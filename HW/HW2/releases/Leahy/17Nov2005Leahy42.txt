       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Massacre At San Jose De   Apartad                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy     On The Massacre At San Jose De Apartad     November 17  2005 MR  LEAHY  I want to speak about a      matter that I suspect few Senators are aware of  but which should      concern each of us   On February 21  2005  in the small      Colombian community of San Jose de Apartado  8 people  including 3      children  were brutally murdered  Several of the bodies were      mutilated and left to be eaten by wild animals   This  unfortunately  was not      unusual  as some 150 people  overwhelmingly civilians caught in the      midst of Colombia s conflict  have been killed by paramilitaries       rebels  and Colombian soldiers in that same community since 1997       None of those crimes has resulted in effective investigations or      prosecutions  No one has been punished   That is an astonishing fact  Think      of 150 murders  including massacres of groups of people  in a single      rural community  and no one punished   This latest atrocity occurred in a      remote area frequented by rebels and paramilitaries  As a result       the presence of the Colombian army has also grown significantly      there  Yet the army  which was sent to that area to protect      civilians from attacks by illegal armed groups  is now suspected by      some of having committed this massacre   Residents of San Jose de Apartado      have blamed the army  and international observers who went with      community members to locate the bodies witnessed disturbing behavior      by soldiers who reportedly laughed while body parts were being      exhumed  who took pictures of themselves making victory signs  and      who mishandled evidence from the massacre sites  There is also the      possibility that paramilitaries acted in collusion with the army       And some have speculated that there were two separate groups of      perpetrators  perhaps including the FARC  the Revolutionary Armed      Forces of Colombia  the countrys oldest rebel group   Even before an investigation began       top Colombian officials publicly declared that the FARC was      responsible  The Minister of Defense  who has since resigned       insisted that the army could not have done this because on February      21 they were more than two days walking distance from the crime      scene  It was soon determined  however  that there were soldiers      only half a days walk away  and army helicopters had recently been      seen in the vicinity   While it has not been proven who is      responsible for this horrific crime  the governments rush to      judgment was only its first mistake  That was quickly followed by      the decision  against the wishes of the community  to send armed      police officers into their midst  While I do not doubt the authority      of Colombian police to enter that territory  it caused the majority      of its inhabitants to flee their homes out of fear that the police      would become a target of illegal groups and that the villagers could      once again be harmed   In fact  such an attack took place      on June 26  when three policemen were wounded in an attack by the      FARC and community members were caught in the crossfire  Later  on      July 18  an old man was found beaten to death  There were two more      killings by the FARC  one in August and another in September  and      verbal threats and acts of intimidation by soldiers and police      officers towards members of the community have reportedly steadily      increased  Then last month  there were three incidents in which      armed paramilitaries and soldiers reportedly threatened members of      the community and destroyed property  It appears that the community      may be no safer today than it was on February 21   One of the consequences of the      governments tactless approach to this and previous cases is that      several witnesses from the community have refused to come forward      and give testimony  and this has hindered the investigation  After a      massacre of 6 members of this same community five years ago when      over 100 people gave testimony to judicial authorities  no one was      convicted and no report on the investigation was ever issued       Convincing witnesses to come forward this time will require a degree      of sensitivity by the government that has  to date  been sorely      lacking   We are told by the Colombian      Government that an investigation of the massacre is ongoing  That       unfortunately  is the story of most heinous crimes in Colombia       Investigations often continue without end  and often the      perpetrators avoid punishment  I am concerned that this case may be      no different   According to information I have      received  neither the soldiers who were in the area at the time of      the February 21 killings  nor hospital workers who treated a girl      who was wounded by soldiers there the previous day  have been      interviewed by investigators  I find this hard to believe  but if it      is correct the government has much to answer for   For five years  the United States      has provided significant military aid to Colombia despite ongoing      concerns about human rights  Several months ago  the Secretary of      State certified that the Colombian Government had met the human      rights conditions in our law  and recommended the release of      additional military aid  However  the report accompanying her      certification also noted that  w hile the human rights performance      of many of the Army s units is improving  an exception is evidenced      by continued accusations of human rights violations and collusion      with paramilitaries against the Army s 17th Brigade  which operates      in northern Colombia  These reportedly include some 200 allegations      involving the peace community of San Jose de Apartado in 2000 2001      and  most recently  of involvement in the killings near San Jose de      Apartado in February 2005      As a result of these allegations  the      United States has informed the Government of Colombia that it will      not consider providing assistance to the 17th Brigade until all      significant human rights allegations involving the unit have been      credibly addressed   While I might differ with the      Secretarys decision to make the certification at the time she did       which coincidently occurred just hours before President Uribes      arrival at President Bushs ranch in Texas  I commend her decision      to withhold aid to the 17th Brigade  It is noteworthy  however  that      concerns about the 17th Brigade had been conveyed to the State      Department well before this incident  including reports that its      members were openly colluding with paramilitaries  Yet there is      reason to believe that U S  aid continued despite those reports       This case presents the Bush      Administration with an important challenge  It shows that despite      billions of dollars from the United States and lofty rhetoric about      human rights  the Colombian governments initial reaction to this      despicable crime was not appreciably different from what we saw      years ago  They denied responsibility and blamed the victims even      before an investigation began  and some of the key witnesses may not      even have been interviewed eight months later   This is unfortunate because there      has been progress on human rights under President Uribes      government  Parts of the country are noticeably safer  The      government reports a significant decline in violent crime  But labor      leaders and human rights defenders are still threatened and killed       the judicial system remains sluggish  and impunity is more the rule      than the exception  Clearly  much more needs to be done to protect      human rights   This case also presents a challenge      for the Colombian government to demonstrate  albeit belatedly  that      it can respond with sympathy  with impartiality  and effectively to      bring justice to the victims of a crime that epitomizes the worst of      Colombia s conflict   I am also told that the Office of      the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights conducted its      own investigation of the massacre  but that the Colombian Government      has not requested a copy of the report of that investigation  If      this is correct I urge the Government to do so immediately and to      release as much of the report to the public as possible without      compromising the investigation   This conflict has brought nothing      but suffering to the Colombian people  It has caused the deaths of      countless innocent civilians  uprooted millions from their homes       and perpetuated the trade in illegal drugs that has corrupted many      sectors of society  The people of San Jose de Apartado  with the      conflict raging around them  sought to insolate themselves from this      danger by declaring themselves a peace community  That strategy      failed  as one after another of their members was brutally murdered       Before February 21  I was not aware      of the many tragedies this community had already suffered  While I      do know  as a former prosecutor  that some crimes are harder to      solve than others  in Colombia  as in so many countries  political      will is often what really matters  It is imperative that this case      not be added to the long list of unsolved  unpunished crimes in San      Jose de Apartado  or become part of the history of impunity in      Colombia  Who ever was responsible must be brought to justice       Mr  President  I also want to      mention the demobilization of paramilitaries that is underway in      Colombia  We all want these narco terrorist organizations to be      dismantled  their commanders punished  their illegally acquired      assets seized  and their victims compensated  The Colombian      Government is asking the United States for millions of dollars to      help finance the demobilization  and we want to help   I am concerned  however  because if      the demobilization of the paramilitary unit located in the area of      San Jose de Apartado is indicative of the way this process is      unfolding  there are serious problems that need to be addressed       According to reports I have received  paramilitaries are engaging in      the same threatening and violent behavior  they continue to collude      with the army  and some have joined the army  Little has changed for      the people in that area who continue to live in fear of losing their      property and their lives  I hope the Colombian authorities who have      been touting the success of the demobilization process will      investigate these reports   I yield the floor
