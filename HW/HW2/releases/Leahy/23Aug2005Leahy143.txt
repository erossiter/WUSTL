                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Reaction Of      Sen  Patrick Leahy     To The Bush Administrations Proposed Changes     In Fuel Economy Standards     Tuesday  August 23  2005   The      Administrations so called CAFE Lite proposal  released Tuesday       has been under consideration for several months and now is available      for public comment for the next 8 months  The standards would      require SUVs  pickups and minivans  so called light trucks  to      increase their fuel economy only by about 1 8 m p g  over four      years  2008 to 2011  Below is the reaction of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt      Instead of standards that would save      consumers billions of dollars and reduce our dependence on foreign      oil  the White House is offering only anemic leadership on one of      the most important pocketbook and security issues of our time  The      need for and value of stronger fuel economy standards is right      there  day after day  in the headlines about spiraling gas prices       What in heavens name is the Administration waiting for     These are weak and entirely      insufficient changes that would do virtually nothing to reduce our      dependence on oil or to address high fuel costs  The      Administrations claim of saving 10 billion gallons of gasoline with      this proposal amounts to less than one month s worth of gasoline      saved over 15 years  Simply by requiring manufacturers of SUVs       minivans and pickup trucks to meet todays car standard of 27 5      m p g  within five model years    something I have long supported         could save 11 billion gallons of gasoline in one year alone  2015        saving consumers  14 billion  And closing the fuel economy gap      between cars and light trucks would cut fuel costs for truck owners      by at least 25 percent  equivalent to reducing gasoline prices to      below two dollars a gallon from todays record high of more than       2 60   Todays fuel prices and our      over dependence on costly foreign oil are an imperative for      leadership  and the White House has defaulted  The public has a      chance to urge sensible standards during the comment period that now      begins on these draft rules  I hope the American people and their      representatives in Congress will speak up  and I hope the      Administration will finally listen
