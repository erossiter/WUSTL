       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Department Of Justice   Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Department Of Justice Oversight     Witness  Attorney General Gonzales    April 19  2007   This week we join in mourning the tragic killings     at Virginia Tech on Monday  The innocent lives of students and     professors are a terrible loss for their families and friends and for     their community  It affects us all  We honor them and mourn their     loss    I expect that in the days ahead  as we     learn more about what happened  how it happened and perhaps why it     happened  we will have debate and discussion and perhaps legislative     proposals to consider  I look forward to working with Department of     Justice and specifically with Regina Schofield  the Assistant Attorney     General for the Office of Justice Programs  and others to make     improvements that can increase the safety and security of our children     and grandchildren in schools and colleges    Today  the Department of Justice is     experiencing a crisis of leadership perhaps unrivaled during its     137 year history  There is the growing scandal swirling around the     dismissal and replacement of several prosecutors  and persistent efforts     to undermine and marginalize career lawyers in the Civil Rights Division     and elsewhere in the Department    We hear disturbing reports that politics     may have played a role in a growing number of cases  I have warned for     years against the lack of prosecutorial experience and judgment     throughout the leadership ranks of the Department  We are seeing the     results amid rising crime  rampant war profiteering  abandonment of     civil rights and voting rights enforcement efforts  and lack of     accountability  This Justice Department seems to have lost its way   The Department of Justice must not be     reduced to another political arm of the White House  The Department of     Justice must be worthy of its name  The trust and confidence of the     American people in federal law enforcement must be restored  Since Attorney General Gonzales last appeared     before this Committee on January 18th  we have heard sworn testimony     from the former U S  Attorneys forced from office and from his former     Chief of Staff  Their testimony sharply contradicts the accounts of the     plan to replace U S  Attorneys that the Attorney General provided to     this Committee under oath in January and to the American people during     his March 13th press conference   The Committee is still seeking documents      information and testimony so that we may know all of the facts  the     whole truth  surrounding the replacement of these prosecutors who had     been appointed by President Bush    One thing already abundantly clear is that     if the phrase performance     related is to retain any     meaning  that rationale should be withdrawn as the justification for the     firing of David Iglesias  John McKay  Daniel Bogden  Paul Charlton      Carol Lam and perhaps others  Indeed  the apparent reason for these     terminations has much more to do with politics than performance   In his written testimony for this hearing     and his newspaper columns  the Attorney General makes the conclusory     statement that nothing improper occurred    The truth is that these firings have yet     to be explained and there is mounting evidence of improper     considerations and actions resulting in these dismissals    The dismissed U S  Attorneys have     testified under oath that they believe political influence resulted in     their being replaced  If they are right  the mixing of partisan     political goals into federal law enforcement is highly improper  The     Attorney General s own former Chief of Staff testified under oath that     Karl Rove complained to Attorney General Gonzales about David Iglesias     not being aggressive enough against so called  voter fraud  which explains     his being added to the list    With respect to Mr  Iglesias  the former     U S  Attorney in New Mexico  the evidence shows that he was held in high     regard  considered for promotion to the highest levels of the Department     and chosen by the Department to train other U S  attorneys in the     investigation and prosecution of voter fraud    Then as the election approached in 2006      Administration officials received calls from New Mexico Republicans     complaining that Mr  Iglesias would not rush an investigation and     indictments before the November election   True accountability means being forthcoming  and     true accountability requires consequences for bad actions  This hearing     is such an opportunity   Last November  the American people     rejected this Administration s unilateral approach to government and to     the President acting without constitutional checks and balances  Rather     than heed that call  within days of that election  senior White House     and Justice Department staff finalized plans to proceed with the     simultaneous mass firings of a large number of top federal prosecutors        By so doing  they sent the unmistakable     message    not only to those forced out but also to those who remained        that traditional  independent law enforcement by U S  Attorneys would     no longer be tolerated by this Administration  Instead  partisan loyalty     had become the yardstick by which all would be judged    I cannot excuse the Attorney General s     actions and his failures from the outset to be forthright with us  with     these prosecutors and with the American people    The White House political operatives who     helped spearhead this plan did not have effective and objective law     enforcement as their principal goal  They would be happy to reduce     United States Attorneys offices to another political arm of the     Administration    If nothing improper was done  people need     to stop hiding the facts and need to tell the truth  the whole truth      If the White House did nothing wrong  then show us  Show us the     documents and provide us with the sworn testimony of what was done      why  and by whom  If there is nothing to hide  then the White House     should quit hiding it    Quit claiming the e mails cannot be     produced and quit contending that the American people and their duly     elected representatives cannot see and know the truth  I trust that     after weeks of preparation for this hearing  the Attorney General s past     failures to give a complete and accurate explanation of these firings     will not be repeated here today    There has always been a tacit and     carefully balanced intersection between politics and our law enforcement     system  but it has been limited to the entrance ramp of the nomination     and confirmation process  Instead of an entrance ramp  this     Administration seems to have envisioned a political toll road   Real oversight has returned to Capitol     Hill  and the investigation of this affair already has pulled back the     curtain to reveal unbridled political meddling  Katrina style cronyism     and unfettered White House unilateralism that has been directed at one     of our most precious national assets  our law enforcement and legal     system    Earlier in this process  it seemed that     the Administration was concluding that any answer will do  whether it     was rooted in the facts  or not  Those days are behind us  Just any     answer wont do anymore  We need the facts  and we will pursue the     facts until we get to the truth    Just as respect for the United States as a     leader on human rights has been diminished during the last six years      the current actions have served to undercut confidence in United States     Attorneys    Just as Mr  Gonzales cannot claim immunity     for the policies and practices regarding torture that were developed     under his watch while White House counsel  he cannot escape     accountability for signing off on this plan to undercut effective     federal prosecutors and to infect federal law enforcement with narrow     political goals    His actions have served to undermine     public confidence in federal law enforcement and the rule of law  By     getting to the truth  we can take a step toward restoring that trust
