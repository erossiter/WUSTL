       Leahy Faults White House For  Slow Walking  Roberts Papers That Were   Promised To The Senate                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy Faults White House     For Slow Walking Roberts Papers     That Were Promised To The Senate         Following are the comments of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   ranking      member  Senate Judiciary Committee  on Wednesdays   Washington Post      disclosure that White House officials are delaying the release of      tens of thousands of pages of Reagan era documents relating to      Supreme Court nominee John Roberts    I am greatly concerned about news      reports in which unnamed White House sources seem to be      acknowledging that papers pertinent to this nomination and promised      to the Senate are being kept under wraps  Slow walking these papers      has the effect of running out the clock as the Senate prepares for      confirmation hearings that now are only weeks away     We have worked in good faith with the      White House in setting an early start date for these hearings and in      myriad other ways as the Senate prepares to fulfill its      constitutional role  In good faith we have also requested steps to      prioritize and expedite the screening of these documents  The      Senate needs good faith cooperation from the White House in return        For this lifetime appointment to the      Supreme Court  the Senate has one chance to get it right  and timely      cooperation from the White House is essential in helping the Senate      make the right decision on behalf of the American people                   Contact  David Carle  202 224 3693
