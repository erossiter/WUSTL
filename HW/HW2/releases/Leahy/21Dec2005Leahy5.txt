       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Nepal s Downward Spiral                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On     Nepal s Downward Spiral     December 21  2005 Mr  President       this is the third time in the past six months that I have spoken in      this chamber about Nepal  I do so because this land of mostly      impoverished tea and rice farmers who toil between India and China      on precipitous hillsides in the shadows of the Himalayas  is      experiencing a political crisis that may plunge the country into      chaos   As many      predicted  King Gyanendras seizure of absolute power on February 1st      and suppression of civil liberties has damaged Nepals foreign      relations  triggered clashes between pro democracy demonstrators and      the police  and strengthened the Maoist insurgency   The Maoists       whose use of extortion and brutality against poor villagers has      spread throughout the country  announced a unilateral ceasefire on      September 3rd which they recently extended for an      additional month  Although flawed  the ceasefire was the impetus      for a loose alliance with Nepals weak political parties after the      King refused to negotiate with them and sought instead to      consolidate his own grip on power   Last month  the      Maoists and the parties endorsed a vaguely worded but important 12      point understanding that could be the basis for a national dialogue      to restore democracy and end the conflict  That  however  would      require some reciprocal confidence building measures by the army       which has so far rejected the Maoist ceasefire as a ploy and      continues to see itself as the defender of an anachronistic  corrupt      and autocratic monarchy   Although the army      has won praise for its role in international peacekeeping missions       its reputation has been badly tarnished because of its abusive and      ineffective campaign against the Maoists  It has engaged in      arbitrary arrests  torture and extrajudicial killings of ordinary      citizens  which has alienated many of the same people who have been      victims of the Maoists   On December 10th       when hundreds of Nepali citizens took to the streets to protest the      Kings repressive actions  the police used force to break up the      rally and arrested several dozen people  The press reported another      120 arrests and dozens injured in demonstrations on December 17th       More protests are likely  and it may be only a matter of time before      Katmandu is in the full throes of a pitched battle between      pro democracy demonstrators and the Kings security forces  This is the      disheartening situation in which Nepal finds itself today  The      immediate challenge for the United States is how to help promote a      political dialogue which includes the broadest possible      participation from Nepali society to restore and strengthen      democracy and end the conflict   The Maoist      ceasefire  while welcome  was a tactical move to lure the political      parties into an alliance and further isolate the palace  There is      no way to predict with confidence if the Maoists would participate      in a political process in good faith  or simply use it as a ruse to      gain new recruits and weapons  A resumption of attacks against      civilians would be condemned and resisted by the international      community  The Maoists should know that they cannot defeat the      government by force  and as long as they extort money and property      and abduct children they will be seen as enemies of the Nepali      people   Similarly       military experts have concluded that Nepals undisciplined army      cannot defeat a determined insurgency that attacks civilians and      army posts and then disappears into the mountains   There are also      concerns about Nepals political parties  who do not have a record      of putting the interests of the nation above their own self      interest  But the political parties  for all their flaws  are the      real representatives of the Nepali people  They urgently need to      reform  but there is no substitute for them   Despite these      difficulties and uncertainties  it is clear that the King has failed      to provide the leadership to build bridges with the countrys      democratic forces and develop a workable plan  It is also clear      that efforts by the international community  including the United      States  to appeal to the King to start such a process  have failed       The Bush Administration should apply whatever pressure it can       including denying U S  visas to Nepali officials and their families  With few options      and no guarantees  Nepals hour of reckoning is approaching  There      is a growing possibility that the Kings obstinacy and unpopularity      will trigger massive civil unrest  shootings and arrests of many      more civilians by soldiers and police  Nepals further isolation       and perhaps the end of the monarchy itself   Only the army has      the ability to convince the King to abandon his imperial ambitions       but time is running out  The armys chief of staff  General Pyar      Jung Thapa  was privileged to receive training at the Army War      College and he has participated in other U S  military training      programs  He has led Nepali troops in UN peacekeeping missions  He      knows  or he should have learned  that the function of a modern       professional military is to protect the rights and security of the      people  not the privileges of a dictator who has squandered the      moral authority of his office  It is not only in the interests of      Nepal  but in the armys long term self interest  to show real      leadership at this critical time   The United States      should do everything possible to encourage the army to announce its      own ceasefire  to accept international observers as the Maoists have      said they would do  and to support a broadly inclusive political      dialogue with or without the participation of the palace    Such a process       to be meaningful  must lead to free and fair elections  The      municipal elections announced by King Gyanendra for early next year       without any consultation with the political parties  are no      solution  An attempt to apply a veneer of legitimacy to an      otherwise undemocratic process will only prolong and exacerbate this      crisis   Many of the      Maoists grievances mirror those of the majority of Nepals people      who for centuries have suffered from discrimination  poverty  and      abuse by one corrupt government after another  But Nepals      problems  which are at the root of the conflict  can only be solved      through a transparent  democratic process  The Maoists have opened      the door a crack for that to begin  The army should reciprocate       The international community should lend its support
