       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Examining Approaches To Corporate   Fraud Prosecutions And The Attorney Client Privilege Under The McNulty   Memorandum                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Examining Approaches To Corporate Fraud Prosecutions And The      Attorney Client Privilege Under The McNulty Memorandum     September 18  2007     Today  the Judiciary Committee      considers whether the Department of Justice has struck the right      balance between robust prosecution of corporate fraud and the      bedrock legal principle of fairness protected by the attorney client      privilege  I thank Senator Specter for his leadership on this      issue  and I thank the distinguished panel of witnesses for being      with us today   I am deeply concerned about the      lawlessness that has affected this Administrations leadership at      the Department of Justice  They have shown arrogance and asserted      an unprecedented prerogative to rewrite the rules  often in ways      that undermine the rule of law and disregard the finest traditions      of impartial law enforcement and our justice system     They have literally sought to rewrite      the rules on the prosecution of politically sensitive cases and on      the retention and firing of United States Attorneys in ways that      impermissibly and dangerously injected politics into our justice      system  They have undermined the role of law enforcement by using      partisanship in the hiring of career prosecutors  judges and other      Justice employees  They have secretly rewritten the rules governing      torture and the treatment of detainees in ways that call into      question this Nations commitment to basic human rights and American      values  And they have secretly rewritten the rules for government      surveillance of Americans  threatening our privacy and basic legal      protections   It is long past time for the      Department of Justice to recommit itself to the rule of law and to      the principles of our justice system  This Committee has through      its oversight begun to seek accountability that I hope will lead to      the restoration of law and order within the Justice Department and      throughout the Executive branch   In the area of corporate fraud      prosecutions  this Administration has rewritten the rules  In 2003       the Department of Justice made it easier for prosecutors to pressure      corporations to waive the attorney client privilege  One judge went      so far as to dismiss charges in a prosecution of fraud at the      accounting firm KPMG based on government overreaching and      misconduct  It is embarrassing for the government to lose cases       not because the evidence is insufficient  but because the Justice      Department has pushed beyond the law  And it is unacceptable to      steamroll principles that protect fairness    Senator Specter and I made our      concerns clear about Justice Department overreaching in this area in      a hearing last fall  Soon after  the Justice Department rewrote the      rules again  this time spearheaded by then Deputy Attorney General      Paul McNulty in what has come to be known as the McNulty      Memorandum  This memo added new safeguards and restrictions       including some that had been called for at this Committees hearing       on prosecutors ability to request the waiver of the attorney client      privilege    I said at the time that it was a step      in the right direction  With this hearing we continue our      consideration whether or not the Department has  in fact  found and      is implementing the proper balance  The McNulty Memorandum has been      in place for less than a year  We need to get a sense of whether      and how it is working  We are evaluating whether the McNulty      Memorandum and the Departments implementation of it has reached the      right balance between aggressive enforcement of corporate fraud      statute and proper respect for the attorney client privilege  I      look to todays witnesses for help in that analysis     We are holding this hearing at a time      when both the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General have      resigned in the wake of the scandal associated with their firings of      U S  Attorneys  The Department of Justice has chosen not to send      either the Acting Attorney General or the Acting Deputy Attorney      General to testify today   With nominations being made to the top      positions at the Department of Justice  those who will be most      directly responsible for setting and implementing the Departments      policy are not yet in place  We do not know where Judge Mukasey       who the President just announced as his nominee to be Attorney      General  stands on this issue  It will be vital to ask him and      other top nominees for their views of these issues and what steps      they intend to take to make sure that the Department strikes the      right balance    We must be mindful not to cripple law      enforcement efforts to eradicate the scourge of corporate fraud       however  Early in this decade  an epidemic of greed among      executives at companies like Enron and Worldcom  and many others       left employees without work and often bereft of their life savings       and it devastated the shareholders to whom those executives owed      fiduciary duties    Corporate wrongdoers who profit at the      expense of ordinary  working Americans should be held accountable       In connection with the Enron and other corporate frauds  seemingly      encouraged by this Administrations lax efforts  I authored criminal      provisions included in the Public Company Accounting Reform and      Investor Protection Act of 2002  known as the Sarbanes Oxley Act       which strengthened existing criminal penalties for corporate crime       Aggressive prosecution of corporate fraud has helped to reduce the      culture of greed that devastated so many Americans financial      security  Enforcement must continue    I am urging this Committee  the Senate      and the Congress to continue our efforts in these regards by passage      of additional anti corruption and anti fraud legislation   I      introduced the War Profiteering Prevention Act  S 119  at the      beginning of the year to provide better tools to investigate and      prosecute those responsible for ripping off hundreds of millions of      taxpayer dollars from efforts in Afghanistan  Iraq and elsewhere       That bill now has 21 Senate cosponsors and was reported by the      Judiciary Committee in May  Along with Senator Cornyn  I have      recently introduced the Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements      Act  S 1946  to improve our efforts to combat public corruption       And last week  I cosponsored the False Claims Act Correction Act       S 2041  introduced by Senators Grassley and Durbin and also      cosponsored by Senators Specter and Whitehouse  to improve the      effectiveness of anti fraud efforts pursuant to that important      statute      We must be careful not to overreact to      the Departments overreaching  This Administration has sought to      immunize too much misconduct  Corporate misconduct should not be      given a safe haven or immunized from accountability  Nor should the      corporate bar  and its representatives in the American Bar      Association  be allowed to use the legitimate concerns of      overreaching we have identified to create favored status for      corporate fraud defendants  We must not go back to the dark days      before the Sarbanes Oxley Act when Americans were too vulnerable to      the greed of a few unscrupulous executives  We are working hard to      protect prosecutorial independence and discretion from      Administration efforts to influence them  Let us not undermine those      efforts    The Department of Justice and  in      particular  its new leadership must understand the need to get this      right  I hope that Congress demands that corporate fraud be pursued      aggressively  but that prosecutors do so mindful of fairness      principles  I hope the Department will work with us to get this      right
