       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Bush Administration s Announcement   That It Will Make FISA Court Orders Available                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comment Of Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Bush Administrations Announcement      That It Will Make FISA Court Orders Available     January 31  2007      I      welcome the Presidents decision to agree to our bipartisan request      for these court orders  As soon as we learned of the Foreign      Intelligence Surveillance Courts orders authorizing the NSAs      wiretapping program  Senator Specter and I asked that they be made      available to us from the Court and the Bush Administration  The      Chief Judge of the Court approved providing the orders but left the      final decision to the Executive Branch    The President has made the right      decision in changing his previous course of unilaterally      reauthorizing the warrantless surveillance program  to now following      the law by seeking court approval for these wiretaps  Only with an      understanding of the contours of the wiretapping program and the      scope of the Courts orders can the Judiciary Committee determine      whether the Administration has reached the proper balance to protect      Americans while following the law and the principles of checks and      balances  I look forward to reviewing the Courts orders and then      deciding what further oversight or legislative action is necessary
