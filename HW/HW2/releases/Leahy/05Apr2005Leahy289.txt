       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee On The   Judiciary  Hearing On Oversight Of The USA PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT    Statement Of Senator     Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Hearing On Oversight Of The USA PATRIOT Act    April 5  2005   On a September morning three and      one half years ago nearly three thousand lives were lost on American      soil  and our lives as Americans changed in an instant  In the      aftermath of the 9 11 attacks  Congress moved quickly  some have      said too quickly    to give federal authorities substantial new      powers to investigate and prosecute terrorism  The USA PATRIOT Act       a landmark and sweeping measure  was signed into law on October 30       2001  just six weeks after the attacks   Some of us sitting here today      contributed to the PATRIOT Act  We worked together in a bipartisan      manner  and with common resolve to craft a bill that we hoped would      make us safer as a Nation  Freedom and security are always in      tension in our society  but we tried our best to strike the right      balance  Now it is time to return to this discussion to assess what      aspects we got right and what modifications need to be made   I negotiated many of the provisions of      the PATRIOT Act and am gratified to have been able to add several      checks and balances that were not in the initial proposal  The      White House reneged on some agreements that we had mutually reached      to strike a better balance on some of the PATRIOT Acts provisions       It is also true that additional checks and balances that I and      others sought  had the White House agreed to them  would have      yielded the same benefits to our law enforcement efforts  but with      greater accountability and less opportunity for abuse  In the final      negotiating session  former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I      insisted that we add a sunset for certain governmental powers that      have great potential to affect the civil liberties of the American      people  That sunset provision is the reason we are here today  It      ensured that we would revisit the PATRIOT Act and shine some      sunlight on how it has been implemented   As we all know  the vast majority of      the provisions of the PATRIOT Act are not subject to sunset  Of the      handful that will expire at the end of the year  some are      non controversial and can be renewed with little or no      modification  Others require greater scrutiny  For example  many      of us have expressed concerns with the business records subpoena      power in section 215  and its implications for libraries and      booksellers  I have cosponsored legislation  introduced by Senator      Feingold  that addresses this provision    Before we rush to renew any      controversial powers created by the PATRIOT Act  we need to      understand how these powers have been used  and whether they have      been effective  A few weeks ago  we celebrated the first National      Sunshine Week with a hearing on open government and bipartisan calls      for responsiveness and accountability  We should carry that theme      into this process of oversight and legislating    We should also bear in mind the 9 11      Commissions counsel about the PATRIOT Act  They wrote  The burden      of proof for retaining a particular governmental power should be on      the Executive  to explain  a  that the power actually materially      enhances security  and  b  that there is adequate supervision of the      executives use of the powers to ensure protection of civil      liberties   We are in a new Congress with a new      Chairman of this Committee  Chairman Specter has a distinguished      record as a steadfast advocate and practitioner of meaningful      oversight  We have before us a new Attorney General who has pledged      to work with us on a number of issues  including the PATRIOT Act       The American people deserve to be represented by a Congress that      takes its oversight responsibilities seriously  just as they deserve      to see federal agencies cooperate with Congress  The breakdown of      cooperation following passage of the PATRIOT Act has fostered      distrust  We can change that by working together to achieve the      right balance in our anti terrorism laws  and then by allowing      appropriate sunshine to illuminate the ways those laws are being      used    I just said that the new Chairman      supports vigorous oversight  I am pleased that he has agreed to      hold hearings on a number of important issues that fall under this      Committees jurisdiction  We will hold another hearing on the      PATRIOT Act next month  to hear the views of experts from outside      the government  Later this month  the Committee will hold a hearing       the first of several  I hope    to focus attention on the data      brokering industry and its implications for individual privacy and      government accountability  And finally  our new Chairman has      expressed serious interest in holding a hearing that I have been      requesting for more than a year  to examine the FBIs foreign      language translation program  We are working together to schedule      that event    We have heard over and over again that      there have been no abuses as a result of the PATRIOT Act  But it is      difficult  if not impossible  to verify that claim when some of the      most controversial surveillance powers in the PATRIOT Act operate      under a cloak of secrecy  We know the government is using its      surveillance powers under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act      more than ever  but everything else about FISA is secret  This      difficulty in assessing PATRIOTs impact on civil liberties has been      exacerbated greatly by the Administrations obstruction of      legitimate oversight efforts   Whether or not there have been abuses      under the PATRIOT Act  the unchecked growth of secret surveillance      powers and technologies with no real oversight by the Congress or      the courts has resulted in clear abuses by the Executive Branch  We      have seen secret arrests and secret hearings of hundreds of people      for the first time in U S  history  detentions without charges and      denial of access to counsel  misapplication of the material witness      statute as a sort of general preventive detention law       discriminatory targeting of Arabs and Muslims  selective enforcement      of the immigration laws  and the documented mistreatment of aliens      held on immigration charges  Such abuses harm our national security      as well as civil liberties because they serve as recruiting posters      for terrorists  intimidate American communities from cooperating      with law enforcement agencies and  by misusing limited      anti terrorism resources  make it more likely that real terrorists      will escape detection   Beyond this  the Administration has      used brutal and degrading interrogation techniques against detainees      in Afghanistan  Iraq  and Guantanamo Bay that run counter to past      American military traditions  practices and ideals  Information      about these disgraceful acts continues to trickle out in large part      because of a persistent press and the results of a lawsuit filed      under the Freedom of Information Act  or FOIA  Meanwhile  the      Administration continues to stonewall  releasing information only      when it is self serving to do so  or when ordered to do so by the      courts    The Department of Justice has been      particularly obstinate in its refusal to release information       Justice Louis Brandeis said  Sunshine is the best disinfectant       But despite its claims that the Department of Justice redacts      information only to protect national security and privacy  DOJ held      back a considerable amount of potentially embarrassing information      when it released FBI email traffic last December in response to the      FOIA lawsuit  Some of these documents are several pages in length       yet are entirely redacted   Two weeks ago  Senator Levin released      a more complete version of one of these documents  see documents      and    What DOJ had      originally refused to release were conclusions by federal agents at Guantanamo that the military interrogations were producing      intelligence information that was suspect as best  DOJ also      redacted an assertion that the interrogation practices could      undermine future military trials  Finally  DOJ blacked out a      segment of the memo describing how its own Criminal Division lawyers      took their concerns about the harsh interrogation techniques at      Guantanamo to the Pentagons General Counsel  Why would this piece      of information be redacted  Perhaps because the Pentagons General      Counsel  William J  Haynes  is currently a nominee to the Fourth      Circuit Court of Appeals  Mr  Hayness nomination has become      embroiled over concerns that he was deeply involved in developing      the militarys interrogation policies    Finally  in yet another example of      abuse  recent press reports provide disturbing details about how the      Administration embraced the use of extraordinary rendition after the      9 11 attacks  Several press reports detail the CIAs use of jets to      secretly transfer detainees to countries around the world  where it      is likely that they will be tortured    In defending the Administrations      rendition policy  the President said in his March 17 press      conference that  we seek assurances that nobody will be tortured      when we render a person back to their home country  This statement      came only 10 days after Attorney General Gonzales acknowledged that      we cant fully control what happens to detainees transferred to      other nations  and added that he does not know whether countries      have always complied with their promises         I have introduced legislation that      would end this abhorrent practice without expanding our obligations      under the Convention Against Torture  It simply closes the      loopholes in the Conventions implementing legislation  thus      ensuring that we honor our commitment not to outsource torture to      other countries   These cases of overreaching and abuse      trickled down from policy decisions that were made at the top       There will always be scandals and tragedies in a nations history       What makes America special is that we do not hide from our mistakes       we investigate them  learn from them  and make sure they do not      happen again  When necessary  we change our laws to reflect the      lessons we have learned  The spirit of openness and accountability      are what bring us here today to reconsider portions the PATRIOT      Act  I welcome our witnesses and look forward to a fruitful      discussion                   Contact David Carle  202 224 3693        Tracy Schmaler  202 224 2154
