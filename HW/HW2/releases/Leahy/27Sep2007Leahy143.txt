       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Executive Business Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Senate Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting    September 27  2007    I had hoped to see the Committee consider and     report a bill on establishing a statutory privilege to safeguard freedom     of the press last week  The matter was held over so that will be the     first topic for the Committee today  We now have a bipartisan coalition        Senator Lugar  Senator Dodd  Senator Specter  Senator Schumer      Senator Graham and myself  united to cosponsor a version of the Free     Flow of Information Act   Senator Lugar and Senator Dodd are not members of     this Committee but they have been leaders in this effort and I begin by     acknowledging their leadership and commitment to this issue  Last     Congress  it was Senator Lugar who introduced the Free Flow of     Information Act in February 2005  Senator Dodd  who has also long been     an advocate in this area  reintroduced a second version of the bill in     July 2005  And then in May 2006  they introduced a third version of the     bill having been joined by Senators Specter  Schumer and Graham   During the last Congress  Senator Specter worked     extremely hard on this issue and held a number of hearings before this     Committee as its chairman  I believe the first was in July 2005 at which     Senators Lugar and Dodd were our lead off witnesses  He was right to     schedule a second hearing in October  as Senators Feinstein and I had     requested  in order to hear from the Department of Justice  which had     decided at the last minute not to appear at the initial hearing  The     third hearing was after the bill reintroduction in May 2006 and     concerned  in part  revelations about FBI demands to search the files of     journalist Jack Anderson shortly after his death  The fourth hearing     was then held in September 2006  I noted in my statement for that     hearing that after four hearings and hearing from a dozen journalists      First Amendment experts  numerous prosecutors  it was unfortunate that     a minority of the majority was still holding up action on the bill on     behalf of the Bush Administration   Today  after years of effort  the Senate Judiciary     Committee is convening to do what it was prevented from doing last year        to consider  and I hope report out a solid  bipartisan federal     privilege law  Over the past several weeks and month the six sponsors     have joined together to work out the compromise bill that we consider     today  It is fair  It is balanced  It is bipartisan   This bill would create  as a matter of federal law      a qualified privilege for journalists to protect the identity of their     confidential sources   Before I turn to Senator Specter and then Senator     Schumer for their opening remarks and to offer the bipartisan substitute     I would like to discuss a bit of the history that has led us here  The     question of whether or not to enact some form of privilege for     journalists has been around at least since the Supreme Court decided     Branzburg v  Hayes in 1972  Today  33 States and the District of     Columbia have shield laws that protect journalists from disclosing their     confidential sources and many other States  including Vermont  recognize     a common law reporters privilege  Nonetheless  at least half a dozen     journalists have been jailed or fined for protecting their confidential     sources during the last few years  And  according to the National     Newspaper Association of America  more than 40 reporters have been     subpoenaed or questioned about their confidential sources  notes and     work product in federal criminal and civil cases over the past several     years  Sadly  the press has become the first stop        rather than the stop of last resort    for our government and private     litigants when it comes to seeking information  And  this trend can     have a chilling effect on the press and the publics right to know  In     fact  while the federal leak investigation involving former CIA agent     Valerie Plame and the BALCO steroid case are perhaps the most well known     examples  these two cases do not begin to tell the full story of the     difficulties and dangers posed when the press can be routinely compelled     to disclose the identity of confidential sources  We simply have no     idea how many other newsworthy stories have gone unreported out of fear     that a reporter would be forced to reveal a source  or face jail time       We also do not know how many potential     whistleblowers  or other confidential sources  have chosen to remain     silent  out of fear that a journalist could be compelled to disclose     their identity  As the son of a Vermont printer who instilled in me     the importance of the First Amendments guarantee of a free and vibrant     press  I understand that investigative journalism and a vibrant First     Amendment are vitally important to our American democracy  Vermont     famously re elected Matthew Lyon to Congress while he was in jail for     writing what the Administration of that time thought were unflattering     remarks about the President in a letter   Just recently  investigative journalism and     confidential sources have helped uncover significant government failures     in Iraq and in New Orleans  as well as government neglect at the Walter     Reed Medical Center   Still  as a former prosecutor  I also understand     the importance of making sure that the government can effectively     investigate criminal wrongdoing  combat terrorism and preserve national     security  The consensus federal shield legislation before the Committee     today strikes the proper balance among these important objectives  This     bill addresses the legitimate need for law enforcement to obtain     information from reporters to prevent a crime or a national security     threat  In addition  by providing a qualified and not an absolute     privilege to withhold the identity of confidential sources  the bill     also advances other important law enforcement objectives  such as     encouraging whistleblowers to disclose fraud  waste and abuse that might     otherwise go unreported  This legislation is also strongly supported by more     than 50 news media and journalism organizations  including the National     Newspaper Association  the Coalition of Journalists for an Open     Government  the Magazine Publishers of America and the National Press     Club  The call for action extends to editorial pages across the     country  I will submit several letters of support for this bill that I     have received for the record  I believe that the consensus Free Flow of     Information Act takes important steps to ensure a free and vibrant     press  so that Americans are informed about matters that affect their     lives  I am pleased to cosponsor this legislation and I urge the     Committee to support this bill and report it to the Senate without     further delay
