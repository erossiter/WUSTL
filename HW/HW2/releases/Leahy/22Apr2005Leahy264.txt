       Leahy Denounces Religious Smear Campaign On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Denounces Religious Smear Campaign On Judicial      Nominations  Urges Republican Senators  White House To Condemn      Demagoguery        WASHINGTON  Friday  April 22     In a speech delivered Friday      morning  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   denounced a recent smear      campaign to inject religion into the judicial nominations debate       On Sunday  Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist is planning to      participate in the Family Research Councils  FRC  Justice Sunday       Stop the Filibuster Against People of Faith telecast  Leahy  the      ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  urged      Republican senators  leaders and the White House to condemn such      religious McCarthyism  Below is Leahys floor speech    Senator Patrick      Leahy     Senate Floor Remarks     On Republicans Exploitation of Faith in Judicial Nominations     April 22  2005 I spoke at the beginning of the      week about the alarming rise of religious McCarthyism  I hoped that      by drawing attention to this situation the Majority Leader and other      Republican leaders would speak out against any campaign that      improperly characterizes Senators as being  quote  against people      of faith  That demonizing of Senators and their motives has      no place in America  let alone in debate among Senators  That is a      slur and a smear  It is untrue and every Republican Senator knows      it  They should denounce such a campaign that is based on bigotry      and fueled by demagoguery   Sadly  they refuse to do so and  instead  the      Majority Leader will apparently act in support of such a campaign      this weekend  The upcoming telecast to incite congregants by the      false charge that those who oppose judicial activists are      anti Christian or anti faith is wrong  divisive and      destructive  That Republican officials will lend support to that      effort through their silence  rather than denounce it  is disturbing      and disappointing   I had previously called upon the White House to      denounce a similar smear campaign launched more than a year ago       When a lone Republican Senator disavowed those outrageous      advertisements  I thanked him and praised him publicly  Dividing the American people along religious      lines is wrong  Smearing political opponents as anti faith is      despicable  Apparently some will stop at nothing and stump to any      level  No scurrilous charge is too coarse  no baseless accusation      is too outlandish  When a few of us attended the funeral of Pope      John Paul II in Rome as part of the official Senate delegation      recently  Democrats  but not Republicans    were castigated for not      being present in Washington  When we explain in public session the      basis on which we have decided to oppose a nomination that we do not      feel merits a lifetime appointment to the federal bench  the      judicial activism we have catalogued about the nomination is ignored      and we are smeared as anti this or anti that  I thank the many religious leaders who have      come forward this week to uphold Americas great traditions of      respecting faith  honoring faith and  ensuring that the      constitutional prohibition against any religious test for public      office be strictly observed  Christian leaders from a variety of      denominations  Muslim leaders and Jewish leaders have joined      together to reject these disgraceful and polarizing efforts of a few      partisans injecting religion in the discussion of judicial      nominations  They have publicly denounced the efforts of the      religious demagogues making slanderous charges in a win at all costs      bid to rile the passions and further divide Americans from one      another  I am grateful for their voices  We need less division       not more  We need to work together more not less   I share the disappointment of the more than 400      religious leaders who have written Senator Frist urging him to      repudiate those who misuse religious for political purposes and who      impugn the faith of any who disagree with them  All of us need to       as these religious leaders put it  repudiate the message of      divisiveness and religious manipulation  The Reverend Dr  C       Weldon Gaddy  President of The Interfaith Alliance  also recently      wrote to Senator Frist to warn against transforming religion by      baptizing it as a disciple of partisan politics  Abraham Foxman       National Director of the Anti Defamation League  reminded Senator      Frist  Religious liberty has flourished in our nation precisely      because Americans have been steadfast in their commitment against      sowing religious discord as means to achieve political success  I also thank the distinguished leader of the      Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism  Rabbi David Saperstein       for his statement  Rabbi Saperstein notes that with respect to the      upcoming broadcast in which Senator Frist will be lending his      support   The telecast is      scheduled to take place on the second night of the Passover holiday       when Jews around the world gather together to celebrate our      religious freedom  It was in part for exactly such freedom that we      fled Egypt  It was in part for exactly such freedom that so many of      us came to this great land  And it is in very large part because of      exactly such freedom that we and our neighbors have built a nation      uniquely welcoming to people of faithof all faiths  My Irish and Italian grandparents  like so many      others  came to this country seeking a better life for their      families   not just a better job but the freedoms that have always      been so much a part of Americas great attraction  It has taken      time and pain for us to realize as a Nation that dream of religious      freedom and tolerance  I remember my parents talking about days I      thought were long past  when Irish Catholics were greeted with signs      that told them they need not apply for jobs  Italian Catholics were      told that they and their religious ways were not wanted  That is      what my grandparents experienced and my parents saw  The smears we      are seeing today mock the pain and injustice that so may American      Catholics endured  We have come too far to turn back to the      darkness of intolerance  Partisans are these days seeking to rekindle the flames of      bigotry for short term political gain  That is more than just      wrong  it is despicable  To raise the specter of religious      intolerance in order to try to turn our strong  independent federal      courts into an arm of a political party is an outrage  It is      shocking that some would cavalierly destroy the independence of our      federal courts and with it the best protection Americans have of our      freedoms   This tactical shift follows on the rhetorical      attacks on judges over the past few weeks in which federal judges      were likened to the KKK and the focus of evil  Over the last few      weeks we have heard language about Stalinist solutions to problems      and for mass impeachments  Last week the Senate Democratic      leadership called upon the President and the Republican leadership      of Congress to denounce the inflammatory statements against judges       This week I renew my call to all Senators and  in particular  to      Republicans  to denounce the religious McCarthyism that is again      invading this debate   I am saddened to see Senators stay silent when they should      disavow these abuses  Why Republicans do not heed the clarion call      that Senator Danforth  an Episcopalian minister  sounded a few weeks      ago  I do not know  The demagoguery and divisive politics being so      cynically used by supporters of the President s most extreme      judicial nominees need to stop  These smears are lies  and like all      lies they depend on the silence of others to live  and to gain root       It is time for the silence to end  The Bush Administration has to      accept responsibility for the smear campaign and end it   This kind of religious smear campaign hurts the whole country       It hurts Christians and non Christians  It hurts all of us       because the Constitution requires judges to apply the law  not their      personal views  Remember that all of us  no matter what our faith         and I am proud of mine    are able to practice our religion as we      choose or not to practice a religion  That is a fundamental      guarantee of our Constitution  The Constitutions prohibition      against a religious test in Article VI is consistent with that      fundamental freedom   All Americans should understand that the Constitution is there to      protect us  and it is the protection of the Constitution that has      allowed this country to evolve into a tolerant nation  Those who      would try to drag us back into religious intolerance  for short term      political gain  subvert the Constitution  and damage the country       By their false logic  the 205 judicial nominees      nominated by President Bush who Democratic senators have helped to      confirm would seem not to be people of faith  That is as false and      ridiculous on its face as are the slurs being insinuated against      those who have opposed the few other nominees who have not been      confirmed  This smear of good men and women as against faith is      wrong  This slander is laden with falsehoods and permeated by the      smoke and mirrors of partisan politics   Those who hurl these false charges never      mention that the same Senators they are slandering have supported      hundreds of nominees who are people of faith  They never hesitated      to stoke the flames of bigotry  and to encourage their supporters to      continue the smear in cyberspace  or in the pages of the nations      newspapers or through direct mail  Maybe this slander is the only      thing that tests well in their political polls  so that even though      untrue it is the one thing they can agree upon  This is the      equivalent of the weapon of mass destruction justification for      attacking Iraq  It is not true  but it is convenient  Not only must this bogus religious test end       but Senators should denounce the launching of the nuclear option       the Republicans precedent shattering proposal to destroy the Senate      in one stroke  while shifting more power over the Senate to the      White House  I would like to keep the Senate safe and secure and in      a nuclear free zone  The partisan power play Senate Republicans      are now likely to employ will undermine the checks and balances      established by the Founders in the Constitution  It is a giant leap      toward an unfettered Executive controlling all three branches of the      Federal Government  It not only will demean the Senate and destroy      the comity on which it depends  it also will undermine the strong       independent federal judiciary that has protected the rights and      liberties of all Americans against the overreaching of the political      branches   Our Senate parliamentarian and our Congressional Research Service      have said that the so called nuclear option would go against      Senate precedent  Do Republicans really want blatantly to break the      rules for short term political gain  Do they really desire to turn      the Senate into a place where the parliamentary equivalent of brunt      force is what prevails   The recently constituted Iraqi National      Assembly was elected in January  In April it acted pursuant to its      governing law to select a presidency council by the required vote of      two thirds of the Assembly  a supermajority  That same governing      law says that it can only be amended by a three quarters vote of the      National Assembly  Use of the nuclear option in the Senate is      akin to Iraqis in the majority political party of the Assembly      saying that they have decided to change the law to allow them to      pick only members of their party for the government and to do so by      a simple majority vote  They might feel justified in acting      contrary to law because the Kurds and the Sunni were driving a hard      bargain and because governing through consensus is not as easy as      ruling unilaterally  It is not supposed to be  that is why our      system of government is the worlds example   If Iraqi Shiites  Sunni and Kurds can cooperate      in their new government to make democratic decisions  so can      Republicans and Democrats in the United States Senate  If the Iraqi      law and Assembly can protect minority rights and participation  so      can the rules and United States Senate  That has been the defining      characteristic of the Senate and one of the principal ways in which      it was designed to be distinct from the House or Representatives  This week  the Senate debated and passed an      emergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the war efforts      in Iraq and Afghanistan  The justification for these billions of      dollars being spent each week is that we are seeking to establish      democracies  How ironic that at the same time we are undertaking      these efforts at great cost to so many American families  some are      seeking to undermine the protection of minority rights and checks      and balances represented by the Senate through our own history   This week  the Secretary of State said in      Moscow that the centralization of state power in the presidency at      the expense of countervailing institutions like the Duma or an      independent judiciary is clearly very wrong  Just as those      developments undercut democracy in Russia  so  too  our American      democracy is undercut by the concentration of power in the      executive  removing checks and balances  and undermining the      independence of the federal judiciary  It is ironic given that      President Bush and Secretary of State Rice speak so eloquently about      the fundamental requirements of a democratic society when they meet      with President Putin of Russia  that the Bush Administration and      Senate Republicans are intent on employing the nuclear option to      consolidate power in this presidency in this country   The President has in his own words acknowledged      that democracy relies on the sharing of power  on checks and      balances  on an independent court system  on the protection of      minority rights  and on safeguarding human rights and human      dignity  The nuclear option is in direct contradiction to      maintaining those values and those components of our democracy       Just as Abu Ghraib and other abuses make it more difficult for our      country effectively to condemn torture and abuse when we speak to      the rest of the world  the nuclear option used as a partisan      effort to consolidate power in a single political party and      institution will make all the lectures on democracy we give to      leaders of other countries ring hollow  I have spoken of a group of Russian      parliamentarians who came to see me to talk about our federal      judiciary  Like other representatives of emerging democracies      around the world  they asked  Is it true that in the United States      the government might be a party in a lawsuit and that the government      could lose  I said  Absolutely right  They said  People would      dare to sue the government  I said  We have an independent      judiciary  yes  they could  They said  Well  if the government      lost  you fire the judges  of course  I said  No  they are an      independent judiciary  This amazes people in other parts of the      world  that people who disagreed with the government could actually      go to court  bring a challenge and seek redress even if it meant the      government lost  Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to our      independent judiciary as the crown jewel of our democracy  It is      dazzling   Judicial fairness and independence is also      essential if we are to maintain our freedoms  I say to Mr  Delay      and others  stop slamming the federal judiciary  We do not have to      agree with every one of their opinions  Let us respect their      independence   When the United States Supreme Court decided      the presidential election in 2000  I thought that the 5 4 majority      engaged in an incredible and overreaching act of judicial activism       I  nonetheless  called for Americans to respect the opinion of the      Court  I attended the argument of Bush v  Gore with my      Republican counterpart  in order to show the country that we had to      get along and work together  Democrats did not impeach Justice      Scalia when we wholeheartedly disagreed with his action   Part of upholding the Constitution is upholding      the independence of the third branch of government  One      political party or the other will control the presidency  One party      or the other will control Congress  No political party should      control the judiciary  It should be independent of all political      parties  That was the genius of the founders of this country  It is      the genius that has protected our liberties and our rights for well      over 200 years  It is the genius of this country that will continue      to protect us unless we allow some to destroy it for short term      political gain  It would be a terrible diminution of our rights if      we were to remove the independence of our federal judiciary  That      would do things that no armies that have marched against us have      ever been able to do  If you take away theindependence of our      federal judiciary  then our whole constitutional fabric unravels       I ask that copies of the letter sent by      hundreds of religious leaders to Senator Frist  the letter from The      Interfaith Alliance to Senator Frist  the statement by the National      Council of Churches  the letter from the Anti Defamation League to      Senator Frist and a statement from Rabbi David Saperstein  Director      of the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism be included in the      Record
