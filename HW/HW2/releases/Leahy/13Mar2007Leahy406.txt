       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Final Passage Of the 9 11 Commission   Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy     On Final Passage Of The Improving America s Security    By Implementing Unfinished Recommendations    Of The 9 11 Commission Act Of 2007    March 13  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I have voted today in     favor of final passage of the Improving Americas Security by     Implementing Unfinished Recommendations of the 9 11 Commission Act of     2007  S  4  but I do so with a heavy heart  I am truly disappointed that the Chairman and     Ranking Member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental     Affairs  Senators Lieberman and Collins  decided to arbitrarily lower     the minimum allocation for states under the State Homeland Security     Grant Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program from     the 0 75 percent that has existed for the past five years to 0 45     percent  Not only would this change to the formula result in the loss     of millions in homeland security funding for the fire  police and rescue     departments in small  and medium sized states  like Vermont  Connecticut     and Maine  it also would deal a crippling blow to their efforts to     launch federally mandated multi year plans to build and sustain their     terrorism preparedness   During the Senate floor debate on S  4  I offered     with Senators Thomas  Stevens  Roberts  Pryor  Sanders  Enzi  Hatch      Whitehouse and Lincoln an amendment to restore the minimum allocation     for states under the State Homeland Security Grant Program from 0 45     percent  which is proposed by the underlying bill  to 0 75 percent      which is current law  As with current law  the state minimum under our     amendment would have continued to apply only to 40 percent of the     overall funding under this program  The majority of the funds would     continue to be allocated based on risk assessment criteria  as are the     funds under the several separate discretionary programs that Congress     has established for solely urban and high risk areas  which also are     governed by risk assessment calculations  Unfortunately  this amendment lost by a vote of 49     Yays to 50 Nays  This is a marked change from just last year  when the     0 75 percent minimum allocation was overwhelmingly defended when 64     senators voted against an amendment that would have lowered the minimum     to 0 25 percent  Fifteen senators changed their votes from last year      including HSGAC Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins  whose     states stand to lose the most from the decreased minimum  The bill that passed the Senate today would reduce     the all state minimum for SHSGP and the Law Enforcement Terrorism     Prevention Program to 0 45 percent  The House bill reduces it even     further to 0 25 percent  Due to the formula differences  there is no     guarantee that the minimum will not be even further reduced during     conference negotiations  Small  and medium sized states face the loss     of millions of dollars for our first responders if the minimum is     lowered  By reducing the all state minimum to 0 45 percent      the underlying bill would reduce the guaranteed dollar amount for each     state by 40 percent  With appropriations for formula grants having been     cut by 60 percent since 2003  from  2 3 billion in 2003  to  900     million in FY07  further reductions in first responder funding would     hamper even more each states efforts to prevent and deal with potential     terrorist attacks  In FY07  State Homeland Security and Law     Enforcement Terrorism grants were funded at  525 million and  375     million  respectively  for a total of  900 million  Under the current     all state minimum of 0 75 percent  the base amount states receive is      6 75 million  Based on FY07 levels  each state would face a loss of an     estimated  2 7 million  or 40 percent  under the new 0 45 percent     formula  which would be a real blow to our first responders  And the cuts will be even deeper should the     Presidents budget request for next year be approved  The President has     requested only  250 million for these two important first responder     grant programs  My colleagues from our largest states  and     apparently some small  and medium sized states  seem to forget that the     terrorist attacks of 9 11 added to the responsibilities and risks of     first responders nationwide  I wrote the current all state minimum     formula as part of the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 to guarantee that each     state receives at least 0 75 percent of the national allotment to help     meet their national domestic security needs  Every state  rural or urban  small or large  has     basic domestic security needs and deserves to receive Federal funds     under this partnership to meet both those needs and the new homeland     security responsibilities the Federal government demands  Of course      high density urban areas and high risk centers have even greater needs      which is why this year alone we provided  1 3 billion for homeland     security programs for which only a small number of urban areas are     eligible to apply  All of these needs deserve and need to be met  I     have worked hard over the years to help address the needs of larger     states and high density areas  and I have opposed the Bush     Administrations efforts to pit our states against each other  as they     have tried to mask their efforts to cut overall funding for first     responders   Smaller states  especially  would never be able to     fulfill those essential duties on top of their daily responsibilities     without Federal support  especially given that DHS is currently     suggesting that states will pay for REAL ID implementation  an estimated      16 billion  with first responder grants  My colleagues should be     warned that if the minimum drops further  compounded by substantial     drops in overall first responder funding  then small  and medium sized     states will not be able to meet those Federal mandates for terrorism     prevention  preparedness and response  Some from urban states argue that Federal money to     fight terrorism is being sent to areas that do not need it and is     wasted in small towns  They claim the formula highly politicized and     insist on the redirection of funds to urban areas that they believe face     heightened threat of terrorist attacks  What critics of the all state minimum seem to     forget is that since the September 11 terrorist attacks  the Federal     government has asked ALL State and local first responders     to defend us as never before on the front lines in the war against     terrorism  Emergency responders in one state have been given the same     obligation as those in any other state to provide enhanced protection      preparedness and response against terrorists  The attacks of 9 11 added to the responsibilities     and risks of first responders across the country  In recent years  due     to the 0 75 percent all state minimum allocation for formula grants that     has existed in law  first responders have received resources to help     them meet their new responsibilities have made our neighborhoods safer     and our communities better prepared  There is much left undone in securing our Nation      I hope that the Senates conferees will resist calls for further     needless reductions to the all state minimum base and risk the     preparedness efforts in small states like their own  I trust they will     do all they can during conference negotiations to ensure continued     support and resources for our police  fire and EMS services in every     state if we expect them to continue protecting us from terrorists or     responding to terrorist attacks  as well as carrying out their ongoing     responsibilities in helping to keep our communities safe and prepared
