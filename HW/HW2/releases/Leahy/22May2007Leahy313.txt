Judiciary Committee held a hearing        Restoring Habeas Corpus  Protecting American Values and     the Great Writ on Tuesday focusing on a bipartisan bill that would     restore fundamental protections rolled back as part last years     Military Commissions Act of 2006    Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined     in last years legislation  said Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        chairman of the Committee  I hope that the new Senate will reconsider     this historic error in judgment and set the matter right  It is urgent     that we restore our legal traditions and reestablish this fundamental     check on the ability of the Government to lock someone away without     meaningful judicial review of its action  The time to act is now   Leahy added  The sweep of this habeas     provision goes far beyond the few hundred detainees currently held at     Guantanamo Bay  and includes an estimated 12 million lawful permanent     residents in the United States today    Leahy and Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa        the ranking member on the panel  have introduced the Habeas Corpus     Restoration Act of 2007   S 185   The bipartisan bill would restore     habeas corpus protections by repealing provisions of the Military     Commissions Act of 2006   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Restoring Habeas Corpus     Protecting American Values And The Great Writ    May 22  2007        Today  the Judiciary Committee turns its attention to a top legislative     priority that the Ranking Member and I have set for this year      Restoring the Great Writ of habeas corpus  and the accountability and     balance it allows  I thank our distinguished panel of witnesses for     appearing here today  They illustrate the broad agreement among people     of diverse political beliefs and backgrounds that the mistake committed     in the Military Commissions Act of 2006 must be corrected   Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in     last years legislation  Senator Specter and I urged caution before     taking that dangerous step  but fell just a few votes shy on our     amendment to restore these protections  It is now six months later with     the election behind us  I hope that the new Senate will reconsider this     historic error in judgment and set the matter right  It is urgent that     we restore our legal traditions and reestablish this fundamental check     on the ability of the Government to lock someone away without meaningful     judicial review of its action  The time to act is now   I     commend Senator Specter  who feels as passionately as I do about this     issue  for helping to plan this hearing  Senator Specter and I together     introduced the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007   S 185   on the     first day of this Congress  This bipartisan bill has 16 co sponsors       The Military Commissions Act  passed     hastily in the weeks leading up to last years election  was a profound     mistake  and its elimination of habeas corpus rights was its worst     error  Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II      the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear and     another stain on Americas reputation in the world    Justice Scalia wrote in the  Hamdi case  The very core     of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of separated powers has     been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the     Executive  The remedy that secures that most basic of freedoms is     habeas corpus  It provides a check against arbitrary detentions and     constitutional violations    This Great Writ is the legal process that     guarantees an opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of     power by the Government  The Military Commissions Act rolled back these     protections by eliminating that right  permanently  for any non citizen     labeled an enemy combatant  In fact  a detainee does not have to found     to be an enemy combatant  it is enough for the Government to say someone     is awaiting determination of that status    The sweep of this habeas provision goes     far beyond the few hundred detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay      and includes an estimated 12 million lawful permanent residents in the     United States today  These are lawful residents of the United States      people who work and pay taxes  people who abide by our laws and should     be entitled to fair treatment  These are people we have traditionally     welcomed to our shores and invited to experience the freedoms that made     America the most admired country in the world  Under this law  any of     these people can be detained  forever  without any ability to challenge     their detention in court  I look forward to hearing from Professor     Cuellar and others who can elaborate on this disastrous change  and its     potentially disproportionate impact on the Latino population  which     accounts for so many of the countrys hard working legal immigrants   Since last fall  I have been talking about     a nightmare scenario in which a hard working legal permanent resident     who makes an innocent donation to a charity  perhaps a Muslim charity      to help poor people around the world in the finest American tradition      Maybe that charity is secretly suspected by the Government to have a     tie  however tenuous  to terrorist groups  Based on that suspected     tie  perhaps combined with an overzealous neighbor reporting     suspicious behavior  having seen people of a different culture     visiting  or with information secretly obtained from a cursory review of     the persons library borrowings  the permanent resident could be brought     in for questioning  denied a lawyer  confined  and even tortured  Such     a person would have no ability to go to court to plead his or her     innocence  for years  for decades  forever    This is the kind of disappearance that     America has criticized and condemned in parts of the world ruled by     autocratic regimes  That is not America  When I first spelled out this     nightmare scenario  many people viewed it as a far fetched hypothetical      but sadly it was not    Last November  just after enactment of     these provisions  this was confirmed by the Department of Justice in a     legal brief submitted in federal court in Virginia  The U S      Government  seeking to dismiss a detainees habeas case  said that the     Military Commissions Act allows the Government to detain any non citizen     designated as an enemy combatant without giving that person any ability     to challenge his detention in court  And this is not just at Guantanamo     Bay for those whom this Administration likes to call the worst of the     worst  The Justice Department said it is true even for someone arrested     and imprisoned in the United States    I was shocked when Attorney General     Gonzales maintained at a hearing earlier this year that our Constitution     does not provide a right to habeas corpus  But more damaging was the     Senates decision over our opposition to remove this vital check that     our legal system provides against the Government arbitrarily detaining     people for life without charge  This is wrong  It is     unconstitutional  It is un American  We all want to make America safe from     terrorism  But I implore those who supported this change to think about     whether eliminating habeas truly makes America safer in the world  and     whether it comports with the values  liberties  and legal traditions we     hold most dear  I hope this hearing will help convince all in Congress     that it does none of those things   Our leading military lawyers  like Admiral     Guter  tell us that eliminating key rights for detainees hinders the     safety of our troops and the effectiveness of our defense  Diplomats     and foreign policy specialists  like Mr  Taft  tell us that eliminating     habeas rights reduces our influence in the world  Immigration attorneys     and academics tell us that our Nations hard working immigrants are at     risk from this change   Top legal scholars  and conservatives like     Kenneth Starr  Professor Richard Epstein  and David Keene  head of the     American Conservative Union  agree that this change betrays centuries of     legal tradition and practice  Professor David Gushee  head of     Evangelicals for Human Rights  submitted a declaration signed by     evangelical leaders nationwide  which refers to the elimination of     habeas rights and related changes as deeply lamentable and fraught     with danger to basic human rights    Senator Specter and I have both supported     the notion of effective and efficient military tribunals to bring     terrorists to justice  Long before this Administration had to be     ordered by the Supreme Court to revisit its unilateral practices  both     Senator Specter and I had introduced military commission legislation in     2002    The elimination of basic legal rights     undermines  not strengthens  our ability to achieve justice     It is from strength that     America should defend our values and our way of life  It is from the     strength of our freedoms  our Constitution  and the rule of law that we     can prevail  We can ensure our security without giving up     our liberty  I will    keep working on this issue until we restore the checks and     balances that are fundamental to preserving the liberties that define us     as a Nation
