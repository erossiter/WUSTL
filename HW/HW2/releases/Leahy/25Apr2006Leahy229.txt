Bill  the core of the new package    to Senate      passage before  but now it also has its best chance yet of also      passing the House  Specters new support for the bill also adds to      its momentum   The text of the      letter is below  A       version is also available                 April 25  2006 The Honorable George W  Bush     President of the United States     The White House     1600 Pennsylvania Avenue     Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  President  We are writing to enlist your support in      enacting strong antitrust measures to allow the Department of      Justice to crack down on illegal price manipulation by oil cartels       Those tough provisions would immediately serve to deter the illegal      actions of members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting      Countries   OPEC   and provide quick relief to millions of American      families   If OPEC nations continued their price gouging      and manipulation of supplies after passage of the law  S  2557  they      would be subject to immediate and severe legal action by the Justice      Department  America needs immediate solutions to this oil crisis      before the prices at the pump reach  4 or  5 per gallon   We were proud to recently introduce with      Judiciary Committee Chairman Specter and the Antitrust Subcommittee      Chair and Ranking Member  Senators DeWine and Kohl  along with      Senators Feinstein and Durbin  this bill called the Oil and Gas      Industry Antitrust Act of 2006  which includes provisions that      could quickly work to reduce high gas and oil prices  We believe      that this bill will be on the Judiciary Committees agenda for      action later this week   Those provisions  called The No Oil Producing      And Exporting Cartels Act  NOPEC   would make OPEC accountable for      its anti competitive behavior and allow the Justice Department to      take decisive action against the foreign oil cartels for the      withholding of supplies  price gouging or other anticompetitive      activities   It will allow the federal government to take      legal action against any foreign state  including members of OPEC       for price fixing and other anti competitive activities  The tools      this bill would provide to law enforcement agencies are necessary to      rapidly counter OPECs anti competitive practices  and these tools      would help reduce gasoline prices now  We strongly believe that passage of this bill      would immediately deter many of these illegal actions that otherwise      would keep increasing our gas and oil prices   Mr  President  your support will help pass this      measure  OPEC has America over a barrel  and we should fight back       If OPEC were simply a foreign business engaged in this type of      behavior  it would already be subject to American antitrust law  It      is wrong to let OPEC producers off the hook just because their      anti competitive practices come with the seal of approval of this      cartels member nations  The Senate has already passed NOPEC once       In fact  the Judiciary Committee has approved the NOPEC bill three      times   In addition  the day you sign this bill it      would be unlawful to divert petroleum or natural gas products from      their local market to a distant market with the primary intention of      increasing prices or creating a shortage in a market  This would      solve a serious problem where oil or gas products are being shipped      for sale in one market but are later diverted and sold for less in      another market to artificially reduce supplies and force up prices       We have an obligation to address these and      other issues caused by oil cartels and by profit driven companies      who have money to burn  Authorizing tough legal action against      illegal oil price fixing  and taking that action without delay  is      something we should do without additional obstruction or delay   We urge you  Mr  President  to help us in      getting this bill important bill through Congress in the next couple      weeks  Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY HERB      KOHL      Ranking Member Ranking Member
