       Leahy Hearing Sets Stage For Bipartisan Effort To Forge Comprehensive   Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Hearing Sets Stage For      Bipartisan Effort     To Forge Comprehensive Immigration Reform         Calls For AgJobs Plan To      End Hodge Podge     Hiring Of Migrant Farm Workers     WASHINGTON        Wednesday  February 28   The Senate Judiciary Committee        chaired by Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    held a hearing       Wednesday to set the stage for work on comprehensive immigration       reform  featuring Department of Commerce Secretary Carlos       Gutierrez and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael       Chertoff  At the hearing  Leahy pressed the Bush Administration       officials for firm and clear commitments from them to work with       Congress to pass comprehensive immigration reform this year        Leahy also       raised the lack of any reforms in the Presidents immigration       proposals to address the pressing and specialized needs of       farmers seeking agricultural workers   Finding help       on the farm is becoming increasingly difficult for hundreds of       Vermont farms  said Leahy  Many have turned to migrant       workers from Mexico and Central America  Currently  Vermont       dairies are depending on an estimated 2 000 foreign workers  We       need to bring order and common sense to a broken system        Vermont dairy farmers should not have to choose between saving       their family farms and obeying the law  Leahy has       cosponsored a bipartisan bill to reform the H 2A program that       would make it easier for agricultural employers to legally hire       workers  and it would set special provisions for dairy farmers        The bill would set up a program of blue cards  allowing       foreign farm workers currently in the United States in an       undocumented status to obtain legal status to work in       agriculture Below is       Chairman Leahys statement from the hearing                   Statement Of       Chairman Patrick Leahy      Comprehensive Immigration Reform      Senate Judiciary Committee      February 28  2007  I thank Secretary Gutierrez and       Secretary Chertoff for agreeing to appear before the Committee       today  I hope their participation will demonstrate the       Presidents wholehearted commitment to working with us to enact       comprehensive immigration reform legislation this year  Without       the Administrations earnest engagement on this issue  our       efforts are likely to suffer the same fate they did last year        This Committee reported a comprehensive immigration reform bill       only to see Republican congressional opposition stall that       effort  prevent a House Senate conference and  instead  force       through a bill calling for billions to be wasted constructing a       700 mile fence along our 2 000 mile Southern border  This year       we have a renewed opportunity to do the right thing  one which       may not come along again   By their votes in the most recent       elections  the American people have reaffirmed Americas       traditional place as a nation of immigrants  We are not       anti immigrant or racist  We understand people seeking a better       life for their children and grandchildren as naturally as we       do  Americans understand that comprehensive immigration reform       does not mean criminalizing the hard work of law abiding people        deporting millions of families who have lived here for years or       seeking to wall ourselves off from our neighbors and the world       around us  Thankfully  the politics of fear did not succeed        Americans rejected the poisonous rhetoric of intolerance in       favor of a more confident  realistic and humane approach that       finds strength in diversity and human dignity    If we are to reclaim Americas       promise  we need to keep our eyes on the core principles of       comprehensive reform  To his credit the President has called       for comprehensive legislation and an immigration system worthy       of America  Now he must demonstrate his commitment to those       principles and lead Republicans toward achieving that goal so       that  not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans  we can       honor our history as a nation of immigrants and strengthen our       future and leadership in the world    The President has said that no one       element of immigration reform can succeed without a       comprehensive approach  The Committee reported bill last year       took a comprehensive approach  The Senate based bill took a       comprehensive approach  The House generated bill that the       President signed just before the election did not     Our broken system has fostered       incongruities from coast to coast    from our biggest cities to       our smallest towns  and from our factories to our farms  Reform       is overdue  We must be realistic about the millions of       undocumented people in this country  We need to bring people       out of the shadows  When we provide opportunity for people to       be responsible  the vast majority will be and we will all be the       better for it  We can and should do everything necessary to       protect opportunities for our domestic workers  We need to       reduce illegal immigration by reforming our temporary worker       programs to allow more access to the unfilled jobs and unmet       needs in our economy These are not either or propositions  we       can do both   Dairying in Vermont is more than a       job or an industry  it is a way of life  Our agricultural       economy depends on the hundreds of millions of dollars dairy       farmers bring to our state every year  But that way of life is       threatened when family dairies cannot find help to milk the       cows  deliver calves and keep up with chores  Finding help on       the farm is becoming increasingly difficult for hundreds of       Vermont farms  Many have turned to migrant workers from Mexico       and Central America  Currently  Vermont dairies are depending on       an estimated 2 000 foreign workers  We know there is something       wrong with this hodge podge arrangement  and we need to do       better  We need to bring order and common sense to a broken       system  Vermont dairy farmers should not have to choose between       saving their family farms and obeying the law   The President has acknowledged       that you cannot deport 10 million people who have been here       working  He said at the Southern border last August  Its       unrealistic  It may sound good in certain circles and political       circles  Its not going to work  He went on to outline what       he called the best plan for those here illegally  He       recommended saying to them  If youve been paying your taxes        and youve got a good criminal record  that you can pay a fine       for being here illegally  and you can learn English  like the       rest of us have done  and you can get in a citizenship line to       apply for citizenship  You dont get to get in the front  you       get to get in the back of the line  He called this a       reasonable way to treat people with respect and accomplish what       we want to accomplish  which is to be a country of law and a       country of decency and respect  I agree  and those were       precisely the elements contained in the Committee and Senate       bills last year    Our mission must be to create an       immigration system for the 21st Century that honors       the great history and tradition of our nation and secures our       future  What we must always remember is that immigrants are       real people who have families  and hopes  and dreams  In most       cases  these are people who want to contribute  who work hard        who are striving to overcome the fortuitousness of where they       were born  They contribute to our armed forces and sacrifice to       protect the freedoms we have and they hope to enjoy  They       contribute to our economy  to our lifestyle  and help with our       most important responsibility when they help raise Americas       children  As the grandson of immigrants to the United States  I       will work to reaffirm the promise of Americas lamp beside the       golden door for the poor and oppressed
