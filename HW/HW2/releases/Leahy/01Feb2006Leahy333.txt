       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy A Lost Year For Democracy And Peace   In Nepal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     A Lost Year For Democracy And Peace In Nepal     February 1  2006 Mr  President       one of the many things one learns as a United States Senator is that      speaking out about autocratic  corrupt and abusive governments      invariably elicits a response   The victims of      such regimes  including human rights and pro democracy citizens who      are often imprisoned and tortured  express their appreciation       Knowing that they have supporters half way around the world gives      them hope   The officials of      those governments and their supporters respond differently  Knowing      that they cannot honestly defend their ill gotten gains and abuse of      power  they do what they can do  They attack the messenger  And      they do so through distortion and outright fabrication  I have made      several statements about the troubling situation in Nepal  a poor      country with the most majestic mountains on Earth  which has      received too little attention by the Congress  It is a country      struggling against a determined Maoist insurgency that has brought      extortion  brutality and false promises of a better future to      virtually every province   And it is a      country in which an autocratic monarchy has sought to consolidate      its grip on power and take the country backwards after a decade of      fledgling democracy  One year has      passed since last February 1st when King Gyanendra      dissolved the multi party government  curtailed civil liberties and      imprisoned political opponents  He has ignored appeals of the      United States  India and Great Britain  as well as the United      Nations  to negotiate with the leaders of Nepals political parties      on a plan to restore democracy   When the Maoists      unilaterally announced and then extended a four month ceasefire  the      army and the palace rejected out of hand the suggestion that      reciprocating could test the Maoists intentions and possibly create      an opening for dialogue to end the conflict  What we are      witnessing in Nepal is  put simply  a struggle between the      discredited  anachronistic past  and the possibility of a democratic      future   There is also a      third possibility  A Maoist government that imposes its will on      whomever remains in Nepal after a mass exodus  and which further      destabilizes an already troubled region  Predictably       those who have enjoyed the undeserved benefits of absolute power and      privilege want to hold on to what they have  They seem to believe      that the Maoists can be defeated by military force  As desirable as      that might be  there is no evidence to support it   Those who see the      Kings repressive policies as reckless and playing into the hands of      the Maoists  have risked their freedom and their lives by calling      for an inclusive democratic process  And  as the situation      continues to deteriorate  calls for a republic are growing louder  On January 2nd      the Maoists ended their ceasefire by triggering bombs in several      locations  A few days later they killed 12 police officers in      Katmandu  They have carried out attacks in Nepalganj and other      cities  causing civilian casualties  A week ago  in an apparent      attempt to derail the controversial municipal elections scheduled      for February 8  gunmen who are suspected of being Maoists killed a      pro monarchy party member in the city of Janakpur  These brutal      acts should be universally condemned  There is absolutely no      justification for the use of violence to terrorize civilians or to      disrupt an election   But neither can      it be said that the United States has an effective policy when it      appears to amount to little more than blaming the Maoists and      repeating over and over that the King should reach out to the      political parties  He should  but for almost a year he has refused      to do so and absent stronger pressure there is no reason to believe      that he will   It also begs the      question of what is the legitimate role in the 21st      Century for a monarchy that has squandered its moral authority and      shown no competence for governing  Three weeks ago       in the Kings latest attempt to quell mounting public criticism of      his failed policies  the palace announced a preemptive curfew and a      ban on political demonstrations  Since then  hundreds of      pro democracy citizens  including several political party leaders       have been imprisoned around the country   Two weeks ago       the police used tear gas and water canons to break up a rally in      Katmandu  and more political protesters were arrested  The former      Prime Minister remains in custody after a widely ridiculed trial      by the Kings hand picked anti corruption commission   The Nepali people      want peace  But nearly a year after King Gyanendra justified his      power grab as necessary to defeat the Maoists  they are stronger and      peace is more elusive  As many others have said  the only viable      way forward is through dialogue  including the Maoists  under United      Nations or other international auspices  with the clear purpose of      developing a broadly accepted plan to restore and strengthen      democracy   To those of      Nepals ruling class who in various opinion pieces have distorted my      words  mischaracterized my record and questioned my motives  I can      only say that sooner or later they will have to face reality  They      could help save their country  but not if they continue to bury      their heads in the sand and malign those whose only desire is to see      a democratic  peaceful Nepal  Mr  President       Nepal is a beautiful country with a remarkable culture  Its people       as resilient as they are  do not deserve the hardships of caste      discrimination  poverty and violence that they endure daily  The      Maoists have shown no respect for the rights of civilians  But      neither has the King shown that he has a workable plan to stop      Nepals downward spiral  His decision to hold municipal elections      has only widened the gap between himself and the leaders of the      political parties who were never consulted  who see this latest move      as part of a calculated strategy to consolidate his power  and who      have said they wont participate  Far more creative      and persuasive leadership is urgently needed in Nepal  including      from the army  as well as from the United States  India  China and      other friends of Nepal  to prevent a tragic situation from becoming      a disaster
