       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Redeployment Of U S  Forces From Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      On     Redeployment Of U S  Forces From Iraq     July 18  2007    Mr  President  I      strongly support the Levin Reed Amendment  and I urge our friends on      the other side of the aisle to end their filibuster of this vital      piece of legislation   The Presidents      Iraq strategy has been a disaster  It was born of deception  fueled      by incompetence  and pursued through arrogance and stubbornness   This strategy has      not made us safer  It has undermined the international credibility      that took generations of Americans sacrifice to build  it has      squandered billions of hard earned tax dollars that would have been      better used in directly countering terrorists  it has skewed our      priorities here at home  it has weakened our military readiness  and      it has created an open sore in an already volatile Middle East  It      is time to extricate our troops from Iraqs civil war and let the      Iraqis and their regional neighbors forge their own political      settlement   As many predicted       the security situation in Iraq has not appreciably improved despite      the Presidents surge strategy  The ongoing violence comes from a      deadly brew of suicide bombings  intra ethnic conflict  and      out of control militias  all unleashed by the Presidents poorly      planned invasion and occupation of the country   Our troops can      provide some semblance of security in limited areas for limited      periods of time  But this fleeting security largely just shifts the      focal points of violence  and it comes at the horrific price of the      lives and limbs of still more of our soldiers and Marines killed and      maimed every day in roadside bomb attacks and ambushes   The issue is not      whether our troops can gain control of a few city blocks  but      whether there is any way that we can stop Iraqs civil war  I      challenge anyone to say how we can do that  when the Iraqis do not      yet have the political will to do it themselves   The Iraqi Army is      fraught with ethnic divisions and few Iraqi units are capable of      fighting successfully on their own   As others have      pointed out  it often appears the Shiite dominated Iraqi Army is      simply out to settle scores with the Sunnis who ruled Iraq under      Saddam Hussein  The unfortunate truth is that the Iraqi Army cannot      bring security now  and it is unlikely to be able to in the coming      years without overwhelming  side by side support and sacrifice of      American soldiers   That leaves      political reconciliation  and we all know where that stands  The      Iraqis are no closer to an oil revenue sharing agreement  no closer      to an acceptable political arrangement  and no closer to a      functioning government that serves all Iraqis  Our presence has      become an excuse for inaction  Why should Shiites sacrifice when      they have American forces to die for them  Why should the Kurds be      more conciliatory when they think we will protect them forever  Why      should the Sunnis reconcile among themselves when they can fight      Americans together   Rory Stewart  an      insightful author and observer of the Middle East  recently      commented that our presence in Iraq is  to use his phrase       infantilizing Iraqi politics  making the Iraqis completely      incapable of finding their own way   As our troops are      withdrawing we should make a concerted diplomatic push  bringing      together representatives of Iraqs government and Iraqs neighbors       They would have little choice but to recognize that without the U S       militarys constant presence  they have to make some kind of      accommodation among themselves   That is what the      Levin Reed and the Feingold Reid Leahy amendments would accomplish       Based closely on the recommendations of the Iraq Study Group  both      amendments would require the withdrawal of U S  forces in Iraq to      commence within 120 days   By springtime of      next year  only a small number of troops necessary for limited      counter terrorism  force protection  and training purposes would      remain in the country  These amendments would effectively end the      United States military presence in Iraq as we know it   The White House      wants to wait to until September  when General Petraeus will report      on progress from the surge  Yet it is folly to wait when we already      know what the answer will be  We are going to hear words like  The      situation is still challenging  but we are making progress  We are      going to get a report like the glossy one released last week  which      said the Iraqis are making progress in some areas  as if that is      enough reason to continue farther still down the wrong road    We can already see      the way the review is predetermined in statements of General      Petraeus deputies  General Odierno told reporters a couple of      months ago that the current surge level of U S  troops would be      needed in Iraq through next year  Major General Lynch  the      commander of the southern portion of Baghdad  echoed that view only      yesterday  We in Congress      have a constitutional responsibility to act now  If we put off      developing a consensus plan for the redeployment of U S  forces       more of our troops will be needlessly killed and wounded  More      innocent Iraqis will lose their lives  And  as todays public      summaries of the National Intelligence Assessment on Al Qaeda      underscore  the war in Iraq has made our country less safe  It is      an indictment of the ruinous policies and strategies this      Administration has pursued in Iraq  year after year   We must end this      treadmill trudge to nowhere  We must show the Iraqis that only they      can save their country  It is time to shift focus back to      Afghanistan and to rebuild our military and our defenses at home       It is time to restore our reputation as a Nation united in combating      terrorism  but unwilling any longer to sacrifice our sons  our      daughters  or our values for a flawed policy that cannot succeed
