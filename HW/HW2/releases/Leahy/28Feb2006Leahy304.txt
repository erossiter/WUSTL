       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Department Of   Homeland Security FY2007 Budget                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Opening Comments Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Hearing On The Department Of Homeland Security FY 2007 Budget     Subcommittee On Homeland Security     Committee On Appropriations     February 28  2006 Mr  Secretary       many Northern Border States are highly skeptical about the      development and implementation of the border crossing card that is      called PASS Card   Setting aside      whether having this card is good policy or not  I see an economic      and cultural train wreck on the horizon  Commerce and travel will      slow to a crawl if you do not ask for relief from implementing a      border crossing card   This card      threatens to create damaging bottlenecks on what is currently the      longest  most efficient and safest border in the world  Clear signs of      trouble are converging on the horizon and I hope you will pay      attention to the looming problems  With only 18      months to go before requiring all U S  citizens to have a PASS card      or passport  here is the technical situation          DHS and the State Department      are promoting two different technological infrastructures for the      card          DHS is promoting an open UHF      design that is not secure  It is an architecture designed for      tracking freight pallets  If the open UHF standard is adopted  DHS      may actually reduce safety along the border  which is the exact      opposite of what this program is supposed to accomplish          Not only is an open UHF design      less secure  it is completely different technology than what CBP is      installing now to read information off chips in the new      e Passports  DHS would need an entirely separate  new and costly      reader system for the border crossing PASS card  Because none of      the technical issues have been resolved  the logistical planning for      issuance and reading of the PASS cards is also confusing and      delayed   And finally       regardless of how the Administration implements the Western      Hemisphere Travel Initiative  there is another half of this      equation  which DHS seems to be ignoring  Our close allies       friends  and in my state  our relatives  who live across the border      in Canada   The Canadian      government is not moving under the same deadline for a similar card      for their citizens  Thus DHS is simply expecting more Canadians to      apply for passports   While DHS      recognizes the need to have a lower cost alternative for U S       citizens  its disregard for our Canadian friends and neighbors is      stunning  not to mention counterproductive  If the problems      with the PASS card somehow get worked out  DHS is only considering      half the travel and trade across the border  The reduction in trade      and travel from Canadians would be devastating  This head in the      sand mentality is not the treatment our neighbors to our North      deserve
