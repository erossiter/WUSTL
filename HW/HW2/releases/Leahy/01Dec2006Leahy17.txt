       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To Report That The Government Is   Assigning Terror Scores To Travelers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member And Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      To Report That The Government Is Assigning Terror Scores To      Travelers     Friday  December 1  2006       The recent revelation that  since 9 11  the U S  government has      been assigning terror scores to millions of law abiding Americans      who travel across our borders  without their knowledge  highlights      the danger of government use of technology to conduct widespread      surveillance of our daily lives without proper safeguards for      privacy  It is simply incredible that the Bush Administration is      willing to share this sensitive information with foreign governments      and even private employers  while refusing to allow U S  citizens to      see or challenge their own terror scores        When done poorly or without proper safeguards and oversight  data      banks do not make us safer  they just further erode Americans      privacy and civil liberties  This is an Administration that goes to      unprecedented lengths to hide its own activities from the public       while at the same time collecting and compiling unprecedented      amounts of information about every citizen        New technologies make data banks more powerful and more useful than      they have ever been before  They have a place in our security      regimen  But powerful tools like this are easy to abuse and are      prone to mistakes  A mistake can cost Americans their jobs and      wreak havoc in their lives  Mistakes on government watch lists have      become legendary in recent years  We need checks and balances to      keep government data bases from being misused against the American      people         Data banks like this are overdue for oversight  and that is going      to change in the new Congress
