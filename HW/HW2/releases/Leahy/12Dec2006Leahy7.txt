       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To Revisions To The Thompson Memorandum                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member And Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      To Revisions To The Thompson Memorandum     Tuesday  December 12  2006 I welcome Deputy      Attorney General McNultys announcement of new guidelines for the      prosecution of corporate crime  This Administration has taken      extraordinary steps to investigate and silence the press and its      critics  while claiming unlimited privileges and secrecy for      itself  I am pleased that the Justice Department has heeded      bipartisan criticism of its policy  including the criticism of      former Republican Attorneys General  the Chamber of Commerce  the      American Bar Association and the American Civil Liberties Union  as      well as the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee and moved away from its most excessive practices in      corporate fraud investigations   The protection of      communications between client and lawyer has been fundamental to our      nations legal justice system since its inception  and the right to      counsel has long been recognized as essential to ensure fairness       justice and equality under the law for all Americans  I am pleased      that the Department responded to my requests to stop considering      corporations payment of attorneys fees for employees when making      charging decisions  and to implement safeguards to ensure that      prosecutors do not pressure corporations to waive attorney client      privilege  The new guidelines place limits on the ability of      prosecutors to request waivers of this important privilege or to      consider a corporations decision not to waive in deciding whether      or not to charge the corporation  while allowing for appropriate      prosecutorial discretion  But  I remain concerned that  depending      on how the new policies are implemented prosecutors may still be      able to inappropriately consider a corporations waiver of this      important privilege  When rights are      trampled  the rights of ordinary citizens  the rights of business      people  the rights of any of us as Americans  it is important to      speak out and to try to put it right  Going forward  a key issue      will be how the Department implements this new policy and the proof      of the Departments commitment to honoring the legal and      constitutional rights of defendants will be in the pudding  I will      continue to monitor the implementation of this new policy and to      hold the Administration accountable  so that the right to counsel is      preserved for all Americans
