       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The President s Address On U S    Strategy In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        To The Presidents Address On U S  Strategy In Iraq      November 30  2005  What the White House released       today is more a list of goals than it is a workable plan        Concerns continue to mount that the Administration either will       not or cannot recognize the clear facts on the ground that       threaten our troops and our true objectives in combating       terrorism worldwide    This vague plan has as much       credibility as when the President stood on the aircraft carrier       and declared mission accomplished  and more than 1900 more       brave American soldiers have died in Iraq in the meantime    After nearly 1000 days of warfare       and more than 2100 American deaths in Iraq  it speaks volumes       that only now  as public support for the war continues to       plummet  does the White House feel the need to address concerns       about the Administrations strategy in Iraq  Unfortunately it       is nothing more than a spruced up version of more of the same        riddled with feel good rhetoric that bears little relationship       to the facts facing our troops  This debate is not about       whether we need an effective  global strategy  with our allies        against anti Western religious extremism and terrorism  We do        Rather  the debate is about how best to deal with those       threats  Iraq has become a rallying cry and a recruiting ground       for terrorists  and the longer we pursue this failed policy  the       more dangerous the world will become   A large bipartisan Senate       majority has gone on record to signal a lack of confidence in       the vague course the Administration has been following in Iraq        I once again urge the President to sit down with Congress to       come up with a real plan  with real benchmarks  to turn Iraq       over to the Iraqis and for the orderly withdrawal of our       troops
