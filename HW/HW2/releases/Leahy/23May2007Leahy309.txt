       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On Senate Amendment 1165  Concerning   Dairy Farmers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   On Senate Amendment 1165    Concerning Dairy Workers And Comprehensive Immigration Reform Mr  President  I call up Senate amendment number 1165    and ask that Senators Casey and Schumer be added as cosponsors   I will send a modification to the desk in a moment     First  I wish to note that the amendment I have called up is the language we    had worked out as part of the AG JOBS bill on which I have been at work for    several years with Senator Craig  Senator Feinstein and many others  The    language would have better resolved the immigration problems for our    nations dairy farmers  It was negotiated among many parties and when    agreed upon took into account the special year round needs of dairy farms    and the training that is needed for them to operate efficiently     Regrettably  some have objected to that language being included in the bill    and others have acquiesced to those objections  Accordingly  I must send a modification to the desk and    ask that our agreed upon language be modified    This modification is required by the authors of the    bill in order for dairy provisions to be accepted into this bill  I have    attempted through this language to ensure as best we can that our nations    dairy farmers have adequate access to labor in the future  This amendment    only deals with prospective immigration and is focused on dairy only   Dairy is a year round operation where interruptions to    a farmers labor force can have significant consequencesthe H 2A provisions    as they exist in the bill now do not adequately address the unique needs of    dairy because they permit only 10 month terms of work  This sort of    interruption does not work for dairy farmers  who need year round     dependable employees  In the AG JOBS legislation that this body passed last    year and that we reintroduced this year  I supported a much broader    provision to address the unique needs of the dairy industry  That provision    had the overwhelming endorsement of Americas family dairy operations     Unfortunately there were objections from the Bush administration and the    authors of the bill now pending  so I have worked with the managers of this    bill to craft this compromise   This modification would enable dairy farmers to have    multiple avenues to employ legal workers in the future  First  under the    H 2A program  dairy farmers would have the ability to hire workers for a    3 year period after which time the workers would return home  Second  this    amendment would refine the H 2A program to allow dairy farmers to more    easily obtain workers under the normal H 2A time frame of 10 month work    periods  In combination with available opportunities under the Y visa    program  these changes should provide significant opportunities for    Americas dairy farmers to obtain future legal workers to meet their needs     I urge support for this modified amendment to ensure that essential changes    for dairy farmers become part of this legislation
