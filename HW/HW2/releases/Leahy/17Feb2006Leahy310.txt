       Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee  Sends   Follow Up Letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld On Surveillance Of   Anti War Protestors From Vermont                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       Sends Follow Up Letter to Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld On      Surveillance Of Anti War Protestors From Vermont   February 17  2006   The Honorable Donald      Rumsfeld     Secretary of Defense      1000 Defense Pentagon     Washington       D C  20301    Dear Secretary Rumsfeld    A member of your office      recently replied to my letter dated December 21  2005  about      surveillance activities conducted by the Department of Defense  The      response from the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for      Intelligence does not answer several of the very basic questions      posed in my original letter  What information I did gather from the      letter paints a troubling picture of a program that has gone well      beyond a reasonable effort to protect the Departments installations      and personnel    In my December 21      letter  I asked for a description of the Departments efforts to      collect information in the State of Vermont  I asked for specifics      about the dates of collection  the individuals or groups that were      targets of collections  and the basis for determining that such      targets posed threats to Defense Department installations and      personnel  Protests against the war in Iraq by such peaceful groups      as the Quakers were apparently included in the Department of      Defenses threat database known as Threat and Local Observation      Notice  TALON   which is maintained by the recently established      Counterintelligence Field Activity  CIFA   It is a logical and      usual practice for a senator to request and obtain updates about the      federal governments activities in his or her home state       Accordingly  I was disappointed to see that the January 27  2006       response from the office of the Under Secretary of Defense for      Intelligence did not include a single mention of Vermont  let alone      include the more general information that I requested    I am also troubled by      the fact that the letter I received provides no information about      how the broader information gathering process actually works  In      2002  the Congress reacted negatively to a program that appears to      be similar to TALON  That was the Terrorism Information and      Prevention System  called TIPS  It was a citizen reporting program      that threatened to turn neighbors into spies and to discredit      valuable neighborhood watch programs  The plan as it was structured      was strongly criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike  I      strongly support neighborhood watch efforts  but TIPS had the great      potential to bombard law enforcement offices with countless leads       diverting agencies from tracking criminal and terrorist activity       The TIPS program was abandoned     I am equally concerned      about the privacy of innocent Americans who may be placed on these      lists  and who  once included  are not removed under the Pentagons      routine purging of information after 90 days  Recent press reports      suggest that one of every 100 reports of suspicious activity      reported to CIFA were kept on the lists for more than 90 days      despite the fact that a listed name was not verified as representing      a threat  Reportedly  some names remained on the lists even though       as a Pentagon review found  they should not have been included in      the first place   Walter Pincus  Unverified Reports of Terror      Threats Linger  Washington Post       January 31  2006   Thus far  the Pentagon has been unwilling to      report how many names have been improperly placed and kept on      lists  The press has also reported that names on these lists are      shared with other government agencies inside and outside the      Pentagon     The Departments      response to my letter suggests that there have been problems with      the TALON program and that efforts are underway to monitor and      regulate the program more closely  To admit those facts is a start       but the Department of Defense must be more forthcoming with      information about specific problems  including how many innocent      names were listed  and how many of those names that were      inappropriately included were not purged from the lists in the 90      day review process     I renew my request for      answers to the two questions I posed in my December 21 letter  This      information is important for Congress to determine the effectiveness      and advisability of this program     I also ask that you      answer the following questions  which are raised by the January 27      response to my original letter     1  What rules regarding      collection and retention of information were being followed  and      when  When did the Undersecretary of Defense or another Pentagon      official realize that staff were following multiple rules  When      will guidance be issued to standardize practices  Will you share      this guidance with the Armed Services and Defense Appropriations      Committees of the U S  Senate      2  When will policy      documents be prepared regarding the collection and retention of data      regarding U S  persons  The January 27 letter indicates that these      documents will include a standard to be applied to the TALON      database  and will include oversight procedures  Will you share      these standards and oversight procedures with the Armed Services and      Defense Appropriations Committees of the U S  Senate       3  Have you completed a      review of the TALON database to ensure that it does not include      names that have no connection to terrorism  If so  how many such      names were identified  Were any of those named persons residents of      Vermont  Have those names been purged     4  How many names have      been improperly added to the TALON database since it was created       Have all of these names been purged  Were any of these names shared      with other government agencies  If so  which agencies      I ask that you respond      to my inquiry by letter no later than March 15th  I appreciate your      personal attention to this important matter     Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY     United States Senator
