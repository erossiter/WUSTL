Committee        Thursday afternoon  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   called for tighter        congressional scrutiny of the security practices of data brokers which have        allowed the theft or loss of personal or financial information on hundreds        of thousands of Americans in recent months  The hearing marked the first of        what is expected to be a series of congressional

Democratic leader  Leahys        testimony follows    Statement Of        Senator Patrick Leahy During Hearing On        Identity Theft  Recent Developments Involving        The Security Of Sensitive Consumer Information  Mr  Chairman  I applaud your decision to hold        todays hearing about recent security breaches at ChoicePoint and Bank of        America  and their implications for protecting sensitive consumer data         You and Senator Sarbanes have been leaders on these issues  and I thank you        both for this opportunity to appear before you today to discuss our shared        goals of ensuring data privacy and security   We are in a challenging era  Advanced        technologies have opened up new possibilities and brought enormous benefits        to consumers  to commerce  and to law enforcement   There is no doubt these advances have improved        our lives and made us safer  But they have also created new        vulnerabilities for privacy and security  It is also becoming increasingly        clear that these trends have challenged our current privacy laws  And        todays security saturated environment is fostering partnerships between        governments and private data brokers  creating new challenges for        maintaining privacy standards over sensitive information involving each and        every American   The troubling events at ChoicePoint  Bank of        America and now LexisNexis are a window on some of these weaknesses         ChoicePoints bread and butter business includes identity verification and        screening to help corporate America know its customers         Yet the company failed to know its own customers and sold personal        information on at least 145 000 Americans to criminals posing as legitimate        companies   Bank of America recently announced that the        personal information of more than a million government employees  including        some senators and Senate staff members  was compromised when backup tapes        disappeared during transport on a commercial airliner  We now understand        that this type of transport was routine  not only for Bank of  America  but for the entire industry  On of the eve of this        hearing  we have also learned that personal information on 32 000 more        Americans was potentially compromised at a subsidiary of LexisNexis   The susceptibility of our most personal data        to relatively unsophisticated scams and logistical mishaps is greatly        disturbing  And this is before we consider the dangers posed by insiders         hackers  organized crime and terrorists  In an era where personal        information is a key commodity  the personal information of Americans has        become a treasure trove  valuable and vulnerable   Today  companies around the world routinely        traffic in billions of personal records about consumers  The magnitude of        these transactions has rendered the individuals behind the data faceless         But at the end of the day  when things go south  it is the consumer that        bears the brunt of the harm  For consumers caught up in the endless cycle        of watching their credit unravel  undoing the damage caused by such        breaches becomes life consuming and monumental   Congress needs to act  but we need to do it        right  Many of us have been examining the information brokering industry        and considering various legislative options  Consumers should know who has        their data  what it is being used for and how they can correct mistakes         They should also have notice  consistent with law enforcement        considerations  so that they can protect themselves  These all are matters        of basic fairness   Congress needs to look closely at ensuring a        standard of care consistent with the high value of this data  including        penalty options when companies fall short of meeting those standards  Data        brokers are increasingly partnering with the government in law enforcement        and homeland security efforts  It might prove useful for Congress to        consider the extent to which a companys privacy and security practices are        qualifying factors in securing federal contracts  including appropriate        penalties in the contract procurement process for any failures  I welcome        the opportunity to work with my colleagues on Judiciary  this Committee and        others to craft an effective solution that allows us to harness the        benefits of the information age  while protecting Americans from        unauthorized and inappropriate uses of their personal information   Privacy and liberty are        important values to the American people  and our collective vigilance in        protecting these cherished values has allowed us to enjoy unparalleled        freedoms  security and economic vitality  We must continue this vigilance   Your hearing today will shed much needed        light on a rapidly growing industry and its practices in handling the        financial and personal information of every American  I am also pleased        that Senator Specter understands the significance of these concerns and has        agreed to my request for a hearing in the Judiciary Committee  where there        also is a high level of concern and interest in this subject  and where we        will to continue the process of shedding a little sunshine on these        practices    I thank you for the opportunity to appear        here today  and I look forward to continued discussions on these issues
