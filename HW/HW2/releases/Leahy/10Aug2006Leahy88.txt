       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Foiling Of The British Airline   Terror Plot                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt        On The Foiling Of The British Airline Terror Plot      Montpelier  Vermont      Thursday  August 10  2006  All       of us as Americans are grateful to British authorities for       disrupting a plot that endangered the citizens of both our       countries  I also commend the FBI professionals and others for       their close and expert cooperation in this investigation    This episode and the upcoming       five year anniversary of the attacks of 9 11 are reminders that       there is little margin for error in countering terrorism  We       need to refocus our attention and resources to eliminate the       misdirection and mismanagement that too often divert us from the       goal of protecting the American people   Imagine how different our       situation would be today if we had not shifted our elite forces       from Afghanistan to Iraq at the critical moment when we were       close to finding Osama bin Laden  In the years since then the       Iraq war has stretched our military to the breaking point        sapped hundreds of billions of dollars  and preoccupied our       attention  The White House has even disbanded the intelligence       unit that for years was dedicated to tracking down Osama bin       Laden  The diversion to Iraq has only succeeded in creating a       new breeding ground for terrorists and in emboldening the rogue       states that harbor and supply them  Starting an unnecessary war       in Iraq has not made us more secure  but less secure     We are at our best when we meet       the threat of terrorism not with fear but with facts and       determination  Let us set a new direction to counter terrorism       on our own terms  with American skill and with American values
