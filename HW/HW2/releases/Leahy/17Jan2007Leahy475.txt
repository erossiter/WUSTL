       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Revisions of The NSA Domestic   Surveillance Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Revisions Of The NSA Domestic Surveillance Program      January 17  2007     I welcome the Presidents decision      not to reauthorize the NSAs warrantless spying program and instead      to seek approval for all wiretaps from the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Court  as the law has required for years   Since this program was first      revealed  I have urged this Administration to inform Congress what      the government is doing and to comply with the checks and balances      Congress wrote into law in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act    We must engage in all surveillance      necessary to prevent acts of terrorism  but we can and should do so      in ways that protect the basic rights of all Americans including the      right to privacy  The issue has never been whether to monitor      suspected terrorists but doing it legally and with proper checks and      balances to prevent abuses    Providing efficient but meaningful      court review is a major step toward addressing those concerns        I continue to urge the President to      fully inform Congress and the American people about the contours of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court order authorizing this      surveillance program  and of the program itself  Only with      meaningful oversight can we ensure the balance necessary to achieve      security with liberty
