       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On the Schiavo Legislation Passed By   Congress                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Senator Leahy         opposed last weeks earlier House bill that would have directed a federal         court to issue a stay in the Schiavo case  The last version of the Senate         bill that passed the Senate does not mandate a stay but asks a federal         court to review the case  Senator Leahy believes it is a mistake for         Congress to set the precedent of overriding state procedures and to         intervene in individual cases  and he does not support the bill that         passed    Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy       On The Schiavo Legislation Passed By Congress       Monday  March 21  2005 Terri Schiavos long ordeal has been heart wrenching        for everyone involved  for her husband  her parents  her siblings and her        friends  and now for the entire country  This case has reached the courts because of differing        views within Terri Schiavos family  and Florida law governs how such        disputes should be resolved  The courts of Florida have heard the evidence        and found sufficient evidence to uphold her husbands belief that this        would have been Terris wish  Courts  not legislative bodies  are intended        under our system of government to settle such matters and to evaluate        detailed medical evidence  because courts have the ability to look more        closely at the evidence  to weigh it and to apply the law to the unique        circumstances of each case  I do not believe it is a good precedent for        Congress to override state laws and intervene in individual cases   It was clear that there was strong support in both        the House and the Senate for this legislation  and delaying a vote would        have served no constructive purpose  while enflaming passions on all sides        until the vote was held   Congress also should resist any temptation to jump in        again to overturn the federal court that now will review this case         whichever way that decision goes
