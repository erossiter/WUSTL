       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy International Donations For Victims   Of Hurricane Katrina                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     International Donations     For Victims Of Hurricane Katrina     September 8  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  I want to take a moment  on behalf of myself  my fellow      Vermonters and Americans across this country to express our      heartfelt gratitude for the outpouring of generosity by more than 90      countries and international organizations that have offered      assistance to the recovery efforts after Hurricane Katrina    The United States      is coping with devastation and destruction on a scale not seen in      our lifetimes  It has been shocking and sobering to see how      woefully unprepared our government was to help the victims of this      disaster  The chaotic response has also raised serious concerns      about the adequacy of our preparedness to respond to terrorist      attacks  despite the many billions of dollars the Department of      Homeland Security has spent since 9 11   Yet if there is a silver lining in      such a disaster it is that it unites Americans and it unites the      world in the common cause of alleviating suffering  A massive      relief effort is underway  albeit belatedly  involving everyone from      the Coast Guard to the Red Cross to private citizens who are      rescuing people who were stranded and caring for those who lost      their homes and possessions  Organizations such as the United      Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  the      World Food Program  World Health Organization  UNICEF and the UN      High Commissioner for Refugees have all contributed personnel and      resources to help in the recovery  Canadian search and rescue teams      from as far away as British Colombia were on the ground in some      Louisiana communities as early as August 31st  even      before FEMA had mobilized American relief workers   It is not often      that we  the worlds only superpower  find ourselves on the      receiving end of foreign aid  It is almost always the other way      around  when Americans respond  as we do continuously  to the needs      of people suffering from famine  conflict and natural disasters      overseas  It is notable that our own disaster relief specialists in      USAIDs Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance are assisting in this      domestic recovery effort   The outpouring of      sympathy and the hundreds of millions of dollars in contributions by      Americans to the victims of the South Asian tsunami earlier this      year are today being reciprocated by some of those same countries       and by scores of others  From the      wealthiest European countries and Japan  to the poorest such as      Bangladesh and Sri Lanka  generous offers of cash  water      purification and communications equipment  and emergency and medical      personnel have been extraordinarily gratifying   But while no      offers have been expressly rejected by the U S  government  few have      been accepted and received  It is regrettable that our governments      abysmal coordination in the early days of the recovery effort has      prevented critical international aid from being delivered to our      stricken citizens and communities in the affected Gulf states       One of many      examples is Canadas offer to send three warships and a Coast Guard      vessel  They were delayed for a week due to bureaucratic inertia  I know that in      any major humanitarian crisis when unsolicited offers of aid pour in      it is difficult to coordinate and use it immediately  Some is      simply not usable  such as electric generators that require a      voltage not readily available in this country  There are also      problems of limited access to airfields and ground transportation       and the necessary personnel to handle and distribute it  But these      obstacles should have been anticipated  Bureaucratic backlogs and      bungling have kept foreign relief planes grounded for days  medical      personnel on standby  and tons of supplies waiting to be delivered      to the desperate people of Louisiana and Mississippi   The sluggish      response has left foreign governments frustrated and baffled  I      think it needs to be emphasized how much we welcome and appreciate      their generous offers of help  It is unfortunate that our      government was so unprepared to receive this aid in a timely manner       when lives could have been saved and suffering alleviated  Let us      hope that the bottlenecks are being removed so the State Department       the Department of Homeland Security  and particularly FEMA  can      speed the delivery of aid from our friends around the world without      further delay
