       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On President Bush s Formal Withdrawal   Of The Nomination Of Harriet Miers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On President Bushs Formal Withdrawal Friday     Of The Nomination Of Harriet Miers  To Be An Associate Justice Of      The U S  Supreme Court     Friday  October 28  2005 When I spoke      with Ms  Miers yesterday  I wished her well  Those from the extreme      right who hounded her nomination from the outset and forced the      President to withdraw it should not now be rewarded by being put in      charge of choosing her successor   It is a sign      of how upside down the process has become that even now the White      House is spinning this withdrawal as if the possibility that the      Senate might ask questions about Ms  Mierss work at the White House      were enough to frighten them into withdrawing the nomination in      advance  Ironically  rather than withdrawing this nomination in      defense of presidential power and prerogatives  this withdrawal      signals that this President has allowed his choice to be vetoed by      an extreme faction within his party  before hearings or a vote  He      has ceded presidential authority to the extreme right  With turmoil      engulfing the White House  with no way out of the disastrous and      deadly occupation of Iraq  and with a worsening federal debt  it is      unfortunate that the President feels he is in such a weak position      that he has to cater to a narrow but vocal faction of his political      base  The Supreme Court should be above partisan politics  Many      have previously bemoaned the influence of outside groups who      advocate on each side during the confirmation process  but this      takes that influence to a new level         to the nomination itself  The extreme right has demanded and gotten      an extra constitutional veto over President Bushs nomination and      infected the process designed by the Founders   Along with      other Democratic senators  I urged that we withhold judgment until      after her hearings  and that is what Democratic senators have done  The Senate      Friday received the Presidents withdrawal of this nomination  and      now he has a third opportunity to nominate someone to succeed      Justice Sandra Day OConnor  I strongly urge him not to reward      those who unfairly criticized Ms  Miers but  instead  to consult      with senators on both sides of the aisle and nominate someone who      will unite the country and win overwhelming approval in the Senate      and from the vast majority of the American people  This is a time      for the President to honor his first pledge to the American people      to be a uniter and not a divider   It has been an      eye opening experience for the country to see what a vocal faction      of the Republican Party really wants  They do not want an      independent federal judiciary  This experience exposed the      right wing litmus test that they insist be used  rather than      selecting judges and justices who will be fair and impartial in      applying the law  They  in fact  demand judges who will guarantee      the results that they want   When in the      past they promoted nominees by saying that they should not have to      answer questions or provide information and documents  they did so      because they believed private assurances or because they thought      they knew exactly how the nominee would rule from the bench  From      Harriet Miers  the Presidents lawyer and choice  they have demanded      more  They wanted assurances and had questions about personal      beliefs and demanded to see a documentary paper trail   They have      pretended to be against so called activist judges  But what they      really demand is the appointment of activist judges who will rule      their way  They do not seek fairness and independence but      toe the line  ends oriented decisions from the nations independent      judiciary  It is too bad      that the President gave into their demands to withdraw this      nomination before the hearings proceeded  Harriet Miers was denied      the equivalent of her day in court and of any fair opportunity to      make her case  The President should not now compound this mistake      by rewarding those who forced him to withdraw her nomination by      allowing them to dictate the next nominee  Instead  he should think      about the country  The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the rights      of all Americans  The nomination should be made in the nations      interest  not to serve the interests of any partisan faction
