       First Responder Aid And The All State Minimum  The Menendez Amendment   Takes Aim At The Wrong Threat                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                First Responder Aid And The All State Minimum      The Menendez Amendment Takes Aim At The Wrong Target FEDERAL DIRECTIVES  FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP       Since 9 11 the federal government has asked all states to improve      their preparedness  adding to the responsibilities and risks of      first responders across the nation  The federal government has      several first responder grant programs that are predicated on the      federal responsibility in this partnership  Some of these grant      programs are directed exclusively at the needs of high risk areas      and urban areas  ONLY TWO OUT OF EIGHT of these programs include an      all state minimum  and this formula applies only to 40      percent of those programs funds   ALL STATE MINIMUM  The all state      minimum applies only to two of the federal governments      first responder grant programs  the State Homeland Security Grant      Program and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  and      it applies only to 40 percent of both programs  The remaining 60      percent of the programs funds are subject to discretionary      decisions by DHS  The all state minimum simply ensures that each      state receives at least 0 75 percent of the national allotment of      that 40 percent segment of the programs funds  recognizing that      every state is being asked to improve its preparedness and security      efforts  Without this partnership help  smaller states  in      particular  would find it difficult to fulfill these added duties       Without this minimum  there is no assurance that any state will      receive ANY grant support for the preparedness and security efforts      of its first responders  PITTING STATES AGAINST STATES       All states have basic preparedness needs  and high density urban      areas and high risk centers have even greater needs  All of these      needs deserve and need to be met  The Administration has tried to      shift the blame it deserves for its chronic underfunding of all      first responder grant programs by instead pitting states against      states for scarce grant dollars   Pitting states against each other ignores the      real problem  The Administration has failed to make      first responders a high enough priority  Congress instead should be      looking to increase the overall federal commitment to the nations      first responders  Over the last four years  the President and a      compliant Congress have cut state and local first responder formula      grants in the Homeland Security Department by 59 percent  from  2 3      billion in 2003  to  941 million in 2006  These cuts will affect      each state  regardless of size or population  WRONG TARGET  The reduction in      first responder grant aid this year to high risk areas like New York      City and Washington  D C   involves Department of Homeland Security       DHS  discretionary decisions on grants from an entirely different      grant program  NOT from the programs that include the all state      minimum  Nor does the DHS Inspector Generals report this week on      the Homeland Security Terrorist Database have anything to do with      the all state minimum  CRIPPLING BLOW TO SMALL  AND MEDIUM SIZE      STATES  Not only would this change in the formula result in      the loss of millions in homeland security funding for the fire       police and rescue departments in small  and medium sized states  it      also would deal a crippling blow to their efforts to launch      federally mandated multi year plans to build and sustain their      terrorism preparedness  The federal government should ensure that      adequate  basic support and resources are provided for police  fire      and EMS services in every state if we expect them to continue      protecting us from terrorists or responding to terrorist attacks
