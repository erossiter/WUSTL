       221007a                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary      Committee  Hearing On Examining U S       Government Enforcement     Of Intellectual Property Rights  November 7  2007         Intellectual property  copyrighted works  trademarked goods  and      patented inventions  fuels the engine that drives the U S       economy  Intellectual property reportedly accounts for 40  of our      nations exports  Just as importantly  we consume IP voraciously      here at home  IP is the medicine that cures us  the movies that      thrill us  the music that inspires us  the software that empowers      us  the technology that aids us  It is everywhere in our lives  and      it is evermore important in our economy               Unfortunately  the piracy and counterfeiting of intellectual      property has reached unprecedented levels  Copyright infringement      alone costs the U S  economy at least  200 billion and approximately      750 000 jobs each year  Such theft is unacceptable  but      counterfeiting goods not only infringe IP rights  they can endanger      our health and safety  Fake drugs that look just like the real      thing  tainted infant formula sold to unsuspecting parents       electrical appliances with shoddy insulation  automobile parts that      fail under stress  such counterfeit goods are proliferating  and      are often difficult to distinguish from their real  and safe       counterparts               I have worked for years both to strengthen our existing laws and to      give our law enforcement agents the necessary tools to combat      infringement  In the last Congress  we passed the Stop      Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods Act  which expanded the      prohibition on trafficking in counterfeit goods to include      trafficking in labels or similar packaging with knowledge that a      counterfeit mark had been applied to those goods  I have regularly      authored amendments to the State Departments appropriations bill to      provide millions to the Department in order to send staff overseas      to specifically combat piracy in countries that are not members of      the Organisation for Economic Co Operation and Development  or      OECD  Just this morning  I reintroduced  with my Judiciary      Committee colleague Senator Cornyn  the PIRATE Act  This      legislation is a simple bill that would give the Department of      Justice the authority to prosecute copyright violations as civil      wrongs  The PIRATE Act has passed the Senate on three separate      occasions  this should be the Congress in which it becomes law               In the current Congress  there are a number of other bills designed      to combat intellectual property infringement  Senator Bayh  who has      joined us here today  introduced a bill focused on interagency      coordination on intellectual property  Senator Biden recently      introduced omnibus crime legislation that includes many provisions      suggested by the Department of Justice  No doubt others will join      the effort  as we get the legislative conversation started on the      critical issue of law enforcement in the realm of intellectual      property               This issue is too important to be addressed piecemeal  In order to      effect the greatest change  we must examine enforcement efforts from      the top down  Helping us do so is our second panel today  I look      forward to hearing from these distinguished government officials      about the current state of enforcement  and what needs to be      improved to protect our creators and innovators  as well as our      economy
