       Opening Statement Of Sen  Leahy At Executive Business Meeting  Senate   Judiciary Committee                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting    November 15  2007   Today I will  again  attempt to focus our efforts on     proposals to amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA       These are extremely important matters  We have held two hearings and a     number of briefings and meetings on this issue so we can deal with these     matters in an informed way       Senator Specter and I wrote a joint letter seeking referral of this     matter in accordance with Senate procedures  but our Committees     jurisdiction is limited in time  It is set to expire this week  I tried     to make that point last week  and to proceed through the amendments to     Title I so that we could turn to the retroactive immunity issue in Title     II this week  and provide the Senate with our best collective judgment     on how best to proceed       I was pleased with the airing of views last week  but we were unable to     make real progress when Republican objections required the entire bill     to be held over and considered this morning  We have a lot of amendments     that have been circulated and clearly have our work cut out for us if we     are to complete the Committees consideration of this bill       After my brief opening remarks and any brief opening remarks by the     Ranking Member  I intend to place before the Committee the amendment to     Title I of the bill  which we circulated last week  have revised and     re circulated again yesterday after consulting with a number of offices      I am offering the amendment on behalf of myself  Senator Feinstein      Senator Schumer  and Senator Whitehouse       Title I deals with the new authority for surveillance of targets     overseas  the role of the FISA Court in that surveillance  and     protections for the privacy and liberties of Americans  I would ask that     the Committee adopt this substitute amendment to Title I as a starting     point  with the understanding that it would be open to amendment and     that any amendments filed to Title I of the underlying bill will be     considered in order as amendments to it       At some point I would like to turn to Title II and the important issue     of retroactive immunity  Senator Feingold has an amendment to strike the     provisions  which I will support  Senator Specter has an amendment  and     I intend to recognize him to offer it  The Specter amendment builds on     the concept of substitution as an alternative to retroactive immunity      The hope is that it will incorporate a limit on the use of preemptive     legal doctrines  like the state secret doctrine or sovereign immunity      so that substitution would provide a way to test the merits of the     claims with the government standing in the shoes of the     telecommunications carriers       As I have said before  I have grave concerns with retroactive immunity     for telecommunications carriers for their warrantless surveillance     activities from 2001 through early this year  contrary to FISA and the     privacy rights of Americans  A retroactive grant of immunity would do     more than let the carriers off the hook  Immunity is designed to shield     this Administration from any accountability for conducting surveillance     outside the law  It could make it impossible for Americans whose privacy     has been violated illegally to be made whole
