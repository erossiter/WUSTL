       House Passes Bipartisan Anti Piracy Package                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              House Passes Bipartisan Anti Piracy Package  Leahy Backed Bill      Cracks Down On Use Of Camcorders      To Steal Movies  Helps Preserve Films        WASHINGTON  Tuesday  April 19   The House on Tuesday passed a      bipartisanlegislative package that would both protect and preserve      creative film works through changes in copyright laws  The bill       co sponsored by Sens  Orrin Hatch  R Utah   Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Dianne Feinstein  D Calif    Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   and John      Cornyn  R Texas   targets film piracy by making it a crime to use      camcorders in movie theaters to steal films  The legislation also      includes a provision to help the Library of Congress protect and      preserve the nations rich and diverse film heritage  Leahy  the      ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  has      been a proponent of this effort for years  most recently sponsoring      a measure in the last Congress to preserve these creative works       The legislative package passed the Senate in February and now moves      to the Presidents desk  The President is expected to sign it into      law  Leahys statement on the passage of the bill is below     CONTACT  Tracy Schmaler       202 224 2154        David Carle  202 224 3693        Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      On Final Passage      Of The Family Entertainment and Copyright Act Of 2005     April 19  2005 I am pleased that today the House      has voted to pass the Family Entertainment and Copyright Act of      2005  clearing the way for the President to sign this important bill      into law  That signature will mark the completion of our unfinished      intellectual property business from last year  As we work to enact      an equally ambitious intellectual property agenda in this new      Congress  we have started off on the right foot   The Family Entertainment and      Copyright Act will help protect the rights of our innovators and      support efforts at preserving Americas cultural heritage  Title I      of the bill  the Artists Rights and Theft Prevention Act  will      criminalize a growing scourge  the use of camcorders to      surreptitiously swipe movies from the big screen  Theft of      intellectual property does not involve stealing something tangible       but the economic impact is very real  According to the Motion      Picture Association of America  our film industries lose  3 billion      annually due to piracy  We already know of high profile examples of      movies showing up in other parts of the world on DVD while still in      theaters in the United States  Theft of intellectual property is a      global problem  and we need to ensure that our own IP house is in      order even as we continue efforts at stronger international      enforcement   I have long been an enthusiastic      proponent of the Library of Congresss efforts at protecting and      promoting our nations rich and diverse film heritage  Thus  I am      particularly pleased that the bill passed today also contains the      National Film Preservation Act  legislation that I sponsored in the      last Congress to continue support for this extraordinary project       It reauthorizes a Library of Congress program dedicated to      preserving precisely those types of films most in need of archival      preservation  orphaned works that do not enjoy the protection of      the major studios  The movies saved include culturally significant      silent era films  ethnic films  newsreels  and avant garde works       The Act will allow the Library of Congress to continue its important      work  and to provide assistance to libraries  museums  and archives      in preserving films and in making these works available to      researchers and the public  We know that more than 50 percent of      the works made before 1950 have disintegrated and that only 10      percent of films made before 1929 still exist  Once these works are      gone  they are lost to history forever  The Librarian of Congress       James Billington  has referred to our film heritage as Americas      living past  The National Film Preservation Act will help ensure      that this past is accessible in order to entertain and enlighten      future generations   I am also glad that a small but      significant component of the bill is the Preservation of Orphan      Works Act  which corrects a drafting error in the Sonny Bono      Copyright Term Extension Act  Correction of this error will allow      libraries to create copies of orphan works  copyrighted materials      that are in the last 20 years of their copyright term  are no longer      commercially exploited  and are not available at a reasonable      price  The last provision in the bill is the Family Movie Act       which ensures that in home viewing of movies can be done as families      see fit  I noted when this bill was      introduced that while I might well have drafted specific components      of this package differently  the Family Entertainment and Copyright      Act was built around collegiality and compromise  both across the      aisle and between chambers  As a result  we have produced good law      worthy of the broad support it has enjoyed  I thank the bills      Senate cosponsors  Senators Hatch  Cornyn  Feinstein  and Alexander       for all of their hard work  I also wish to thank in particular      Chairmen Sensenbrenner  Congressman Conyers  Congressman Smith  and      Congressman Berman  without whose efforts this bill could not become      law
