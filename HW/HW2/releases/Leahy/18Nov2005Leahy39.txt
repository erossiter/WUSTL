       Leahy Hits Bush Administration  House GOP For Playing PATRIOT Games                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy Hits Bush Administration      House GOP For Playing PATRIOT Games WASHINGTON       Friday  Nov  18     Senator Patrick Leahy  the ranking Democratic      member of the Judiciary Committee  released the following statement      Friday on the stalled negotiations over reauthorization of certain      provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act  Leahy  D Vt   also is the      leading Democratic Senate conferee on the PATRIOT Act rewrite  One of the      PATRIOT Acts original co authors  Leahy supported the Senate bill      to reauthorize certain provisions of the 2001 law that are set to      expire at the end of the year The Senate bill also includes      Leahy led sunshine additions to the PATRIOT law to promote better      congressional oversight and accountability  Leahy and former House      Majority Leader Dick Armey  R Texas  had teamed up to insist on      including the sunset provisions in the 2001 PATRIOT law  some of      which would be carried forward in the Senates version of the      reauthorization bill  Throughout the House Senate conference  Leahy      has insisted on keeping the sunset and sunshine provisions  Leahys      statement follows   Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      PATRIOT Games     November 18  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  the current consideration by the Congress of a rewrite of      the USA PATRIOT Act is a significant event  These are important      issues  and they have become increasingly important to the American      people   This bill  more      than any other  must have the confidence of the American people  I      understand that and Chairman Specter understands that  I commend      the Chairman for his commitment to work in a bipartisan manner  both      during the Committee process and throughout the House Senate      conference  He and I agree with the vast majority of Americans that      a reauthorization of the PATRIOT Acts expiring provisions must be      accomplished in a bipartisan process  not in a bitter  partisan      battle    The PATRIOT Act      suffers from an image problem  This perception problem stems in      large measure from the rhetoric  practices and secrecy of the Bush      Administration and the Ashcroft Justice Department  The antidote is      clear and it is simple   less secrecy  more congressional oversight       more judicial review and an adjusted balance that better protects      the rights and liberties of all Americans  That is what we      produced here in the Senate when first the Senate Judiciary      Committee and then the Senate unanimously adopted our PATRIOT Act      reauthorization bill  We worked together and we did so in a timely      manner  completing our work in July  The Senate appointed conferees      immediately  Regrettably  the House did not follow suit  They      delayed more than three months until November 9  just last week and      just a week before Congress was scheduled to recess  We lost three      months that we could have used to find common ground and create a      better bill  Unfortunately  the House Republican leadership played      games with the PATRIOT Act while the clock was ticking   Even last week       with conferees newly appointed by the House  I was hopeful that in      our limited time  we could negotiate in good faith and reach a      bipartisan  bicameral agreement  We made some progress over the      weekend on important issues  reaching a tentative agreement on      improved reporting requirements that would shine some light on the      use of certain surveillance techniques  I believed that we were      close to striking a reasonable balance on the core civil liberties      issues raised by the PATRIOT Act  But on Sunday       the Bush Administration stepped in and with the acquiescence of      congressional Republicans the bipartisan negotiations were abruptly      ended  The curtain came down  Democratic participation was      excluded from the process  As a result  the tentative agreements      were scuttled based on Bush Administration demands  Further impeding      bipartisan progress  the conference report was being loaded up with      controversial provisions that had nothing to do with the PATRIOT      Act  terrorism  or anything in either the House or Senate passed      bills  The PATRIOT Act suddenly was being used as a vehicle of      convenience to pass laws that could not be passed on their own      merit  This overreaching by the House Republican conferees caused      more time to be lost  and because of the ill advised choices that      were made late in this process  the conference report is not what it      should be    The needless and      divisive chapter in the late stages of what should have been       what could have been   an open and bipartisan conference threatens      to undermine national consensus on this bill  Sadly  it also      threatens national confidence in how we as a Congress can best      address these important issues  Before the Bush Administration      butted in and grabbed the reins  we were close to a compromise that      could have been acceptable to almost all members of Congress and to      the American public  This is not that conference report  I am not      sure that this conference report can win the confidence of the      American people  Rather than seek common ground with the Congress      and with the American people that we represent  the Bush      Administration and Republican conferees have taken abused their      power and taken terrible advantage  Just two months      ago  we observed the fourth anniversary of the horrific attacks of      September 11       2001  In the aftermath of the attacks  Congress moved quickly to      pass anti terrorism legislation  The fires were still smoldering at      Ground Zero when the USA PATRIOT Act became law on October 30  2001       just six weeks after the attacks   Many of us here      today worked together in a spirit of bipartisan unity and resolve to      craft a bill that we had hoped would make us safer as a Nation       Freedom and security are always in tension in our society  and      especially so in those somber weeks after the attacks  but we tried      our best to strike the right balance       One of the fruits of that bipartisanship was the sunset provisions      contained in the PATRIOT Act  These sunsets have allowed us some      opportunity to obtain key information Americans have a right to      know  and to revisit these matters to add more sunshine and      oversight  Those sunsets were supported by Dick Armey  the      Republican House Majority Leader and by me in the Senate      an unlikely duo I concede       but in this case  a successful and productive alliance that proved      to benefit the American people  We prevailed  thank goodness       Sadly  the Bush      Administration and Republican congressional leadership has largely      squandered this opportunity to refine the PATRIOT Act  Instead       they are insisting on a continuing assault on habeas corpus rights      and adding other extraneous matters  Working with Chairman Specter       we are insisting on modifications to the conference report that will      make it more protective of civil liberties and increase      opportunities for oversight  including a 4 year sunset  I thank Senators      Kennedy  Rockefeller and Levin for their efforts to improve the      draft circulated to us this week  I know that some Senate      Republican conferees were not satisfied that the draft fully      protected Americans civil      liberties and thank them for working to improve this important      measure  I hope that the other conferees will work with us to      arrive at a conference report that we all can support and that we      can take to the American people together   If the Bush      Administration would cooperate with us    the peoples      representatives    we will be better able to refine the authorities      and uses of national security letters and the other tools provided      in the law  Without that cooperation  with the veil of secrecy      cloaking so much activity  neither Congress nor the American people      will know or trust what the government is doing
