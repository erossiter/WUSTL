       Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy On AG Gonzales  Remarks At The Hoover   Institution                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT       Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt            Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         On Attorney General Alberto Gonzales Remarks        At The Hoover Institution        Monday  February 28  2005  ON THE USA PATRIOT ACT   No one will support changes that would make        us more vulnerable  When Dick Armey and I insisted on adding the sunset        provisions to the PATRIOT Act  we wanted to ensure that the law we enacted        just weeks after the September 11th attacks would be subject to        effective oversight  We both understood that when you give the government        new powers you have to pay close attention to how those powers are used         It is past time for the Department of Justice to provide detailed reporting        on the use of these tools and to demonstrate why they should be extended        beyond the end of this year    ON THE JUSTICE FOR ALL ACT   I welcome the comments that the Attorney        General made about this vital legislation  and he also pledged at his        confirmation hearings to work with us in implementing this new law  but the        Presidents new budget tells another story  The Justice for All Act  which        we enacted last year with broad bipartisan support  authorizes grants to        the states for state of the art victim notification systems         Unfortunately  the President did not request a cent for victim notification        in his proposed budget  In fact he zeroed out funding for these critical        victims programs  Talk is fine  and talk is cheap  but making our justice        system work as it should takes commitment and resources     ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IMMIGRATION        POLICIES    If the Attorney General wants to reduce the        immigration workload ofour federal courts  he should restore the fair        appeals process within the Justice Department that his predecessor        diminished through his misguided restructuring of the Board of Immigration        Appeals  That  and not depriving legal permanent residents of their due        process rights  should be the solution
