       Senators Call On EPA To Strengthen Mercury Rule In Light Of New GAO   Report                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Senators Call On EPA To         Strengthen Mercury Rule         New GAO Report And Recent IG Report Call Rule Tainted        WASHINGTON  Monday  March 7   U S  Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Jim        Jeffords  I Vt   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  Monday led a tri partisan        coalition of 29 senators in calling on the Environmental Protection Agency        to strengthen a proposed mercury rule that a newly released General        Accountability Office  GAO  report and last months EPA Inspector General  IG         report say was improperly drafted   In a        letter submitted to Acting EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson  the senators        ask EPA to strengthen its proposed Utility Maximum Achievable Control  MACT         rule governing the amount of mercury released through power plant        emissions  Last year Leahy  Jeffords and Snowe led an effort to have the        rulemaking process investigated after it became clear that the proposed        rule continued to pose a threat to the health of women and children exposed        to mercury  After record setting public concern was voiced over the rule        and after numerous congressional inquiries  the EPA delayed finalizing the        rule until March 15  2005   Both the        GAO report and the IG report severely criticize EPAs rulemaking process         concluding that it violated EPA policy  OMB guidance and Presidential        Executive Orders  Both reports emphasize serious flaws in how EPA analyzed        the impacts of mercury on childrens health and the benefits of the        different ways to control mercury emissions  limiting EPAs ability to        select the best approach          Last year Snowe  Jeffords and Leahy were joined by Sens  Joseph Lieberman         D Conn    Thomas Carper  D Del    Barbara Boxer  D Calif    Hillary Rodham        Clinton  D N Y    Frank Lautenberg  D N J   and Mark Dayton  D Minn   in        requesting the GAO report          These two reports show that the Administration ignored sound science and        cut corners to justify the weaker mercury proposal that industry wanted         said Leahy  They need to step up now and put forward a final rule that        protects women and children from this toxic pollutant    This report and ourletter        demonstratethe very real and continuing concernthat the Bush        Administration s mercury proposal was written for and by the big energy        companies  said Jeffords  Mercury poisoning isreal and it is happening        now A recently published study by theMount        Sinai  Center for Children s Health        and the Environment shows lower IQ levels linked to prenatal mercury        exposure costs the United States  8 7 billion a year  Of this total  about         1 3 billion each year is attributable to mercury emissions from American        power plants  Everything we ve seen and heard from this Administration        amounts to delaying enforcement of the CleanAir Act and ignoring the        resulting public health damage  I hope they surprise us this weekor next        and write a strong  enforceable rule that gets mercury reductions        fromevery power plant as rapidly as humanly possible  The GAOs findings        underscore both the inadequacy of existing regulations and the urgent need        to reduce mercury emissions from power plants nationwide  said Snowe  The        current EPA proposals are not going far enough to address this pressing        public health issue  putting millions of Americans  especially women and        children  at risk of serious harm  I urge EPA to change course and make a        commitment to protect the public and our environment  In the        letter  the 29 senators urge EPA to act on the GAO and IG recommendations        to strengthen the mercury control proposals  fully assess the potential for        hot spots of mercury contamination and conduct new analysis to determine        the option that is most protective of children  One in        six women of child bearing age in the United States carries enough        accumulated mercury in her body to pose risks of adverse health effects to        her children should she become pregnant  Forty five states have fish        advisories for mercury warning pregnant women and children to limit their        consumption of many fish caught in freshwater   The 29        senators urging Johnson to fix the rule are  Leahy  Jeffords  Snowe         Lieberman  Collins  Feingold  Dayton  Lautenberg  Boxer  Feinstein         Sarbanes  Clinton  Kerry  Kennedy  Akaka  Inouye  Dodd  Harkin  Biden         Corzine  Schumer  Reed  Cantwell  Wyden  Murray  Durbin  Levin  Reid  and        Mikulski          ___________ A copy of the GAO report is available in                Text of Monday s letter follows         March 07  2005 The Honorable Stephen Johnson Acting Administrator       U S  Environmental Protection Agency       1200 Pennsylvania Ave   N W        Washington  D C  20460 Dear Administrator Johnson  We are writing to urge you to take immediate action to        address serious problems in EPAs proposed rule on mercury emissions from        power plants  so that a better and legally defensible rule to expeditiously        reduce those emissions can be promulgated by the settlement agreement        deadline of March 15  2005  We are also gravely concerned that the        rulemaking process has not been open and transparent to the public and may        not have adhered to proper and statutory guidance   A similar letter was sent to former Administrator        Michael Leavitt on April 1  2004  expressing our belief that EPAs mercury        proposals fell far short of what the law requires and that the proposed        approach fails to protect the health of our children and our environment         The issues raised in the 2004 letter are bolstered by a recent report from        the EPA Inspector General  IG  and a draft report from the Government        Accountability Office  GAO   The IG and GAO reports severely criticize        EPAs rulemaking process saying it violated EPA policy  OMB guidance         Presidential Executive Orders and  in some instances  important provisions        of the Clean Air Act  Both reports highlight serious deficiencies in EPAs        analysis for childrens health impacts and the lack of transparency in the        regulatory process  Due to the known serious and persistent effects of        mercury on people and the environment  EPAs final rule on mercury air        emissions must be protective of childrens health  The Agencys failure to        comply with Executive Order 13045 on Childrens Health nor to even estimate        the value of the health benefits directly related to decreased mercury        emissions concerns all of us  Today  45 states have fish warnings for        mercury  and EPA and the Food and Drug Administration warn women of        childbearing age  nursing mothers and young children from eating more than        six ounces a week of fish caught in local waterways  Recent studies indicate that at least one in six women        of child bearing age in the United States carry enough accumulated mercury        in her body to pose risks of adverse health effects to her children should        she become pregnant  The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed        scientific research demonstrating that maternal consumption of unsafe        levels of mercury in fish can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm        resulting in children that suffer from learning disabilities  poor motor        function  mental retardation  seizure disorders and cerebral palsy   The lack of analysis of the health impacts of mercury        on children by EPA in this rulemaking process is alarming and should be        corrected before EPA issues a final rule on mercury air emissions   Unfortunately  the IG and GAO found other serious        concerns with EPAs rulemaking process on mercury  The IG found that  EPA senior management        instructed EPA staff to develop a maximum achievable control technology  MACT         standard for mercury that would result in national emissions of 34 tons        annually  instead of basing the standard on an unbiased calculation of what        the top performing units were achieving in practice   EPA IG report         Additional Analysis of Mercury Emissions Needed Before EPA Finalizes Rules        for Coal Fired Electric Utilities  Feb  3  2005  p  11  By instructing EPA staff to ignore the top performers        and to base the standard on an arbitrary 34 ton annual emissions limit         these EPA senior managers failed to carry out the MACT requirement under        the Clean Air Act  directing staff to be arbitrary and capricious in        arriving at a standard  These actions violate sections 112 d  and 307 b         of the Clean Air Act  Both the IG and GAO criticized EPA for failure to        follow Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Review  which requires agencies        to analyze and present cost and benefit estimates for all regulatory        alternatives  GAO writes  EPAs initial economic        analysis of the two policies that it is considering has a number of        shortcomings  Specifically  because EPA did not analyze and document the        economic effects of each policy option by itself the results cannot be        meaningfully compared  Further  without monetary estimates of the human        health benefits of mercury emissions reductions  a primary purpose of a        mercury regulationover the full implementation period of each option  or        at a minimum  qualitative comparison of these benefits  EPAs analysis does        not provide decision makers with a strong basis for comparing the net        benefitsUnless EPA conducts and documents further economic analysis         decision makers and the public may lack assurance that the agency has        evaluated the economic tradeoffs of each option and taken the appropriate        steps to identify which mercury control option would provide the largest        net benefit   GAO Report Clean Air Act Observations on EPAs Cost Benefit        Analysis of Its Mercury Control Options  p  16   We request that EPA take action on the recommendations        in both the IG and GAO reports  These recommendations request that EPA                   Re analyze mercury emissions data for an updated MACT             Consistently analyze options and provide estimates of costs        and benefits for each proposal in a comparative manner            Strengthen mercury control proposals            Fully assess the potential for hot spots of mercury        contamination            Conduct integrated analysis to determine the option that is        most protective of children and subsistence fishermen and their families         including Asian Americans and Native Americans  and           Provide full disclosure and transparency throughout the        process as required by EPA policy  OMB guidance and the Clean Air Act  We have a responsibility to do all that we can to        protect Americans from domestic sources of mercury pollution and we must be        world leaders in controlling this persistent toxic global pollutant  The        technology to dramatically clean up these power plants is available and        affordable  EPA has already delayed a rule to regulate mercury under the        Clean Air Act by at least six years  There should be no further delays         Accordingly  we urge you to include in the final        rulemaking the analysis that the law and the Executive Orders require and        to issue a mercury rule that gets real and timely reductions on schedule        for the health of the children of our nation   Sincerely
