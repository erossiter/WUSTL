       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee On The   Judiciary  Hearing On FBI Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On FBI Oversight     July 27  2005  Mr  Chairman  thank you for convening      todays important hearing on FBI oversight  This is a constructive      opportunity to continue our efforts to remake the FBI into a modern      domestic intelligence and law enforcement agency  Congress      immediately rose to the post 9 11 challenges facing the Bureau by      giving law enforcement agencies new tools  by funding  information technology  and by pushing      for key management and systemic changes at the Bureau  We have also      had time to evaluate and adjust  Just last week  we unanimously      passed out of the Committee the USA PATRIOT Act Reauthorization      Bill  to extend law enforcement powers  while adjusting safeguards      to address privacy and civil liberty concerns  Today  we have a      panel of distinguished witnesses to help us evaluate the Bureaus      progress  and I look forward to their input    After 9 11  we all realized the FBI      had a lot of work to do  The 9 11 Commission recommended crucial      changes  such as creating an effective intelligence group  enhancing     information sharing       improving linguistic capabilities  and addressing management      concerns in hiring  training and advancement  The FBI has improved       as recognized by Inspector General Fine  members of the 9 11      Commission and others  such as the National Academy of Public      Administration  But those evaluations also show substantial      impediments to information sharing  effective use of analysts and      expertise in domestic intelligence operations  and improving      linguistic capabilities   You  your leadership team and the      hard working men and women of the Bureau deserve the constant      appreciation of all of us as Americans for all you do and for the      sacrifices you make to do it  Especially after 9 11  the people of      the FBI have invested untold overtime hours  working under great      pressure  to handle the expanded duties that landed on the Bureaus      doorstep that day  Constructive oversight is an invaluable      partnership tool that can help the Bureau become as effective as the      American people need it to be in thwarting terrorism and in its many      other essential missions  And that is why you and we are here      today    Translators  I have followed the challenges faced      by the FBI translation program for years and have tracked this      effort closely since 9 11  Recognizing that the FBI would need to      hire additional linguists with fluency in Middle Eastern  Central      Asian and other languages and dialects  I added provisions to the      original USA PATRIOT Act to facilitate the hiring of additional      translators at the FBI    Over the past year  the Office of      Inspector General has issued two reports on the translation      program  The first was a full audit and the other was the result of      an investigation into the security of the operation after      allegations of lax controls and possible espionage were leveled by a      former contract linguist  I thank Mr  Fine and his staff for the      significant effort they have made in this area  both to produce the      reports and to ensure that public versions are made available in due      course  These reports have proven invaluable to those of us who      believe vigorous oversight and government transparency are essential      accountability tools in making the FBI as effective as the American      people need the Bureau to be  and I hope these reports will be      valuable to the Bureau in charting further improvements     This morning the Inspector General      released an update to his 2004 audit  He gives credit where credit      is due and acknowledges that the FBI is making progress  We all      recognize that it is extremely difficult  as a starting point  to      find linguists who are skilled in languages uncommon in the  United States  I recently      spoke directly with Director Mueller about the translation program       among other oversight topics  I appreciate that the Bureau is      working hard to address this challenge  but I remain troubled by the      fact that it takes the Bureau  on average  16 months to hire a      contract linguist    Numerous additional problems continue      to plague the translation program  First  the number of hours of      unreviewed counter terrorism audio is increasing  Counter terrorism      recordings are as important as they sound  they include data      gathered under foreign intelligence surveillance warrants  Even      after the FBI adjusts the numbers to account for double counting       and after it consolidates data from field offices  the numbers still      show a marked increase  from about 4 000 hours of unreviewed      counter terrorism audio recordings in April 2004  to more than 8 000      hours in March 2005    Second  the amount of unreviewed      counter intelligence audio recordings remained somewhat constant       but the Inspector General found that field offices are still failing      to review all of the high priority intelligence data within 24      hours    Finally  with regard to quality      control  new guidelines require a higher level of review and      certification of translated material  but there apparently still is      no nationwide system in place to implement these guidelines and      monitor the quality of translations    I want to see this program succeed       An efficient and versatile translation program is critical to the      Bureaus ability to prevent terrorist attacks  We need to see more      sustained progress in this area before we can be satisfied that the      Bureau is meeting its responsibilities    Information      Sharing   Terrorist Screening      Center  And Terrorist Watch Lists  A January 2005 report by the National      Academy of Public Administration found that the FBIs  information sharing practices  while      improved  are largely ad hoc and lack mechanisms  such as penalties      or incentives  to enforce or promote information sharing  That is a      problem  Other weaknesses in the information sharing infrastructure      are the current challenges with the Terrorist Screening Center and      the Virtual Case File project   After 9 11  there was broad agreement      that the nation needed an accurate  reliable and comprehensive      terrorist watchlist  The Terrorist Screening Center  TSC  was      established in 2003 with the FBI as the lead agency  and it was      charged with consolidating 12 terrorist watchlists  The      consolidation has taken longer than anticipated  but the FBI has      made notable progress  But as a recent report by Inspector General      Fine shows  significant concerns remain  TSCs operations have been      hampered by inadequate training  rapid turnover among the employees      staffing at the 24 hour call center  and deficient  information technology  And if a      terrorist disaster struck  there are questions about whether TSCs      continuity plans would provide sufficient redundancy to ensure      access to the very information that would be so critically needed at      such a time    The watchlists have also been plagued      by inaccurate and incomplete entries  Names that should have been      included in the list were not  Innocent individuals have been      detained or prevented from airline travel due to list errors   I am also concerned about whether the      consolidated list is being used effectively  For example  the      watchlist uses four risk based handling codes to designate how law      enforcement agencies should respond when encountering individuals on      the list  A sample reviewed by the Inspector General showed that      the majority of watchlist names  including nearly 32 000      individuals described as armed and dangerous  are designated for      the lowest handling code  which does not require law enforcement      encountering those individuals to contact the TSC or any other law      enforcement agency  Some of these 32 000 individuals were also      described as having engaged in terrorism  likely to engage in      terrorism if they enter the Untied States  hijacker  hostage      taker  and user of explosive or firearms  It is unclear to me      how individuals so described could be designated for the lowest      handling  These designations raise significant concerns that law      enforcement agencies may be caught unawares or may miss      opportunities for updating TSC on the movements of such      individuals    There have also been repeated stories      of plane diversions because terrorist suspects from the no fly list      have been allowed to board planes  If a person is so dangerous as      to be on a no fly list  then mid flight is much too late to      respond  Our screening processes must make sure that the list is      effectively used to prevent the individuals from boarding planes in      the first place     Virtual Case File      and Sentinel  It is no secret that many of us are      greatly concerned about the FBIs handling of the Virtual Case File       VCF  project  The FBI bit off more than it could chew  failed to      develop a finite and final list of project requirements  poorly      chose to issue a contract without milestones and associated      penalties  had inconsistent leadership  and lacked the capabilities      and procedures necessary to manage the project well  As the      Director knows from two appropriations subcommittee hearings  I      found intolerable the fact that Congress  and this Committee in      particular    was not given the full story on how poorly the project      was progressing until the entire project collapsed under its own      weight  Taxpayers are out more  100 million  we have lost several      crucial years in getting this essential task completed  and we have      been told that the work product is not salvageable  with only      lessons learned to show for this great expense     I am also disturbed by recent reports      from the General Accountability Office that an audit of the project      has been substantially delayed by the FBI  Weeks go by before      meetings are scheduled and GAO has had to wait several months  and      in at least one case  as long as nine months  to receive requested      documents  The Bureau has provided the wrong documents and has      imposed other delays by requiring DOJ and FBI attorneys to screen      documents before their release  and by limiting direct contact      between the GAO and individuals involved in the project  Some of      this sounds familiar to me  I have often been told that the FBIs      answers to my questions are tied up in DOJ reviews  I hope that the      FBI will make adjustments to reduce these delays  The GAOs audit      will be critical as we move forward with the four year replacement      project  Sentinel         and attempt to manage the already skyrocketing costs   While we are still waiting for the FBI      to share with Congress the Sentinel cost estimates received quite      some time ago  the numbers reported in the press are not      encouraging  U S  News  World      Report reported it to be as much as  792 million  which      would be several times larger than the amount previously dedicated      to VCF     170 million  and more than the cost of the entire      Trilogy project     581 million  The Bureau has disputed this      figure  but it is hard to verify figures without access to the hard      numbers  When I asked Director Mueller about the costs in a recent      hearing  he suggested that he would rather discuss the issue in      private  given procurement sensitivities  Director Mueller and I      have met in private and those numbers were not forthcoming  but I      hope that when the numbers are revealed  they are not in this      expensive neighborhood  We remain very concerned about this      project  we expect transparency and accountability  and there is no      patience for another fiasco    Counterintelligence      and Counterterrorism  There are also other weaknesses in the      Bureaus counterintelligence and counterterrorism efforts  The 9 11      Commission recently organized a series of panels as part of its      Public Discourse Project to assess developments since its monumental      report  Those discussions revealed that there are an insufficient      number of intelligence analysts and significant weaknesses in      programs to train and retain them  A former CIA intelligence      officer pointed out that FBI culture continues to place a lower      value on intelligence functions than investigative efforts  and that      the Bureau inadequately invested in analysts expertise or      integrated them into positions of authority  influence and      leadership    I am also concerned about reports that      many top counterterrorism officials at the FBI do not have a      detailed understanding or experience in counterterrorism  While      other capabilities  such as leadership skills  are critical to the      counterterrorism effort  I would also like to see a core competence      in counterterrorism within the FBIs personnel resources  There      appears to be some difficulty to filling counterterrorism posts       The discussions at the Public Discourse Project also reveal that the      Bureau has 200 unfilled counterterrorism positions and is facing      difficulty finding analysts and agents to fill those posts      Conclusion  The FBI has undertaken a significant      organization overhaul since 9 11  The times and threats have      changed  and the Bureau has been adjusting in several key areas       The Bureau has made significant strides and I want to underscore and      commend Director Mueller and the Bureau for that  But there is much      work to do  I look forward to engaging our witnesses on how best to      move forward
