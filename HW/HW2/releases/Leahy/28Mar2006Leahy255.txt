       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On NSA III  War Time  Executive Power And The FISA Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Hearing On NSA III  War Time Executive Power And The FISA Court    March 28  2006      I thank the     Chairman for holding this hearing today  We desperately need some     answers to basic questions about the Presidents decision to wiretap     Americans on American soil without court approval and without     attempting to comply with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance     Act  More than three months and two Committee hearings after the     President was forced to acknowledge the programs existence  this     Committee remains in the dark with regard to nearly every aspect of     the program  As Senator Specter succinctly put it recently  we are     still flying blind on a great deal of this  We held our first     hearing on February 2 with Attorney General Gonzales  His testimony     was more obstructionist than enlightening  He flatly refused to     discuss anything beyond those facts the President has publicly     confirmed  nothing more  In other words  he refused to tell us     anything we did not already know   The     Administrations stonewalling has only gotten worse since then      Three weeks later  the Attorney General wrote an extraordinary     letter to Chairman Specter  seeking to alter his live testimony      mainly by making it even less responsive than it was  That letter     raised serious additional concerns about the scope of the     Administrations domestic spying activities  its shifting legal     rationalizations  and the Attorney Generals own credibility  For example  the     Attorney Generals letter suggests that the Administration is     operating other secret programs that invade the rights and liberties     of Americans  But it refuses to answer our questions regarding the     scope and the purported legal basis of those programs  The Attorney     Generals letter admits that the Departments legal analysis has     evolved over time  while once again refusing to answer the basic     factual question of when the Administration came up with its theory     that the congressional resolution authorizing military force against     al Qaeda also authorized warrantless domestic wiretapping of     Americans  I can only infer that the Administrations AUMF theory     was concocted long after it decided to ignore FISA   The AUMF says     nothing about FISA or about domestic wiretaps  And no members of     Congress I have spoken to understood themselves to be partially     repealing FISAs warrant requirement when they voted for the AUMF      So here  four years after the fact  we have an Administration that     purports to pride itself on strict construction claiming that      unbeknownst to the Congress that passed it  the AUMFs silence on     wiretaps overrides FISAs express prohibition  including in wartime      of warrantless domestic wiretaps  I agree with George Will who     wrote in a column last month that that after the fact     rationalization is both risible and incoherent  To fulfill our     legislative function  we need to know what other invasions into     Americans rights and privacy the Administration believes we     authorized  and why  However  the Bush Cheney Administration     continues to stonewall   The Democratic     members of the Committee finally received a response late last     Friday to the priority questions we sent the Attorney General     following his appearance on February 6  I say we received a     response because saying we got answers would be an     exaggeration  What we got  with respect to virtually every     question  was some version of we cannot  answer  or we are not     able to  answer  or we are not in a position  to answer  or     simply  it would be inappropriate for us  to answer   We held our     second hearing on the program on February 28  That hearing was an     academic panel discussion featuring scholars and former government     officials with a great deal of expertise in the law  but no     knowledge of the program that they were discussing  We had a good     discussion  But it was not oversight   Nor is our     hearing today  Our witnesses are experts in the Foreign     Intelligence Surveillance Act  but they have no special knowledge of     the Presidents program to wiretap Americans outside of that Act      They cannot tell us any more than the very little that we already     know about what this Administration has been doing for the last four     years under its theory of limitless Executive power  We are stuck at     an impasse  lacking information or cooperation from an     Administration that refuses to submit to real congressional     oversight  This is  of course  nothing new from an obsessively     secretive Administration that has classified historical documents     for no reason  conducted energy policy and attempted to outsource     port security behind closed doors  routinely blocked investigations     and audits  repeatedly harassed whistleblowers  and dismissively     refused to cooperate with congressional oversight for more than five     years  This Administration has a paranoid aversion to openness and     accountability that will not be overcome by gentle persuasion      The     Administration tells us  we wont tell you enough to do meaningful     oversight over what were doing  so just trust us  But how can we     trust this Administration  when every day brings more evidence of     its incompetence  including yesterdays revelation that our borders     are not even secure from the simplest scheme to smuggle in a dirty     bomb  So how can we     move forward to protect the security and the rights and freedoms of     the American people  I believe that we in Congress need to do three     things  First  if the     rule of law means anything  we must insist on real oversight and     real accountability  The Chairman said at our last hearing  we     will struggle to try to find out what the program is  With the     greatest of respect  that need not be a struggle  We have the     constitutional right to compel information from this Administration     by subpoena  During the last two years of the Clinton     Administration  this Committee approved the issuance of more than a     dozen subpoenas to the Department of Justice and former DOJ     officials  both for documents  including legal memoranda  and for     live testimony  The question is not whether we can find out     the extent of the Administrations secret spying on the American     people  The question is whether the Republican majority of this     Congress has the political will to do so   Second  if there     is a real need for legislation that eases existing restrictions     under FISA  we should of course pass it  as we have done on a     bipartisan basis with numerous powers requested by this     Administration over the past five years  However  we should not     rush to give the Administration new powers it has not deigned to     request  based on concerns it has not articulated   Finally  in     discussing legislation  we should collectively draw a line in the     sand  No new powers should be given to this Administration until we     secure a firm assurance that it will faithfully execute and abide by     the law as written by Congress  We have spent many hours of the     peoples time in this Congress  and been subjected to extreme     partisan political pressure  responding to the Administrations     repeated demands for urgent amendments to FISA  the PATRIOT Act and     other laws that limit Americans civil liberties for the sake of     security  Yet  as George Will pointed out  all those debates have     been a meaningless charade if the Administrations monarchical     assertions of essentially unfettered presidential power to conduct     the war on terror are taken seriously  If  as the Administration     contends  the President can pick and choose which laws he will or     will not follow  what is the point of our amending FISA    We are not here     to play charades  We are here to legislate the law of the land  So     any further legislation that we enact in this area should  at a     minimum  include express provisions that require the President to     stop equivocating with vague  expansive and dangerous theories of     inherent powers  and to accept that he is fully bound by the     legislation as written  We must put an end to police state powers     operating outside the law
