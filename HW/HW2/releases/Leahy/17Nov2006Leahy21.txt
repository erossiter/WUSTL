the truth about the      Bush Administrations interrogation policies and practices that have      engendered criticism at home  contributed so negatively to the image      of the United States around the world and served to undercut our      efforts against terrorism  he said                       The text of the      letter follows        November 16  2006  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW     Washington  D C  20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales     Recent press accounts indicate that       after years of denials  the Central Intelligence Agency has      acknowledged the existence of additional documents detailing the      Bush Administrations interrogation and detention policy for      terrorism suspects  According to press reports  the CIA recently      disclosed the existence of two interrogation related documents  a      presidential directive regarding the CIAs interrogation methods and      detention facilities located outside of the United States  and an      August 2002 Department of Justice Memorandum to the CIA General      Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods  the 2nd      Bybee memo   in connection with an ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by      the American Civil Liberties Union    As you know  for more than two years       I have repeatedly sought answers from the Department of Justice  the      FBI  the CIA  and the Department of Defense regarding reported and       in some instances  documented cases of the abuse of detainees in      U S  custody  The photographs and reports of prisoner abuse in      Iraq  Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere that have emerged during the past      two years depict an interrogation and detention system operating      contrary to U S  law and the Geneva Conventions    Prisoner abuse is one aspect of a      broader problem  which includes the use of so called extraordinary      renditions to send people to other countries where they will be      subject to torture  We diminish our own values as a Nation  and      lose credibility as an advocate of human rights around the world       by engaging in  or outsourcing  torture   The American people deserve to have      detailed and accurate information about the role of the Bush      Administration in developing the interrogation policies and      practices that have engendered such deep criticism and concern at      home and around the world  I ask that you promptly respond to the      following questions and document requests        1  Please produce any and all directives  memoranda  and or      orders  including any and all attachments to such documents       regarding CIA interrogation methods or policies for the treatment of      detainees  including but not limited to the directive signed by      President Bush governing CIA interrogation methods  or allowing the      CIA to set up detention centers located outside of the United      States        2  Please produce any and all Department of Justice      directives  memoranda  and or guidance  including any and all      attachments to such documents  regarding CIA detention and or      interrogation methods  including but not limited to the August 2002      Memorandum from the Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel      to the CIA General Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods  the      2nd Bybee memo          3  Please produce any and all documents in the custody of      the Department of Justice regarding the legality of specific      interrogation tactics and or federal criminal prohibitions on      torture and abuse that were used in the preparation of the 2nd      Bybee memo referenced above        4  Please state whether the 2nd Bybee memo was      withdrawn  replaced  or modified after the Administration withdrew      the Office of Legal Counsels memorandum regarding U S  obligations      under anti torture law  dated August 2002  the 1st Bybee      Memo  in December 2004  If so  please produce any and all      revisions  or modifications of the 2nd Bybee memo        5  Please produce any and all Department of Justice      documents that interpret  or advise on  the scope of interrogation      practices permitted and prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act or      the Military Commissions Act         6  Please produce an index of any and all documents relating      to investigations and or reviews conducted by the Department of      Justice into detainee abuse by U S  military or civilian personnel      in Guantanamo Bay  Abu Ghraib prison  or elsewhere   I look forward to comprehensive      responses to the above questions and document requests   Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     United States
