       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Courage And Brutality In Burma                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    On Courage And Brutality In Burma    September 27  2007 Mr  LEAHY  For the past ten days  people around     the world have watched with admiration and increasing trepidation as     over 100 000 courageous Burmese citizens  led by thousands of maroon     clad Buddhist monks  have demonstrated peacefully in Burmas capital     city in support of democracy and human rights  They have been calling     for an end to military dictatorship and the release of Burmas rightful      democratically elected leader  Aung San Suu Kyi  who has been either in     prison or under house arrest for 11 of the past 18 years   Today  there are reports that Burmese soldiers had     cordoned off the streets  fired tear gas  shot and killed several of the     protesters and a Japanese journalist  raided monasteries and arrested     opposition party members and hundreds of monks  The vicious response by     the Burmese military against masses of peaceful  dignified  unarmed     citizens  while not surprising  is intolerable and should be universally     condemned  Earlier this week  President Bush made a forceful     statement before the United Nations General Assembly criticizing the     repression of Burmas military leaders and announcing tighter sanctions     and visa restrictions  The Presidents announcement is welcome   United States leadership is essential  but it can     only go so far  Bringing democracy and human rights to the Burmese     people will require far stronger pressure from its neighbors and trading     partners such as China  Thailand  Russia and India  It will require     these and other nations to disavow the failed policies of engagement     with the Burmese junta   I have long believed that engagement is most often     the best policy  but there comes a time when it has demonstrably failed      and there is no more obvious example of this than Burma  A different     approach is long overdue   Burmas friends and allies must make unequivocally     clear what President Bush and others have said  and what the brave     citizens of Burma are calling for  Burma will suffer severe economic     sanctions unless Aung San Suu Kyi and other political prisoners are     released and the generals in charge agree to hand over power   In his own speech at the United Nations  Secretary     General Ban Ki moon voiced hope that the Burmese junta would exercise     utmost restraint and engage in a dialogue with relevant parties in     seeking national reconciliation  Obviously  that has not happened      Since then  the Secretary General has sent his special envoy to Burma to     try to convince the Burmese junta to resolve this crisis peacefully   It is very disappointing that China  Burmas     largest trading partner  has once again put its economic interests  and     Burmas corrupt generals  above the fundamental rights of the Burmese     people  China  which has more influence over the Burmese junta than any     other government  blocked the UN Security Council from adopting a     resolution condemning the violence   It is a sad commentary on a country that the rest     of the world entrusted to host the next Olympics  While China has     urged the generals to exercise restraint  history has shown that in     Burma words alone are not enough  We hoped China would act differently     this time  but so far we have been mistaken  Many times in the past  peaceful protests in Burma     have been put down with brute force  Countless Burmese citizens have     been imprisoned or killed for doing nothing more than speaking out in     support of democracy   The past ten days of protests have attracted far     greater crowds  and because of the Internet the whole world can see     their numbers  their bravery  and the strength of their conviction  The     people of Burma are an inspiration to people everywhere  and they are     asking for our support  Without it they cannot succeed  If all nations     stand united behind them now  Burmas long nightmare can finally come to     an end
