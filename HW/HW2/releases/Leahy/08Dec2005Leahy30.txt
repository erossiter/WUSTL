       PATRIOT Bill  A Missed Opportunity                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           PATRIOT Bill  A Missed Opportunity     To Protect Americans Security And Civil Liberties        Democratic Senators Seek Brief Extension Of      PATRIOT Law     To Strike Responsible Compromise On Laws Reauthorization   WASHINGTON       Thursday  Dec  8   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and fellow      Democratic senators said the proposed version of a bill to renew and      improve expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act falls short of      striking the right balance to protect Americans civil liberties and      privacy  and they are proposing a brief extension of the current law      to give Congress time to improve the bill  Leahy  the      ranking member of the Judiciary Committee  joined by the other      Democratic Senate conferees on the bill    Senators Edward Kennedy       D Mass    John Rockefeller  D W V    and Carl Levin  D Mich           sent a letter to the conference chairman  House Judiciary Committee      Chairman James Sensenbrenner  R Wis    and to Senate Judiciary      Committee Chairman Arlen Specter  R Pa    urging a three month      extension of the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act to give      Congress more time to craft a bipartisan compromise that could win      broad support   This was a      missed opportunity to produce a bipartisan bill that would protect      both Americans security and their rights and liberties  said      Leahy  who served as the chief Democratic negotiator on the      conference committee  This is too important to the American people      to rush through a flawed bill to meet some deadline that we have the      ability to extend  The way forward to a sensible and workable      bipartisan bill is clear I am prepared to continue to work on these      important issues so Congress can get this right  Leahy was an      original co author of the USA PATRIOT Act  enacted in October 2001       just weeks after the Sept  11 terrorist attacks  Several provisions      of the 2001 law are set to expire at the end of this year under      sunset provisions that Leahy and former House Majority Leader Dick      Armey  R Texas  included in the final version of the 2001 law  as a      way to improve congressional oversight of the new powers given to      the government  Earlier this year  Leahy supported and voted for      the Senate version of the USA PATRIOT Act renewal bill  which      included several new sunshine provisions advanced by Leahy  to      improve oversight and accountability  as well as continuing some of      the 2001 laws sunset provisions  The Senate bill won unanimous       bipartisan support   Leahy said there      are several areas where the proposed conference report falls short       including  Inadequte      Checks on National Security Letters  NSLs     The report       contains no sunset on National Security Letter  NSL        authorities  despite recent revelations about the use of these       authorities to spy on innocent Americans     The       conference report does not provide meaningful judicial review of       an NSLs gag order  Under current law  the recipient of an NSL       can challenge the NSL in court  The conference report changes       that by requiring the court to accept as conclusive the       governments assertion that a gag order should not be lifted        unless the court determines the government is acting in bad       faith     The       conference report allows the government to use secret evidence       to oppose a judicial challenge to an NSL  At the governments       request  the court must review any government submission in       secret  whether or not it contains classified material     The       conference report fails to protect the records of innocent       Americans collected by means of an NSL  Such records may be       kept forever in government databases  shared with the       intelligence community  and used for datamining   Inadequate      Checks on FISA Court Orders For Tangible Things  Section 215    Unlike the       Senate bill  the conference report allows the government to       obtain sensitive personal information on a mere showing of       relevance  striking the three part test that was the basis of       the Senate compromise  This allows the government to obtain       this information without being required to convince a judge that       the records they seek have some connection to a suspected       terrorist or spy                 Unlike the Senate bill  the conference report does not permit       the recipient of a Section 215 order to challenge its automatic        permanent gag order  Courts have held that similar restrictions       violate the First Amendment  The recipient of a Section 215       order would not be entitled to meaningful judicial review of the       gag order under the current version of the report                 The conference reports allows the government to use secret       evidence to oppose a judicial challenge to a Section 215 order        At the government s request  the court must review any       government submission in secret  whether or not it contains       classified material                    Below      are Senator Leahys Remarks on the Proposed Conference Report        Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Proposed Conference Report     On Reauthorization Of The USA PATRIOT Act     News Conference     Senate Radio TV Gallery     Thursday  Dec  8  2005 Security and liberty are not and should not be      mutually exclusive goals in a nation conceived in liberty  The      American people know that  and all of us here deeply believe that       It is our job in Congress to work as hard as it takes to protect      both the security and the freedoms of the people we represent  We have succeeded in making this a better bill      than the one that was almost filed before Thanksgiving  but it can      be made a better bill  a bill as good as the American people expect      and deserve from us  A nation built on freedom  as America is  can      do better  and if we work together  we will do better  Though I cannot sign the conference report in      its current form  I do want to express my appreciation to Chairman      Sensenbrenner and Chairman Specter  who have cooperated in      addressing several of the problems and concerns about the earlier      draft of this conference report  Chairman Specter and I have had      many  many discussions about these issues  and he has acted in good      faith throughout this lengthy process  I appreciate his efforts  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee at that      time  I led the Senates negotiations on the original USA PATRIOT      Act  And former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted on      including the sunset provisions that have contributed to      congressional oversight and that are the reason we are going through      this review and renewal process  In this effort to improve these laws  I      advanced several sunshine provisions to improve oversight and      accountability  as well as continuing some of the 2001 laws sunset      provisions  These were included in the Senates version of the      bill  and most are in the conference report  The conference      committee had an opportunity to adjust the PATRIOT Acts expiring      provisions to protect the rights and liberties of all Americans more      effectively  Regrettably  the opportunity was lost when Democratic      conferees were excluded from key negotiations and the conference      failed to meet to consider and vote on amendments  The resulting      conference report falls short of what the American people have every      reason to expect Congress to achieve in defending their rights while      advancing their security   The Senate bill       which the Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate adopted      unanimously  reached a far better balance  The      reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must have the confidence of the      American people  The Congress should not rush ahead to enact flawed      legislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to extend       We owe it to the American people to get this right   If a satisfactory bill cannot be achieved by      the end of the year  I will be proposing a three month extension for      the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act  Congress has had years      to improve and renew these provisions of the PATRIOT Act  but has      failed to act expeditiously  If three more months are needed to      make this a better bill  then we should take and prudently use that      time  This is too important to the American people to rush through      a flawed bill to meet some deadline that we have the ability to      extend  The way forward to a sensible and workable      bipartisan bill is clear  All of us are prepared to continue to      work on these important issues so Congress can get this right  Let me touch briefly on some of the flaws in      this conference report that are still troubling to Democratic and      Republican senators  and to civil liberties advocates on both the      right and the left   Section 215 I am disappointed that the conference report      did not come out closer to the Senate bill  especially on the      standard for Section 215  the so called library provision  As it      stands  the government can compel the production of business records      merely upon a showing that the records were relevant to a      terrorism investigation   The Senate bill would have required the      government to show that the records had some connection to a      suspected terrorist or spy  This is a common sense protection that      would not hamstring the government  but would prevent government      overreaching   NSLs The conference report also falls short on its      treatment of National Security Letters  or NSLs  These are  in      effect  a form of secret administrative subpoena  They are issued      by FBI agents  without any court supervision  and recipients are      prohibited from telling anyone that they have been served   The conference report does not provide      meaningful judicial review of an NSLs gag order  It requires the      court to accept as conclusive the governments assertion that a gag      order should not be lifted  unless the court determines the      government is acting in bad faith  Despite strong opposition to      this provision from the right and the left  the House Republicans      refused to strip it out  House Republicans also refused  as an      alternative  to impose a sunset on NSL authorities  to ensure      closer oversight of  and public accountability for  their use  The conference report also is loaded with      extraneous provisions that have nothing to do with the expiring      PATRIOT Act authorities  or even with terrorism  I am particularly      concerned about the habeas provisions that were snuck into the      conference report after all Democratic conferees were shut out of      the room  These provisions have never been approved by either      Judiciary Committee  and have been strongly opposed by the U S       Judicial Conference and others                        Letter from the Senate Democratic Conferees   December 8  2005 The Honorable      Arlen Specter     Chairman     U S  Senate Committee on the Judiciary     224 Dirksen Senate Office Building     Washington D C  20510 The Honorable James Sensenbrenner     Chairman     U S  House of Representatives Committee on the Judiciary 2449 Rayburn House Office Building  Washington D C  20515      Dear Chairman Specter and Chairman Sensenbrenner       We write to you about our decision not to sign the House Senate      conference report on USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization  The      conference committee had an opportunity to adjust the PATRIOT Acts      expiring provisions to protect the rights and liberties of all      Americans more effectively  Regrettably  the opportunity was lost      when Democratic conferees were excluded from key negotiations and      the conference failed to meet to consider and vote on amendments       The resulting conference report falls short of what the American      people have every reason to expect Congress to achieve in defending      their rights while advancing their security  The American people do not believe that      security and liberty are mutually exclusive goals  and they are      right  For four years  the protection of civil liberties has been      at the forefront in debates over the PATRIOT Act  The conference      report makes some improvements to the current Act  but it fails to      make others  and even takes several steps backward  We welcome the      enhanced oversight provisions  but they do not offset the reports      deficiencies  The Senate bill  which the Senate Judiciary Committee      and then the Senate adopted unanimously  reached a far better      balance       The reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act must have the confidence of      the American people  The Congress should not rush ahead to enact      flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our power to      extend  We owe it to the American people to get this right   If a satisfactory bill cannot be achieved by      the end of the year  we propose a three month extension for the      expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act  Congress has had years to      improve and renew these provisions of the PATRIOT Act  but has      failed to act expeditiously  The deadline that Congress imposed to      ensure oversight and accountability should not become a barrier to      achieving bipartisan compromise  This is a vital debate  and these      are vital issues  If three more months are needed to make this a      better bill  then we should take and prudently use that time       Sincerely       _____________________________
