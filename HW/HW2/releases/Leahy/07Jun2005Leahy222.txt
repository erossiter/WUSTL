       Cornyn  Leahy Call For Greater Transparency In Congressional FOIA   Exemption Attempts                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Cornyn  Leahy Call For Greater Transparency     In Congressional FOIA Exemption Attempts   Congress should      not establish new secrecy provisions through secret means  WASHINGTON      U S  Sens  John Cornyn  R Texas  and Patrick Leahy  D Vt        introduced bipartisan legislation Tuesday to ensure greater openness      in the legislative process  The bill creates additional legislative      transparency by requiring that any future legislation containing      exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  requirements be      stated explicitly within the text of the bill  It marks one in a      series of open government bills on FOIA reforms that Leahy  the      ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and      Cornyn  a member of the panel  have sponsored together   This bipartisan legislation will help      to ensure an open and deliberate process in Congress  by providing      that any future legislation to establish a new exemption to the      federal Freedom of Information Act must be stated explicitly within      the text of the bill  Cornyn said in introducing the legislation       The justification for this provision is simple  Congress should      not establish new secrecy provisions through secret means  If      Congress is to establish a new exemption to FOIA  it should do so in      the open and in the light of day   Leahy  a longtime champion of FOIA       said  This is a simple and straightforward bill  Not every FOIA      exemption is inappropriate  but every proposal deserves scrutiny       Congress must be diligent in reviewing new exemptions to prevent      possible abuses  Focusing more sunshine on this process is an      antidote to exemption creep    Sens  Cornyn and Leahy introduced the      Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of      2005  OPEN Government Act  S  394  on Feb  16  and a separate bill      on March 10 to establish an advisory Commission on Freedom of      Information Act Processing Delays  Other co sponsors of the OPEN      Government Act include Sens  Russell Feingold  D Wisc    Lamar      Alexander  R Tenn    Johnny Isakson  R Ga   and Ben Nelson  D Neb     Cornyn and Leahy held a hearing      earlier this year that examined the OPEN Government Act  The last      time Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade      ago  and the Senate Judiciary Committee had not convened an      oversight hearing on compliance issues since 1992  The Senate      Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  which shares      jurisdiction over federal government information  has not held a      FOIA oversight hearing since 1980    Cornyn was      presented with the James Madison Award in 2001 for his efforts as      Texas Attorney General to promote open government by the Freedom of      Information Foundation of  Texas  Sen  Cornyn      served previously as Texas Attorney General  Texas Supreme Court      Justice  and Bexar County District Judge   Leahy sponsored      the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments  which updated      FOIA for the Internet age  and in 1996 he was installed in the      Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame         Leahys statement on the introduction of the bill follows                Statement Of Senator Patrick  Leahy  On The Introduction Of Section 8 Of      The Open Government Act     June 7  2005  MR  LEAHY  For the third time this      year  Senator Cornyn and I have joined to introduce common sense      proposals to strengthen open government and the Freedom of      Information Act  or FOIA  The Senator from Texas has      a long record of promoting open government  most significantly      during his tenure as Attorney General of Texas  He and I have      forged a valuable partnership in this Congress to support and      strengthen FOIA  We introduced two bills earlier this year  and      held a hearing on our bill  the Open Government Act  issues during      Sunshine Week in March    The bill we introduce today is simple      and straightforward  It simply requires that when Congress sees fit      to provide a statutory exemption to FOIA  it must state its      intention to do so explicitly  The language of this bill was      previously introduced as section eight of S 394  the Open Government      Act    No one argues with the notion that      some government information is appropriately kept from public view       FOIA contains a number of exemptions for national security  law      enforcement  confidential business information  personal privacy       and other matters  One provision of FOIA  commonly known as the       b  3  exemption  states that records that are specifically exempted      by statute may be withheld from disclosure  Many bills that are      introduced contain statutory exemptions  or contain language that is      ambiguous and might be interpreted as such by the courts  In recent      years  we have seen more and more such exemptions offered in      legislation  A 2003 Justice Department report stated that Congress      has been increasingly active in enacting such statutory      provisions  A June 3  2005  article by the Cox News      Service titled  Congress Cloaks More Information in Secrecy       pointed to 140 instances where congressional lawmakers have      inserted such exemptions into proposed legislation  I commend this      article to my colleagues and understand that Senator Cornyn has      placed a copy in the Record         Our shared principles of open government lead us to believe that      individual statutory exemptions should be vigorously debated before      lawmakers vote in favor of them  Sometimes such proposed exemptions      are clearly delineated in proposed legislation  but other times they      amount to a few lines within a highly complex and lengthy bill       These are difficult to locate and analyze in a timely manner  even      for those of us who stand watch  As a result  such exemptions are      often enacted with little scrutiny  and as soon as one is granted       others are requested         The private sector has sought many exemptions in exchange for      agreeing to share information with the government  One example of      great concern to me is the statutory exemption for critical      infrastructure information that was enacted as part of the Homeland      Security Act of 2002  the law that created the Department of      Homeland Security  In this case  a reasonable compromise  approved      by the White House  to balance the protection of sensitive      information with the publics right to know was pulled out of the      bill in conference  It was then replaced with text providing an      overly broad statutory exemption that undermines Federal and State      sunshine laws  I have introduced legislation  called the      Restoration of Freedom of Information Act  to revert to that      reasonable compromise language    Not every statutory exemption is      inappropriate  but every proposal deserves scrutiny  Congress must      be diligent in reviewing new exemptions to prevent possible abuses       Focusing more sunshine on this process is an antidote to exemption      creep   When we introduced the Open Government      Act in February  we addressed this matter with a provision that      would require Congress to identify proposed statutory exemptions in      newly introduced legislation in a uniform manner  Today  we      introduce that single section as a new bill that we hope can be      enacted quickly    I want to thank the Senator from     Texas for his personal dedication to these issues  I      urge all members of the Senate to join us in supporting this bill
