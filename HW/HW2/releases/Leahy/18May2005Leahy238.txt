       Judge Testifies On Family Slayings To Promote Court Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Judge      Testifies On Family Slayings To Promote Court Security       WASHINGTON       Wednesday  May 18   U S  District Judge Joan Lefkow broke her      silence Wednesday on the brutal slayings of her husband and mother      by an angry litigant earlier this year to highlight the importance      of court security  In testimony before the Senate Judiciary      Committee  Judge Lefkow  of the Northern District of Illinois  urged      the committee to support efforts to keep judges safe both inside and      outside of the courthouse  Lefkow also made a specific plea to      senators to assist in tempering the dangerous and inflammatory      rhetoric by some who have targeted judges for their decisions       Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   who has led efforts in the past to      protect the judiciary  including sponsoring a bill in 2001 that      toughed criminal penalties for assaults against judges and their      families  commended Lefkow for her courage in appearing before the      panel  Leahy is the ranking Democratic member of the committee       Below is Leahys statement from the hearing and Judge Lefkows      testimony                 Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Hearing On     Protecting The Judiciary At Home And In The Courthouse     May 18  2005  I want      to thank Judge Lefkow for her strength and courage in coming here      today to speak with us about the tragedy that has reached so      suddenly and wrenchingly into her life  and which has shocked the      entire nation  While no condolences can repair the terrible damage       she and her family have our deepest sympathy   There is      no justification for threats against  let alone violence against       judges and their families  It is in the vital interests of the      Nation that we defend the bright line that protects judges from      threats  Crossing that line can never be justified or excused or      explained away    I say      this because this tragedy has not only left personal wounds  but has      also dealt a blow to the federal judiciary  Chief Justice Rehnquist      is right to refer to the federal judiciary as the crown jewel of our      system of government  It is the envy of the rest of the world  It      is an essential check and balance and a critical source of      protection of the rights of all Americans  Violence and threats of      violence against judges and their families place at risk the      judicial independence that is a cornerstone of our democracy and a      model for the world    It is an      abomination that some in this country have chosen to use dangerous      and irresponsible rhetoric when talking about judges  comparing      judges to terrorists and threatening judges with punishment for      decisions they do not like  This provocative rhetoric must stop       for the sake of our judges and the independence of the judiciary       Judicial fairness and independence are essential if we are to      maintain our freedoms    It is      unfortunate that it takes acts of horrific violence to put a human      face on the federal judiciary  law enforcement officers or U S       officials  to remind everyone that these are our brothers and      sisters and fellow Americans  hard working people with children and      parents and friends  The tragedy that has befallen Judge Lefkow and      her family is the act of a deranged man  Another has been convicted      of crimes for seeking to threaten her   When I      chaired the Judiciary Committee recently  one of the first things I      did was push for passage of the Judicial Protection Act of 2001       which I sponsored with Senator Gordon Smith  It toughened criminal      penalties for assaults against judges and their families  We      enacted it  We were right to do so  Protecting our judges and      federal law enforcement officers should always be a top priority for      us    We must      better protect the dedicated women and men throughout the federal      judiciary and federal government across this country who do a      tremendous job under challenging circumstances  They are examples      of the hard working public servants who make up the federal      government  who are too often maligned and disparaged  We owe it to      them and to our democracy to find ways to make sure that this      tragedy is not repeated and to ensure that judges and their families      have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital and difficult      jobs    We must      also recognize the tremendous challenges facing the men and women of      the United States Marshals Service  who are charged with the      essential job of keeping our judges  our courts and the rest of the      federal judiciary safe  It is a difficult job and they do it well       with compassion and commitment  Like all law enforcement  the      Marshals stand with the women and men of the judiciary on the front      lines of a battle for security against ever changing threats  We      must give the Marshals Service the resources it needs to fulfill its      mission of keeping the judiciary safe and secure   This      countrys federal judges deserve our respect and our protection  and      we will do everything in our power to work with law enforcement      officials to keep them safe and to protect the independence of the      federal judiciary    I thank      all our witnesses for their constructive testimony  I especially      again want to thank Judge Lefkow and her family for traveling all      this way to be with us  at such a painful period in your lives  to      share your experience and its lessons for us  and for your      suggestions                      Testimony Of Joan      Humphrey Lefkow     United States District Judge     Northern District of Illinois     Before The Judiciary Committee Of The United States Senate     May 18  2005  Mr       Chairman and Members of the Committee   Good      morning  Chairman Specter  Senator Leahy  members of the Judiciary      Committee  Thank you  Senator Specter  for your invitation to      appear here today  And I wish to thank you Senator Durbin for the      compassion and concern that you have expressed to me and my family   Although      I have to this date refused all invitationsof which there have been      many  to speak publicly on my situation or matters of judicial      security in general  I am here today because I believe it important      to speak to this body which has the power to effect much needed      changes in the manner in which the federal judiciary is protected      from assassination and lesser attacks  My family is here because      they hope that their presence will reinforce my words   I am the      fourth judge since 1978 who has been the victim of assassination as      a result of the madness in the shadows of modern life   I borrow      that phrase from the note former President Clinton wrote to me more      specifically  as a direct result of a decision made in the course      of fulfilling the judges oath to do justice without fear or      favor  Among more than 1 000 letters of condolence my family has      received are approximately 200 from judges  state and federal  each      of whom knows in their heart  This could have been me  Five      assassinations  that includes 2 for me  in 25 years tells us that      judges are particularly vulnerable   For example  the last such      tragedy within the Congress was in 1978 and on foreign soil  and      that something is wrong in the judicial protection arena   These      numbers do not include attempts  such as the poisoning of a judges      wife    Let me      briefly tell you what this has done not only to me and my children       but to my extended family of brothers and sisters  nieces and      nephews and others  Michael was a man whose excellent character and      accomplishments at the bar and as a family man have been described      in recent news reports and I will not attempt to recount them  On a      personal level  however  he was a man who  at the age of 64  looked      to the future with hopefulness and anticipation  A litigant who was      angry with me shot him in the head  and shot my aged mother  on      February 28  2005  for no reason other than that they were in his      way on his road to murder me  He could have easily added my      16 year old daughter and me   2 28 is      our own personal 9 11  Since 2 28  our family includes a daughter      and her husband who have to explain to their young children why      their grandfather is now with God and they will not see him again       two daughters who will not have their beaming father to walk them      down the aisle at their weddings  and two who will not have Dad to      join the fun at high school and college graduations  From now on       they will have a fathers guidance only through their memories       Michaels family includes  among others  four sisters and brothers      who have now lost their third sibling before age 65  An entire      family has lost its ability to assume that when we walk through the      door of our own homes  we will be safe there  Beyond the family       there is a community of clients  friends  fellow church members  and      neighbors who simply miss this man who was a significant part of      their lives in one way or another   The      father who sent every report card to Grandma  so she also could      rejoice in what the children accomplished  is no longer there  and      neither is the grandmother  who made each of her 20 grandchildren      and great grandchildren believe that that grandchild was her special      favorite    Finally       I am the wife who wakes up in the morning  not to a cup of coffee      presented by my husband of 30 years to reopen what has been called      the endless conversation of marriage  but to an open book that I      was reading in an effort to banish the memories of 5 30 p m  on the      day our world changed forever   I say      all of this not to garner pity or sympathy  We have been      overwhelmed by the kindness of others and can never adequately      express our gratitude  Rather  I come to you with a plea that you       who have the power  continue to make judicial protection a priority      as is reflected in the recent passage of H R  1268 which includes       12 million to the Marshals Service for increased security for      federal judges  particularly for home intrusion detection systems       and that you be vigilant with us in monitoring judicial security so      that sympathetic feelings translate into real protection  And I      come to you with a plea that each of you exercise leadership to use      your voice in support of the vital role of judges in sustaining a      society based on the rule of law instead of right being defined by      might    First       may I speak of prevention  I understand that the Congress cannot      eradicate violence against judges  nor are judges exempt from the      madness in the shadows  But as I replay in my mind the events that      led to our tragedy  I believe that several things might have      prevented it and could prevent it from happening to even one more of      our judges                 The first is rapid distribution of the funds for home security       systems  Obviously  had the Lefkow family had such a       system at home  this horror could have been avoided  We judges       are grateful beyond words to this Committee and the Congress for       authorizing this appropriation so quickly after this latest       tragedy  Now that the funds are there  I ask that members of       this committee make clear to the Director of the Marshals       Service its intent that this money be distributed to the judges       in the field as quickly as the judges can make arrangements for       installation  As recently as last Friday  May 13  I was       spotted and harassed in a restaurant in downtown Chicago  Had       that harasser had a gun  I would be dead today  There is no       time for bureaucratic delay           I       urge your support for legislation that prohibits the posting of       personal information about judges and other public officials on       the Internet without written consent  I believe that       the Internet is a brave new world in the matter of judicial       security  During       the late fall of 2003 I became aware that I was being villified       on the Internet by a white supremacist organization that had a       trademark case before me   As some of you are aware  the       circumstances resulted in the prosecution and conviction of the       principal of that group   Not only was I labeled as a probable       Jew with mixed race grandchildren  as if those were shameful       things  but eventually my home address and other personal       information were posted by this fringe group  The information        true and false  that was posted about me was readily available       free of charge on the Internet  As a matter of fact  our home       address was posted by the State board of elections in connection       with my husbands candidacy for a local judgeship  A small fee       of  20 will give anyone who wants it access to social security       numbers  loans  land transactions  the names of neighbors  and       so forth  Although it may never be stopped entirely  limits on       commercial trafficking in such information is  I believe        feasible and essential                The third item for which the judiciary needs your support is       adequate funding for adequate staffing  and pay equity  with       other federal law enforcement agencies such as FBI  for the       United States Marshals Service  Others who are more       knowledgeable than I  including Circuit Judge Jane Roth  will be       addressing you on these matters  I also call your attention to       the letter my Chief Judge  Charles Kocoras  wrote to you        Senator Specter  addressing these issues as well  This is my       personal observation over the 22 plus years I have worked in the       federal judiciary  there has been a diminution of support for       the judges that corresponds with the increase in demand for       transportation of prisoners  apprehension of fugitives  and       other responsibilities associated with the federalization of       criminal law  Although security is provided at all criminal       case hearings  many officers are not trained U S  Marshals  and       on the civil side  no security is provided unless the judge       specifically requests it from an already strained district       office  We need a trained deputy marshal present at all court       hearings  criminal and civil  who can be our eyes and ears to       identify and follow up on litigants who appear to be dangerous         How many times have I chastised myself for not recognizing the       threat that became a reality  but this is neither my expertise       nor is it appropriate that I focus on such a matter when I am       handling a case   In addition  my own experience with my       current security detail suggests to me that planning and       training need analysis at the top    Let       me be clear  I do not intend by these remarks to convey any       criticism of either Marshal Kim Widup of the Northern District       of Illinois nor any individual deputy whom I have encountered on       my protection detail since 2 28  Starting with the team who       swept a shaken  disbelieving family into protective custody on       that awful night  these deputies were the knot at the end of our       rope for weeks  and not one of them has been anything but       compassionate  available and committed beyond the call of duty        This has been a sacrifice for the entire Service  of course  as       districts who have lent deputies for my detail are even more       shorthanded in their own locales than they were under normal       circumstances                 Finally  I ask you to publicly and persistently repudiate       gratuitous attacks on the judiciary such as the       recent statement of Pat Robertson on national television and        unfortunately  of some members of the Congress  albeit in more       measured terms  We need your help in tempering the tone of the       debates that concern the independence of the judiciary  I have       come to know scores of judges during my 22 years as a magistrate       judge  bankruptcy judge  and district judge  Whether liberal       or conservative  I have never encountered a judge in the federal       judiciary who can remotely be described as posing a threat       probably more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly       into buildings  In this age of mass communication  harsh       rhetoric is truly dangerous  It seems to me that even though we       cannot prove a cause and effect relationship between rhetorical       attacks on judges and violent acts of vengeance by a particular       litigant  fostering disrespect for judges can only encourage       those that are on the edge  or the fringe  to exact revenge on       a judge who ruled against them           Judges do not invite anyone to file a law suit  The cases come       to us because the prosecutor  an individual  or a corporation is       convinced that the court will protect the rights they believe       are granted to them by the Congress and the Constitution        Neither do we choose the issues  I know many judges but I dont       know one who welcomes the responsibility to decide whether a       mans heinous crime was a result of inability to understand the       nature of his acts  or whether a decision by the next of kin to       remove a feeding tube from a living human being should or should       not be honored  or whether termination of a collectively       bargained pension plan is lawful  We call this winning and       losing  but those terms are inadequate  This is never a game        Rather  cases such as these entail enormous consequences for the       individuals involved  Emotions can be powerful in these       situations   As       Chief Judge Kocoras of my court wrote in his letter to Senator       Specter                No principle by which we live as Americans or govern and judge       ourselves is worthier of greater respect and fealty than the       doctrine of the rule of law  Respect for the rule of law and       the civility it affords requires acceptance of the results the       law ordains  If it comes to pass that  attacks on judges  are       perpetuated because each person feels free in deciding for       themselves what is right or just  then chaos and anarchy will       not be far behind         This       very statement has been echoed by dozens of strangers in my       mail  These ordinary citizens and voters understand what Judge       Kocoras puts eloquently  This is the reason American judges are       invited by developing democracies throughout the world to help       establish an independent judiciary  Our system is the role model       for the world  Without fearless judges  where are we as a       nation  I have no doubt that each of you is equally committed to       this idea  Your voices as elected officials are magnified        Judges  by contrast  speak most often through their decisions        We need your leadership in this area  and the stakes are       profound         Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for the opportunity to appear here       today  I am confident that I speak for all my judicial       colleagues throughout the nation in expressing our appreciation       for the attention and time you are giving to our security       needs  I would be pleased to respond to any questions you may       have
