       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Conference Report On H R  3199    The USA PATRIOT Improvement And Reauthorization Act Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On The Conference Report On H R  3199      The USA PATRIOT Improvement And Reauthorization Act Of 2005     December 16  2005 As      Senator Salazar noted  yesterday was the anniversary of the adoption      of the Bill of Rights to the Constitution  Yesterday morning the      Senate engaged in debate in which we are seeking to protect and      preserve those rights as we consider how best to revise and      reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act  I thank Senators Sununu       Feinstein  Craig  Wyden  Salazar  Feingold and Obama for their      thoughtful remarks and their willingness to work in a bipartisan      way  in the best tradition of the United States Senate  to get these      important issues right       This is a vital debate  The terrorist threat to Americas security      is very real  and it is vital that we arm the government with the      tools needed to protect Americans security  At the same time       however  the threat to civil liberties is also very real in America      today       Todays New York Times reports that over the past three      years  under a secret order signed by President Bush  the government      has been monitoring the international telephone calls and      international e mail messages of people inside the United States       without court approval  This warrant less eavesdropping program is      not authorized by the PATRIOT Act or by any act of Congress       According to the reports  it is being conducted under a secret      presidential order  based on classified legal opinions by the same      Justice Department lawyers who argued that the President could order      the use of torture       This debate is not about whether the Government should have the      tools it needs to protect the American people  Of course it      should  That is why I co authored the PATRIOT Act four years ago       and that is why that Act passed with broad bipartisan support  When      I voted for the PATRIOT Act  I did not think it was an ideal piece      of legislation  and I knew that it would need careful oversight and       in due course  reform  But I was in favor of most of the PATRIOT      Act four years ago  which is why I voted for it  and I am in favor      of most of the PATRIOT Act now  which is why I voted for the      bipartisan Senate bill in July  Nor      is this debate about whether the PATRIOT Act should suddenly      expire  Of course it should not  That is why Senators from both      parties have offered a bill to extend it in its present form for      three months in order to give us time to either return to the      bipartisan compromise that we reached when we passed the Senate bill      or to reach a new bipartisan compromise  Our goal is to mend the      PATRIOT Act  not to end it  None of us wants it to expire  and      those who threaten to let it expire rather than fix it are playing a      dangerous game       Rather  this is a debate about how to reconcile two shared and      fundamental goals    ensuring the safety of the American people and protecting their liberty by means of a system of checks and      balances that keeps the Government    their Government         accountable  Those goals are not the goals of any particular party      or ideology  they are shared American goals  How      to balance security with liberty and Government accountability was      the most fundamental dilemma with which the Framers of our      Constitution wrestled  and how to adjust that balance in the      post 9 11 world is the most fundamental dilemma before this      Congress   No      one should doubt that those who vote for cloture on the conference      report care deeply about the liberty of the American people    and      no one should doubt that those of us who vote against cloture are      devoted to protecting both the security and liberty of the American      people
