       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee On The   Judiciary  Hearing On FBI Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On FBI Oversight      May 2  2006  Mr  Chairman  thank you for       convening todays FBI oversight hearing  This is another       opportunity to continue our efforts to remake the FBI into a       modern domestic intelligence and law enforcement agency     As you know  oversight of the FBI       to help make the Bureau as good as the American people need it       to be was one of my highest priorities when I chaired the       Committee in the period just before  and then in the wake of        the attacks of 9 11  After the attacks  Congress acted quickly       to address the new challenges facing the Bureau  by giving it       new tools to combat terrorism  by funding information       technology  and by pushing to correct institutional and       management flaws that prevented FBI field agents from operating       at their full potential  As recognized by Inspector General       Fine  the Government Accountability Office  and others  the FBI       has improved  Yet we continue to see some of the same problems       that this Committee identified years ago in those earlier       hearings  and that we and the       9 11 Commission sought to correct  Today  four and a half years       after 9 11  it troubles me deeply that the FBI is still not as       strong and as equipped as it must be to fulfill its core       missions     Director Mueller        you  your leadership team and the hard working men and women of       the FBI deserve    and have    the constant appreciation of all       of us as Americans  for all that you do and for the sacrifices       that you make  For decades    and especially since 9 11    the       men and women of the FBI have toiled tirelessly  while under       great pressure  to carry out the Bureaus duties  Constructive       oversight of the FBIs work by Congress is an invaluable tool to       help keep moving us toward the goals that we all share for the       Bureau  That is why you and we are here today          Domestic Surveillance   Since 9 11  the       Bureau has made great strides in enhancing its intelligence       gathering capabilities  I was disappointed to learn  however        that the FBI has been using that capability to conduct domestic       surveillance on law abiding American citizens  simply because       they happen to oppose the governments war policy in   Iraq  In March  the      Seattle Post Intelligencer      reported that federal antiterrorism agencies        including the FBI  conducted surveillance on longtime Quaker       peace activist Glen Milner during the 2003 Seafair festival  A       Freedom of Information Act lawsuit recently filed by the ACLU       has also revealed communications between the FBI and other law       enforcement agencies about the surveillance of several other       domestic peace groups   The FBI cannot simply dismiss       these very serious concerns by citing Inspector General Fines       recent report on the Bureaus conduct during the 2004 nation       political conventions  That report does not address these other       incidents of domestic surveillance    According to the       documents obtained in that lawsuit  these are not isolated       events  The documents show that the FBI has infiltrated       political  environmental  antiwar and faith based groups       elsewhere across the country     The FBIs       participation in domestic spying    at the expense of the       privacy and civil liberties interests of our citizens    is also       evident in a recent report on the Bureaus surveillance       activities  According to a recent report by Inspector General       Fine  the FBI reported more than 100 possible surveillance       violations to the Intelligence Oversight Board during the past       two years  These violations included cases in which FBI agents       tapped the wrong telephone  intercepted the wrong emails or       continued to listen to conversations more than a year after a       warrant had expired     Now we learn that       the FBI wants to search the personal records of prominent   Washington reporter Jack Anderson        just a few months after his death  to look for documents that       may have been classified at some distant point in time      All of this should       concern all who value privacy rights and the free exchange of       ideas in our society           Information Sharing    Terrorist       Screening Center  And Terrorist Watchlist   I have closely       followed the FBIs challenges in analyzing and disseminating the       intelligence data in its possession  The failure of our       intelligence and law enforcement agencies to share information       that might have warned of a pending terrorist attack was cited       as a key problem in the investigations that followed the 9 11       attacks  Last month  the GAO issued a report finding that        despite more than four years of legislation  Executive Orders       and presidential directives  the Bush Administration has yet to       comprehensively improve the sharing of counterterrorism       information among dozens of federal agencies    including the       FBI  In fact  numerous deadlines set by both President Bush and       by Congress to better coordinate information sharing have not       been met     According to the       GAOs report  the FBI does have several initiatives underway to       promote information sharing  including the establishment of 103       joint terrorism task forces around the country  While       commendable  this effort is not fully effective because  as the       GAO found  there are no government wide standards on how to       handle the sensitive counterterrorism information that the FBI       must share with its law enforcement partners    The Terrorist       Watchlist produced and disseminated by the FBIs   Terrorist Screening Center has been       plagued by too many entries and inaccurate and incomplete       information  Earlier this year  the  Washington Post       reported that the National Counterterrorism Center  which       provides data for the watchlist  maintains a central repository       of 325 000 names of international terrorist suspects  The       Terrorist Screening Center provides these names to the       Transportation Security Agency for its no fly list  the State       Department for its visa program  the Department of Homeland       Security for border crossings  and the National Crime       Information Center for distribution to police    If being placed on a       list means in practice that you will be denied a visa  barred       entry  put on the no fly list  or targeted for prosecution  then       the sweep of this list and the apparent absence of any way to       clear oneself certainly raises privacy concerns as well as law       enforcement problems  The FBI must take steps to better ensure       the accuracy of the watchlist and to protect the privacy of the       growing number of law abiding Americans who names have been       improperly listed there          Virtual Case File And Sentinel   It is no secret that       I  like many Americans  am greatly concerned about the FBIs       handling of the now defunct Trilogy project and the prospects       for its replacement    the Sentinel project  The sad saga of       the Trilogy project is well known to everyone in this room  The       project  which was intended to modernize the FBIs information       technology infrastructure  was plagued by numerous schedule       delays and cost increases         B       from an estimated  380 million to an estimated  458 million to       upward of  596 million  before it was finally scrapped last       year     In March  the GAO       issued its report to Congress on the Trilogy case management       project  That report found that weak controls on the parts of       the FBI and the General Service Administration resulted in the       Bureau paying more that  10 1 million in unallowable costs and       in the FBI being unable to account for more than 1 400 pieces of       missing equipment  valued at about  8 6 million  The GAO also       cautioned in its report that if these control weaknesses go       uncorrected  future contracts  including those related to       Sentinel  will be highly exposed to improper payments and       similar problems    As the Director       knows from the recent Appropriations subcommittee hearing  I       find it intolerable that Congress  and this Committee in       particular  was not given the full story on Trilogy until the       entire project collapsed under its own weight  Taxpayers are       out millions of dollars  and we have lost several crucial years       in getting this essential task completed    In March  we learned       that Sentinel will cost the American taxpayers  425 million to       complete and that this system will not be fully operational       until 2009  The GAOs recommendations will be critical as we       move forward with the Sentinel project and attempt to manage the       already skyrocketing costs of that replacement program  I       remain very concerned about this project  This time around  I       expect transparency and accountability  The Bureaus       effectiveness hangs in the balance  and the American people       cannot afford another fiasco           Counterintelligence And Counterterrorism   There are also other       weaknesses in the Bureaus critical counterintelligence and       counterterrorism efforts  I continue to be troubled by the       relatively low level of counterterrorism experience of some of       the FBIs mid level and senior counterterrorism officials        Director Mueller recently told us that candidates for mid level       Special Agent positions within the FBI are vetted through a       process in which subject matter expertise is considered and       preferred  but is not mandatory  In other words        counterterrorism experience is not a prerequisite to promotion       to managerial positions within the Bureau     Given that the FBIs       top priority since 9 11 is to protect the   United States from terrorist attacks        I believe that is critical that we have managers within the FBI       who have significant counterterrorism experience  The FBI       simply cannot continue to foster a culture that places a lower       value on intelligence functions than investigative efforts                Conclusion   Since 9 11  the FBI       has made significant strides to adjust to the threats and       challenges of our time  I commend Director Mueller and the       Bureau for all that they have accomplished  but there is much       more work to do  I look forward to engaging our witnesses on       how best to move forward
