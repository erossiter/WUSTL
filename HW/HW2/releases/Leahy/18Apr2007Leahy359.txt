       Leahy  Hatch  Berman And Smith Introduce Bicameral  Bipartisan Patent   Reform Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy  Hatch  Berman And Smith    Introduce Bicameral  Bipartisan Patent Reform Legislation  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  April 18   Leading     members of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees joined together     Wednesday to introduce bipartisan  bicameral patent reform legislation       Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman     Patrick Leahy  D Vt    and Senator Orrin Hatch  R Utah   a senior member     of the panel  joined with Rep  Howard Berman  D Calif    chairman of the     House Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Courts  the Internet  and     Intellectual Property and Rep  Lamar Smith  R Texas   ranking member of     the House Judiciary Committee  to introduce the Patent Reform Act of     2007   The bill  which is similar to bipartisan     legislation introduced last year  updates current patent laws to provide     much needed reform for patent seekers and patent holders   Among many important reforms  the bill     would create a pure first to file system to bring needed clarity and     certainty to the U S  patent system  The American system is the only     one in the world that still grants patents to the first inventor rather     than the first to file an application  The bill also creates a more     streamlined and effective way of challenging the validity and     enforceability of patents   If we are to maintain our     position at the forefront of the worlds economy and continue to lead     the globe in innovation and production  then we must have an efficient     and streamlined patent system to allow for high quality patents that     limits counterproductive litigation  said Leahy  This bill is an     important step towards achieving that goal   The patent system is the bedrock of     innovation  especially in todays global economy  said Hatch      Americas ingenuity continues to fund our economy  and we must protect     new ideas and investments in innovation and creativity  Patents     encourage technological advancement by providing incentives to invent      invest in  and disclose new technology  Now  more than ever  it is     important to ensure efficiency and increased quality in the issuance of     patents   The bottom line in this is there should     be no question that the U S  patent system produces high quality     patents  Since questions have been raised about whether this is the     case  the responsibility of Congress is to take a close look at the     functioning of the patent system  said Berman  High patent quality is     essential to continued innovation  Litigation abuses  especially ones     committed by those which thrive on low quality patents  impede the     promotion of the progress of science and the useful arts  Thus  we must     act quickly to maintain the integrity of the patent system   Last year  we laid a strong foundation     for this bill  Today  we build on that foundation  Few issues are as     important to the economic strength of the United States as our ability     to create and protect intellectual property  American IP industries     account for over half of all U S  exports  represent 40 percent of our     economic growth and employ 18 million Americans  Strengthening     intellectual property leads to economic growth  job creation and the     type of creativity that has made America the envy of the world  The bill     is a good first start  said Smith  It s not the final word      Legislation and modifications will be made during the legislative     process   The Patent Reform Act of 2007 is an update     to patent reform legislation that was introduced last Congress                  Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    On Introduction Of The Patent Reform Act Of 2007    April 18  2007  Our patent system is grounded in the     Constitution  Among the specifically enumerated powers of Congress in     Article I  Section 8  stands the command to promote the progress of     science and the useful arts  by securing for limited times to authors     and inventors the exclusive right to their respective discoveries      Those discoveries have  since the founding of our Nation  made us the     envy of the world  Our inventors  our research institutions  and the     many companies that commercialize those discoveries have brought a     wealth of new products and processes to our society  we have all been     the beneficiaries of that creativity and hard work    Vermont     has long played an important role in bringing such inventions to the     public  combining  Yankee ingenuity  with lots of sweat equity  In     fact  the very first U S  patent was granted to Samuel Hopkins  a farmer     in Pittsford  Vermont  who discovered a process for making potash  That     ethic continues to the present day  just last year inventors in IBMs     Essex Junction plant received 360 patents  10 percent of IBMs total     U S  patents    Vermont     is special  of course  but not unique in this regard  American     inventors are in every community  every company and school  They are     individuals tinkering on the weekends in their garages  They are teams     of PhDs in our largest corporations  They are scientists training     students in laboratories at our colleges and universities  Our patent     laws should support and reward all American innovators    independent     inventors  small businesses  venture capitalists  academic researchers      and large corporations  To do so  we must update our patent laws      Crafted for an earlier time  when smokestacks rather than microchips     were the emblems of industry  those laws have served well but need some     refinements    Senator Hatch and I introduced     an earlier version of this bill  S  3818  last August  At that time  I     said we had taken the first step down a road to real  constructive     patent reform  which could reduce the unnecessary burdens of litigation     in the patent system and enhance the quality of patents granted by the     Patent and Trademark Office  Senator Hatch wisely noted that we would     have to have continuing conversations about issues that remained     unresolved  We have spent the time since then hearing from all manner     of interested parties  and indeed we have learned as much since we     introduced S  3818 as we had in the two years prior to its     introduction    In this Congress  the     partnership is not only bipartisan but bicameral  We have reached not     only across the aisle but across the Hill to work out a bill that joins     the Senate and the House  Democrats and Republicans  so that today we     are introducing a Leahy Hatch bill in the Senate that mirrors a     Berman Smith bill in the House  The message is both strong and clear      We have a unified and resolute approach to improving the nations patent     system  We will all have time to focus on the bills many provisions in     the weeks to come  but I would highlight three significant changes we     have made since last summer  aided by the many stakeholders in this     process    First  the Patent Reform Act of 2007 now     includes a pure first to file system  which will inject needed clarity     and certainty into the system  The United States stands alone among     nations that grant patents in giving priority for a patent to the first     inventor  as opposed to the first to file a patent application for a     claimed invention  The result is a lack of international consistency      and a complex and costly system in the United States to determine     inventors rights  At the same time  our legislation provides important     protections for inventors at universities  by permitting them to discuss     publicly their work without losing priority for their inventions   Second  poor patent quality has been     identified as a key element of the law that needs attention  After a     patent is issued  a party seeking to challenge the validity and     enforceability of the patent has two avenues under current law  by     reexamination proceeding at the USPTO or by litigation in federal     district court  The former is used sparingly and some see it as     ineffective  the latter  district court litigation  can be unwieldy and     expensive  S  3818 had created a new  post grant review to provide an     effective and efficient system for considering challenges to the     validity of patents  The Patent Reform Act of 2007 has improved that     system  and in particular  we have addressed concerns about misuse of     the procedure  Post grant review will include protections to avoid the     possibility of misuse of the post grant process  The Director is     instructed to prescribe rules to prevent harassment or abuse  successive     petitions are prohibited  and petitioners are stopped from raising the     same arguments in court   Third  we are keenly aware that a sound     patent system needs fair and equitable remedies  As products have become     more complex  often involving hundreds or even thousands of patented     aspects  litigation has not reliably produced damages awards in     infringement cases that correspond to the value of the infringed     patent  Our bill last summer was our first effort to ensure that     damages awards accurately reflected the harm caused by infringement      Subsequent conversations with many affected parties have led us to     language that  we believe  better serves that purpose and avoids     potential pitfalls   The Patent Reform Act of 2007 is also     significant for what is not included  S  3818 would have made three     considerable changes to the patent laws that  upon further consideration     and after listening to the affected parties  we have decided not to make     in this years legislation  First is the requirement that patent     applicants not intentionally misrepresent a material fact or fail to     disclose material information to the PTO  Candor and truthfulness are     the backbone of the patent application system  and are protected by the     inequitable conduct doctrine  S  3818 would have weakened that     doctrine  but it is preserved this year  Second  we maintain the     traditional rule on attorneys fees  instead of shifting fees and other     expenses to the non prevailing party as was proposed in S  3818      Finally  we do not inject Congress into the ongoing litigation over the     extra territorial provision  section 271 f   S  3818 would have     repealed the provision in its entirety  the Patent Reform Act of 2007     does not  while the interpretation of the provision is currently pending     before the Supreme Court  If the Court does not resolve that issue  we     will revisit it in the legislative process    If we are to maintain our     position at the forefront of the worlds economy  if we are to continue     to lead the globe in innovation and production  if we are to continue to     enjoy the fruits of the most creative citizens  then we must have a     patent system that produces high quality patents  that limits     counterproductive litigation over those patents  and that makes the     entire system more streamlined and efficient  This bill is an important     step towards that goal  I look forward to immediate and intense debate     that will inform both the Members of Congress and the public about these     improvements  that will allow us to further refine our legislation  and     that will lead us to consideration on the Senate floor                Leahy Hatch   Berman Smith    The Patent Reform Act Of 2007    Section By Section  Sec  1  Short Title      Table of Contents  This Act may be cited as the     Patent Reform Act of 2007   Sec  2  Reference to     Title 35  United States Code  All references to     sections are to title 35  United States Code   Sec  3  Right of the     First Inventor to File    In general         The United States stands alone among Nations that grant patents in     giving priority for a patent to the first inventor  as opposed to the     first to file a patent application for a claimed invention  The result     is a lack of international consistency  and a complex and costly system     in the United States to determine inventors rights  The United States     Patent Office  USPTO  currently uses an interference proceeding to     determine which party was first to invent the claimed invention  where     competing claims arise  The determination is intensely fact specific     and costly to resolve  By contrast  a first to file system injects     needed clarity and certainty into the system    This section converts the United States     patent system into a first to file system  giving priority to the     earlier filed application for a claimed invention  Interference     proceedings are replaced with a derivation proceeding to determine     whether the applicant of an earlier filed application was not the proper     applicant for the claimed invention      such a proceeding will be faster and less expensive than were     interference proceedings  This section also encourages the sharing of     information by providing a grace period for publicly disclosing the     subject matter of the claimed invention  without losing priority   Specifically  this section makes the     following amendments to implement the first to file system   Subsection  a       100 is amended to     include definitions for terms necessary for the conversion to     first to file    Subsections  b    c       102 is replaced     and    103 is amended  as follows  A patent may not issue for a claimed     invention if the invention was patented  described in printed material      or in public use  1  more than a year before the filing date or  2      anytime prior to the filing date if not through disclosure by the     inventor or joint inventor    A patent also may not be issued if the     claimed invention was described in a patent or patent application by     another inventor filed prior to the filing date of the claimed     invention  A grace period is provided for an inventor or joint inventor     that discloses the subject matter of the claimed invention   Further  an exception is made for claiming     an invention if the subject matter previously disclosed was obtained     directly or indirectly from the inventor or joint invention or if the     subject matter was owned by the same person or subject to an obligation     of assignment to the same person    The CREATE Act is preserved by including     an exception for subject matter of a claimed invention made by parties     to a joint research agreement   Subsections  d    e       104      requirements for inventions made abroad  and    157  statutory invention     registration  are repealed  as part of the transition to     first to file    Subsection  f    Amends    120 related to     filing dates to conform with the CREATE Act   Subsection  g    Makes various conforming     amendments for first to file transition   Subsections  h    i    j    Repeals the     interference proceeding authorized in    291 and creates a new     derivation proceeding in    135 a   designed to determine the inventor     with the right to file an application on a claimed invention  An     applicant requesting a derivation proceeding must set forth the basis     for finding that an earlier applicant derived the claimed invention and     without authorization filed an application claiming such invention  The     request must be filed within 12 months of the date of first publication     of an application for a claim that is substantially the same as the     claimed invention  The party making the request  1  must have filed an     application not later than 18 months after the effective filing date of     the opposing application or patent and  2  must not have filed an     application  within one year of the earliest effective filing date of     the application  containing a claim that is substantially the same as     the invention claimed in the earlier filing application  The Patent     Trial and Appeal Board  the Board  shall determine the right to patent     and issue a final decision thereon  Decisions of the Board  in general      may be appealed to the Federal Circuit    Sec  4  Inventors Oath     or Declaration    In general      The section streamlines the requirement that the inventor     submit an oath as part of a patent application    An applicant may submit a substitute     statement in lieu of the inventors oath in certain circumstances      including if the inventor is unable or unwilling to make the oath      Failure to comply with the requirements of this section will not be a     basis for invalidity or unenforceability of the patent if the failure is     remedied by a supplemental and corrected statement    An assignee of an invention  or a person     who otherwise shows sufficient proprietary interest  may file an     application for the patent    Sec  5  Remedies for     Infringement and Affirmative Defenses Thereto    Relationship of     Damages to Improvements over the Prior Art  As     products have become more complex  often involving hundreds or even     thousands of patented aspects  litigation has not reliably produced     damages awards in infringement cases that correspond to the value of the     infringed patent  This section  therefore  preserves the current rule     that mandates that a damages award shall not be less than a reasonable     royalty for the infringed patent  and further requires the court to     conduct an analysis to ensure that  when a reasonable royalty is the     award  it reflects only the economic value of the patents specific     contribution over the prior art  i e  the truly new thing that the     patent reflects  The court also has to identify the factors that will     be considered in determining a reasonable royalty  ensuring that the     record is clear on what the judge or jury looked at in awarding     damages  The court must also consider any non exclusive marketplace     licensing of the invention  if there is such a history  in determining a     reasonable royalty  Finally  the court is instructed to consider any     other relevant law  which is included to ensure that the significant     body of judge made law on the topic of damages awards in infringement     cases is preserved    Willful infringement      A willful infringer of a patent is liable for treble damages  The     current definition of willful infringement  however  perversely     discourages parties from reviewing issued patents to determine whether a     patent exists  This section provides that a court may only find willful     infringement if the patent owner shows  by clear and convincing     evidence  that  1  the infringer  after receiving written notice from     the patentee  performed one of the acts of infringement   2  the     infringer intentionally copied the patented invention with knowledge     that it was patented  or  3  after having been found by a court to have     infringed a patent  the infringer engaged in conduct that again     infringed on the same patent  An allegation of willfulness is subject     to a good faith defense   Prior user rights      The defense to infringement for patents involving a method of doing or     conducting business based on the alleged infringers having reduced the     subject matter to practice one year prior to the filing date is amended     to apply to all patents and require only that the subject matter be     commercially used  or substantial preparations be made for commercial     use  prior to the effective filing date of the claimed invention    Sec  6  Post Grant     Procedures   In general      After a patent issues  a party seeking to challenge the validity and     enforceability of the patent has two avenues under current law  by     reexamination proceeding at the USPTO or by litigation in federal     district court  The former is used sparingly and is considered not very     effective  the latter  district court litigation  is unwieldy and     expensive  This section therefore creates a new  post grant review that     provides an effective and efficient system for considering challenges to     the validity of patents  Addressing concerns that a post grant review     procedure could be abused by cancellation petitioners  this section     requires the Director to prescribe rules for abuse of discovery or     improper use of the proceeding  In addition  it bars successive     petitions in either the first or second window  and prohibits a party     from reasserting claims in court that it raised in post grant review       Reexamination     procedures  Amends the reexamination procedures of        303 a  to provide that  within three months of a request for     reexamination of a patent by the patent owner  or at any time on the     Directors own initiative  the Director may determine whether a     substantial new question of patentability is raised by patents     discovered by him or cited by any other person   Post grant review     procedures       321  Permits a person who is not the     patent owner to file a petition for cancellation before the Patent     Trial and Appeal Board based on any ground that might be raised under     section 282 a  2  and  3   The Director shall establish fees to be paid     by the person requesting the proceeding       322  The petition for cancellation can     only be filed  1  within 12 months of the patents issue or reissue      known as the first window   or  2  if there is substantial reason to     believe that the continued existence of the challenged claim is likely     to cause the petitioner significant economic harm  the petitioner has     received notice from the patent holder alleging infringement by the     petition  or the patent owner consents to the proceeding in writing      known as the second window       323  Certain procedures are required      including setting forth the basis for the petition      324  Successive petitions under either     the first or second window are prohibited  unless the patent owner     consents in writing      325   The Director may not institute a     post grant review proceeding unless the Director determines that the     information presented provides sufficient grounds to proceed        326  The Director shall establish rules     and standards for post grant review  which should result in a final     decision within 12 months  Rules for discovery may  and sanctions for     abuse of process shall  be prescribed by the Director        327  The patent owner has a right to     file a response to the cancellation petition and may include affidavits      declarations and any additional factual evidence and expert opinions on     which the patent owner relies in support of the response        328  The presumption of patent validity     does not apply in post grant review  burden of proof is preponderance of     the evidence      329  Patent owner may file one motion     to amend the patent  or cancel or propose a substitute to any challenged     patent claim  in response to a challenge  provided that the amendment     may not enlarge the claim or introduce new matter      330  The Board shall issue a final     decision if the challenge is not otherwise dismissed      331  If a final decision of the Board     that is not timely appealed  the Director shall publish a certificate     canceling any claim determined unpatentable      332  The Director may determine rules     relating to other ongoing proceedings      333  A party against whom final     judgment has been entered under 28 U S C     1338 may not file for     post grant review based on propositions that party could have raised in     federal court      334  A petitioning party whose petition     with respect to any original or new claim of the patent is denied may     not  based on any ground which the petitioner raised  pursue     reexamination of such claims  interference of such claims  post grant     review of such claims  or assert the invalidity of such claims in any     civil action under 28 U S C     1338      335   A party dissatisfied with the     final determination of the Director in a post grant review may appeal     the determinations under sections 141 through 144   Sec  7  Definitions      Patent Trial and Appeal Board   The Board of Patent Appeals and     Interferences is replaced with the new Patent Trial and Appeal Board      The Board is charged with reviewing adverse decisions of examiners upon     applications and reexamination proceedings  determining priority and     patentability  and presiding over the new post grant review     proceedings    Sec  8  Study and     Report on Reexamination Proceedings   The Director shall  not later than 3 years     after the date of enactment  conduct a study on the effectiveness of the     different forms of review under title 35  and submit a report to the     House and Senate Judiciary Committees on the results of the study  along     with any suggested amendments    Sec  9  Submissions by     Third Parties and Other Quality Enhancements    In general      This section is designed to improve patent quality by creating a     mechanism for third parties with knowledge of the subject matter of a     claimed invention to submit relevant information about prior art to the     USPTO   Subsection  a       122 b  2   which     provides confidentiality to patent applications for an applicant who is     not filing in another country  is repealed    Subsection  b    Creates a mechanism in        122 for third parties to submit timely  pre issuance information     relevant to the examination of the application    Sec  10  Venue and     Jurisdiction    In general      This section addresses two litigation issues unique to the patent     world  Subsection  a  deals with venue  A venue section specific to     patent infringement cases exists in 28 U S C     1400 b   A change in     the general venue provision  28 U S C     1391  was later read into the     patent venue provision  The result has been forum shopping  which this     subsection addresses  Subsection  b  makes patent reform litigation     more efficient by providing the Federal Circuit jurisdiction over     interlocutory orders in what have become known as  Markman orders  in which the     district court construes claims of a patent  The contours of the claim     are crucial to resolution of the patent litigation  and authorizing     interlocutory appeals will add predictability at an earlier stage of     litigation    Subsection  a    The jurisdiction and     venue provision for patent cases is amended to specify that any action     brought related to patents  other than an action for declaratory     judgment or seeking review of a decision of the Board  must be brought     in the district where either party resides or where the defendant has     committed acts of infringement and has a regular place of business  For     purposes of this section  a corporation resides either where its     principal place of business is located or where it is incorporated       Subsection  b    The Federal Circuit is     given jurisdiction over interlocutory orders regarding claim     constructions    Sec  11  Regulatory     Authority   The Director is granted rulemaking     authority to carry out the provisions of this title or any other law     applicable to the PTO or that is necessary to govern the operation and     organization of the office    Sec  12  Technical     Amendments   Sec  13  Effective     Date  Except as otherwise provided  this Act takes     effect 12 months after the date of enactment and applies to any patent     issued on or after that effective date
