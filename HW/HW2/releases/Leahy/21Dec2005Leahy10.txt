       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee On   Bipartisan Call To Extend The PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     News Conference     On Bipartisan Call     To Extend The PATRIOT Act     Wednesday  Dec  21  2005 Those of us      working constructively to improve the PATRIOT Act have repeatedly      offered to enter into a short term extension while we work out the      differences toward a better bill  What we are trying to achieve is      a balanced and effective PATRIOT Act  a bill that promotes our      security while preserving our freedom  and a bill that will earn and      deserve the widespread support of the American people  Our goal is      to mend it or extend it  not to end it  This brief extension is a      commonsense solution that gives everyone just a little more time to      get this right   It is clear that      our extension bill would pass the Senate overwhelmingly  if the      Republican leadership allows a vote on it  As soon as it      became apparent that the conference report filed by the Republican      leadership would not clear the Senate in its current form  I joined      Senator Sununu in urging a three month extension to work out a      better bill  and our bill has been gathering more and more      bipartisan support ever since then  Our bill now has 47 cosponsors       and it has support beyond those who have cosponsored it   Every single      Senator    Republican and Democratic    voted in July to mend and      extend the existing PATRIOT Act  That bipartisan solution was cast      aside by the Bush Administration and Republican congressional      leaders when they hijacked the conference report  rewrote the bill      in ways that fell short in protecting basic civil liberties  and      then tried to ram it through Congress as an all or nothing      proposition  Now we have a      clear majority of the Senate  Republican and Democrats  coming      together in this letter to ask the Majority Leader to take up the      short term extension  These are Senators who voted for cloture and      Senators who voted against cloture in an effort to improve the      long term extension of the PATRIOT Act  These are Republicans and      Democrats   The President       his assistants and his partys chairman are throwing around a lot of      insults and so far have refused to allow an extension of the PATRIOT      Act  They have called our bipartisan group of senators      irresponsible for trying to make the bill better  What IS      irresponsible is for the Bush Administration and some congressional      leaders to threaten to allow the PATRIOT Act to expire  What is      wrong is for the White House to manipulate this into a partisan      fight for its partisan political advantage   No Democratic      Senator opposes extending the PATRIOT Act  All of the 52 Senators      who signed this letter urge its extension   In fact  it is      Republicans who control the White House  who control the House and      who control the Senate  If the PATRIOT Act expires  it is on their      watch and under their hand  If the PATRIOT Act expires  it is      because they refuse to accept the commonsense way out that a      bipartisan majority of Senators has offered them  Instead of      playing partisan politics  the Bush Administration and Republican      congressional leaders should join in trying to improve the law   The White Houses      partisan attacks unavoidably beg several key questions  Why NOT      make the extra effort to produce a balanced PATRIOT Act and a      consensus PATRIOT Act  As we work to balance our security needs      with Americans civil liberties  shouldnt a balanced  consensus      PATRIOT Act be our goal  Isnt that a wiser  nobler and healthier      course for our democracy than threatening to cook up partisan attack      ads against those who want a better bill  There is no reason why      the American people cannot have a PATRIOT Act that is both effective      and that adequately protects their rights and their privacy    Our nation is a      democracy  founded on the principles of balanced government  We      need to restore checks and balances in this country to protect us      all and all that we hold dear  All Americans need to take notice      and need to demand that their liberties be maintained  We can do      better  and we must do better for the American people
