       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Judge Terrence Boyle                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Hearing Before The Judiciary Committee        On The Nomination Of Judge Terrence Boyle        March 3  2005  The Committee meets today for its second        controversial nominations hearing in three days to consider a circuit court        nomination that comes to us laden with questions and opposition and        concern  Chairman Specter is holding this hearing today on the        renomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the U S  Court of Appeals for the        Fourth Circuit    During the last four years the Republican        majority bent or broke virtually every previous practice and rule to try to        force through this Presidents divisive judicial nominees in a bid to        transform the federal bench into an arm of the Republican Party  In        contrast  the prior Republican leadership assiduously respected every        Republican objection to President Clintons moderate judicial nominees and        prevented more than 60 from being considered  blocking them with pocket        filibusters  Judge Boyle has the distinction of being so controversial        that his was the only circuit court nomination of President Bush on which        the former Republican leadership balked at a hearing    Unlike the many anonymous Republican holds        and pocket filibusters that kept scores of President Clintons qualified        judicial nominees from moving forward  Senator Edwards opposition to the        elevation of Judge Boyle to the Fourth Circuit was not kept secret  His        reasons for openly opposing Judge Boyle remain as compelling today as they        were when he resolutely represented the people of North        Carolina on this Committee and in the Senate  He wrote to Senator Hatch in        2003   As a        North Carolina Senator  I am very familiar with this record  Judge Boyles        decisions have been reversed or vacated more than one hundred times  Two        of these rulings were by the United States Supreme Court  one by a        unanimous vote  Judge Boyles record on civil rights is particularly        troubling  In numerous cases he has inaccurately interpreted the law in a        way that undercuts basic civil rights protections    The        history of filling vacancies on the Fourth Circuit has been a difficult one        these last several years  Senator Helms blocked numerous qualified        nominees from North Carolina and even from Virginia         Republicans would not cooperate in elevating any of the outstanding        African American nominees to the Fourth Circuit throughout President        Clintons two terms  Senator Edwards was mindful of that  He worked hard        to find a way and due to his extraordinary efforts  he succeeded in having        Judge Allyson Duncan appointed to the Fourth Circuit to fill one of the        many seats from North Carolina that Republicans had intentionally kept        vacant    I also        want to commend Senator Warner for his efforts and Senator Allen for his        help in getting Judge Roger Gregory of Virginia confirmed to        a lifetime appointment to the Fourth Circuit  the first African American to        serve on that circuit  Judge Gregory had been nominated by President        Clinton  but the Republican majority refused to consider his nomination        and  instead  relied upon Senator Helms objection  Senator Warner and        Senator Robb both supported his nomination  and Senator Allen did as well        during his campaign and after his election to the Senate  They deserve        great credit for Judge Gregory becoming the first African American to be        confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the Fourth Circuit  I know this        nomination well  I chaired this Committee when Judge Gregory was finally        given a hearing and when the Senate confirmed him in 2001    During my 17 months as Chairman  we were able        to break through the logjam on the Fourth Circuit that Republicans had        constructed  The Senate confirmed two nominees of President Bush to the        Fourth Circuit  Roger Gregory of Virginia  and Dennis Shedd        of South Carolina  It was when Democrats were in the Senate majority that        we broke that pattern of Republican obstruction  In addition to Judge        Gregory  I proceeded with the controversial nomination of Judge Shedd  He         too  was given a hearing  Committee consideration and Senate consideration        and  although he was a divisive nominee with an uneven record  he was        confirmed by the Senate  That effort at reconciliation  as with all of our        Democratic efforts  was not reciprocated  Instead  Republicans chose to        excoriate me for the timing of the process    Democratic action stands in stark contrast to        the way the Republican Senate obstructed President Clintons nominees to        this circuit  when six circuit court nominees were blocked by Republicans         Judge James Beaty did not get a hearing or a vote from the Judiciary        Committee in 1995  1996  1997 or 1998  Judge James Wynn did not get a        hearing or a vote in 1995 or 1996  Judge James Wynn did not get a hearing        or a vote in 1999  2000  or the beginning of 2001  Judge Roger Gregory did        not get a hearing or a vote in 2000 or the beginning of 2001  when he was a       Clinton nominee  Neither Judge Andre Davis nor Elizabeth        Gibson got hearings or votes in 2000  Not one of these six circuit court        nominees ever got a hearing or a vote in this Committee when the Republican        majority stalled so many outstanding  qualified judicial nominees during        the last six years of the Clinton Administration    Others may recite partisan talking points        seeking to rewrite Senate history on its treatment of judicial nominations         but these are the facts and the background that bring us to todays        consideration of Judge Boyles nomination  I hope we will not have to        endure the erroneous claim that Judge Boyle has been denied a hearing for        14 years  Those who make the charge know full well that Republicans have        been in charge of this Committee for the most recent years  and for a        majority of those 14 years no nomination was pending for this controversial        nominee    Judge Boyle was nominated to the Fourth        Circuit at the end of 1991  when the White House of President George H W         Bush was refusing to give Senators access to nominees FBI files  as        Chairman Biden noted at the time  The process was restored in the spring        of 1992  Despite the obstruction of the process by the Republican White        House  the Senate confirmed 66 judicial nominees in 1992  including 11        circuit court nominees  A Democratic Senate majority proceeded in that        presidential election year  when the Thurmond Rule was traditionally used        by Republicans to shut down the confirmation process  to confirm more        judicial nominees than the Republican Senate majority confirmed in any one        of the six years it was responsible for reviewing President Clintons        judicial nominees  Any time the Senate confirms that many judges in a year        it is working at an exceptionally fast pace  I know  When I chaired the        Committee and the Senate confirmed 72 judges in 2002 and 100 in 17 months         we worked exceptionally hard  Chairman Biden did an exceptional job and        acted in an extraordinarily bipartisan way  His efforts were not        reciprocated when Republicans assumed control of the process and could have        worked more cooperatively with a Democratic President    In the early 1990s the Senate was working        hard to fill judicial vacancies and to fill the scores of additional        judgeships recently created  Under the Thurmond Rule  which was honored by        Republicans until last year  only uncontroversial nominees or nominees with        bipartisan consent were considered and confirmed in presidential election        years  Judge Boyle was hardly uncontroversial  He was not among the        historically high 66 judges confirmed in 1992  As  The Los Angeles Times reported          D uring his last months in office  the senior Bush nominated Judge        Terrence Boyle  a prot  g   of Sen  Jesse Helms  R N C    to the U S  4th        Circuit Court of Appeals  But his nomination never got a hearing  In        retaliation   Senator  Helms vetoed all of Clinton s nominees from North        Carolina to the 4th Circuit  including three African Americans  The        Republican Chairman of the Judiciary Committee respected Senator Helms        objections to African Americans Judge Beaty and Judge Wynn as well as        federal Bankruptcy Judge J  Rich Leonard of Raleigh  a former federal        magistrate and clerk of court for the Eastern District of North Carolina         even though their records were beyond reproach   Despite these actions by Senator        Helms and by Senate Republicans  despite the change in position by        Republicans  who used to argue that the D C  Circuit and the Fourth Circuit        and the Sixth Circuit did not need more judges when a Democratic President        was doing the nominating  Democrats have worked with        President Bush to confirm nominees to these vacancies  some of which were        deliberately maintained for years by Republican obstruction  Democrats        worked to break the Republican logjam of confirmations to the Fourth        Circuit  the Sixth Circuit and the D C  Circuit  The caseload of the        Fourth Circuit is almost the same now as it was when it had five vacancies        and Chief Judge J  Harvie Wilkinson opined against adding more judges to        his court  Thanks to Democrats bipartisan cooperation on President Bushs        nominees to the Fourth Circuit  the court now has more judges than it did        then          President Bush spoke eloquently about the fundamental requirements of a        democratic society when he met recently with President Putin of  Russia  He acknowledged that we rely on the sharing of power  on        checks and balances  on an independent court system  on the protection of        minority rights  and on safeguarding human rights and human dignity  I        agree with him  He recently promised the American people in a radio        address that he would serve all Americans and would work to promote the        unity of our great nation  I commend that thought and hope that he will        work to fulfill that promise  His renomination of controversial judicial        nominees is inconsistent with that promise and undercuts the fundamentals        that protect our democracy    At the        outset of this Congress  the Senate Democratic Leader reached out to the        President  as I have for the last four years  and urged him to work with us        on lifetime judicial appointments  Just this week  Senator Salazar wrote        to the President urging him to work with us to find common ground and        consensus nominees  He offered President Bush some wise counsel noting        that the decision to re nominate these individuals will undoubtedly create        the animosity and divisiveness between the President and the Unites States        Senate as an institution that is not helpful to our Nation and will        sidetrack our collective efforts to work on other crucial matters           The        confrontational approach of this Administration is unnecessary and unwise         Senate Republicans insistence that this President be given carte blanche        in his efforts to pack the federal courts and that the Senate become a        rubber stamp and give up its distinctive protection of minority rights is        shortsighted at best  It is most unfortunate that this White House        persists in its single minded effort to pack the federal courts  It is        unfortunate that the Senate Republican leadership is acting as an arm of        the Administration rather than on behalf of the Senate and providing the        checks and balances on which our democracy and our freedoms depend     That        brings us to this difficult hearing on controversial nominations  Over the        last several days we have heard from opponents of Judge Boyles nomination        that include groups and citizens from North Carolina concerned about his        record on the District Court  and by people who have followed his career or        been affected by his rulings  I have a numbers of letters from groups of        police officers  for example    many  from North Carolina           who are emphatically opposed to Judge Boyles confirmation to the Fourth        Circuit  There is a letter from the North Carolina Police Benevolent        Association  the North Carolina Troopers Association  Police Benevolent        Associations from South Carolina  Virginia and Alabama  the National        Association of Police Organizations  and the Professional Fire Fighters and        Paramedics of North Carolina  These are not the typical opponents of        judicial nominees  They have come forward to oppose this nomination    In        addition  there is deep opposition from those interested in civil rights         disability rights  womens rights  the environment and many other issues         This home state opposition is something this Committee needs to consider         It signals to me that there may be serious problems with this nomination
