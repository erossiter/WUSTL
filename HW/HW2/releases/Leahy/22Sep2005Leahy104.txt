       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts    Jr  To Be Chief Justice Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts  Jr        To Be Chief Justice Of The United States      Executive Business Meeting Of the Judiciary Committee      September 22  2005  There are few decisions we face in       the Senate that are as consequential and enduring as the one       this Committee considers today  I believe that each Senator       must carefully weigh the matter and decide it for himself or       herself   I have approached the nomination       of Judge Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States with       an open mind  I have served in the Senate for three decades and       on this Committee for most of that time  I am one vote out of       100  but I recognize that those 100 of us privileged to serve in       the Senate are entrusted with protecting the rights of 280       million of our fellow citizens  There is no entitlement to       confirmation for lifetime appointments on any court for any       nomination by a president  Democratic or Republican  This       nomination presents a close question for me  for the reasons I       discussed at greater length on the Senate floor yesterday   I want a Supreme Court that acts       in its finest tradition as a source of justice  The Supreme       Court must be an institution where the Bill of Rights and human       dignity are honored    I have not reflexively opposed       Republican nominees or conservative judicial nominees nominated       by Republican presidents  I have drawn the line only at those       nominees who were among the most ideologically extreme and who       came to us in the mold of activists    I do note my extreme       disappointment in the Administrations lack of cooperation with       the Senate on this nomination  Although we started off well       with some early efforts at consultation  it never resulted in       any meaningful discussions  The Presidents naming of Judge       Roberts as his choice to replace Justice OConnor came as a       surprise  not as a result of meaningful consultation  He then       preemptively announced that he had decided to withdraw that       nomination and  instead  nominated Judge Roberts to succeed       Chief Justice Rehnquist  There could and should have been       consultation with the Senate on the nomination of someone to       serve as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States          Yesterday Chairman Specter and I        along with the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate        met with the President about a possible replacement for Justice       OConnor  I trust that this time the President will follow       through  share with us his intentions and seek our advice before       he acts    The Bush Administration committed       another disservice to this nomination by withholding information       that has traditionally been shared with the Senate  The Bush       Administration treated Senators requests for information with       little respect  They stonewalled entirely the narrowly tailored       request for the most important work papers from John Robertss       time as the principal deputy to Kenneth Starr at the Solicitor       Generals office  The precedent from Chief Justice Rehnquists       hearing and others  of course  go the other way  Previous       Presidents have paid the appropriate respect to the Senate and       to the constitutional process by working with the Committee to       provide such materials  Accordingly  I would understand if a       Senator were to vote against the Presidents nomination of Judge       Roberts on this basis alone  I urge the Administration to work       with us and cooperate on any future nomination    Some Republican Senators also       disserved the confirmation process by urging the nominee not to       answer questions during the course of this hearing        Unfortunately  Judge Roberts heeded that advice to too great a       degree and should have been more forthcoming in his answers    The President asked for dignified       hearings and an up or down vote  That is what we have done on       this Committee  The hearings were dignified and they were       fair    I thank and commend the public       witnesses who appeared before the Committee  They were       extraordinarily helpful in underscoring what is at stake for all       Americans with these nominations  No one who heard Congressman       John Lewis  Wade Henderson and Judge Nathaniel Jones can doubt       the fundamental importance of our refusal to retreat from our       Nations commitment to civil rights  Coach Roderick Jackson and       Beverly Jones reminded us how courageous Americans are still       opening doors and righting wrongs through our courts  Anne       Marie Talman of MALDEF reflected what is at stake when       undocumented immigrant children are denied education and       benefits that should be available to every child in America         As I consider this nomination  I       reflect on the hearings and my meetings with Judge Roberts  In       particular  I was encouraged by his answer to my question about       providing the fifth vote needed to stay an execution when four       other Justices vote to review a capital case  That has not       always been the practice of late and he was right to recognize       the illogic  if not the injustice  of having the necessary votes       to review the case but lacking the necessary vote to allow that       review to take place especially where a life hangs in the       balance    Judge Roberts testified about his       admiration for Justice Robert Jackson  Justice Jacksons       protection of fundamental rights  including unpopular speech       under the First Amendment  and his willingness to serve as a       check on presidential authority are among the finest actions by       any Justice in our history  I expect Judge Roberts to act in       the tradition of Justice Jackson and serve as an independent       check on the President  When he joins the Supreme Court he can       no longer simply defer to presidential authority  We know that       we are in a period in which the Executive has a complicit and       compliant Republican Congress that refuses to serve as a check       or balance  Without the courts to fulfill that constitutional       role  excess will continue  and the balance will be tilted         When Congress acts to protect the       interests of Americans through the Commerce Clause  spending       powers and the 14th Amendment  that needs to be       respected  I am encouraged by Judge Robertss assurances that       he will respect congressional authority  His steadfast reliance       on the Supreme Courts recent Raich decision as significant       precedent contravening further implications from Lopez and       Morrison was intended to reassure us that he will not join the       assault on congressional authority  I heard him and rely on him       to be true to the impression that he created   At the hearing  he took pains to       assure me and Senator Feinstein  among others  that as Chief       Justice he would respect congressional authority  To do       otherwise would greatly undermine Congresss ability to serve       the interests of Americans and protect the environment  ensure       equal justice  and provide health care and other basic       benefits  I think he knows that now    As Chief Justice  John Roberts       will be responsible for the way in which the judicial branch       administers justice for all Americans  He must know in his core       that the words engraved in the Vermont marble on the Supreme       Court building are not just Under Law but Equal Justice under       Law  It is not just the rule of law that he must serve  but       the cause of justice under our great charter    After hours of private meetings       with Judge Roberts and hours of public testimony  I am called       upon to cast a vote on this important nomination  In my       judgment  in my experience  but especially in my conscience  I       find it is better to vote yes than no  Ultimately my Vermont       roots have always told me to go with my conscience     Judge Roberts is a man of       integrity  I take him at his word that he does not have an       ideological agenda  For me  a vote to confirm requires faith       that the words he spoke to us have meaning  I take him at his       word that he will steer the court to serve as an appropriate       check on potential abuses of presidential power     I respect those who have come to       different conclusions  and I readily acknowledge the unknowable       at this moment  that perhaps they are right and I am wrong        Only time will tell    The Senate will vote next week but       only later will we know if Judge Roberts proves to be the kind       of Chief Justice he says he will be  if he truly will be his       own man  I hope and trust that he will be
