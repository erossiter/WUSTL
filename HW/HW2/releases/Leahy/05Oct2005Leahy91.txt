       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The McCain Amendment To The   Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On The McCain Amendment Number 1977 To H R  2863      Defense Department FY2006 Appropriations Bill     October 5  2005 MR  PRESIDENT  I      strongly support Senator McCains amendment to provide clear      guidance for the treatment of detainees in U S  custody  This      Administration has steadfastly refused to address the black mark on      our Nation caused by its interrogation policies and the resulting      abuse of detainees  Congress needs to take action   Our credibility      and reputation as a world leader in human rights suffers from our      unwillingness to openly address the flaws in our system  More      importantly  the failure to provide clear guidance on the treatment      of detainees puts our own troops at risk and undermines their      efforts in Afghanistan and Iraq  I commend my colleagues across the      aisle who are attempting to address this problem  despite resistance      from members of their own party and the strong opposition of the      White House  The President has threatened to veto any legislation      that would regulate the treatment of detainees  claiming that it      would impinge on his Commander in Chief authority  I fail to see      how a bill requiring the humane treatment of detainees  the same      treatment the President claims they now receive  would impinge on      his authority in any way   It is Congresss      right under the Constitution to issue regulations governing the      armed forces  This was something I asked Chief Justice Roberts at      his confirmation hearings  and he agreed that Congress can make      rules that may impinge upon the Presidents command functions  He      answered  Certainly     the Constitution vests pertinent authority      in  this  area in both branches  The President is the      Commander in Chief     On the other hand  Congress has the authority      to issue regulations governing the armed forces  another express      provision in the Constitution   Senator Graham      said on the floor this morning that  Congress has been AWOL when it      comes to the war on terror in terms of interrogation  detention and      prosecution  and weve done it in a way to weaken our Nation  I      agree with my friend  the senator from South Carolina  Without      congressional action  the problem of prisoner abuse will continue to      fester   We continue to      learn of abuses from press reports and the court ordered release of      government documents in response to Freedom of Information Act  FOIA       litigation  Documents that were recently made public by the FOIA      case demonstrate why Senator McCains amendment is necessary       These documents      reveal a troubling pattern of abuses that occurred because soldiers      did not know what was acceptable under this Administrations vague      detention and interrogation policies  Several of the documents are      transcriptions of interviews of military personnel in Iraq that show      a systematic failure of the Pentagon to properly train soldiers on      how to treat detainees  One report describes soldiers who  because      of a lack of guidance and training from their command  engaged in      interrogations using techniques they literally remembered from      movies  Another document describes the shooting of an Iraqi      detainee in U S  custody  The report concludes that this incident      could have been prevented if  the soldier  had better training       Another report       released last week by Human Rights Watch and based on firsthand      accounts of soldiers in the 82nd Airborne Division  details the      widespread abuse of Iraqi detainees by soldiers at Camp Mercury  a      forward operating base near Falluja  Iraq  The report states that      detainees were severely beaten and mistreated from 2003 through      2004  even after the photos from Abu Ghraib became public  The      witnesses claim that detainees were abused at the request of      military intelligence personnel as part of the interrogation      process  but also claim that the abuse occurred simply as a way for      troops to relieve stress  One soldier allegedly broke a      detainees leg with a baseball bat  In another incident  detainees      were stacked into human pyramids and denied food and water  It is      time for this Administration to finally acknowledge that such      incidents were not the isolated acts of a few bad apples  These      horrific acts were not isolated incidents on the night shift at Abu      Ghraib  Unfortunately  similar acts occurred at locations      throughout Iraq and Afghanistan  A group of 28      senior military officers  including General John Shalikashvili       recently wrote to Senator McCain in support of his amendments      addressing detainee treatment  That letter stated  The abuse of      prisoners hurts Americas cause in the war on terror  endangers U S       service members who might be captured by the enemy  and is anathema      to the values Americans have held dear for generations   Our      service members were denied clear guidance  and left to take the      blame when things went wrong  They deserve better than that  I      hope the President will consider these words before he vetoes a bill      that contains Senator McCains amendment
