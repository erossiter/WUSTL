       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Introduction Of The Intellectual   Property Enforcement Bill Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy  On Introduction Of The      Intellectual Property Enforcement Bill Of 2007  November 7  2007    I am     pleased to introduce the Intellectual Property Enforcement Act of 2007      Congress is charged to promote the progress of science and useful     arts  and part of promotion is protection  This legislation will     enhance existing intellectual property enforcement laws  provide more     resources to combat infringement  and harmonize copyright and trademark     laws  I thank Senator Cornyn for joining me in this effort  which is a     high priority of mine  and also of the creative communities and     industries across the county      Each     year  counterfeiting and copyright infringement cost the U S  economy     billions of dollars  The International Anti Counterfeiting Coalition     estimates that counterfeiting and piracy cost American businesses  250     billion a year  and hundreds of thousands of jobs as well  Clearly  IP     theft is big business  and that can devastate small businesses  No one     knows this better than Vermont companies such as Hubbardton Forge      Vermont Teddy Bear Company  and Burton Snowboards  Each of these     companies  and many others like them across the nation  invests time      money  and effort in the development of new products  When their     products are infringed  it devalues the product and threatens the     company          Senator Cornyn and I have heard from a myriad of interested parties     about the importance of protecting intellectual property  and have seen     many enforcement proposals  The legislation we introduce today will     serve as the core of our legislative effort this year  It will start     the process of considering how to ensure that our enforcement laws are     up to the task  and that the necessary resources are in place to enforce     them  Other Senators have introduced legislation to address these     issues  and the Department of Justice and others have suggested     legislative language  These are all helpful to the debate  and I expect     there will be more to come  Introduction of the Intellectual Property     Enforcement Act of 2007 is the beginning of this important effort     The     centerpiece of the bill we introduce today gives the Department of     Justice the ability to bring civil actions against copyright     infringers  Punishment should fit the crime  and a civil action is     often more appropriate to the wrong being done in such cases than is     criminal prosecution  This concept has passed the Senate on three     separate occasions  as the PIRATE Act  Next  this bill adds resources     for agents to combat infringement  It does not matter how strong our     laws are  if there are not enough agents  or if our agents do not have     the proper expertise to investigate and prosecute crimes  piracy will     flourish and harm our economy  Third  this bill allows for harmless     errors on copyright registration forms  Copyright registration should     not be voided by innocently checking the wrong box or misspelling a word     on a form  Finally  this bill harmonizes the forfeiture provisions in     the copyright and trademark statutes      By     enacting well balanced enforcement laws  we can protect both the     creators and the consumers of intellectual property  It is impossible     to put a price tag on creativity  but we must do all we can to protect     the fruits of creative labor       I ask unanimous consent that the     full bill text be included in the Record
