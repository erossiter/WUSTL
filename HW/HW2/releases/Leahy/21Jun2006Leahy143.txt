       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Analog Hole  Can   Congress Protect Copyright And Promote Innovation                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Hearing On The Analog Hole      Can Congress ProtectCopyrightAnd Promote Innovation      June 21  2006 I thank Chairman Specter for agreeing to      holding this hearing today  We have devoted considerable attention      in recent years to the   which will address an important issue that      this committee has spent a great deal of time on in recent years of      protecting important creative works in the digital age without      stifling the innovative technologies that deliver the digital      content of those works to consumers  Today  we turn to another      aspect of this problem  the so called analog hole  Content owners are concerned over a gap in copy      protection of their digital works  This gap  known as the analog      hole  opens up when digital input is converted into an unprotected      analog form so it can be viewed clearly on the millions of analog TV      sets in households across the country  That analog form content can      then be re converted into unprotected digital form and put on the      Internet  once digital content falls into that hole  it loses its      digital protection  The possibility that this      digital to analog back to digital transformation could facilitate      the mass indiscriminate redistribution of copyrighted video content      is certainly real  And as we have learned from past experiences       such as the unfettered illegal sharing of content over peer to peer      downloading networks that cost the copyright industries millions of      dollars  there are many reasons to work hard to end the      infringement of copyrighted goods  The theft of copyrighted works      harms consumer  threatens business  and enriches illegal      enterprises  Congress has an obligation to help ensure that      copyrights are respected and copyrighted materials are protected       nonetheless  we should be cautious about government sanctioned      technology mandates  which  at best  may be a temporary solution to      a complex problem  Technology invariably moves faster than      legislation  and for that reason  industry participants are often      better equipped to determine what will work and what consumers will      buy  The inexpert hand of government is not as effective as the      relevant markets in moving assets  and interests  to their best      uses   I am committed to finding the best solution to      this problem  and am hopeful that our discussion today is the next      important step to moving us forward to the answer  I look forward      to hearing from our witnesses and thank them in advance for their      participation
