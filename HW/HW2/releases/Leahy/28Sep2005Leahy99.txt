       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of The Vessel   Hull Design Protection Act Amendments Of 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Introduction Of The Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments      Of 2005     September 28  2005 Senator Cornyn      and I have already worked together on significant Freedom of      Information Act legislation and on counterfeiting legislation during      the first session of this Congress  Today  we are introducing      another bill and taking our partnership to the high seas  or at      least to our nations boat manufacturing industry  with the Vessel      Hull Design Protection Act Amendments of 2005   Designs of boat      vessel hulls are often the result of a great deal of time  effort       and financial investment  They are afforded intellectual property      protection under the Vessel Hull Design Protection Act that Congress      passed in 1998  This law exists for the same reason that other      works enjoy intellectual property rights  to encourage continued      innovation  to protect the works that emerge from the creative      process  and to reward the creators  Recent courtroom experience      has made it clear that the protections Congress passed seven years      ago need some statutory refinement to ensure they meet the purposes      we envisioned  The Vessel Hull Design Protection Act Amendments      shore up the law  making an important clarification about the scope      of the protections available to boat designs   We continue to be      fascinated with  and in so many ways dependent on  bodies of water       both for recreation and commerce  More than fifty percent of      Americans live on or near the coastline in this country  We seem      always to be drawn to the water  whether it is the beautiful Lake      Champlain in my home state of Vermont or the worlds large oceans       And as anyone who has visited our seaports can attest  much of our      commerce involves sea travel  I would like to thank Senators Kohl      and Hatch for cosponsoring this legislation  Protecting boat      designs and encouraging innovation in those designs are worthy aims       and I hope we can move quickly to pass this bipartisan legislation
