       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Nomination Of Michael B  Mukasey To Be   Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee   On The Nomination Of       Michael B  Mukasey       To Be Attorney General Of The United States      November 6  2007      I spoke in Vermont last Friday       about my decision to vote against the Presidents nomination  I       wish to emphasize a few important points this morning      Nothing is more fundamental to our       constitutional democracy than our basic notion that no one is       above the law  This Administration has undercut that precept       time after time  They are now trying to do it again  with an       issue as fundamental as whether the United States of America       will join the ranks of those governments that approve of       torture  This President and Vice President should not be       allowed to violate our obligations under the Convention Against       Torture and the Geneva Conventions or disregard U S  statutes       such as our Detainee Treatment Act and War Crimes Act  They       should not be allowed to overturn more than 200 years of our       Nations human rights and moral leadership around the world          The Administration has compounded       its lawlessness by cloaking its policies and miscalculations       under a veil of secrecy  leaving Congress  the courts  and the       American people in the dark about what they are doing  The       President says that we do not torture  but had his lawyers       redefine torture down in secret memos  in fundamental conflict       with American values and law     I agree with the Generals  the       Admirals  and our JAG officers that waterboarding is torture and       is illegal  If an American were waterboarded anywhere in the       world  would we have to know the circumstances and purported       justifications for it before condemning it  Of course not          Some have sought to find comfort       in Judge Mukaseys personal assurance that he would enforce a       future  new law against waterboarding if this Congress were to       pass one  Unsaid  of course  is the fact that any such       prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this       President     But the real damage of this       argument is not its futility  The real harm is that it       presupposes that we do not already have laws and treaty       obligations against waterboarding  In fact  we do  No Senator       should abet this Administrations legalistic obfuscations by       those such as Alberto Gonzales  John Yoo  and David Addington by       agreeing that the laws on the books do not already make       waterboarding illegal  We have been prosecuting water torture       for more than 100 years     When a top legal adviser at our       State Department cannot say that the waterboarding of an       American is illegal  and our State Department cannot forcefully       rule it out as a technique that might be okay for other       countries foreign intelligence services to use against U S        citizens  we see how far wrong this Administration has headed        When asked at a recent public debate whether he could imagine       any circumstance in which waterboarding could be justified on an       American national by a foreign intelligence service  John       Bellinger of the State Department said  one would have to apply       the facts to the law and when pressed he said that he was not       willing to include it or exclude it and that he did not want       to get involved in abstract discussions  That is so wrong       that it is chilling        When it comes to our core values        the things that make our country great and that define Americas       place in the world  it does not depend on the circumstances        America  the great and good Nation that has been a beacon to the       world on human rights  does not torture and should stand against       torture        That is not what America stands       for  Indeed  the better example is set by the Army Field       Manual  which instructs our forces to consider how we would       react if what a soldier was about to do to someone was done to       an American soldier        In their recent letter to the       nominee  Senators Warner  McCain  and Graham recognize  as I do       and as I hope all Senators do  that  Waterboarding  under any       circumstances  represents a clear violation of U S  law          Finally  when the Administration       and others say that we cannot say whether America waterboards       people because it would tip off our enemies  they have it       precisely wrong  That is about as effective as Saddam Hussein       hinting that he had weapons of mass destruction when he did not       in order to impress his enemies  In refusing to say that we do       not waterboard prisoners  we give license to others  When the       United States cannot state clearly that waterboarding is torture       and illegal and will not be tolerated  what does that mean for       other governments  and what comfort does that provide the       worlds most repressive regimes     I wish that I could support Judge       Mukaseys nomination  I like Michael Mukasey  But this is an       Administration that has been acting outside the law and an       Administration that has now created a confirmation       contortion  When many of us voted to confirm General Petreas        the Administration turned around and  for political advantage        tried to claim that when we voted to confirm the nominee  we       also voted for the Presidents war policies  Just as I do not       support this Presidents Iraq policy  I do not support his       torture policy or his views of unaccountability or unlimited       Executive power        No one is more eager to restore       strong leadership and independence to the Department of Justice       than I  What we need most right now is an Attorney General who       believes and understands that there must be limitations on       Executive power  America needs to be certain of the bedrock       principles in our laws and our values that no President and no       American can be authorized to violate  Accordingly  I vote no       on the Presidents nomination
