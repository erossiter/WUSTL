       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  A Tribute To The Nepali People                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     A Tribute To The Nepali People MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  I want to speak briefly about recent events in Nepal       As Senators are      aware  last February 1st King Gyanendra seized absolute      power  dissolved the multi party government  and imprisoned his      political opponents  He justified his power grab as necessary to      bring peace and democracy to that impoverished Himalayan nation that      has been in the throes of a bloody conflict with Maoist insurgents      for a decade   Yet  as many      predicted  in the past year the Maoists have gained strength while      Nepals fledgling democratic institutions have been badly weakened       Finally recognizing that the Kings real purpose was to consolidate      his own power and take the country back to the feudal days of his      father  the people lost patience   Over the past few      weeks  hundreds of thousands of Nepali citizens took to the streets      in a show of defiance and braved bullets  clubs and tear gas to      force the King to back down   Tomorrow  Nepals      Parliament will reconvene and it is expected to begin discussion of      a date for the election of a constituent assembly to draft a new      constitution  Among the key issues to be addressed is what role  if      any  the monarchy will have in Nepals democratic future  Another      necessary step will be to guarantee the armys subservience to      civilian authority  Mr  President  I      want to pay tribute to the people of Nepal  They have suffered for      generations from poverty  discrimination  corruption and      repression  Yet through it all they have persevered  and they have      shown that not even the most recalcitrant despot who uses the      national army as his own palace guard can withstand the will of the      people when they are prepared to risk their lives for freedom  Today  Nepal      begins a new chapter in its history  The future is far from certain      and the road ahead is filled with potential pitfalls  But no one      can doubt the opportunity that this moment offers  nor the      importance of what is at stake for Nepal   It is up to      Nepals political parties  whose leaders have too often put their      own personal ambitions ahead of the good of the country  to show      that they have a practical vision for the future and that they can      govern  In a democracy that means dialogue  it means tolerance  it      means compromise  it means acting in good faith as representatives      of the people  it means keeping ones commitments  and it means      being willing to step aside for the next generation when it is their      turn  The Maoists must      also recognize that the Nepali peoples foremost desire is peace       The Maoists have announced another ceasefire  which is welcome  but      there is no justification for any return to violence  Too many      innocent people have died and too many Nepali families have suffered      needlessly  It is time for the Maoists to renounce violence and      join in a national dialogue to restore democracy and develop a      strategy to address the root causes of the conflict   The international      community  particularly India  the United States  Great Britain       China  and the United Nations  also have an important role to play      in supporting Nepal at this critical time  Like Afghanistan  East      Timor  and other unstable countries emerging from years of conflict       Nepal will need technical assistance for the election of a      constituent assembly and the drafting of a new constitution  It      will need international monitors of the ceasefire and of the      observance of human rights by both Maoists and the army  It will      need resources to help build the institutions of democracy and to      hold accountable those on both sides of the conflict who are      responsible for atrocities   During the five      years of his troubled rein  King Gyanendra took Nepal to the brink      of disaster  He stubbornly ignored the pleas of Nepals friends       He shamelessly used the army to trample on the peoples cherished      rights  He squandered his opportunity to continue on the path of      his predecessor to nurture democracy and help guide Nepal into the      21st Century   The Nepali      people  15 of whom gave their lives in the protests  want nothing      less than a democratic future  They want a government that respects      the worth of every Nepali  regardless of the family they come from       their ethnicity  religion  gender or profession  It is time for      Nepals leaders to show that they are worthy of the Nepali peoples      confidence and support
