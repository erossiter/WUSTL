       Closing Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of John G    Roberts  Jr  To Be Chief Justice Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Closing Remarks Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of John G  Roberts  Jr        To Be Chief Justice Of The United States      Senate Floor      September 29  2005  As we come to the conclusion of       these confirmation proceedings I commend Senators on both sides       of the aisle for taking the time and making the effort to       actively participate in this process  Few duties and few votes       are as enduring and as consequential as deciding on a nomination       for the premier jurist in our federal court system  We have had       43 Presidents in our nations history  but only 16 Chief       Justices of the       United States    We have had full and fair hearings       and a constructive debate  This process has been a credit to       the Senate and to the Judiciary Committee  and I commend       especially Chairman Specter and all of the members of the       Committee and their staffs for the detailed and sometimes       grueling preparation that evaluating a Supreme Court nomination       requires  For two months  the Committees Democratic staff       has labored dutifully and with professionalism and helped       Senators in our review of this important nomination  And their       experience was duplicated by the hard working Republican staff   The minority party has a vital       role in our system that often is less visible but is crucial       just the same  The minority sharpens the Senates and the       publics focus on issues that come before the Senate  or        sometimes  on unattended issues that deserve the Senates       attention  In these proceedings  we have helped sharpen the       Senates focus on issues that matter most in the decision before       us  that of confirming a new Chief Justice of the  United States   I want especially to commend the       Senators on this side of the aisle for taking this       responsibility so dutifully  for waiting to hear the evidence       and to learn the particulars about this nomination and for not       rushing to judgment  Individual senators now have weighed the       evidence and have come to their individual conclusions  This       will not be a lockstep vote on this side of the aisle   I appreciate the thoughtful       remarks by those who have decided to vote in favor of       confirmation and by those who have decided to vote against  I       respect the decisions of Senators who have come to different       conclusions on this nomination  I know for many  including       myself  it was a close question and a difficult decision  I       have said that each Senator must carefully weigh this matter and       decide it for himself or herself  We are  each of us  one vote       out of 100  entrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million       of our fellow citizens  And what a somber and humbling       responsibility we have in casting this vote    I was glad to hear the Republican       Leader say earlier this week that a judge must jettison politics       in order to be a fair jurist  He is right  I thought the       remarks of the senior Senator from  Maine were especially meaningful        and I appreciated that she was careful to include judicial       philosophy among the criteria she considered on this       nomination  She is right    As the Senate considers a       nomination  it is important to have more information  rather       than less  about a nominees approach to the law and about his       or her judicial philosophy  For the American people  whose       lives will be directly and indirectly affected by the decisions       of a nominee  it is equally important that the Senates review       process be fair  that it be transparent  and that it be       thorough  The hearings we conduct and the debates we hold are       the best and only opportunity for the American people to hear       from and learn about the person who could have significant       influence over their constitutional protections and freedoms        We owe the people we represent a vigorous and open review        including forthright answers to questions     My   Vermont roots have always told me to       go with my conscience  and that is what I have done in this       decision  Judge Roberts is a man of integrity  For me  a vote       to confirm requires faith that the words he spoke to the       Judiciary Committee in the hearings and to me in our meetings       have meaning  I take him at his word that he does not have an       ideological agenda and that he will be his own man as Chief       Justice  I take him at his word that he will steer the Court so       it will serve as an appropriate check on potential abuses of       presidential power  today  and tomorrow  I hope that he will        and I trust that he will    As we close the debate on this       nomination and move to a vote  we do so knowing that we soon       will be considering another Supreme Court nominee here in the       Senate  Last week Chairman Specter and I  along with the       Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate  met with the       President  I urged him to follow through with meaningful       consultation  I urged him to share with us his intentions and       seek our advice on the next nomination before he acts    There could and should have been       consultation with the Senate on the nomination of someone to       serve as the 17th Chief Justice of the  United States  There was not        There could and should be meaningful consultation on the person       to be named to succeed Justice OConnor  for what has so often       been the decisive vote on the Supreme Court  The stakes for all       Americans and for the Nations well being are high as the       President contemplates his second pick for a justice on the       nations highest court  a choice that will fill a swing vote       that could steer the Courts direction for years to come   The President has an opportunity       to work with us to unite this country around a nominee to       succeed Justice O Connor  Now more than ever  with Americans       fighting and dying in  Iraq every day  and hundreds of       thousands of Americans displaced by disasters here at home  it       is a time to unite rather than divide  The Supreme Court       belongs to all Americans  not to any faction  For the sake of       the Nation  I urge the President to live up to his original       promise to be a uniter and not a divider
