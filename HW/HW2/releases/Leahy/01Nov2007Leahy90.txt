       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Nomination Of Julie L  Myers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On The Nomination Of Julie L  Myers  Executive Business Meeting     November 1  2007     I hope we can report Julie Myers      nomination to the full Senate  Her nomination was held over last      week  and the Committee has retained jurisdiction until November 2       But before the Committee acts on the nomination  I will take a      moment to express my hopefulness that if Ms  Myers is confirmed       she will work hard to address some serious concerns that I have      about Immigration and Customs Enforcements  ICE  conduct in the      enforcement of immigration law       I have been concerned about media reports and recent litigation that      has highlighted the inadequate standards at detention facilities run      by ICE  These facilities house both asylum seekers and children and      families  along with other detainees  A settlement in August  which      came about as the result of litigation on behalf of a number of      children housed at the Hutto facility in Texas  has forced some      positive changes  Conditions at the Texas facility were found to be      below minimum standards  where children were reportedly separated      from their parents as a disciplinary measure  and required services      were severely lacking  I am pleased this settlement agreement was      reached  and I am hopeful that Ms  Myers will make it a priority to      work toward ensuring that those in ICEs custody are treated with      dignity and respect so that future litigation can be avoided  I am      also hopeful that Ms  Myers will look for alternatives to      incarceration for families and children who the Department of      Homeland Security determines warrant detention  The incarceration      of children is something that should be avoided if at all possible       I am also concerned about reports of detainees dying in custody from      lack of adequate medical care  The New York Times reported      on June 26  2007 that since 2004  62 people in ICEs custody had      died  some as the result of inadequate medical care  It is hard to      imagine why any person in the custody of the United States should      die for lack of medical services or as the result of any other      preventable situation  With growing rates of detention as a result      of the Administrations stepped up immigration enforcement  these      issues will persist  I hope Ms  Myers will devote appropriate      energy and resources to ensuring that all those in custody are      treated consistent with American values  The treatment of asylum      seekers and others in United States custody sends a powerful message      to the world  and I urge Ms  Myers to make sure that message is a      positive one      Just last month  the Committee on Homeland      Security and Governmental Affairs approved this nomination  I      expect that we will approve Ms  Myers nomination today  I look      forward to continuing to work with her and her agency  and helping      to improve their enforcement and detention operations to ensure that      the United States Government honors its humanitarian      responsibilities
