       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Strengthening FISA                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                      Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Strengthening      FISA  Does The Protect America Act     Protect Americans  Civil Liberties And Enhance Security      September 25  2007     The Committee holds this hearing today      to consider the Protect America Act  passed in haste in early      August    Congressional leaders went to      extraordinary lengths earlier this summer to provide the flexibility      Director McConnell said was needed to fix a legal problem with      surveillance of targets overseas  I supported a change to FISA  as      I have done several times since 9 11  The Rockefeller Levin      legislative proposal that many of us voted for would have eliminated      the need to get individual probable cause determinations for      surveillance of overseas targets  That bill addressed the concern      that had been raised by an opinion of the FISA Court  and it      satisfied what the Administration said was needed in that time of      heightened concern  Yet  Director McConnell and the Administration      rejected that legislation  We need to find out why   I do not know who Director McConnell      is referring to in his written testimony when he says that he has      heard a number of individuals       assert that there really was no      substantial threat to our nation  I trust that he is not referring      to any Senator serving on this Committee  Let me be clear  Every      single Senator understands the grave threats to our Nation  Every      Senator wants us to be able to conduct surveillance effectively       Every Senator on this Committee voted to give him the flexibility he      said he needed  I hope we will not hear anymore irresponsible      rhetoric about congressional inquiries risking Americans safety       We all want Americans to be safe  Our job is to protect Americans      security and Americans rights    The Protect American Act provides      sweeping new powers to the Government to engage in surveillance       without a warrant  of international calls to and from the United      States and potentially much more  It does this  in the view of      many  without providing any meaningful check or protection for the      privacy and civil liberties of the Americans who are on those calls       We are asked to trust that the Government will not misuse its      authority  When the issue is giving muscular new powers to      government  just trust us is not enough   Fortunately  those temporary      provisions contain a sunset  We meet today to consider real issues      and concerns with this legislation  Let us not engage in the      high pitched rhetoric that plays on peoples fears and prevents real      progress    The FISA Court has played an important      role ever since the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act was passed      to provide a meaningful check on the actions of our Government as it      engaged in surveillance of Americans  Unfortunately  the FISA Court      was cut out of any meaningful role in overseeing surveillance of      Americans in the Protect America Act    The Rockefeller Levin measure by      contrast would have allowed the basket surveillance orders that      the Administration says are needed  with no individual probable      cause determinations  but it had the FISA Court issuing those orders      to communications carriers after reviewing the Administrations      procedures  The Protect America Act requires U S       telecommunications carriers to assist with surveillance just on the      say so of the Attorney General and the Director of National      Intelligence  That is a mistake  it is an invitation to abuse   I look forward to hearing from      Director McConnell on what he believes the problems are with a role      for the FISA Court in issuing orders  and how we can create the      necessary authority to include the appropriate checks and balances   The problem facing our intelligence      agencies is targeting communications overseas  We want them to be      able to intercept calls between two people overseas with a minimum      of difficulty  What changes the equation and raises the stakes is      that the people may be innocent Americans  or they may be talking to      innocent people here in the United States  International      communications include those of businesspeople  tourists  and even      the families of our troops overseas  We can give the Government      flexibility it needs to conduct surveillance of foreign targets       while doing a better job protecting the privacy of innocent      Americans    The Protect America Act provides no      meaningful check by the FISA Court or the Congress  It does not      even require the Government to have its own internal procedures for      protecting the privacy of these Americans  The alternative bill      would have required internal procedures and an Inspector General      audit  I would like to know why Director McConnell rejected that      check   In addition  the Protect America Act      contains language that appears to go far beyond what the      Administration said it needed  It redefines electronic      surveillance in a way that has expansive implications  but was not      necessary to accomplish the Administrations stated objectives  It      has language in many places that  at the very least  is inscrutable      and could be read to allow much broader surveillance than the      Administration has acknowledged or  I hope  intends  If this was      unintentional  let us fix it  If it was not  then we need to      evaluate what was really intended and why    I know the skilled and dedicated      employees of our intelligence agencies want to protect our country       But if our history has taught us anything  it is that the Government      can not and should not be left to police itself when it comes to the      secret surveillance of Americans  The Founders knew it  The      Congress that passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act knew      it  I hope this hearing will help us institute the proper      protections to safeguard our security and our valued freedoms
