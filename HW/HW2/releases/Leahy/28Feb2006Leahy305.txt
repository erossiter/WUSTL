       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Wartime Executive Power   And The NSA s Surveillance Authority II                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Wartime Executive Power And The NSA s Surveillance      Authority II     February 28  2006  Todays hearing is our second to      explore the legality of President Bushs warrantless domestic spying      program  On December      17  2005  one day after the existence of the program was reported      by The New York Times       the President admitted that the Bush Cheney Administration has      engaged in secret wiretapping of ordinary Americans without warrants      for more than four years  Seven weeks later  Attorney General      Gonzales was called before this Committee and provided unsworn      testimony about the program    That testimony was far from complete      and left many important questions unanswered  At that hearing  we      had before us the chief legal officer of the  United States  He is not the      Presidents legal advisor  he is the American peoples lawyer  His      sworn duty is to uphold and enforce the Constitution and the laws      enacted by Congress  including the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act  which we have amended five times since the      September 11 attacks  It seemed reasonable to start by asking him      about how his Department of Justice has and will interpret those      laws  Also  by starting with legal questions  we avoided raising      any operational issues that could conceivably implicate national      security concerns  So I asked the Attorney General a simple      question  When did the Administration come up with its current      theory that the congressional resolution authorizing the use of      military force against al Qaeda  a resolution that says nothing at      all about wiretapping    also authorized secret  warrantless      wiretapping of Americans inside the United States  At every      opportunity  the Attorney General failed and refused to answer this      basic factual question   The Attorney General was asked several      times to clarify the scope of the Bush Cheney Administrations legal      theory of Executive power  If  as they claim  they can ignore      FISAs express prohibition of warrantless wiretapping  can they also      eavesdrop on purely domestic phone calls  Can they search or      electronically bug an Americans home or office  Can they comb      through Americans medical records and open first class mail  Can      they suspend the Posse Comitatus Act       These are questions to which Congress and the American people      deserve answers  Based on his testimony and persistent refusals to      answer responsively  it appears the Attorney General  whose job it      is to enforce the laws  has a radically different understanding of      the laws than do many of us    the peoples representatives in      Congress who wrote the laws  The  Attorney General refused to answer      questions  even legal and hypothetical questions  but limited his      appearance to confirming those facts the President has publicly      confirmed  nothing more  In a last minute change to his prepared      testimony he also followed the path of his predecessor by playing      politics on important security matters  hoping to intimidate      Senators who asked questions and sought to get to the facts     Senators from both parties took great      care to ask straightforward questions about the program that could      be answered without danger to national security  When did the      program begin  How many Americans have had their calls and emails      intercepted  Has the program led to any arrests  What involvement       if any  has the FISA      Court had with the program  Why was the program shut down in 2004       and was its scope changed in 2004  Once again  we got no answers       Attorney General Gonzales refused to answer a simple yes or no      question regarding the role of telephone companies and ISPs in      implementing the program  He asserted that the program was very      narrowly tailored  but he pointedly refused to say whether earlier      versions of the program were likewise narrowly tailored  or      whether the President has authorized other  broader secret      surveillance programs inside the United States  for example       programs that may involve warrantless physical searches or      large scale data mining    In short  we learned almost nothing      from our prior hearing  So far as the Attorney General was      concerned  any question that was  not limited to      confirming the current version of the specific program the President      described in December was irrelevant or hypothetical  even if it      went to the core of the Administrations legal justifications  And      any question that was  about that program amounted to a request for operational      details that the American people have no business knowing  even if      those questions were confined to the purely historical question of      when the program began  Whatever we asked  it was either too      relevant or not relevant enough  and either way  we were getting no      answers from the Attorney General    There was  briefly  one crack in the      stone wall he erected  It has been reported that senior Department      of Justice officials concluded in 2004 that the Presidents program      was illegal and  backed by former Attorney General Ashcroft       insisted that its scope be narrowed  So Chairman Specter asked the      Attorney General whether he had any objection to his predecessor      testifying before the Committee on this issue  Attorney General      Gonzales replied  I would not  One week later  in a carefully      worded about face  he had an assistant write to Chairman Specter      that the Bush Cheney Administration would not permit any former      officials to provide any new information to the Committee  The      stone wall was back up   Attorney General Gonzales conduct has      made the Bush Cheney Administrations position crystal clear  It      claims there is no place for congressional or judicial oversight of      any of its activities in any way related to national security in the      post 9 11 world  Through stonewalling  steamrolling and      intimidation  this Administration is running roughshod over the      Constitution and hiding behind inflammatory rhetoric demanding      Americans blindly trust every one of its decisions  Just last week      we were reminded  again  that they hold to that position even when      bipartisan members of Congress raise national security concerns      about the approval of a government owned Dubai company taking over      port operations in the United States  There are some striking      parallels between the warrantless wiretapping program and approval      of the takeover of most of our key ports on the East Coast by a firm      controlled by a foreign government that has previous ties to Osama      bin Laden  to terrorist financing and to the proliferation of      nuclear weapons technology by Ali Khan  In both cases  this      obsessively secretive Administration proceeded with action that it      must have known would face strong bipartisan opposition and did so      without informing Congress or the American people  In both cases       the Administration made no attempt whatsoever to follow even the      confidential review processes mandated by specific and express      federal statutes  the      FISA Court warrant requirement in the wiretapping case  and the      45 day review requirement of the Exon Florio law in the case of the      ports deal  And in both cases  the Bush Cheney Administration has      responded to bipartisan efforts at congressional oversight with      bellicose political threats   Will the Republican Congress fulfill      its constitutional duty of providing the checks and balances      envisioned by the Framers by engaging in real and effective      oversight  or will it continue to abdicate its oversight role in      deference to the other end of  Pennsylvania Avenue    Chairman Specter has a history of      engaging in meaningful  bipartisan oversight and I very much      appreciate his efforts thus far to lead a bipartisan quest for      straight answers on this illegal domestic surveillance program  I      am glad that we are having todays hearing  But we should be clear      about what todays hearing is  and is not  It is not an oversight      hearing  Through Attorney General Gonzales  the Bush Cheney      Administration has refused to answer oversight questions and refused      to allow former officials to answer them  At this point  meaningful      oversight of the Governments actions can only be achieved by      subpoenas backed by threat of real congressional sanctions if the      Bush Cheney Administration continues to stonewall   Our hearing today will be an academic      panel discussion featuring commentators who have not witnessed or      played any role in the program that they are discussing  and who      know no more than the very minimal facts about the program that the      President has chosen to divulge  This is an important discussion to      have to help this Committee  Congress and the American people      understand our legal landscape  and what consequences this illegal      program has on our system  These are scholars and former government      officials with a great deal of expertise in the law or in the      intelligence field  I greatly appreciate their analysis  just as I      appreciate the analysis of former President Jimmy Carter  former FBI      Director William Sessions  conservative columnist George Will  and      the many other scholars and former government officials who have      concluded that this program violates the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act and threatens the constitutional separation of      powers  But todays hearing is no substitute for the vigorous and      forceful oversight this Congress owes the American people
