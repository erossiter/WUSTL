              Senator Jim Jeffords  I Vt                  to name Vermonts White                Rocks National Recreation                Area in honor of former                Senator Bob Stafford  R Vt                   who is also a former                Governor of Vermont                   The effort is a joint                project by the Vermont                Congressional Delegation                 Representative Bernie                Sanders  I Vt   has                introduced the counterpart                to the Senate passed bill in                the U S  House of                Representatives                   The recreation area  in                Rutland and Bennington                Counties  encompasses 22 758                acres and will be known as                The Robert T  Stafford White                Rocks National Recreation                Area  It was designated a                National Recreation Area in                the 1984 Wilderness Act                 which Stafford largely                wrote                    Leahy said  Bob Staffords                legacy is enduring  and this                is an enduring and                meaningful way to                commemorate his work and his                love of Vermont  White                Rocks is among his most                beloved natural areas in our                state  and we know that he                and Helen could actually see                the towering white cliff                face of White Rocks Mountain                from their home  This will                remind generations of future                Vermonters of Bob Staffords                towering achievements  and                of the humanity of his                spirit                   Jeffords said  No monument                or park renaming can do                justice to the unparalleled                contributions that Senator                Stafford made to both                Vermont and this nation                 That said  naming the White                Rocks area after Senator                Stafford is as fitting a                tribute as I can imagine for                a man who did so much to                protect Vermonts natural                resources and beauty  It is                our way of thanking Senator                Stafford for his many years                of devoted public service                   Sanders said  Bob Stafford                has spent his career                servinghis fellow                Vermonters both here and in

          Stafforddeservedly is                widely respected by people                of all political persuasions                and it is important that                hiswork be recognized in

of Leahy and Jeffords that                were entered into the                Congressional Record                Thursday night at the time                of the bills Senate                passage

 Area  Along with Senator                Jeffords  I introduced this                legislation as what we                believed is a fitting                tribute to our friend and                former colleague  Senator                Robert Stafford                     Bob Stafford is an absolute                giant in Vermont politics                 He spent almost 30 years

years  During his                Senate service Bob Stafford                became a national figure of                stature  of vision and of                courage in his leadership

the Senate                honors our former colleague                and our friend                                              Statement Of Sen James                M  Jeffords               In Support Of The Robert T                 Stafford National Recreation                Area               Congressional Record               March 16  2006                  Mr  President  today I join                my colleague from Vermont                 Senator Leahy  in seeking to                rename the White Rocks                National Recreation Area in                the Green Mountain National                Forest of Vermont in honor                of our great friend  and my                mentor and predecessor                 Robert T  Stafford                   Twenty two years ago                 Senator Stafford introduced                the Vermont Wilderness Act                of 1984 on behalf of himself                and Senator Leahy  Senator                Stafford said at that time                 It is our intention to                present this legislation to                Vermonters and seek their                comments       I am willing                to listen to the voices of                other Vermonters before a                decision is made  And                listen he did                     Senator Stafford then led                Senator Leahy and me back                home to Vermont to hear from                hundreds of our                constituents  Their input                changed the bill  and the                result was the creation of                the White Rocks National                Recreation Area                   Mr  President  this                magnificent  36 000 acre                recreation area exists                because of Senator                Staffords insistence upon                listening to Vermonters and                seeing their views embodied                in the law                    Senator Staffords public                service spanned four                decades  and included six                years as Chairman of the                Senate Committee on                Environment and Public                Works  Throughout his                career  he proved himself a                true steward of our                environment  As he                approached his retirement at                the end of the 100th                Congress  Senator Stafford                gave a series of floor                statements describing the                environmental threats that                faced our nation                   On September 12  1988  he                said  We humans have                degraded the environment of                our world  and now we must                set ourselves on the path of                reversing that course  It                will not be an easy task to                accomplish  but it is a                necessary oneIf only we can                recognize this circumstance                for what it is    an                opportunity to redirect                ourselves toward a brighter                future    then setting                ourselves to the task ahead                will not be a burden  but a                joy                   That was 18 years ago  and                unfortunately  those threats                remain very much with us                today  But it is my hope                that the White Rocks                recreation area  which                Senator Stafford can look                out upon from his home in                Rutland  Vermont  will be a                constant reminder of Senator                Staffords devotion to                Vermont and his devotion to                our environment                   No monument or statement or                park renaming can do justice                to the unparalleled                contributions Senator                Stafford has made to both                Vermont and this nation                 Senator Stafford has been                one of the most devoted                 capable and accomplished                public servants the Senate                has ever known  That said                 naming the White Rocks area                after Senator Stafford is as                fitting a tribute as I can                imagine                    Just as the Wilderness Act                of 1984 named the George                Aiken Wilderness Area in                honor of that great Vermont                Senator  we seek to bestow                the same honor upon Senator                Stafford with the naming of                the Robert T  Stafford White                Rocks National Recreation                Area
