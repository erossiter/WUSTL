       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On FY 2008 USAID Budget Request   And Foreign Aid Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee    Hearing On FY 2008 USAID Budget Request    And Foreign Aid Reform    March 28  2007 I want to begin by     welcoming Senator Gregg who is the new Ranking Member of this     Subcommittee  Senator Gregg and I come from states that share a border     and I look forward to working with him in the same bipartisan way that     his predecessor  Senator McConnell  and I worked together for so many     years   I think we both     agree that the United States does not need a Democratic or Republican     foreign policy  we need an American foreign policy  and that is what I     intend to strive for  Ambassador Tobias      we appreciate you being here  We also appreciate your past leadership     as the Global AIDS Coordinator  You got that program off to a good     start  The jobs of USAID     Administrator and Director of Foreign Assistance are quite different     from either the CEO of a private corporation or the AIDS Coordinator  as     Im sure you have discovered  Today we want to     focus on the Presidents Fiscal Year 2008 budget request for USAID  and     on your proposals for reforming our foreign aid programs  I think most people     would agree that there is a lot of room for improvement in our foreign     aid budget  personnel and procurement policies  and programs  But the     issue is how you do it  and what decision making authority is retained     by USAID  On the positive     side  you have developed a more coherent process that will enable your     office to more accurately show where and how funds are spent  That will     help and we welcome it   We are also assured     by your office that you consulted extensively during this process      although that is not what we have heard from some of those whose views     we would have wanted to see reflected  including within USAID itself  While the budget     process may be more coherent and transparent  I am mystified by many of     the results  A glance at your     budget request yields as many questions as answers  A country like     Colombia  that has received roughly  565 million in each of the past     five years  gets the same amount for the same purposes in FY 2008  even     though we know that some things have not worked and that conditions in     Colombia have changed   In Nepal  a country     where years of fighting has cost thousands of lives  there is a     chance to end the Maoist insurgency and replace feudalism with     democracy  Yet you propose to cut our assistance  The Democratic     Republic of the Congo  a huge country with every imaginable problem  has     emerged from conflict and completed its first election in 40 years  It     holds the key to the future of central Africa  yet you propose to cut     our assistance   Vietnam  a country     of 80 million people  seeks closer ties with the United States  and     there are so many opportunities for working together  Yet  with the     exception of HIV AIDS  you propose to cut our assistance  The Congress has     worked hard to increase funding for global environment programs      particularly to protect biodiversity in the Amazon and central Africa     where the forests are being destroyed  Yet you propose to slash funding     for those programs   Last year  you     testified before this Subcommittee that  and I am quoting you  our     intent is not to have a USAID budget or a State Department budget  but a     Foreign Assistance budget that will make all of it more coherent in a     way that all of us can better understand  I have mentioned     just a few of many examples  I have to ask what is the purpose of this     stated coherence if it produces illogical outcomes  What was the     strategic thinking behind these decisions  How were the views of USAID     program officers in the field and their implementing partners     reflected  How were the Congress views reflected   We know you have to     make hard choices  We all face budget constraints  But Pakistan      Afghanistan  Iraq and Indonesia are not the only countries where the     United States has important economic and security interests  You need     to make sense of this for us if we are going to be able to work     together
