       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Reauthorization Of The Juvenile Justice And   Delinquency Prevention Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On Reauthorization Of The Juvenile Justice And      Delinquency Prevention Act  Protecting Our Children And Our      Communities  December 5  2007          Today  the Judiciary Committee considers the important issue of how      we can best help our communities protect our most precious asset       our children  not only by keeping them safe and out of trouble  but      also by helping to ensure they have the opportunity to become      productive adult members of society  I thank Senators Specter       Kennedy  and Durbin for their leadership on this issue  and I      particularly thank Senator Kohl  who has long been committed to this      issue  for agreeing to share with me the responsibility of chairing      this hearing              The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act sets out federal      policy and standards for the administration of juvenile justice in      the states  It authorizes key federal resources for states to      improve their juvenile justice systems and for communities to      develop programs to prevent kids from getting into trouble  The      reauthorization of this important legislation gives us a good      opportunity to reexamine federal juvenile justice policy so that we      can reinforce what has been working and change what has not         The Washington Post reported last week on a study by the      Center for Disease Control and Prevention that we should consider       The CDC determined that children who are held in adult prisons      commit more crimes  and more serious crimes  when they are released      than kids with similar histories who are kept in juvenile      facilities  After years of pressure to try more and more kids as      adults and to send them to adult prisons  we need to seriously      consider whether that policy is working in the face of strong      evidence to the contrary             As a former prosecutor  I know well the importance of holding      criminals accountable for their crimes with strong sentences  But      when we are talking about children  we must also think about how      best to help them become responsible  contributing members of      society as adults  That keeps us all safer             As I have observed before  Congresss and the Clinton      administrations strong support for state and local law enforcement      in the 90s with the COPS Program and other key grant programs      contributed to historic declines in crime  The gutting of these      programs by this administration and recent Republican Congresses has      contributed to a reversal of that trend and to recent increases in      crime rates  Press reports based on documents from the Office of      Management and Budget suggest that the administration may be      proposing further cuts in funding to law enforcement next year  I      am afraid that similar trends are evident in the juvenile justice      field  with effective prevention programs facing significant cuts in      federal support  creating a dangerous vacuum  We need to reverse      this trend and help our communities implement programs proven to      help kids turn their lives around             I have long supported a strong federal commitment to preventing      youth violence  and I have worked hard on past reauthorizations of      this legislation  as have many of my colleagues on the Committee       We have learned with time the importance of boosting support for      state and local law enforcement and of balancing strong law      enforcement with prevention programs aimed at keeping kids out of the criminal justice system  Some problems persist  including      disturbing episodes of mistreatment of children and the continuing      disproportionate representation of minorities in the juvenile      justice system  We must continue looking for ways to solve these      troubling patterns and disparities  as well as to build upon past      successes             I thank the many prominent Vermont representatives of law      enforcement  the juvenile justice system  and prevention oriented      non profits who have spoken to me in support of reauthorizing this      important Act and who have helped to shape my understanding of these      issues  I know that many of my colleagues on the Committee have      heard from passionate leaders on this issue in their own states       several of whom join us on todays panel              I thank the distinguished panel of witnesses for coming  I am glad      that the panel includes people with juvenile justice experience not      only in large urban communities  but also in rural areas  areas      with problems that may receive less national attention  but which      for Vermont and many other states are just as real  Importantly       the panel includes representation from the federal  state  and local      levels  people with years of experience both in law enforcement and      in programs aimed at keeping children out of the criminal justice      system  I know they will provide us with valuable ideas and      perspectives today              A careful examination of how to keep our children from entering or      reentering the criminal justice system not only makes our      communities safer by reducing the number of kids who go on to lives      of crime as adults  but it also ensures that our children will lead      safer and more fulfilling lives
