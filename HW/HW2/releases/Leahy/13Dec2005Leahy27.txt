       Statment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of Legislation To   Extend The Expiring Patriot Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Floor Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     On The Introduction Of Legislation To Extend     The Expiring Patriot Act     Senate Floor     December 13  2005  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  first  if I      might  I wish to compliment my colleague and neighbor from across      the Connecticut River  Senator Sununu of New Hampshire  He has laid      out very clearly and eloquently the reasons we should not be rushed      into a bad bill  It is not because any of us here have any love of      terrorists  Of course none of us do  no Americans do   On a September morning 4 years ago       nearly 3 000 lives  American lives  were lost   not in a foreign      nation but on our own soil  Our lives as Americans changed in an      instant  There is not a person within this Chamber who does not      remember exactly where he or she was when they heard the news of the      attacks of 9 11  In the aftermath of those attacks  Congress moved      swiftly to pass antiterrorism legislation  We moved as a Congress       as a Senate  as a House   not as Republicans or as Democrats  but as      Americans  united in our efforts  The fires were still smoldering      at Ground Zero in New York City when the USA PATRIOT Act became law      on October 30  2001  just 6 weeks after the attacks   I know how hard we worked  I was      chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee at the time  Many of us      here in the Senate today worked together in that spirit of      bipartisan unity  We resolved to craft a bill that would make us      safer as a nation   Freedom and security are always in      tension in our society  especially so in those somber weeks after      the attacks  We tried our best to strike the right balance between      freedom and security   The Senator from New Hampshire quoted      Benjamin Franklin  As one reads the history of the founding of this      Nation and what the Founders went through  his quote stands out so      much   Benjamin Franklin  like the other      Founders  knew that had our new country not worked  had the      Revolution not worked  most of them would have been hanged for      trying to break away from our mother country  When he spoke of a      people who would give up their liberties for security deserving      neither  he knew of what he spoke  And he set a key idea for the      fledgling democracy of America  and it is one that I like to think      through the generations we have strengthened  During my years in      the Senate  I have done everything possible to strengthen that      balance to maintain our liberties because if we do not maintain our      liberties  at the best we have a false security  It is not a real      security   One of the fruits of the      bipartisanship of the PATRIOT Act  in trying to work out this      balance  was the sunset provisions  Those key provisions set an      expiration date of December 31  2005  on certain Government powers      that had great potential to affect the civil liberties of the      American people  We are just weeks away from that date now   Some may wonder how these sunset      provisions worked their way into the PATRIOT Act  They were put      there by the Republican leader of the House  Dick Armey of Texas       and myself  We have entirely different political philosophies  but      we agreed on one thing  If you are giving great powers to our      Government  you want to make sure there are some strings attached       It makes no difference whether it is a Republican administration or      a Democratic administration  you want to make sure there are strings      attached  Leader Armey and I insisted on these sunsets to ensure      that Congress would revisit the PATRIOT Act within a few years and      consider refinements to protect the rights and liberties of all      Americans more effectively  and we prevailed on that point   Sadly  the administration and some in      the leadership in the House and Senate have squandered key      opportunities to improve the PATRIOT Act  The House Senate      conference report filed last week by Republican lawmakers falls      short of what the American people expect and deserve from us  The      bipartisan Senate bill  which the Senate Judiciary Committee and      then the Senate adopted unanimously  struck a better balance   If I might  I wish to compliment the      chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  Senator Arlen Specter       the senior Senator from Pennsylvania  and those Republicans and      Democrats in this body who worked with him  as I did  to put      together a fair and balanced bill which was able to go through our      committee  which is sometimes heavily divided on issues  Instead  it      went through the Judiciary Committee unanimously and passed the      Senate unanimously  We worked together on that because we      understand that the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act has to have      the confidence of the American people   Think for a moment  Governments can      limit the rights of the people in their countries really in only two      ways  they can do it by force of arms  by oppression and      repression  as we have seen with totalitarian governments  or  if      they have done it right  they can do it with the consent of the      governed   As we are limiting some of these      rights  as we are giving greater powers to our Government  we want      to do it in a way where the American people   all of the nearly 300      million people in this great country   would have confidence in what      we have done  because we do not enforce our laws in this country by      force of arms  by dictatorship  we do it with the consent of the      governed   I believe what we passed in the Senate      and in the Senate Judiciary Committee would have the confidence of      the American people  But now we have pushed forward and changed      that to flawed legislation which will not have that confidence and      respect of the American people  The Congress should not rush ahead      to enact flawed legislation to meet a deadline that is within our      power to extend  We owe it to the American people to get this      right  America can do better than this flawed legislation   The way forward to a sensible       workable  bipartisan bill is clear  It is very clear  as Senator      Sununu said on the floor earlier this morning and as I have      suggested    Yesterday  Senator Sununu and I      introduced a bill to extend the sunset for the expiring PATRIOT Act      powers until March 31  2006  Give us until March 31 to get this      right  give us until March 31 to have a bill that would have not      only the respect of the American people but especially the      confidence of the American people  Our laws work if we have      confidence in them  and they fail if we do not have confidence in      them    In offering this bill  Senator Sununu      and I have been joined by Senators Craig  Rockefeller  Murkowski       Kennedy  Hagel  Levin  Durbin  Stabenow  Salazar  and others  It is      a bipartisan effort to extend this deadline  A deadline which  Congress imposed to ensure oversight      and accountability should not now become a barrier to achieving      bipartisan compromise and the best bill we can forge together   This is a vital debate  It should      be  These are vital issues to all Americans  If a brief extension      is needed to produce a better bill that would better serve all of      our citizen then by all means  let us give ourselves that time        We want to give tools to prosecutors       I spent 8 years of my life as a prosecutor  Some of the finest      people on my staff are former prosecutors  We know the needs       especially in the electronic age  But we can do better  and America      can do better if given the time   I thank Senator Sununu and all of our      cosponsors in coming together in a bipartisan way to advance what is      a commonsense solution   I ask unanimous consent to have      printed in the Record some recent editorials on this matter
