       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Senate Consideration Of The FISA Amendments   Act of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On Senate Consideration Of S  2248       The FISA Amendments Act Of 2007  December 17  2007      The Foreign       Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA  is intended to protect       both our national security and the privacy and civil liberties       of Americans  We are considering amendments to that important       Act that will provide new flexibility to our Intelligence       Community  I think we all support surveillance authority and we       have joined together to update FISA dozens of times since its       historic passage after the intelligence abuses of earlier       decades  I thank the Majority Leader for his efforts in       bringing this matter before the Senate  He has consulted with       me and with Chairman Rockefeller and is proceeding by regular       order to bring this legislation before the Senate in a manner       that allows deliberation of the many protections of Americans       rights added to the bill during consideration by the Senate       Judiciary Committee        It is vitally       important that we correct the excesses of the so called Protect       America Act that was rushed through the Senate in an atmosphere       of fear and intimidation just before the August recess after the       Administration reneged on agreements reached with congressional       leaders  That bill was hurriedly passed under       intense  partisan pressure from the Administration  It provided       sweeping new powers to the government to engage in surveillance        without a warrant  of international calls to and from the United       States involving Americans  and it provided no meaningful       protection for the privacy and civil liberties of the Americans       who are on those calls       Before that flawed bill passed        Senator Rockefeller and I  and several others in the House and       the Senate  worked hard and in good faith with the       Administration to craft legislation that solved an identified       problem  but also protected Americans privacy and liberties        Just before the August recess the Administration decided        instead  to ram through its version of the so called Protect       America Act with excessive grants of government authority and       without accountability or checks and balances  After almost six       years of violating FISA through secret warrantless wiretapping       programs  that was wrong  A number of us supported the better       balanced alternative and voted against the Protect America Act       as drafted by the Administration        Fortunately  because the Protect       America Act has a 6 month sunset  we have a chance to revisit       this matter and do it right  The Judiciary Committees and       Intelligence Committees in the Senate and the House have spent       the past months considering changes to FISA  In the Senate       Judiciary Committee  we held open hearings and countless       briefings and meetings to consider new surveillance       legislation  We considered legislative language in a number of       open business meetings of the Committee and reported a good bill       to the Senate before Thanksgiving        The bill we are       considering will permit the government  while targeting       overseas  to review more Americans communications with less       court supervision than ever before  I support this       surveillance  but we must also take care to protect Americans       liberties  Attorney General Mukasey said at his nomination       hearing that protecting civil liberties  and       peoples confidence that those liberties are protected  is a       part of protecting national security  On that I agree with       him  That is what the Senate Judiciary bill does       I commend the House of       Representatives for passing a bill  the RESTORE Act  that       takes a balanced approach to these issues  It allows our       Intelligence community great flexibility to conduct surveillance       on overseas targets  while providing oversight and protection       for Americans civil liberties  The Senate Select Committee on       Intelligence has also worked hard  I know that Chairman       Rockefeller was as disappointed as I at the Administrations       partisan maneuvering just before the August recess  I commended       his efforts this summer and do so  again  now  I believe that       he and I both want surveillance with oversight and       accountability        I also want to praise our joint       members  Senators Feinstein  Feingold  and Whitehouse  who as       members of both the Judiciary Committee and the Select Committee       on Intelligence contributed so much to the work of the Judiciary       Committee and who worked with me to author many of the       additional protections that we adopted and reported  These       Senators and others on the Judiciary Committee worked hard to       craft amendments that preserve the basic structure and authority       proposed in the bill reported by the Select Committee on       Intelligence  while adding crucial protections for Americans             In my view  and I think the view       of many Senators  we need to do more than the bill initially       reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence to       protect the rights of Americans  Indeed  Senator Rockefeller       joins with me to support many of the Judiciary Committees       improvements        The Judiciary bill  for example        makes clear that the government cannot claim authority to       operate outside the law    outside of FISA    by alluding to       legislative measures that were never intended to provide such       exceptional authority  This Administration has come to argue       that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force  AUMF         passed after September 11  justified conducting warrantless       surveillance of Americans for more than five years  I       introduced a resolution on this in the last Congress  when we       first heard this canard  When we authorized going after Osama       bin Laden  the Senate did not authorize  explicitly or       implicitly  warrantless wiretapping of Americans  Yet this       Administration still clings to this phony legal argument  The       Judiciary bill would prevent that dangerous contention with       strong language reaffirming that FISA is the exclusive means for       conducting electronic surveillance for foreign intelligence       purposes       The Judiciary bill would also       provide a more meaningful role for the FISA Court in this new       surveillance  The Court is a critical independent check on       government excess in the very sensitive area of electronic       surveillance  The fundamental purpose of many of the Judiciary       Committee changes is to assure that this important  independent       check remains meaningful        On one important issue  I strongly       oppose the bill reported by the Senate Select Committee on       Intelligence  That bill includes one provision that goes beyond       even the so called Protect America Act  It would grant blanket       retroactive immunity to telecommunications carriers for their       warrantless surveillance activities from 2001 through earlier       this year contrary to FISA and in violation of the privacy       rights of Americans        This Administration violated FISA       by conducting warrantless surveillance for more than five       years  They got caught  and if they hadnt  they would probably       still be doing it  When the public found out about the       Presidents illegal surveillance of Americans  the       Administration and the telephone companies were sued by citizens       who believe their privacy and their rights were violated  Now       the Administration is trying to get this Congress to terminate       those lawsuits in order to insulate itself from accountability        We should not allow this to happen        The rule of law is fundamentally       important in our system  and so is protecting the rights of       Americans from unlawful surveillance  I do not believe that       Congress can or should seek to take those rights and those       claims from those already harmed  Instead  I will continue to       work with Senator Specter  as well as with Senators Feinstein       and Whitehouse  to try to craft a more effective alternative to       retroactive immunity  We are working with the legal concept of       substitution to place the government in the shoes of the private       defendants that acted at its behest and to let it assume full       responsibility for the illegal conduct        I voted for cloture on the motion       to proceed to the measure  just as I would have supported       proceeding to the House passed bill  because I believe it is       important that we correct the excesses of the so called Protect       America Act  The Judiciary Committee has done good work in       reporting protective measures to the Senate to add balance to       the surveillance powers of the Government and to better ensure       the rights of Americans  I strongly oppose retroactive immunity       in favor of accountability        As we debate these issues  let us       keep in mind the reason we have FISA in the first place  Not so       long ago  we painfully learned the hard lesson that powerful       surveillance tools  without adequate oversight or the checks and       balances of judicial review  lead to abuses of the rights of the       American people  I hope this debate will provide us an       opportunity to show the American people what we stand for  that       we will do all we can to secure our future while protecting       their cherished rights and freedoms
