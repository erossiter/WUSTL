       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On USAID s FY2007 Budget   Request                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee      Hearing On USAIDs FY 2007 Budget Request      Ambassador Randall Tobias     June 8  2006 Ambassador      Tobias  we have 90 minutes to cover the entire world of USAIDs      programs  so I will be very brief   I join Chairman      McConnell in welcoming you to this Subcommittee for the first time      as USAID Administrator and as the Director of Foreign Assistance  I      also want to thank you for the job you did as Global AIDS      Coordinator  My impression is that you got that program off to a      good start  despite some less than helpful constraints in the law  Yours is a heavy      responsibility  While your previous role involved some of the same      countries and problems  fighting AIDS is different from reforming      dysfunctional judicial systems  building potable water systems       responding to famines or hurricanes  stopping deforestation       supporting nascent political parties  or providing economic      alternatives for opium growers   Building      democratic institutions and economic systems that offer real      opportunities for people to improve their lives within a just      society  presents unique  long term challenges and opportunities  Your new role      will also involve more interaction with the Congress than you are      accustomed to  Some of it may not always be welcome  because in the      Senate we have 100 different points of view of whats wrong in the      world and what USAID should do about it  And you also have to deal      with the House  I hope you      understand that the way we get this bill passed is by balancing the      Presidents priorities with the Congresss priorities  They are      often the same  but not always  Let me give you some friendly      advice  dont forget who pays the bills   You have already      discovered that USAID has outstanding people  But its staff is a      fraction of the number that are needed to effectively manage      programs in so many countries with so many problems  It is also      plagued by burdensome and self defeating procurement and contracting      procedures that one might expect to find in Russia  but not here  I      want to know  not today but soon  how you plan to fix these      problems   I have long      believed that the United States needs a Director of Foreign      Assistance  We need far better coordination  and I only wish your      oversight extended to the international programs of other agencies      besides State and USAID  like the Departments of Agriculture and      Energy  the US Foreign Service and the CDC  At the same time       there are good reasons for USAIDs autonomy  and we want to protect      it  I am concerned      that there has not been nearly enough consultation with the Congress      about your position or the Secretarys transformational diplomacy      initiative  Your testimony today does not give us much more than      the vague generalities we have heard already  One thing we have      learned over many years is that when it comes to foreign policy and      foreign assistance  real reform is difficult and it doesnt happen      unless the Congress is fully on board  We know what the      problems are and there is a lot we can do to make our foreign      assistance programs more effective  But we have to work together       from the beginning  which has not been the practice of this      Administration  I hope this will be different because there is a      lot at stake for all of us  Thank you Mr       Chairman  and thank you Ambassador Tobias for being here
