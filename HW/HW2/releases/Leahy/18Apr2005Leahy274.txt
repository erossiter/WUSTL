       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Democratic Member  Judiciary   Committee  Senate Floor Remarks On Republicans  Exploitation Of Faith In   Judiciary Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Democratic Member  Judiciary Committee     Senate Floor Remarks     On Republicans Exploitation Of Faith In Judicial Nominations    April 18  2005  Religious McCarthyism We have learned that     those who are intent on forcing confrontation  breaking the Senates     rules and undercutting our democratic checks and balances plan to take     their previous outrageous allegations of religious McCarthyism one step     further and accuse Democrats of being against people of faith because     we object to seven of the Presidents more than 200 judicial nominees      By the logic of this venom  the 205 judicial nominees forwarded by     President Bush who Democratic senators have helped to confirm would seem     not to be people of faith  though that is as false and ridiculous on its     face as is the predicate charge leveled at Democratic senators    This disgusting     spectacle  this smear of good men and women as against faith is     expected to happen in  of all places  a house of worship  according to a     front page article last week in The     New York Times  It will involve twisting history as well as     religion  because  according to the report  those involved will claim     that Democratic Senators are using the filibuster rule to keep people of     faith off of the federal bench  This slander is so     laden with falsehoods  so permeated by the smoke and mirrors of partisan     politics  and so intertwined with one mans personal political     aspirations that it should collapse of its own weight  But too many who     should speak out against it remain silent   Republicans on the     Senate Judiciary Committee began blatantly to invoke obscene accusations     like this one earlier in the Bush Administration  They hurled false     charges claiming Senators were anti Hispanic  anti African American      anti woman  anti religion  anti Catholic and anti Christian for opposing     certain judicial nominees  They never stopped to mention that the same     Senators they were slandering had supported hundreds of nominees     including Hispanics  African Americans  women  and people of faith        Catholic  Christian  and Jewish  They never hesitated to stoke the     flames of bigotry  and to encourage their supporters to continue the     smear in cyberspace  or in the pages of the nations newspapers or     through direct mail  To the contrary  they liked the way it sounded      Maybe it tested well in their political polls  Now they have decided     to up the ante on such religious McCarthyism  as I called it last     year  as a way to help them tear down the Senate and do away with the     last bastion against this Presidents most extreme judicial nominees      It is crass demagoguery  fueled by the arrogance of power  They now seek to make     a connection between the dark days of the struggle for civil rights      when some used the filibuster to try to defeat equal rights laws  and     the situation we find ourselves in today when the voice of the minority     struggles to be heard above the cacophony of daily lies and     misrepresentations  This tactical shift follows on the rhetorical     attacks aimed at the judiciary over the past few weeks in which federal     judges were likened to the KKK and the focus of evil  In the last few     weeks we have heard calls for Stalinist solutions to problems and for     mass impeachments  Last week the Senate Democratic leadership called     upon the President and the Republican leadership of Congress to denounce     these inflammatory statements against judges  This week I renew my call     to Republican leaders and  in particular  to Republican moderates  to     denounce the religious McCarthyism that is again pervading their side of     this debate   I ask my friends on the other side of     the aisle to follow the brave example of one of Vermonts     greatest Senators  Republican Ralph Flanders  Senator Flanders     recognized a ruthless political opportunist when he saw one  and he knew     that Senator Joe McCarthy had exploited his position of power in the     Senate to smear hundreds of innocent people and win headlines and     followers with his false charges and innuendo  without regard to facts      rules  or human decency  Senator Flanders spoke out during this dark     chapter in the history of this great institution  and he offered a     resolution of censure condemning the conduct of Senator McCarthy  Now      in our time  a line has again been crossed by some seeking to influence     this body  and I ask my friends on the other side of the aisle to follow     Senator Flanders lead in condemning the crossing of that line   I have served with many fair minded     Republican Senators  I am saddened to see Republican Senators stay     silent when they are invited to disavow these abuses  Where are the     voices of reason of the more moderate Members of this body  Will they     not heed the clarion call that Senator Danforth sounded a few weeks     ago  What has silenced these Senators who otherwise have taken moderate     and independent stands in the past  Why are they allowing this     religious McCarthyism to take place unchallenged  The demagoguery that     is so cynically and corrosively being used by supporters of the     President s most extreme judicial nominees needs to stop   Not only must this     bogus religious test end  but Senators should denounce the launching of     the nuclear option  the Republicans precedent shattering proposal to     destroy the Senate in one stroke  while shifting more power over the     Senate to the White House  I would like to keep the Senate safe and     secure and in a nuclear free zone  The partisan power play Senate     Republicans are discussing and now likely to employ will undermine the     checks and balances established by the Founders in the Constitution  It     is a giant leap toward an unfettered Executive controlling all three     branches of the Federal Government  It not only will demean the Senate     and destroy the comity on which it depends  it also will undermine the     strong  independent federal judiciary that has protected the rights and     liberties of all Americans against the overreaching of the political     branches   Even our current parliamentarian s     office and our Congressional Research Service have said that the     so called nuclear option would go against Senate precedent and require     the chair to overrule the parliamentarian  Is this how we want to     govern the Senate  Do Republicans want to blatantly break the rules for     short term political gain   Just as the     Constitution provides in Article V for a method of amendment  so  too      the Senate Rules provide for their own amendment  Sadly  the current     crop of zealot partisans who are seeking to limit debate and minority     rights in the Senate have no respect for the Senate  its role in our     government as a check on the executive or its Rules  Republicans are in     the majority in the Senate and chair all of its Committees  including     the Rules Committee  If Republicans have a serious proposal to change     the Senate Rules  they should introduce it  The Rules Committee should     hold serious hearings on it and consider it and create a full and fair     record so that the Senate itself would be in position to consider it      That is what we used to call regular order  That is how the Senate is     intended to operate  through deliberative processes and with all points     of view being protected and being able to be heard   That is not how the     nuclear option will work  It is intended to work outside established     precedents and procedures as explained by the Congressional Research     Service report from last month  Use of the nuclear option in the     Senate is akin to amending the Constitution not by following the     procedures required by Article V but by proclaiming that 51 Republican     Senators have determined that every copy of the Constitution shall     contain a new section or different words    or not contain some of those     troublesome amendments that Americans like to call the Bill or Rights      That is wrong  It is a kind of lawlessness that each of us should     oppose  It is rule by the parliamentary equivalent of brute force      The recently     constituted Iraqi National Assembly was elected in January  In April it     acted pursuant to its governing law to select a presidency council by     the required vote of two thirds of the Assembly  a supermajority  That     same governing law says that it can only be amended by a three quarters     vote of the National Assembly  Use of the nuclear option in the     Senate is akin to Iraqis in the majority political party of the Assembly     saying that they have decided to change the law to allow them to pick     only members of their party for the government and to do so by a simple     majority vote  They might feel justified in acting contrary to law     because the Kurds and the Sunni were driving a hard bargain and because     governing through consensus is not as easy as ruling unilaterally  It     is not supposed to be  that is why our system of government is the     worlds example   If Iraqi Shiites      Sunni and Kurds can cooperate in their new government to make democratic     decisions  so can Republicans and Democrats in the United States     Senate  If the Iraqi law and Assembly can protect minority rights and     participation  so can the rules and United States Senate  That has been     the defining characteristic of the Senate and one of the principal ways     in which it was designed to be distinct from the House or     Representatives  This week  the Senate     is debating an emergency supplemental appropriations bill to fund the     war efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan  The justification for these     billions of dollars being spent each week is that we are seeking to     establish democracies  How ironic that at the same time we are     undertaking these efforts at great cost to so many American families      some are seeking to undermine the protection of minority rights and     checks and balances represented by the Senate through our own history      Yet that is what I see happening   President Bush     emphasized in his discussions earlier this year with President Putin of    Russia that the essentials of a democracy include protecting     minority rights and an independent judiciary  The Republican nuclear     option will undermine our values here at the same time we are preaching     our values to others abroad   I urge Senate     Republicans to listen carefully to what their leaders are saying  here     in the Senate  and out across the country to their most extreme     supporters  Consider what it is they are about to do and the language     they use to justify it  Both are wrong  It would steer the Senate and     the country away from democracy  away from the protections of the     minority and away from the checks and balances that ensure the freedoms     of all Americans     Leahys extended floor remarks follow      Id also like to talk     for a moment about the independence of the judiciary  I have expressed     my concern that members of Congress have suggested judges be impeached     if they disagree with the judges decisions  Republicans rushed through     legislation telling federal judges what to do in the Schiavo case  and     then criticized the judges when they acted independently  judges     appointed by President Reagan  by former President Bush  and by     President Clinton  They were all criticized for that  although there are     still those who are saying we should impeach the judges  or as I     mentioned earlier in my speech  one speaker at a recent conference  to     the cheers of some suggested Joseph Stalin s famous No man  No     problem solution  because he killed those who disagreed  I remember a group of     Russian parliamentarians came to see me to talk about a federal     judiciary  and they asked  Is it true that in the United States     the government might be a party in a lawsuit and that the government     could lose  I said  Absolutely right  They said  People would dare     to sue the government  I said  We have an independent judiciary  yes      they could  They said  Well  if the government lost  you fire the     judges  of course  I said  No  they are an independent judiciary      And I remember the discussion around the conference room in my office      This was the most amazing thing to them  that the people who disagreed     with the government could actually go to a federal court or a state     court  bring a suit there and seek redress even if it meant the     government lost  Sometimes it wins  sometimes it loses  I was a     government prosecutor  I know how that works  I think they finally     understood that the reason we are such a great democracy is that we have     an independent judiciary   I would call out to my     friends on the other side of the aisle to stop slamming the federal     judiciary  We don t have to agree with every one of their opinions but     let s respect their independence  Let s not say things that are going to     bring about further threats against our judges  We ve had a lot more     judges killed than we ve had U S  Senators killed for carrying     out their duties  We ought to be protecting them and their integrity  If     we disagree with what they ve done in a case where we can pass a law and     we feel we should  then pass a law and change it  Don t take the pot     shots that put all judges in danger and that attack the very     independence of our federal judiciary   We remember our own     oath of office  Part of upholding the Constitution is upholding the     independence of the third branch of government  One party or the other     will control the presidency  One party or the other will control each     House of Congress  No political party should control the judiciary  It     should be independent of all political parties  That was the genius of     the founders of this country  It is the genius that has protected our     liberties and our rights for well over 200 years  It is the genius of     this country that will continue to protect them if we allow it to  It     would be a terrible diminution of our rights and it would be one of the     most threatening things to our whole democracy if we were to remove the     independence of our federal judiciary  That would do things that no     armies marched against us have ever been able to do  None of the     turmoil  the wars  all that we ve gone through in this country has ever     been able to do  If you take away theindependence of our federal     judiciary  then our whole constitutional fabric unravels
