       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Habeas Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Thursday        Oct  6     The Judiciary Committee on Thursday considered       amendments to the Streamlined Procedures Act  S 1088  during its       executive business meeting  The panel did not vote on the bill        which remains pending before the Committee  Below is Senator       Leahys statement from the session earlier today     Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On Habeas Legislation  S 1088       Executive Business Meeting      October 6  2005  The Committee is returning today       to S 1088  the so called Streamlined Procedures Act  This       bill first appeared on our agenda back in late June  At that       time  we were told that the bill was a rather modest proposal       that was very narrow in scope  It was such a modest little       bill that no hearing was necessary   What we now know is that this       bill is far from modest  Indeed  the only thing modest about       it are the minor changes that have been made in the intervening       period  We have now heard from a wide range of experts and       practitioners who work in the criminal justice system and apply       the present rules governing habeas corpus on a daily basis  And       what we have heard repeatedly from them is that this bill would            impose radical and unprecedented restrictions on the Great Writ       of habeas corpus  without any compelling justification   In August  the Conference of       Chief Justices and the Conference of State Court Administrators       passed Joint Resolution 16  urging us to slow down  The       Resolution notes that the far reaching changes contemplated by       S 1088 may preclude state defendants in both capital and       non capital matters from seeking habeas corpus relief in the       federal courts  and may deprive the federal courts of       jurisdiction in the vast majority of these matters  all with       unknown consequences for the state courts and for the       administration of justice  It urges Congress to delay further       action on the bill pending additional study and analysis   When Resolution 16 was adopted       in August  it was supported by all but one state chief justice        Chief Justice Wallace Jefferson of the Texas Supreme Court       abstained from voting at that time because he wanted more time       to familiar himself with the issues  Having taken that time  he       has now joined the Resolution  In a letter dated  September 19        2005  Chief Justice Jefferson  the top judge in the Nations       most active death penalty State  wrote as follows    It is an unfortunate fact that       some people are wrongfully convicted  Resources for indigent       defense are scarce  and  while  Texas has made great strides in       providing counsel in criminal cases  work still remains to be       done      When the system       fails and an innocent person is convicted  the writ of habeas       corpus can play a key role in restoring justice   The State chief justices are now       unanimous in opposing S 1088  We have also heard from the       federal judiciary  The Judicial Conference has expressed its       strong opposition to virtually every provision of the bill  The       Judicial Conference has written to us twice about the bill          the letters are dated July 13 and September 26  I urge my       colleagues to read these letters carefully  if you havent       already  They reflect careful analysis of the changes proposed       by S 1088  and assess the real world consequences of those       changes    Here is what the Judicial       Conference had to say about the bill    The proposed Streamlined       Procedures Act     attempts to expedite the processing of habeas       corpus petitions by creating a stringent system of forfeitures       for federal constitutional claims   Not only could it create       unreasonable obstacles to resolution of such claims        but it has the potential for       complicating and protracting litigation in both state       and federal courts  Furthermore     these procedural       requirements may prove very difficult for applicants    many of       whom do not have lawyers  to meet   In analyzing S 1088  the       Judicial Conference reviewed the available statistical data  It       concluded that the data as a whole does  not support the need       for another wholesale rewriting of federal habeas corpus law        In fact  the vast majority of habeas cases appear to be moving       expeditiously through the system   Let me briefly mention some of       the other opposition that has been voiced to this legislation         The American Bar Association has       expressed strong opposition to the bill  Among other problems        the  ABA says the bill inadequately       protects the innocent by proposing virtually unattainable       procedural and other requirements to establish innocence   More than 20 current and former       state and federal judges have urged us to reject the bill        calling it misguided and dangerous    Two former FBI Directors          William Sessions and William Webster  oppose the bill  They       say it would prohibit habeas review of claims of innocence and       wrongful conviction   In July  we received a letter       signed by more than  50 former prosecutors and law       enforcement officers  strongly opposing the bill  They wrote us       again earlier this month  to say that the new version of the       bill  while it drops some objectionable provisions  remains       deeply flawed    A former District Attorney for       the  County of Los Angeles wrote a       blistering opinion editorial this week in the  Los Angeles Times        He wrote  This legislation  ostensibly designed to make the       justice system more efficient  is a Trojan horse whose       transparent purpose is to strip the federal courts of virtually       all of their jurisdiction to review state criminal court       proceedings   Other opponents of S 1088       include the U S  Conference of Catholic Bishops  the NAACP Legal       Defense Fund  the American Conservative Union  and former       Solicitor General Seth Waxman    We should not approve the bill       in its current form  The jurisdiction stripping provisions       would flatly prohibit federal courts from reviewing meritorious       claims of constitutional violations  The actual innocence       exceptions remain unrealistically demanding  And in a strange       parody of federalism  the bill invites federal courts to       second guess state court rulings on matters of state law  I       will have more to say about these and other defects when we       begin considering amendments
