       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The Authority To Prosecute Terrorists   Under The War Crimes Provisions Of Title 18                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     The Authority To Prosecute Terrorists Under     The War Crime Provisions Of Title 18     August 2  2006 In 1996  working with the Department of      Defense  Congress passed the War Crimes Act to provide criminal      penalties for certain war crimes committed by and against      Americans  The next year  again with the Pentagons support       Congress extended the War Crimes Act to violations of the baseline      humanitarian protections afforded by Common Article 3 of the Geneva      Conventions  Both measures were supported by a broad bipartisan      consensus  and I was proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments   The legislation was uncontroversial for a good      reason  As I explained at the time  the purpose and effect of the      War Crimes Act as amended is to provide for the implementation of      Americas commitment to the basic international norms we subscribed      to when we ratified the Geneva Conventions in 1955  Those norms are      truly universal  They condemn war criminals whoever and wherever      they are   That is a critically important aspect of the      Geneva Conventions and our own War Crimes Act  When we are dealing      with fundamental norms that define the commitments of the civilized      world  we cannot have one rule for us and one for them  however we      define us and them   As Justice Jackson said at the Nuremberg      tribunals  We are not prepared to lay down a rule      of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to      have invoked against us   In that regard  I was disturbed      to read recent reports that the Department of Justice is drafting      legislation to narrow the scope of the War Crimes Act to exclude      violations of the Geneva Conventions and retroactively immunize past      violations  Before taking such a drastic step there is much we need      to know  In particular  I have been concerned for some time that      this President has thought he could immunize conduct otherwise      illegal  I want to know whether the Administration has sought to      immunize illegal conduct and on what basis   But the Chairman convened this hearing today to      consider the Governments authority to prosecute terrorists under      the War Crimes Act  It has long been open to the Administration to      charge suspected terrorists  including those imprisoned at      Guantanamo Bay  with federal crimes  In addition to the War Crimes      Act  federal law provides criminal penalties for terrorism  torture       hostage taking  and other acts considered grave breaches of the      Geneva Conventions  regardless of where these acts may occur  And      unlike the international law of war  Federal law allows for      prosecution of the crime of conspiracy   There is ample authority under federal law for      the prosecution of international terrorists  But for various      reasons  some good and some bad  the Administration has made little      use of that authority against suspected terrorists  As far as I can      tell  the Ashcroft Justice Department and the Gonzales Justice      Department have yet to file a single charge against anyone for      violation of the War Crimes Act  Nor has the Administration made      use of the processes and procedures set forth in the Manual for      Courts Martial and the Uniform Code of Military Justice  Instead  the Bush Cheney      Administration has pursued a two pronged strategy  First  with      respect to the vast majority of the 700 plus prisoners at Guantanamo      and the unidentified prisoners in secret prisons abroad  the      Administration has frankly stated that it has no interest in trying      them in any court  civilian or military  Second  this Administration has      decided to bring a small number of detainees before military      commissions  I have no objection in principle to the use of      military commissions  Indeed  I introduced legislation to authorize      procedures for military commissions back in February 2002 after      holding hearings in 2001 on the issue  I invited the Administration      to work with Congress on legislative authority for such      commissions  Regrettably  when the Administration had the option to      work in a constructive way with Congress  it chose its customary      path of secrecy and unilateralism  This Administrations      go it alone approach yielded the predictable result after four      years  it has achieved nothing other than an embarrassing defeat in      the United States Supreme Court  Not a single suspected terrorist      has been held accountable before a military commission in the last      six years   The Courts landmark      separation of powers decision in Hamdan compelled the      Bush Cheney Administration to finally come to Congress to request      authorizing legislation  I was encouraged to read the testimony the      uniformed witnesses provided before the Armed Services Committee  in      which they indicated that the starting point for legislation should      be the well established rules governing courts martial  But when      the Administrations civilian lawyers came before this Committee       they instead argued that Congress should rubberstamp the problematic      procedures that the Supreme Court struck down   What is at stake for all      Americans as these decisions are made  are our American values and      the primacy in our system of government of the rule of law    Today  we have before us some      of the uniformed witnesses who testified before the Armed Services      Committee  I look forward to the testimony of the JAG officers       They have been trying to uphold the best military justice      traditions  but have too often been cut out of this Administrations      deliberations  I thank them for their services and their      willingness to work with us in Congress and to share their views       I look forward to our      consideration at this hearing whether the War Crimes Act provisions      should be expanded to include additional offenses  In the future I      hope that that they will be willing to appear before our Committee       again  as we consider how to construct military commissions
