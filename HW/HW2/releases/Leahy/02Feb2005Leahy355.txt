       Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy  Response to Charge That Gonzales  Bears No Responsibility For Torture Policies                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT                Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy       Response to Charge that       Gonzales Bears No Responsibility       for Torture Policies      February2  2005    MR  LEAHY  I have been       following the remarks of other Senators on this nomination        This morning we have heard many excellent speeches and I       commend my colleague from             Vermont  Senator Jeffords  for his statement  Yesterday we       heard thoughtful statements from Senators Feinstein        Schumer  Kennedy  Mikulski  Dayton  and Stabenow  and I       commend them as well     As I have listened to the       statements of those supporting this nomination I am glad       that none of them is defending torture  None of them is       defending what happened at Abu Ghraib  And none of them is       defending the Bybee memorandum  with its narrow  legalistic       interpretation of the torture statute  and its outrageous       claim that the President is above the law  In fact some       have been quite explicitly critical of the Bybee memo        Unfortunately  the nominee has not joined in that       criticism  Instead  he told me at his hearing that he       agreed with its conclusions and we know for at least two       years he did not disagree while it was the secret policy of       this Administration   Water flows downhill  and so       does government policy in this Administration  Somewhere in       the upper reaches of this Administration  a process was set       in motion that rolled forward until it produced scandalous       results  We may never know the full story  because the       Administration has circled the wagons and stonewalled on       requests for information  What little we know we owe to       leaks  to the initiative of the press  to international       human rights organizations  and to a few internal Defense       Department investigations  and to Freedom of Information Act       litigation   In particular  and despite       repeated requests before  during  and after Judge Gonzaless       confirmation hearing  there is much we still do not know        We gave this nominee every opportunity before  during and       after his hearing to clarify his role in these matters  We       do know that he was chairing meetings and requesting memos       and checking up on those memos as various government       agencies were being tasked with eroding long established                  U S  policy on torture  Just this week  the  New York Times       reported that the Justice Department produced a second       torture memo to address the legality of specific       interrogation techniques proposed by the CIA  So much for       proponents arguments that these memoranda were research       memos with little real world impact  That second torture       memo  which the Administration has refused to provide to the       Judiciary Committee  reportedly uses the very narrow and        thus  permissive interpretation of the torture statute       outlined in the first memorandum  Quite simply  the       Administration will not come clean from behind the stone       wall it has constructed to deter accountability for these       actions  Does anyone really believe that this memo was       generated without knowledge of the White House and without       its approval     President Bush said that he       chose Judge Gonzales because of his sound judgment in       shaping the Administrations terrorism policies  But the       glimpses we have seen of secret policy formulations and       legal rationales that have come to light show that his       judgments in fact have not been sound   Let me start with the       obvious  Judge Gonzales role with respect to the Bybee       memo  This is the memo that noted legal scholar Dean Koh of       the             Yale Law School called perhaps the most clearly erroneous       legal opinion I have ever read and a stain upon our law       and our national reputation     In remarks yesterday        Republican Senators  quite correctly  in my view  and in       the view of many others who have studied it    said the       Bybee memo was erroneous in its legal conclusions  as has       been generally agreed to  They called the memos       interpretation of what constitutes torture very  very       extreme  certainly not a realistic or an adequate        definition of torture which would withstand legal analysis       or legal scrutiny  They said  The memorandum was extreme       and excessive in its statement and articulation of executive       power  Even supporters of Judge Gonzales distanced       themselves from the Bybee memos conclusion that the       President has authority to immunize those who violate the       law noting that certainly is not lawful  These are the       statements of Republican Senators but they should not be       confused with statements by the nominee  who has refused to       criticize its legalistic excuses for recalibrations of       decades of law and practice    Blind defenders say that Judge       Gonzales did not write the Bybee memo as if that is where       the inquiring should stop  What is apparent from the face       of the memo is that Judge Gonzales commissioned it  The       memo is titled  Memorandum for Alberto R  Gonzales  Counsel       to the President  and the first line begins  You have       asked for our Offices views regarding the standards of       conduct under the Convention Against Torture    Nor did Judge Gonzales simply       request the Departments views and then sit back and wait       for a response  He acknowledged at the hearing that he       spoke with Justice Department lawyers during the drafting of       the Bybee memo and then described a give and take process       during its formulation  He said there were  quote  some       discussions in my office about the legality of specific       interrogation techniques  although he could not recall what       was said  He added  in response to questions by Senator       Kennedy  This is an issue that the White House cared very       much about  and we wanted to make sure that we got it       right  Far from getting it right  he and they got it       wrong  In fact  one Republican Senator called the memo       exactly wrong    Senate supporters of this       nomination have not defended the Bybee memo  On the       contrary  on this floor in the last 24 hours they have       readily conceded it was wrong as a matter of law and policy   One of the interrogation       techniques that Judge Gonzales and others admitted       discussing in his office was waterboarding  which involves       strapping a person to a board  raising his feet above his       head  wrapping his face and nose in a wet towel  and       dripping water onto the head  The object is to simulate the       suffocating effects of drowning  Judge Gonzales       acknowledged that he participated in discussions about       waterboarding  but said  I cant tell you today whether or       not I said  That s offensive  Thats not offensive  If       another country subjected our citizens to waterboarding        would any of us hesitate to condemn the practice as       offensive    I think it is much more than       offensive  I think it is barbaric  This President spoke       out against demeaning Americans in any way in the first days       of his military offense two years ago  Many of us  both       Republicans and Democrats denounced the pubic display of       American prisoners in Desert Storm and more recently as       abhorrent  Are we to understand that Judge Gonzales  as the       closest legal adviser to the President  headed the       Administrations effort to reinterpret the law and chaired       meetings in the White House to discuss whether waterboarding       and other torture techniques were to be utilized by American       personnel  Are we to disregard the redefinition of       torture that  once it became public  was rejected even by       the Justice Department as untenable   Judge Gonzales requested the       Bybee memo  he held meetings with the lawyers who were       drafting the memo to discuss their analysis  and  when the       final memo was delivered to his office in August 2002  he       accepted it on behalf of the President and this       Administration  It was the governing policy of this       Administration for more than two yearsso long as it was       kept secret  Republican Senators now admit that the memos       interpretation of torture was certainly not a realistic or       an adequate  definition of torture which would withstand       legal analysis or legal scrutiny  That is putting it       mildly  But Judge Gonzales did not question it  Until the       memo was made public it was doctrine  this Administrations       guiding policy that provided legal justification for       practices that the Army Field Manual would have forbidden         I asked Judge Gonzales whether       he agreed with the Bybee memos interpretation of the       torture statute back in August 2002  He replied  I dont       recall today whether or not I was in agreement with all of       the analysis  but I dont have a disagreement with the       conclusions then reached by the Department  The Department       itself has repudiated and withdrawn the Bybee memo  but       Judge Gonzales still apparently accepts its conclusions         Many of us were particularly       troubled by the nominees refusal to repudiate the notion       that the President has authority as Commander in Chief to       override the torture statute and immunize from prosecution       those who commit torture under his order  He had many       opportunities to do so  Senators asked his views on this       issue more than a dozen times during the hearing  and again       in written questions  He would not give a straight answer        At times  both during the hearing and at an earlier press       conference  Judge Gonzales assumed that the President did       possess the authority to authorize the use of torture  as       the Bybee memo concluded  This is despite federal law       against torture and our ratification of the Convention       Against Torture  This is despite the fact that  as one       Republican Senator said in yesterdays debate  the Bybee       memorandum vastly overstated executive authority  and its       conclusions were far  far off base  and palpably       erroneous    Judge Gonzales showed his       support for the Bybee memo in another way  by rewarding the       author  As White House Counsel  Judge Gonzales vetted the       nomination of Jay Bybee to sit on the Ninth Circuit Court of       Appeals  Apparently  neither Judge Gonzales nor anyone else       in the White House had any concern with Mr  Bybees       reasoning or conclusions  When we asked about his work at       the Department of Justice  this work product was hidden from       us  Mr  Bybee was rewarded for his work with a lifetime       appointment to the federal judiciary  Now  many months       after he was confirmed and after we have seen his handiwork        the Bybee memo has been withdrawn and is universally       repudiated   In light of the strong       criticism of the Bybee memo  perhaps others in the Senate       today now share my profound regret that this body approved       the elevation of the author of this disgraceful  then secret       memo to a lifetime judicial appointment without our being       able to even see this memo  let alone to have the ability to       question the author about it  To prevent such regret in the       future  we must ensure that full disclosure and careful       scrutiny of each nominee occurs in the future  Instead        this Administration continues to play hide the ball  They       release only those letters and papers they deem helpful to       their narrow interests and cloak the rest in secrecy        Critical information is locked away from the peoples       lawfully elected representatives in the Senate and from the       American people  as well   Judge Gonzales has argued that       the Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or       Degrading Treatment or Punishment does not prohibit cruel        inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment with respect       to aliens overseas  Reaching this conclusion requires such       twisted reasoning that even those who support Judge Gonzales       must part company with him  I received a letter in late       January from former State Department Legal Advisor Abe       Sofaer  He worked on the Torture Convention during the Bush       I Administration  and presented the Administrations       proposed reservations to the Senate Foreign Relations       Committee  While Judge Sofaer supports the nominee and       hopes he will be confirmed he disagrees with both the       merits and the wisdom of the nominees conclusion       concerning the geographic reach of the torture convention        This is yet another example of this nominee using twisted       legal reasoning to justify this Administrations desired       outcome   The nominee testified that  in       his view  the Hamdi       decision by the United States Supreme Court was an       affirmation of the Administrations far reaching claims of       presidential authority to detain             U S  citizens as enemy combatants                   In fact  the Court held that Congress  not the President        had authorized detention of someone like Hamdi captured on       the battlefield in Afghanistan  but even that detention was       subject to limits and judicial checks     I am disturbed by Judge       Gonzaless interpretation of the Geneva Conventions  Judge       Gonzales did not follow the advice he received from       Secretary of State Powell  the former Chairman of the Joint       Chiefs of Staff  and other State Department lawyers  He did       not stand up for the military and interpret our obligations       consistent with the Army Field Manual and the decades of       sound practice and counsel from the Judge Advocates General       corps  Instead  he advocated the position of ideologically       driven  political appointees at the Department of Justice        The Administration and the nominee refuse to provide us with       Judge Gonzales final memorandum on this matter  leading us       to wonder whether his position and logic cannot withstand       scrutiny  and whether it is another ends oriented analysis       designed to justify the circumvention of the law     As the chief legal adviser to       the President this nominee has admitted his involvement in       the Bybee memo and his own memoranda to the President        Those matters we know about in large part because of the       press  The Administration has yet to come clean on so many       other important questions in which the Presidents legal       advisers and White House counsels office were most likely       involved  We need to know whether and if so how our country       became involved in turning prisoners over to nations where       they faced torture  or in the hiding of ghost detainees       from the International Committee of the Red Cross  This       Administration circles the wagons as if these scandals will       go away and no one will notice  They wish only to blame       those on the lowest rungs of the chain of command     As our nations chief law       enforcement officer  Judge Gonzaless judgment about our       laws would be of enormous consequence  He has supported       policies that are in fundamental conflict with decades of       our laws  sound military practice  international law and       human rights  It is precisely because I lack confidence in       his judgment that I cannot support his nomination to be       Attorney General
