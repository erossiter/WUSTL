       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Nomination Of John Danial Tinder To The   Seventh Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On The Nomination Of John Daniel Tinder To The      Seventh Circuit  December 18  2007     We end the 2007 legislative session as we      began it  by making significant progress confirming the Presidents      nominations for lifetime appointments to the federal bench  At the      Judiciary Committees first business meeting of the year  held less      than two weeks after the Republican caucus agreed to the resolutions      organizing the Senate  I included on our agenda five judicial      nominations  On January 30  the Senate confirmed the first two      judicial nominations of the session  Todays confirmation of John      Daniel Tinder to the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit will      be the 40th  including six of this Presidents      nominations to powerful circuit courts         I thank the Members of the Judiciary Committee for their hard work      all year in considering these important nominations  I thank      especially those Senators who have given generously of their time to      chair confirmation hearings throughout the year      Given the work of the Senators serving on      the Judiciary Committee  we will have exceeded the yearly total in      each of the last three years when a Republican majority managed the      Senate and the consideration of this Republican Presidents      nominations  Indeed  with the confirmation today of Judge Tinder to      replace Judge Daniel A  Manion  like that of Reed OConnor who was      confirmed last month to the Northern District  we are proceeding to      fill vacancies before they even arise          The progress we have made this year in      considering and confirming judicial nominations is sometimes lost      amid the partisan sniping over a handful of controversial      nominations and attempts to appeal to some on the far right wing      When we confirm the nomination we consider today  the Senate      will have confirmed 40 nominations for lifetime appointments to the      Federal bench this session alone  That is more than the total      number of judicial nominations that a Republican led Senate      confirmed in all of 1996  1997  1999  2000  2004  2005 or 2006  It      is 23 more confirmations than were achieved during the entire 1996      session  more than double that sessions total of 17  when      Republicans stalled consideration of President Clintons      nominations  It is seven more than the confirmations in the second      to last year of President Clintons final term          We continue to make progress on circuit      court nominations  We began the year by resolving an unnecessary      controversy over Judge Norman Randy Smiths nomination to one      of Californias seats on the Ninth Circuit  That nomination could      easily have been confirmedand a judicial emergency addressedin the      last Congress had the Bush Administration chosen the common sense      approach of nominating Judge Smithwho is from Idahoto Idahos seat      on the Ninth Circuit  After many months of urging by me and others       President Bush finally did the right thing at the beginning of this      Congress by pulling the controversial Myers nomination to Idahos      Ninth Circuit seat and nominating Judge Smith  instead  He was      confirmed in February  We could make even more progress if the      President would make a California nomination to fill the long vacant      California Ninth Circuit seat left open by Judge Stephen Trotts      retirement             We continued through the year to consider and confirm district and      circuit court judges  In October  the      Senate confirmed the nominations of Judges Jennifer Walker Elrod and      Judge Leslie Southwick  who became the fourth and fifth circuit      court nominees confirmed this year          After this confirmation today  the Senate      will have confirmed six circuit court nominees  matching the total      circuit court confirmations for all of 2001  We will also have      exceeded the circuit court totals achieved in all of 2004 when a      Republican led Senate was considering this Presidents circuit      nominees  all of 1989  all of 1983  when a Republican led Senate was      considering President Reagans nominees  all of 1993 when a      Democratic led Senate was considering President Clintons nominees       and  of course  the entire 1996 session during which a      Republican led Senate did not confirm a single one of President      Clintons circuit nominees the entire session         The treatment of President Clintons nominees contrasts harshly with      the treatment Democrats gave the circuit court nominees of      Presidents Reagan and Bush in the Presidential election years of      1988 and 1992  In those two election years  the      Democratic controlled Senate averaged nine circuit court      confirmations  Regrettably  the Republican Senate reversed that      course in the treatment of President Clintons circuit court      nominations  confirming an average of only four in the Presidential      election years of 1996 and 2000  and none in the entire 1996      session         At the end of the 106th Congress  the last two years of      the Clinton Administration  the Republican led Senate returned to      the President without action 17 of his appellate court nominees  I      have not duplicated that record and I do not intend to  any more      than I intend to see the Senate pocket filibuster more than 60 of      President Bushs judicial nominees  as Republicans did with      President Clintons              It is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency  more      circuit judges  more district judges    more total judges         were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary      Chairman than during the 2 year tenures of either of the two      Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities             I continue to try to find ways to make progress  Last month  I sent      the President a letter urging him to work with me  Senator Specter       and home state Senators to send us more well qualified  consensus      nominations  Now is the time for him to send us more nominations      that could be considered and confirmed as his     Presidency approaches its last year       before the Thurmond Rule kicks in       As I noted in that letter  I have been concerned that several recent      nominations seem to be part of an effort to pick political fights      rather than judges to fill vacancies       For example  President Bush nominated Duncan Getchell to one of      Virginias Fourth Circuit Vacancies over the objections of Senators      Warner and Webb  one a Republican and one a Democrat  They had      submitted a list of five recommended nominations  and specifically      warned the White House not to nominate Mr  Getchell  As a result       this nomination that is opposed by Democratic and Republican      home state Senators is one that cannot move       The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts will list 43 judicial      vacancies and 14 circuit court vacancies after todays      confirmations  Compare that to the numbers at the end of the 109th      Congress  when the total vacancies under a Republican controlled      Judiciary Committee were 51 judicial vacancies and 15 circuit court      vacancies  That means  that despite the additional 5 vacancies that      arose at the beginning of the 110th Congress  the current      vacancy totals under my chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee are      below where they were under a Republican led Judiciary Committee                  The President has sent us 27 nominations for these remaining      vacancies  Sixteen of these vacancies  more than one third  have      no nominee  Of the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office      to be judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us      nominees for seven  nearly half of them  If the President would      decide to work with the Senators from Michigan  Rhode Island       Maryland  California  New Jersey  and Virginia  we could be in      position to make even more progress              Of the 16 vacancies without any nominee  the President has violated      the timeline he set for himself at least 11 times    11 have been      vacant without so much as a nominee for more than 180 days  The      number of violations may in fact be much higher since the President      said he would nominate within 180 days of receiving notice that      there would be a vacancy or intended retirement rather than from the      vacancy itself  We conservatively estimate that he also violated      his own rule 15 times in connection with the nominations he has      made  That would mean that with respect to the 43 vacancies  the      President is out of compliance with his own rule more than half of      the time              We have succeeded in dramatically lowering vacancies and  in      particular  circuit court vacancies  We have helped cut the circuit      vacancies from a high water mark of 32 in the early days of this      Administration to as low as 13 this year  Contrast that with the      Republican led Senates lack of action on President Clintons      moderate and qualified nominees that resulted in increasing circuit      vacancies during the Clinton years from 17 when he was inaugurated      to 26 at the end of his term  During those years  the      Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous and successful efforts      under the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of      a Republican President  More than 60 percent of current circuit      court judges were appointed by Republican Presidents  with the      current President having appointed more than 30 percent of the      active circuit judges already              The American peopleexpect the federal courts to be fair forums      where justice is dispensed without favor to the right or the left       I have set out since the beginning of this Congress to do all that I      can to ensure that the federal judiciary remains independent and      able to provide justice to all Americans  These are the only      lifetime appointments in our entire government  and they matter  I      will continue in the 2008 session to work with Senators from both      sides of the aisle as I have in the 2007 session       John Daniel Tinder has a decade of service as a District Court Judge      for the Southern District of Indiana  Before his tenure on the      bench  he worked for seven years at the Justice Department as U S       Attorney and Assistant U S  Attorney for the Sothern District of      Indiana  He has worked in private practice and has experience as a      county prosecutor and county public defender      His nomination has the support of both      home state Senators  I acknowledge the support of Senators Lugar      and Bayh  and want to thank Senator Durbin for chairing the hearing      on this nomination          While I support Judge Tinders confirmation  I am concerned about      his answer to a question I sent him on the legal significance of      Presidential signing statements  I asked Judge Tinder if an alleged      violation of the law prohibiting cruel  inhuman  and degrading      conduct by American personnel were to come before a court  would it      be appropriate for that court to consider the Presidents signing      statement as legislative history  in addition to the text of law      itself  I am troubled by Judge Tinders answer that he is open to      looking at signing statements as a tool for determining the meaning      of a statute              Throughout the countrys history  Presidents used signing statements      for limited purposes  such as explaining to the public the likely      effects of legislation or providing direction to administrative      agencies within the Executive Branch  It has long been considered      out of bounds for any President to use signing statements  which      are at most post passage remarks  for the more expansive and      controversial purpose of creating legislative history that our      courts would be expected to follow  Legislative history is created      within the Congress  which is charged by the Constitution with      considering and passing laws  The President may veto legislation       but the constitutional system of checks and balances does not allow      the President to speak for Congress             The Nation stands at a pivotal moment in      history  where Americans are faced with a President who makes      sweeping claims for almost unchecked Executive power      This President has used signing statements      to challenge laws banning torture  laws on affirmative action  and      laws that prohibit the censorship of scientific data  When      the President uses signing statements to unilaterally rewrite laws      enacted by Congress  he undermines the rule of law and our      constitutional checks and balances  It is incumbent upon the      federal judiciary  to safeguard and protect the constitutional      balance when necessary             I hope that Judge Tinder will fulfill his oath and be an independent      buffer against constitutional overreaching  I congratulate the      nominee and his family on his confirmation today
