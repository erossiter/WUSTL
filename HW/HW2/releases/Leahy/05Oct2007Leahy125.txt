       Crisis In Burma                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               STATEMENT OF SENATOR PATRICK LEAHY  The Crisis In Burma  October 4  2007 MR  LEAHY  Mr      President  I spoke last week in this chamber about the political crisis     in Burma where thousands of Buddhist monks  joined by an estimated     100 000 other Burmese citizens  peacefully protested for an end to     military dictatorship  Despite appeals for     restraint by governments around the world  as well as the UN Secretary     General  they were met with brute force  Soldiers firing live bullets     and wielding clubs killed and injured an undetermined number of unarmed     civilians  including at least one foreign journalist  and there are     reports that hundreds  and possibly thousands  of monks have been     beaten  killed or jailed   The atrocities     perpetrated by the Burmese generals are crimes against humanity  They     should be indicted and prosecuted by the International Criminal Court      Sooner or later they     will be made to pay for the appalling brutality that has been witnessed     on television by hundreds of millions of people around the world    The United States     has imposed economic sanctions on the Burmese government for many years      thanks in large measure to the tireless efforts of Senator McConnell     who  for the better part of two decades  has called for the release of     Aung San Suu Kyi  Burmas rightful leader   Additional sanctions     were announced  belatedly  by President Bush last week  But far more     pressure is needed  particularly to convince Burmas trading partners      like China  India and Thailand  to cut their economic ties to Burma  It     is thanks in large part to them that the Burmese generals owe their     power and wealth   The crisis in Burma     today tarnishes any government that values its financial interests over     freedom for the Burmese people  For two decades  they have chafed     under the iron grip of a clique of corrupt generals who have shown  year     after year  that they belong in the category of ruthless despots who     will stop at nothing  including mass murder  to perpetuate their     control   Lasting economic      social and political stability in Burma can only begin once the Burmese     generals relinquish power  How that comes about is their choice  We     have seen the results of peaceful protest  Not even civil disobedience      just peaceful protest  Time and again it has been met with deadly     force   Mr  President  those     nations that continue to do business with Burma make a mockery of their     own professed commitment to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights      There is no truer test of their commitment to those fundamental     principles than how they respond to the slaughter of unarmed monks and     civilians by a regime that is apparently unconcerned that their crimes     are being televised to the world  Whether this year      next year  or there after  the Burmese juntas days are numbered  Where     do Burmas trading partners want to be then  on the right side of     history  or having propped up an illegitimate regime until its last     gasps  No government can     claim perfection in its respect for human rights  including my own     government  We have made mistakes  and it has damaged our credibility     as a nation that was instrumental in the creation of the Universal     Declaration   But our own short     comings are no excuse for other governments actions to block UN     resolutions condemning the crackdown in Burma or their refusal to join     us in imposing economic sanctions that could deal a death blow to a     tyrannical regime  And it is certainly     no excuse for continuing to do lucrative business deals with a     government whose officials pocket the profits for themselves while they     starve  imprison and murder their people   Mr  President  it is     a testament to the spirit of the Burmese people  and to the courage of     Aung San Suu Kyi  that despite so many years of repression  they remain     as defiant and as dedicated to the ideals of democracy as ever  Our     moral responsibility  the worlds responsibility  is to support them  I yield the floor
