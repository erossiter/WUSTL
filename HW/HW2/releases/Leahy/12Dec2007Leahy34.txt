       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On S 1782  The Arbitration Fairness Act Of   2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D VT        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing Before The Subcommittee On The Constitution    On     S  1782  The Arbitration Fairness Act Of 2007     December 12  2007    Todays hearing     addresses an issue that I have been concerned about for many years       Binding Mandatory Arbitration  BMA  provisions that require consumers to     give up their right to have disputes resolved by a judge or jury      Companies are unilaterally inserting mandatory  binding arbitration     clauses in their agreements that consumers and employees must sign as a     condition of employment  or for receiving medical care  buying a car      opening a bank account or getting a credit card  Few people understand     that the fine print of these clauses strips them of their constitutional     right to have disputes resolved in court      Arbitration is     credible and effective only when consumers enter into it knowingly      intelligently and voluntarily  Unfortunately  many individuals are     unaware that they are even entering into a mandatory binding arbitration     agreement  That is why I have joined with Senator Feingold to cosponsor     the Arbitration Fairness Act of 2007  S  1782  This bill would protect     consumers against BMA provisions by requiring that agreements to     arbitrate employment  consumer  franchise  or civil rights disputes be     made after the dispute has arisen  Such timing would ensure the     voluntariness of the decision to waive the constitutional right to a     jury trial and go to arbitration     Every American     should have meaningful legal recourse to resolve disputes  and I believe     that this legislation is a step in the right direction  I thank the     Chairman of the Subcommittee on the Constitution for calling this     hearing and for introducing legislation to address this growing and     pervasive problem
