       Leahy To Vote No On Iraq Spending Plan                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy To Vote No On Iraq Spending Plan  Statement    Of U S  Senator Patrick Leahy   On The Fiscal Year 2007 Emergency Supplemental   May 24  2007 Mr  President  I will vote against the Fiscal Year 2007    Emergency Supplemental conference report  Although there are many sound and    worthy provisions in this bill  such as assistance for Afghanistan and    other countries  and additional funds not requested by the Administration to    help address the backlog of equipment for the National Guard  the    inescapable fact is that this legislation would not reverse this    Administrations disastrous Iraq policy  I simply cannot vote in favor of a    bill  containing tens of billions of additional dollars for the Presidents    policy in Iraq  that does not begin to bring our troops home   As one of the 23 senators who opposed authorizing this    war  I believe it is vital that we send a strong signal that Congress is    going to exercise its Article I constitutional powers and end our central    involvement in Iraqs civil war  Every Senator  for or against this    military adventure  must take a stand on whether to continue the status quo    or change course  That  at the end of the day  is what this vote    represents  Congress had a workable and I believe widely acceptable    plan in the original version of this supplemental bill  Taking a page from    the Iraq Study Group recommendations  the plan was to end the military    mission in Iraq as we currently know it  We would reduce American forces to    the contingent necessary for limited Iraqi troop training  counter terrorism    operations  and protecting remaining American personnel   I and others joined with Senator Feingold in an effort    to strengthen that position by ensuring that no funding could go toward    deployment  beyond those narrow purposes  About a month ago  we all saw the    President veto the supplemental bill  Then last week  the President muscled    his congressional allies to vote against the stronger Feingold Reid Leahy    provision  So what we are left with is this new version of the    supplemental  the status quo  more of the same old stay the course  The    reality is that this new conference report does nothing to stop the    Presidents open ended escalation  It will not force the Iraqis to make the    difficult political compromises which they need to make  Nor will it begin    a redeployment of American forces  The final legislation drops the    mandatory timetable for planning and commencing redeployment with a targeted    completion date  Beyond some reporting requirements  there is no limitation    on troop levels  What the legislation does do is limit our aid to the    Iraqi government if actions toward reconciliation are not taken  although    the President may waive these limitations   I agree that we should tie our aid to the Iraqi    government to clear benchmarks  But that alone is not sufficient  The    reality is that despite spending hundreds of billions of dollars in Iraq     the violence has increased  We all know that the trends are going in the    wrong direction  This piecemeal approach assures that our troops will    remain in the middle of harms way for the foreseeable future   And when it comes to changing the dynamic in Iraq  it    is troop levels that matter  The introduction of more forces through this    open ended escalation that the President calls the surge is sending the    wrong signal to the Iraqis and to countries in the region that have    interests there  It says they do not have to make the tough decisions    because the American forces are there to do the dirty work  to spill their    blood and to contain sectarian militias or deal with unwelcome foreign    fighters   Rory Stewart  a perspicacious observer with hands on    experience in Iraq  rightly pointed out in a recent public forum that our    presence there is fundamentally undermining Iraqs political system     infantilizing Iraq politics  to use his phrase  He notes that Iraqi    politicians are far more capable of making deals and reaching compromise    than we think  but that our troop presence allows them to play hardball with    each other  Were we to leave  Mr  Stewart says  they would be weaker and    under more pressure to compromise  As I have said  there are many aspects of this    supplemental that I support  We have  for example  included  1 billion in    un requested funding to help rebuild our National Guard  which is suffering    from dangerously low equipment stocks because so much of the Guards    equipment has been sent to Iraq  We have funded the Marla Ruzicka Fund to    aid innocent Iraqi civilians who have suffered casualties  and a similar    program to aid civilian victims of war in Afghanistan  There is other    funding for refugees and humanitarian assistance in Africa and the Middle    East  as well as for Kosovo  I am gratified that we have been able to    include funding for elections in Nepal  to support reintegration of former    combatants in northern Uganda  and to begin the clean up of    dioxin contaminated sites in Vietnam and for health programs in nearby    communities   These are just a few of the things carried over from    the original  vetoed version of the bill that I support and for which I have    worked hard  I want to thank Senator Gregg  the Ranking Member of the    State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee  and our counterparts in the House     Chairwoman Lowey and Ranking Member Wolf  for working together in a    bipartisan way to allocate the foreign assistance funding in this bill   Yet there is a central fact that we must meet head on     This war has been a costly disaster for our country  Our ability to fight    terrorism  pursue our larger national security and foreign policy goals  and    secure the welfare of every American has been diminished because of it     Thousands of our troops have lost their lives or suffered grievous     life altering injuries  Tens of thousands  and possibly hundreds of    thousands    of innocent Iraqis have lost their lives  We have opened a    gaping wound in the Middle East and severely damaged our image and our    influence  This war has been a foreign policy failure of epic proportions     It is time to bring our troops home  It is time to    show the Iraqi people that they cannot expect us to make these sacrifices if    they wont make the hard decisions that are spread before them  I regret    that this legislation whitewashes what was a reasonable  good faith effort    to bring real pressure to bear in Baghdad and beyond  I cannot in good    conscious vote for it
