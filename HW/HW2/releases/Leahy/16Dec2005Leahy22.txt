       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Violence And Repression In Ethiopia                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Violence And Repression In Ethiopia December 16  2005 MR  LEAHY  On May 15  2005  Ethiopia held the      first open  multi party  democratic elections in its 3 000 year      history  It was an important milestone that gave the people of that      country a sense of national pride and hope  Unfortunately  the      elation that was so evident on election day was short lived       International observers cited serious vote counting irregularities      and flaws in the electoral process    Nearly 25 million Ethiopians  90 percent of      eligible voters  went to the polls and early counts indicated      strong support for the opposition  As it became clear that the      ruling party was in danger of losing its grip on power  the      government stopped the vote counting in a blatant move to manipulate      the results  Accusations of vote rigging forced the National      Electoral Board of Ethiopia  NEBE  to delay the release of the      official results  The controversy led to protests in Addis Ababa       the Oromiya regions  and other provinces  On June 8  in response to      protesters challenging the provisional results of the elections       Ethiopian security forces are accused of shooting at least 40      protestors  killing 26  temporarily detaining over 500 student      protestors and arresting at least 50 people  Ethiopias main      opposition political party  the Coalition for Unity and Democracy      Party  CUDP  refused to take its seats in parliament in protest of      the election results  Just recently  50 members of the CUDP took      their seats in Parliament  but there is some concern that they were      pressured into doing so    Last month  the situation in Ethiopia took a      further turn for the worse  On November 1  following street      demonstrations that erupted into four days of violence when police      started shooting  at least 46 protesters were killed in Addis Ababa      and other towns  and some 4 000 were arrested    There have been numerous reports of      widespread arbitrary detention  beatings  torture  disappearances       and the use of excessive force by police and soldiers against anyone      suspected of supporting the CUDP detainees   The detainees include distinguished Ethiopian      patriots such as Hailu Shawel  president of the CUDP  Professor      Mesfin Woldemariam  former chair of the Ethiopian Human Rights      Council  Dr  Yacob Hailemariam  a former UN Special Envoy and former      prosecutor at the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda  Ms       Birtukan Mideksa  CUDP vice president and a former judge  and Dr       Berhanu Negga  the recently elected Mayor of Addis Ababa and      university professor of economics    Today  the entire senior leadership of the CUDP      is reportedly in jail and has been held incommunicado in harsh      conditions  without access to their families or legal      representatives  Amnesty International considers these individuals      to be prisoners of conscience who have neither used nor advocated      violence  The government of Prime Minister Meles Zenawi is seeking      to charge them with treason  a capital offense  for the crime of      urging their supporters to engage in peaceful protest on their      behalf  CUDP leaders are scheduled to appear in court today       presumably to be officially charged with treason     Journalists and members of the media have also been jailed       According to the Committee to Protect Journalists  Ethiopian  authorities have prevented most private newspapers from      publishing  arrested or harassed local journalists and their family      members  and threatened to charge journalists with treason       Thirteen journalists have been detained since last months      anti government protests  including two more who were just arrested      this week    It is particularly disturbing  when one      considers these events  that since 1991 the government of Prime      Minister Meles has received billions of dollars in foreign aid       including to strengthen democratic institutions and the rule of law      in his country  Recently  the European Union suspended its aid to      Prime Minister Meles government and is seeking ways to channel it      to the Ethiopian people through private voluntary organizations  Last month  thousands of Ethiopians and their      supporters in this country came to Washington to protest the      violence and repression by the Meles government and to urge the Bush      Administration to help establish real democracy and the rule of law      in Ethiopia  Ethiopia has been an ally of the United States in      combating international terrorism  yet it is using similar tactics      against its own people   Mr  President  over the past several years       Ethiopia has made progress in both political reform and economic      development  But that progress has been overshadowed by the tragic      events of the past six months  The governments heavy handed      tactics to steal the election and persecute those who sought to play      by the rules of democracy  should be universally condemned  The Bush Administration      should make clear to Prime Minister Meles that if his government      does not abide by the basic principles of democracy  due process and      respect for human rights  including an end to the use of random      searches  beatings  mass arrests and lethal force against peaceful      protesters  and if political detainees are not released  that we      will join with the European Union and suspend our aid to his      government  including our support for financing from the World Bank      and the African Development Bank other than for basic human needs       There should be severe consequences for such a flagrant subversion      of the will of the Ethiopian people
