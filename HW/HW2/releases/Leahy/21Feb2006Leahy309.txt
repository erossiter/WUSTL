       Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Pending Transfer Of Operational   Control Of Six U S  Ports To A State Owned Firm In Dubai                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Impending Transfer Of Operational Control     Of Six U S  Ports     To A State Owned Firm In Dubai     Tuesday  Feb  21  2006   Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   is a      senior member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee of the Senate      Appropriations Committee    Democratic and Republican lawmakers      alike are rightly concerned about the Bush Administration s decision      to allow an Arab country with previous ties to terrorism to take      over the operation of six major U S  shipping ports  The President      and the Republican leadership in Congress should now join with      Democratic leaders in organizing a full review of the security      implications of this sale and a full investigation of how this      decision was made   Concerns about this sale are      heightened by the Administrations already anemic attention to port      and transportation security  This unwise transfer can only compound      the dangers and difficulties we face in securing our ports  While      this Administration has been quick to launch illegal spying on      Americans here at home  it has chronically neglected to adequately      recognize and act on the security weaknesses of our ports and      borders  Today  more than four years after 9 11  we still only      inspect 5 to 7 percent of all cargo coming into this country through      our ports   New indications that at least two      White House aides have ties of some kind to this company also raise      troubling questions about how this decision was made   The Administration should have      recognized that an unprecedented sale of this size and scope      requires extraordinary precautions to ensure that appropriate      security safeguards are in place at all of our ports  Instead  they      rushed through and rubberstamped a secret review  and now they once      again ask us to trust their vague assurances that adequate national      security arrangements are in place    The public deserves answers about how      this happened  and Congress also should consider legislative      safeguards to make sure it does not happen again  Legislation is      being readied that would prohibit companies owned or controlled by      foreign governments from purchasing U S  port operations and to      require that U S  port security officials be American citizens    Given the serious security      implications at stake  and given this Administration s recent      history  a prompt and thorough investigation is needed to get to the      bottom of this
