       Bond Leahy Seek To Empower National Guard                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Bond Leahy Seek To Empower National      Guard       Senators Testify Before Guard and Reserves Commission      WASHINGTON  March 8    U S  Sens  Kit Bond  R Mo   and Patrick Leahy       D Vt    the co chairs of the National Guard Caucus  testified today      at a hearing with the Commission on the National Guard and Reserves      about the importance of the National Guard and the need to give the      Guard a stronger voice   We      need to empower the National Guard  We need to give the Guard more      bureaucratic muscle  so that the force will not be continually      pushed around in policy and budget debates within the Pentagon       said Bond and Leahy in their joint testimony       Despite their vital contribution to the national defense  the Guard      is often treated as a lesser partner  said the Senators  Earlier      this month  Bond and Leahy led Senate opposition to Army proposals      to cut the National Guard  The Pentagon retreated on their plans to      scale back the Guard s force structure after the Senators organized      more than 75 Senators in opposition to the plan        Bond and Leahy stressed that the Army s original decision to cut the      Guard force structure and personnel end strength underscores the      larger problem  namely that the National Guard does not have a      substantive voice in key decisions that impact its force structure       personnel  readiness and budget  At      today s hearing focusing on current and future Guard roles  Bond and      Leahy said they will work to elevate and empower the Guard in the      coming months  The      Senators  legislative approach to strengthen the Guard would involve      four central planks             Allow the      National Guard Bureau to establish more formal relationships with      the Office of the Secretary of Defense and the Joint Chiefs of      Staff            Give the      Guard more muscle in the existing relationships  elevating the Chief      of the National Guard to a four star position and adding the Chief      to the Joint Chiefs of Staff           Ensure      that the Deputy Commander of U S  Northern Command is a member of      the National Guard            Give the      National Guard a budget that is separate from the service      procurement accounts        Bond and Leahy also stressed that the National Guard is a unique      dual mission force that can work effectively at home and abroad       Guard forces have comprised almost 50 percent of the combat force in      Iraq and 40 percent of the total force  Also  last year the Guard      fulfilled its homeland defense and civil support mission during the      response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita                   Comments Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy      Hearing Of The Commission On The National Guard And Reserve      Wednesday  March 8  2006   I appreciate having the       opportunity to testify before you today  Your panel has taken       on the timely and critical task of examining how we can keep the       National Guard and Reserve strong and ready  well into this new       century  I commend each of your for taking on the assignment        Chairman Punaro  it is great to see you again  You have already       provided enormous service to the country not only through your       highly regarded time in the Marine Corps  but also through your       work for so many years on the Armed Services Committee with our       friend Sam Nunn    You have a copy of our joint       testimony  I would like to join with Senator Bond in just       highlighting some key points    The National Guard has performed       spectacularly since September 11th  taking on a far       more operational role than ever before  We have all heard about       the Guards presence in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as its       important role in the recent hurricane relief efforts  Let us       not forget how  in the wake of the attacks  the Guard helped       provide air cover over key cities and increased security at the       nations airports  our borders  and right here at the Capitol    The attacks of 9 11 have been a       turning point for the Guard  And now  as the Commissions work       signifies  9 11 has also become a catalyst for evaluating the       Guards missions and needs  Since 9 11 the Guard has been       assigned more and more duties crucial to our domestic       preparedness and our national security  including two overseas       wars  Meanwhile the Guard has performed skillfully in the face       of national calamities like Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  Today       the National Guard is being asked to perform a post 9 11 role       with a pre 9 11 infrastructure  We cannot endlessly overlay       more and more burdens on the Guard without understanding and       then addressing the strains on the resources  the people and the       families of the National Guard    What the National Guard Caucus has       seen again and again is that the National Guards contributions       have received short thrift during policy and budget       discussions  Instead of more actively integrating the National       Guard into long range planning  which you would hope for and       expect  the National Guard has become increasingly frozen out       of these crucial deliberations    We saw the sad fruits of this       trend late last year  when the Army announced that it would seek       to cut almost 17 000 personnel from the Guard and that the Air       Force would seek an unspecified level of further cuts        Three quarters of the U S  Senate  75 senators in all  joined       us in opposing these recommendations  and we believe that both       services have backed away from those proposals  Yet those       proposals themselves highlight the lack of substantive input       from the National Guard     This discussion is about more than       making sure that we ensure that the Guard can continue to       actively support the Army and the Air Force  It is about how we       harness the National Guards natural ability to serve as a       homeland security force    Homeland security is not a major       focus of the Army and the Air Force  but it is for the National       Guard  Yet there is no real mechanism to ensure that the Guard       is properly structured and resourced to carry out that mission        The Guard still faces an enormous shortfall in equipment at       home  and there are still some in the Pentagon who dont       understand that the Guard brings special capabilities when       operating domestically    Senator Bond and I believe we must       do more to empower the National Guard  We plan to introduce       legislation that elevates the National Guard Bureau  giving it       more budgeting authority and promoting its chief to a four star       position on the Joint Chiefs of Staff  We also would like to       make sure that there is a National Guard deputy at Northern       Command    We want the Commission to know       that you have an ally in the Senates National Guard Caucus        The 82 senators who make up the Caucus have shown a willingness       to unite and to focus their efforts  on a bipartisan basis  for       the good of the National Guard and Reserve    We believe in taking the necessary       steps to ensure that the Guard remains effective and strong  and       we look forward to working with you to meet that critical goal          I look forward to your questions
