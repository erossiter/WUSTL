       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee On The   Judiciary  Hearing On Detainees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Hearing On Detainees     June 15  2005  It has been well over three years      since the Administration began to hold detainees at the U S  Naval      Base in Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  The first batch of 20 detainees      arrived in January 2002  There are now more than 500 detainees at      Guantanamo  although the exact number remains unclear     Todays hearing is a welcome  if long      overdue  opportunity to discuss what we should do with the      Guantanamo detainees and what role Congress should take in      developing long term policies for detaining and trying terrorism      suspects  I commend the Chairman for taking the initiative to      confront these important and difficult issues    No Coherent Process  The Administrations policies on      detainees are clearly not working  and the Administration does not      have a coherent theory for how to proceed  Late in 2001  military      commissions were defended by our current Attorney General as      tribunals that can dispense justice swiftly  close to where our      forces may be fighting  without years of pretrial proceedings or      post trial appeals  That was more than three years ago  But far      from assuring swift justice  there has been no justice at all  We      have yet to see a single military commission complete a hearing or      convict a suspected terrorist  and the whole process is now      hopelessly tied up in litigation   Until a year ago  the Administration      seemed to hold tight to the notion that by detaining prisoners at      Guantanamo Bay    a location where it asserted prisoners had no      right of access to the courts    it could shield itself from      judicial challenge  But the Supreme Court decision in  Rasul v  Bush rejected      this flawed legal theory  Now it seems that all the Administration      has left to cling to is the amorphous notion of a war on terror      that has no end    If the Administration had applied the      Geneva Conventions from the start  as former Secretary of State      Powell strongly urged it to do  we would not be in the mess we are      in today  Combatants who merited POW status could have been held      for the duration of active hostilities  Those who did not meet the      POW standards could be prosecuted under our existing criminal laws       or for violating the laws of war  These standards and procedures      were used for decades by our military  including in the first Gulf      War  Unfortunately  the Administration made its determination on      the basis of flawed understandings of the Geneva Conventions and      against the advice of military and State Department attorneys  We      now see the repercussions of those poorly conceived policies   Alternatively  if the Administration      had made better use of the Federal courts  we would not be in this      mess  The handful of suspected terrorists who were indicted for      their crimes have been severely punished  Shoe bomber Richard Reid      was sentenced to life in prison  John Walker Lindh  the so called      American Taliban  was sentenced to 20 years  as was the Ohio truck      driver who plotted to destroy the Brooklyn Bridge  Even Zacharias      Moussoui  whose case has been complex and challenging for all      involved  has now pleaded guilty  the only question remaining is      whether he faces life in prison or death    The Fruits Of      Unilateralism  What has become clear over the past      three years is that the Administrations policies were poorly      reasoned and extremely shortsighted  The Administrations      insistence on unilateralism  a tendency and a problem that has      colored and undermined so many of the Administrations policies       has led to poor decisions and poor practices in detention policies       as well  From the start  the Administrations answer to every      question about our detention policies has been  Trust us  Trust      us that we know the law  and that we will comply with it  Trust us      to treat detainees humanely and in accordance with our laws and      treaties  Trust us that Guantanamo will make Americans safer  More      than three years later  the one thing we know for certain is that      any trust we may have had was misplaced   First  the Administration did not know      or follow the law  The list of Federal court reversals of this      Administrations policies and practices is long  From the Supreme      Courts rejection of the claim that Guantanamo Bay is a land of      legal limbo  or  as one Administration official has said  the      legal equivalent of outer space  to a recent district court      holding that the current military commission regulations are      unlawful  there is much that needs attention and correction  The      Administration has also flagrantly violated our international treaty      obligations  International law  not to mention the Defense      Departments own policies  requires the registration and accounting      of all detainees  Yet we know that senior Administration officials      approved a policy of keeping detainees off of the official roles in      order to hide them from the International Committee of the Red      Cross  The Administration also continues to defend its use of      extraordinary rendition to transfer terrorism suspects in U S       custody to the custody of countries where they are likely to be      tortured  a patent violation of the Convention Against Torture        Second  the Administration has not      lived up to its promise to treat detainees humanely  Even with the      Administrations continued stonewalling against any independent      investigation into the mistreatment of detainees  we continue to      learn of more abuses on almost a daily basis  If American POWs were      treated in this way  the Administration would be up in arms  Yet      when these actions take place in Iraq  Afghanistan  or Guantanamo       the Administration refuses to acknowledge any wrongdoing  The      dangerous implications that this posture has for our own troops and      citizens are obvious    Third  and this brings us to the      bottom line  The net effect of all of these problems is that      Guantanamo has not made our country safer  It is increasingly clear      that the Administrations policies have seriously damaged our      reputation in the world and that they are making us less safe  The      stain of Guantanamo has become the primary recruiting tool for our      enemies  President Bush often speaks of spreading democratic values      across the Middle East  but Guantanamo is not a reflection of the      values that he encourages other nations to adopt  The United States      has often criticized other nations for operating secret prisons       where detainees are hidden away and denied any meaningful      opportunity to contest their detention  Now we have our own such      prisons  Even if the Administration fails to see the hypocrisy in      this situation  the rest of the world does not     A Festering Threat  Guantanamo      Bay  along with Abu Ghraib  is an international embarrassment to      our nation and to our ideals  and it remains a festering threat to      our security  America was once viewed as a leader in human rights      and the rule of law  but Guantanamo has undermined our leadership       damaged our credibility and drained the worlds goodwill for America      at alarming rates  Even our closest allies cannot condone the      policies embraced by this government  not to mention the significant      damage that has been caused by allegations and proven incidents of      detainee abuse in Iraq  Afghanistan  and Guantanamo  These are not      the policies of a great and just nation like ours  and this is not      the American system of justice   The 9 11 Commission understood that      military strength alone is not sufficient to defend our nation      against terrorism  there must also be a role for working      cooperatively with the rest of the world  In its report  the      Commission stated that the U S  government must define what the      message is  what it stands for  We should offer an example of moral      leadership in the world  committed to treat people humanely  abide      by the rule of law  and be generous and caring to our neighbors       Our current detention policies fall woefully short of this ideal   The Administration got itself into      this mess because it refused to accept Congress as a partner in the      war on terror and insisted on acting unilaterally  Following the      start of combat in Afghanistan in October 2001  I urged President      Bush to work with Congress to fashion appropriate rules and      procedures for detaining and punishing suspected terrorists  Our      current Chairman  Senator Specter  did the same  We both noted at      the time that our government is at its strongest when the Executive      and Legislative branches of government act in concert       Unfortunately  the President was determined to go it alone   Up until now  this Republican led      Congress has been content to go along for the ride  As the      Administration dug itself deeper and deeper into a hole  we stood      idly by  Instead of providing checks and balances  we wrote one      blank check after another    Congresss      Constitutional Role  This must change  The Constitution      provides that Congress  not the President  has the power to make      Rules concerning Captures on Land and Water  Congress  not the      President  has the power to define and punish Offenses against the      Law of Nations  And Congress  not the President  has the power of      the purse   What is the Administrations plan for      Guantanamo Bay  assuming there is one  What does the Administration      intend to do with the more than 500 detainees still imprisoned      there  How many will be released  and when  How many will be      charged and tried  and when    Chicken Dinners And      Other Diversions  The Administration consistently      insists that these detainees pose a threat to the safety of      Americans  Vice President Cheney said that just the other day  If      that is true  there must be evidence to support it  If there is      evidence  then they should prosecute these people     But we also know that some of the      detainees have been wrongly detained  And I suspect there are      others who have not yet been released  against whom the evidence is      weak at best  It is one thing if they are being detained in      accordance with the Geneva Conventions  But if not  they do not      belong there    This week the Administration and its      defenders have been trying to change the subject from the legal      morass that Guantanamo has become  by producing props of chicken      dinners and such  seeming to argue that it is more Club Med than      prison  Lets get real  People have been kept in cages for three      years  with no end in sight and no workable process to lead us      there   Guantanamo      Bay is causing immeasurable damage to our reputation as a defender      of democracy and a beacon of human rights around the world  The      Administration has yet to articulate a coherent plan to repair the      damage  The Congress has abdicated its oversight responsibilities      for far too long  The Administration has placed this nation in an      untenable situation  and it is time for Congress to demand a way      out
