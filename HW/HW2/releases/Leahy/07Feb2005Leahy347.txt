       Statement Of Senator Leahy On Class Action Fairness Act  S  5                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy                Class Action Fairness Act  S  5        February 7  2005   Today we are considering the first of several         bills advanced by corporate special interests to dramatically limit the         publics access to their courts  I must oppose the so called Class         Action Fairness Act for the simple reason that it is NOT fair   This legislation would make it harder for        American citizens to protect themselves against violations of state civil        rights  consumer  health  and environmental protection laws by forcing        these cases out of their local state courts  Aside from being convenient         state courts have experience with the legal and factual issues involved in        these important cases  Legislation that sweeps these cases into federal        courts simply erects new barriers to lawsuits and places new burdens on        plaintiffs    In the case of the legal rights that it would        take from the citizens of my own state  for example  this legislation would        deprive Vermonters of the right to band together to seek relief in their        state courts    even if the principal defendant has a substantial presence        in Vermont and the harm occurred in Vermont  This is a high handed        override of the rights of the American people  intending to benefit wealthy        and powerful special interests   This legislation also overrides the laws and        legislators in our state governments  Indeed the National Conference of        State Legislatures wrote to us last week to note that S 5 undermines our        system of federalism  disrespects our state court system and clearly        preempts carefully crafted state judicial processes which have been in        place for decades regarding the treatment of class action lawsuits  I ask        unanimous consent that this letter be included in the Record   Fourteen State Attorneys General wrote to our        Senate leaders today to express their collective view that  d espite        improvements over similar legislation considered in prior years   they         believe S 5 still unduly limits the right of individuals to seek redress        for corporate wrongdoing in their state courts  This letter urges the        passage of amendments to be offered by Senator Bingaman  Senator Pryor and        Senator Kennedy  I ask unanimous consent that this letter signed by        Attorneys General from New York  Oklahoma  California  Illinois  Iowa         Kentucky  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  Minnesota  New Mexico  Oregon         Vermont and West Virginia be included in the Record   I        want to recognize the sincere efforts made on the class action issue by        Senator Kohl  Senator Feinstein  Senator Schumer  Senator Dodd  Senator        Carper  Senator Landrieu  and others  While I may disagree with them about        the nature of the problem and the appropriate solution in this area  I do        so respectfully    In the last Congress  they were able to        negotiate some procedural improvements and to rein in some of the worst        aspects of previous class action bills  One improvement  for example         restricts the use of worthless coupon settlements  I strongly support this        targeted provision to go after a real class action abuse    Unfortunately  other aspects of the so called        compromise fail to achieve their intended goals    For example  two narrow exceptions have been        negotiated to allow a few local controversies to remain in state court  But        the exceptions to removal to federal court touch on only a thin sliver of        the class action cases that this bill would affect    only when plaintiffs        and primary defendants are from the same state    and even then  I am        afraid that it may do more harm than good with complicated formulas that        will cause costly and time consuming litigation    Another provision seeks to reduce the delay        plaintiffs can experience when a case is removed to federal court by        setting a time limit for appeals of remand orders  However  no measure is        included in the bill that would set a timeline for the district court to        rule on the actual remand motion  This means that plaintiffs claims may        be plucked from state court  just to languish on the federal docket for        years  without any recourse  Senator Feingold intends to offer an        amendment to set a reasonable time limit for the district court to rule on        remand orders  We should all embrace this common sense improvement          I am also concerned that this bill will deny        justice to consumers and others in class actions involving multiple state        laws  The recent trend in the federal courts is not to certify class        actions if multi state laws are involved  and this bill therefore could        force nationwide class actions into federal court  where they will be        dismissed for involving too many state laws  If this legislation is really        about transferring class actions to federal court  instead of being used as        a pro business vehicle for simply dismissing legitimate class actions  then        the supporters of this legislation should want to solve this real Catch 22        problem  Senator Bingaman has an amendment to do just that  and I look        forward to that debate on the Senate floor   This legislation covers        more than just class actions  Individual personal injury actions         consolidated by state courts for efficiency purposes  are not class        actions  Despite the fact that a similar provision was unanimously struck        from the bill during the last mark up of class actions legislation in the        Judiciary Committee  mass torts are now  for some reason  again included in        this bill  Federalizing these individual cases would delay  and possibly        deny  justice for victims suffering real physical injuries  such as the        people injured by taking Vioxx    Mass        tort cases are not class actions  they have not been analyzed under Rule        23s standards or state law equivalents to Rule 23  And they are an        important means by which groups of injured people have long been able to        pursue remedies against those who have harmed them  Mass tort cases        address injuries to citizens health from dangerous medical products         injuries to their property and their health from environmental disasters         and injuries to their rights and liberties from widespread mistreatment in        the workplace    In        short  mass tort actions are entirely different procedural vehicles to        reach justice than class actions  They should not be lumped        in with class actions  and        Senator Durbin has an amendment that would leave mass tort        actions in state courts where they belong   I am old enough to remember the civil rights        battles of the 1950s and 1960s and the impact of class actions in        vindicating basic rights through our courts  The landmark Supreme Court        decision in Brown v  Board of Education was the culmination of        appeals from four class action cases  three from federal court decisions in       Kansas  South Carolina and Virginia and one from a decision by the        Supreme Court of Delaware         Only the Supreme Court of Delaware  the state court  got the case right by        deciding for the African American plaintiffs  The state court justices        understood that they were constrained by the existing Supreme Court law         but nonetheless held that the segregated schools of Delaware        violated the Fourteenth Amendment  Before any federal court did so  a        state court rejected separate and unequal schools          Indeed  many civil rights advocates  including the Lawyers Committee for        Civil Rights Under Law  the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights  the        Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund  and the National Asian        Pacific Legal Consortium  have written to Senators in opposition to this        legislation and in support of Senator Kennedys amendment to exempt civil        rights and wage and hour cases from this bill  I am proud to cosponsor        Senator Kennedys amendment and look forward to debate on it    This legislation has also been criticized by        nearly all of the state Attorneys General in this country  I understand        that at least 43 of them have expressed concern that S  5 could limit their        powers to investigate and bring actions in their state courts against        defendants who have caused harm to their citizens because in certain        instances they file suit as the class representative for the consumers of        their state  I expect Senator Pryor  a former state Attorney General        himself  to bring this issue to the floor with a clarifying amendment  I        look forward to that debate    Some special interest groups are distorting        the state of class action litigation by relying on a few anecdotes in an        ends oriented attempt to impede plaintiffs from bringing class action        cases  We should take steps to correct actual problems in class action        litigation  Simply transferring most suits into federal court will not        correct the real problems faced by plaintiffs and defendants    Defrauded investors  deceived consumers         victims of defective products and environmental torts  and thousands of        other ordinary people have been able to rely on class action lawsuits in        our state court systems to seek and receive justice  We all know that        without consolidating procedures like class actions  it might be impossible        for victims to obtain effective legal representation  Defense lawyers tend        to be paid by the hour  and well paid    Plaintiffs lawyers in class actions tend to        work without pay for the possibility of obtaining a portion of the        proceeds  if successful  It may well prove uneconomical for counsel to        take on cases against governmental or corporate defendants if they must do        so on a case by case  individual basis  It may be that individual claims        are simply too small to be pursued    Sometimes that is what cheaters count on  and        it is how they get away with their schemes  Cheating thousands of people        just a little is still cheating  Class actions allow the little guys to        band together  allow them to afford a competent lawyer  and allow them to        redress wrongdoing   Whether those regular citizens are getting        together to force manufacturers to recall and correct dangerous products         to clean up after devastating environmental harms that endanger their        families and threaten their communities  or to vindicate the basic civil        rights to which they are entitled  they are using class actions  We should        not make it more difficult or costly for them to right those wrongs   As The New        York Times        noted in its editorial last week opposing this bill  the real objective of        this legislation is to dilute the impact of strong state laws protecting        consumers and the environment and to make it harder for Americans to win        redress in court when harmed by bad corporate behavior  I ask unanimous        consent that the editorial be included in the Record  The so called Class Action Fairness Act falls        short of the expectation set by its title  It will leave many injured        parties who have valid claims with no avenue for relief  and that is        anything but fair to the ordinary Americans who look to us to represent        them in the U S  Senate    I look forward to debate and votes on these        amendments and others as the Senate works its will  That is how        legislation should be considered in the Senate and improved upon
