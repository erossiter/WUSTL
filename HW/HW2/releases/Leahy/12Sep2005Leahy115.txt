       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The Resignation Of FEMA Director   Michael Brown                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        To The Resignation Of FEMA Director Michael Brown      Monday  September 12  2005  This shuffling of leadership at       FEMA begins to recognize the disarray in federal preparedness       for this disaster  but it does not solve it  The buck stops at       the Presidents desk  and I hope the President understands the       depth of the problems that Katrina has exposed  As much as we       pray that the American people will never face another major       disaster on this scale  we have to accept that we might  and we       cannot afford to repeat the same mistakes
