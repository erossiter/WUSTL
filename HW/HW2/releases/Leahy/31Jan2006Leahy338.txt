       Closing Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel   A  Alito  Jr                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Closing Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     On The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr       To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United States     January 31  2006  Coretta Scott King On      this rainy morning in our Nations Capital  as we have learned the      sad news of the passing of Coretta Scott King  we are reminded again      of the crucial role our courts have played in making real the      promises of our national charter  the Constitution  The nation      mourns the loss of another civil rights leader  and is reminded      again the vital role our courts play as the place where ordinary      Americans can turn for justice  when justice has been denied them       Coretta Scott King and her late husband  Dr  Martin Luther King Jr        put their lives on the line to help bring those promises to life for      untold millions of Americans  Let us never squander or take for      granted all that has been achieved  Let us keep their dream alive   A Radical Realignment Of Powers Since      this debate began last Wednesday  I have posed the fundamental      question that this nomination raises  Whether the Senate will serve      its constitutional role as a check on the President by preserving      the Supreme Court as a constitutional check on the expansion of      presidential power    This      nomination  now before us  is an unacceptable threat to the      fundamental rights and liberties of all Americans now and for      generations to come  This President is in the midst of a radical      realignment of the powers of the government and its intrusiveness      into the private lives of Americans  I am concerned that if      confirmed this nominee will further erode the checks and balances      that have protected our constitutional rights for more than 200      years  This is a crucial nomination  one that can tip the balance      on the Supreme Court radically away from constitutional checks and      balances and from the protection of Americans fundamental rights       The vote that the      Senate is about to take has real consequences in the lives of the      295 million Americans of today  and of generations to come  The      vote will determine whether Samuel A  Alito  Jr   replaces Justice      Sandra Day OConnor on the Supreme Court of the United States  A      vote for this nomination is a vote against constitutional checks and      balances  A vote for this nomination is a vote against maintaining      the fundamental rights and liberties of ordinary Americans  Republican      Senators have pretended that judicial philosophy and personal views      do not matter because judges simply apply the rule of law  as if it      were some mechanical calculation  Personal views and judicial      philosophy often come into play on close and controversial cases       We all know this to be true  Why else did Republican supporters      force President Bush to withdraw his previous nominee for this      vacancy  Harriet Miers  before she even had a hearing  It mattered      to them when the nominee was Harriet Miers  And it matters now       The only difference is that those who hounded Harriet Miers to      withdraw are confident that Judge Alito will pass their litmus      tests  Harriet Miers failed their litmus tests because  despite all      the backroom whispers and public winks and nods  her conservative      opponents were not confident that she would rule the way they      wanted  Those from among the Presidents supporters who castigated      Ms  Miers wanted certain results  The President allowed his choice      to be vetoed by an extreme faction within his party  before hearings      or a vote  As Chairman Specter has said  they ran her out of town      on a rail  Like the more than 60 moderate and qualified judicial      nominees of President Clinton on whom Republicans would neither hold      hearings or votes  the Miers nomination was killed by Republicans      without a vote  by what was in essence a pocket filibuster  They      do not want an independent federal judiciary  They want certain      results    Dividing Instead Of Uniting The Nation Instead of      uniting the country through his third choice to succeed Justice      OConnor  this President has chosen to reward a faction of his      party  at the risk of dividing the country  Those so critical of      his choice of Harriet Miers were the very people who rushed to      endorse the nomination of Judge Alito  Instead of rewarding his      most virulent supporters  the President should have rewarded the      American people with a unifying choice that would have broad      support  America could have done better through consultation to      select one of the many consensus conservative Republican candidates      who could have been overwhelmingly approved by the Senate  Instead       without consultation  the President withdrew the Miers nomination      and the next day announced that his third choice to succeed Justice      OConnor was Judge Alito    The      Court As A Check On Expansive Claims Of Additional Powers At his hearing       Judge Alito began by asking how he got this critical nomination  I      think we understand the real answer to that question  It has little      to do with Judge Alitos family story and a great deal to do with      the pressures that forced the President to withdraw the nomination      of Harriet Miers and this Presidents efforts to avoid any check on      his expansive claims of additional power  This is a      President who has been conducting secret and warrantless      eavesdropping on Americans for more than four years  This President      has made the most expansive claims of power since American patriots      fought the war of independence to rid themselves of the overbearing      power of King George III  He has done so to justify illegal spying      on Americans without the essential check of judicial oversight  to      justify actions that violate our values and laws against torture and      protecting human rights  and in order to detain U S  citizens and      others on his say so without judicial review or due process  This      is a time in our history when the protections of Americans      liberties are at risk  as are the checks and balances that have      served to constrain abuses of power for more than 200 years    It      is our duty to ask  Can this President  or any President  order      illegal spying on Americans  Can this President  or any President       authorize torture  in defiance of our criminal statutes and our      international agreements  Can this President  or any President       defy our laws and Constitution to hold American citizens in custody      indefinitely without any court review  The President      wanted a reliable justice who would uphold his assertions of power       his most extreme supporters want someone who will revisit the      constitutional protection of privacy rights  and his business      supporters wanted someone favorable to powerful special interests  Supreme Court      nominations should not be conducted through a series of winks and      nods designed to reassure the most extreme Republican factions while      leaving the American people in the dark  No President should be      allowed to pack the courts  and especially the Supreme Court  with      nominees selected to enshrine presidential claims of Government      power  The checks and balances that should be provided by the      courts  Congress and the Constitution are too important to be      sacrificed to a narrow  partisan agenda  The Senate stood up to      President Roosevelt when he proposed a court packing scheme and      should not be a rubber stamp to this President  I will not lend my      support to an effort by this President to undermine our      constitutional checks and balances or to move the Supreme Court and      the law radically to the right   The Supreme Court      belongs to all Americans  not just the person occupying the White      House  and not just to a narrow faction of a political party  This      President continues to choose confrontation over consensus and to be      a divider rather than being the uniter he promised to be  Rather      than sending us a nominee for all Americans  the President chose a      divisive nominee who raises grave concerns about whether he will be      a check on presidential power and whether he understands the role of      the courts in protecting fundamental rights  The Supreme Court      is the ultimate check and balance in our system  Independence of      the courts and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of      life  The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp       and neither should the Supreme Court    Justice OConnors Legacy As the Senate      prepares to vote on President Bushs current nomination of a      successor to Justice OConnor  we should be mindful of her critical      role on the Supreme Court  Her legacy is one of fairness that I      want to see preserved  Justice OConnor has been a guardian of the      protections the Constitution provides the American people  Of      fundamental importance  she has come to provide balance and a check      on Government intrusion into our personal privacy and freedoms  In      the Hamdi decision  she rejected the Presidents claim that      he could indefinitely detain a United States citizen  She upheld      the fundamental principle of judicial review over the exercise of      Government power and wrote that even war is not a blank check for      the President when it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens       She held that even this President is not above the law  The American      people deserve a Supreme Court Justice who inspires confidence that      he  or she  will not be beholden to the President but will be immune      to pressures from the Government or from partisan interests  The      stakes for the American people could not be higher  The appointment      of the next Supreme Court Justice must be made in the peoples      interest and in the Nations interest  not partisan interest or the      Presidents interest   It is as the      elected representatives of the American people  all the people  that      we are charged with the responsibility to examine whether to entrust      their precious rights and liberties to this nominee  The      Constitution is their document  It guarantees their rights from the      heavy hand of Government intrusion and their individual liberties to      freedom of speech and religion  to equal treatment  to due process      and to privacy  I want all Americans to know that the Supreme      Court will protect their rights  I want a Supreme Court that acts      in its finest tradition as a source of justice  The Supreme Court      must be an institution where the Bill or Rights and human dignity      are always honored    Single Moment Of Accountability This      is an accountability moment for each Senator in the decision we      reach on this crucial nomination  I urge all Senators to consult      their consciences and their best judgment before casting their votes      on this critically important nomination  In good conscience  based      on the record  I cannot and will not vote for this nomination
