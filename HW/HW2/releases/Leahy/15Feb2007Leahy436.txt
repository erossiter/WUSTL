       Leahy Leads Bipartisan Effort To Hold Insurance Compamines Accountable   Under The Antitrust Laws                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Leads Bipartisan Effort     To Hold Insurance Companies Accountable Under The Antitrust Laws   Legislation  S 618  Would Provide Needed      Scrutiny     Of Insurance Practices In Gulf Coast Region   WASHINGTON       Thursday  Feb  15   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman of the      Judiciary Committee today joined with Senate Democratic and      Republican leaders to introduce a bipartisan bill that would level      the playing field so that insurance companies must abide by the same      competition laws as every other industry  Leahy introduced      the Insurance Industry Competition Act  along with the panels      Ranking Member  Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    Senate Majority      Leader Harry Reid   D Nev    and Senate Republican Whip Trent Lott        R Miss    Companion  bipartisan legislation has also been      introduced in the House by Reps  Peter DeFazio  D Ore    Gene Taylor       D Miss    Bobby Jindal  R La    Charlie Melancon  D La    Rodney      Alexander  R La    and Walter Jones  R N C    For the last six      decades  insurance companies have enjoyed immunity from federal      anti trust investigation and prosecution  The bipartisan bill      introduced today would give the Department of Justice and the      Federal Trade Commission the authority to apply antitrust laws to      anti competitive behavior by insurance companies   The insurance      industry and its practices have come under serious scrutiny along      the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  said      Leahy  who has raised concerns that insurers have been too often      denying claims and delaying payouts to residents along the Gulf      Coast instead of honoringtheir contractual commitments to their      customers and helping rebuild that region   Federal oversight      would provide confidence that the industry is not engaging in the      most egregious forms of anticompetitive conduct  price fixing       agreements not to pay  and market allocations  said Leahy       Insurers may object to being subject to the same antitrust laws as      everyone else  but if they are operating in an honest and      appropriate way  they should have nothing to fear  American      consumers and American businesses rely on insurance  it is a vital      part of our economy  and they have the right to be confident that      the cost of their insurance  and the decisions by their insurance      carriers about which claims will be paid  reflect competitive market      conditions  not collusive behavior  It is my hope      that this legislation will bring the benefits of competition to the      insurance industry and to consumers  Too many consumers are paying      too much for insurance due to the collusive atmosphere that exists      in the insurance industry  This has become a particular problem      along the Gulf Coast  where insurers have shared hurricane loss      projections  which may result in double digit premium increases for      Gulf Coast homeowners  stated Specter  I strongly urge members      who are concerned about industry exemption from the antitrust laws      and collusive insurance industry practices to support this important      piece of legislation  One thing I      learned coming out of Katrina is that the insurance industry is not      subject to antitrust laws  Senator Lott said  I ve looked at the      history  and there s no explanation for why that is   for why      antitrust and price fixing in this industry are not covered by the      federal government  Our legislation corrects this exception and      applies antitrust restrictions to the insurance industry just as it      is applied to most other corporations  American      consumers should be confident that the cost of their insurance      reflects competitive market conditions  not collusive behavior  and      they should benefit through lower prices  more choices  and better      services  said Reid  If insurers around the country are operating      in an honest and appropriate way  they should not object to being      answerable under the same federal antitrust laws as virtually all      other businesses               Below      is Senator Leahys Statement on Introduction of the   Bill       Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     On Introduction Of The Insurance Industry Competition Act of 2007     February 15  2007  MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  our      Nations competition laws are powerful tools to ensure that consumer      welfare is the benchmark for fair and accountable industry      practices  The vast majority of the companies doing business in the      United States are subject to the strictures of the antitrust laws       and consumers benefit through lower prices  more choices  and better      services  Only a few industries operate outside the federal      antitrust laws  and I am pleased to introduce today a bipartisan      measure that will end the insurance industrys exemption from the      requirements of those laws  I am joined in this effort by the      Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  who has a strong      record of supporting effective competition in every industry through      our antitrust laws  I am joined as well by Senator Reid and Senator      Lott  Senator Lott represents many of the Gulf Coast residents who      can speak personally  and painfully  to the abuses that insurers can      wreak on their policy holders    Insurance industry practices affect      all of us  They affect each of our constituents  they affect every      business in every state  But perhaps nowhere has the industry and      its practices come under as much scrutiny as along the Gulf Coast in      the wake of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  Insurers have been too      often denying claims and delaying payouts to residents along the      Gulf Coast instead of honoring their contractual commitments to      their customers  and thereby contributing to the rebuilding and      rejuvenation of the area    The behavior of insurers in      Mississippi has been so outrageous that the states attorney general      recently convened a grand jury to investigate certain practices       Hundreds of policyholders had to go to court to force the insurance      companies to fulfill their obligations  It seems some insurance      companies are eager to collect premiums when times are good  but      reluctant to aid policyholders when tragedy strikes   Senator Lott knows all too well the      difficulties his constituents have had with insurers  His state was      hit hard by Hurricane Katrina  and I commend him on his tireless      efforts to ensure that resources are in place to rebuild  I have      worked with them in other contexts to support efforts to rebuild the      Gulf Coast  Most recently  I was honored to have assisted Senator      Landrieu in her successful efforts to convince the Attorney General      to dispatch additional law enforcement to the New Orleans region   Our fellow citizens on the Gulf Coast      who have had to cope with the devastation and destruction of the      2005 Hurricanes  and who were utterly failed by their woefully      unprepared government  should not also be bullied or neglected by      insurance companies in their time of need  insurance companies      whose business is based on compensating people after a tragic loss        Unfortunately  the insurance industry      has operated largely beyond the reach of federal antitrust laws for      more than six decades  If there ever was  there is no longer any      justification to exempt the insurance industry from federal      government oversight  Such oversight could provide confidence that      the industry is not engaging in the most egregious forms of      anticompetitive conduct  price fixing  agreements not to pay  and      market allocations    The Insurance Industry Competition Act      we introduce today will simply give the Department of Justice and      the Federal Trade Commission the authority to apply the antitrust      laws to anticompetitive behavior by insurance companies  Our      antitrust laws are the beacon of good competition policy       Competition is good for consumers and good for our economy   Insurers may object to being subject      to the same antitrust laws as everyone else  but if they are      operating in an honest and appropriate way  they should have nothing      to fear  American consumers and American businesses rely on      insurance  it is a vital part of our economy  and they have the      right to be confident that the cost of their insurance  and the      decisions by their insurance carriers about which claims will be      paid  reflect competitive market conditions  not collusive behavior   I thank Senator Reid and Senator      Specter for joining me in this important effort  And I thank      Senator Lott for his support  and for using the lessons of his      constituents experiences to shed light on an industry that for too      long  in too many ways  has been out of the reach of federal      antitrust authorities
