       Senate Judiciary Panel Clears Oversight Bill On Government Data Mining                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Senate Judiciary Panel Clears Oversight Bill On Government Data Mining        Agencies Would Be Required To Report Data Mining   Activities  WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 12   The Senate Judiciary   Committee Thursday overwhelmingly passed a key oversight bill to begin   introducing vital checks and balances to the way the federal government handles   private information of Americans in its rapidly expanding databanks   The Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act would require   federal agencies to report to Congress on their data mining programs and   activities   Without proper safeguards  government data mining programs   are prone to produce inaccurate results and are ripe for abuse  said Senator   Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the committee and original cosponsor of the   bill  This legislation takes an important first step to address these concerns   by requiring federal agencies to tell Congress how they are using data mining   technology and what steps they are taking to protect privacy and civil   liberties  The bill was introduced by Senators Russ Feingold  D Wisc      John Sununu  R N H    and Leahy  It is similar to earlier legislation the three   senators introduced in the last two Congresses  This years bill is also   cosponsored by Senators Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii   Edward Kennedy  D Mass    and   Ben Cardin  D Md    Earlier this year  a similar data mining reporting measure   passed the Senate as part of the 9 11 reform legislation  The legislation would require that federal departments and   agencies that use or develop data mining programs report to Congress on these   activities and the impact of these programs on Americans privacy  The bill   also requires annual updates  including any new uses or the development of   data mining technology  The bill has been part of a response to reports issued by   several non partisan governmental and non governmental organizations that some   federal agencies have misused data mining technology  potentially violating   Americans privacy rights  Leahy has said that oversight of federal databanks and data   mining activities will be one of the Judiciary Committees high priorities in   the new Congress   Below is Chairman Leahys statement from the committees   business meeting earlier today  Statement Of   Sen  Patrick Leahy   Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary   On Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act Of 2007  April 12  2007 Today  the Committee is   considering the Federal Agency Data Mining Reporting Act  This important   privacy legislation helps restore key checks and balances in our government  by   requiring that federal agencies report to Congress on their data mining programs   and activities  The Committee has held over this bill for six consecutive weeks   and I hope that the Committee will favorably report this bill today  I thank Senator Feingold   for his leadership on this issue  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of   this bipartisan legislation  During the recent hearing   that this Committee held on government data mining programs  we learned that the   Federal Governments use of data mining technology has exploded in recent   years  According to a May 2004 report by the General Accountability Office    there are at least 199 different government data mining programs   operating or planned throughout the Federal Government    But  sadly  the Congress and the public know   very little about most of these data mining programs  making them ripe for   abuse   Recently  the Washington   Post reported that the Department of Homeland Security may have violated   federal privacy laws while testing the ADVISE data mining program  a data   mining program would mine vast amounts of sensitive personal information about   ordinary Americans  such as flight and hotel reservations  According to a new report   by the Government Accountability Office  the privacy violation at DHS is just   one of three privacy violations that the GAO found in separate government data   mining programs  The troubling situation   with the ADVISE data mining program demonstrates that  too often  government   data mining programs lack adequate safeguards to protect the privacy rights and   civil liberties of ordinary Americans  The Transportation Security   Administration  TSA  has also recently admitted that its own controversial   Secure Flight data mining program violated federal privacy laws  because TSA   failed to notify U S  air travelers of the fact that their personal data was   being collected for government use  Without proper safeguards    government data mining programs are prone to produce inaccurate results and are   ripe for abuse   This legislation takes an   important first step to address these concerns by requiring federal agencies to   tell Congress how they are using data mining technology and what steps they are   taking to protect privacy and civil liberties   In addition  this bill does   not prohibit the use of data mining technology  But  rather  the bill provides   meaningful oversight to ensure that data mining technology is being used   appropriately and effectively   This is bipartisan   legislation that every   member of this Committee should support  In fact  in 2005  the full Senate   included these same data mining reporting requirements in the appropriations   bill for the Department of Homeland Security  Because this bill advances   an important objective of keeping government data bases from being misused  I   support this bill and I urge all members of the Committee to support this   important privacy legislation
