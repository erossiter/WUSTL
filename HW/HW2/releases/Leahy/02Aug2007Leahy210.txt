       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Children s Health Insurance Program   Reauthorization                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization    August 2  2007 Mr  President  I wish to express my support for the     passage of the Childrens Health Insurance Program Reauthorization      This is a vitally important program that ensures some of the most     vulnerable among us  our children  have access to the health care they     deserve  There is no question that we are a country with a health care     crisis  In the richest  most powerful country in the world  it is a     disgrace that we have 47 million people with no health coverage      Addressing this national priority is long overdue  so I am especially     pleased that this new Congress will take action by extending health care     coverage to millions of children   Congress created this program ten years ago to     provide coverage to children whose families earned too much to qualify     for Medicaid  but lacked health care coverage through their employer or     the private market  At that time  there were more than ten million     children who were uninsured  In the last decade  we have seen the     success of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  it has covered over     six million low income children  providing consistent quality health     care   With the success of this program  it is appropriate     that we renew it for five more years  but also extend it so that     millions of additional low income  uninsured children will now have     health coverage  This expansion is critically important because through     CHIP children have far better access to preventive and primary care     services than they would if they were uninsured  With more routine     health care  we know that kids have better health outcomes and perform     better in schools   Studies have also shown that approximately six     million children are eligible for public coverage  but are not enrolled     in CHIP  I am pleased that the Finance Committee has been able to craft     a bill that would cover 3 2 million children  but I do hope that we can     go even farther and expand this coverage to additional children      Because uninsured children are nine times less likely to receive needed     health care on time and are more likely to go without a visit to a     doctors office  we need to cover as many of them as possible   My state of Vermont has been a leader when it comes     to covering kids  We are referred to an early expansion state because     prior to the creation of this program  Vermont extended Medicaid     coverage to low income children through a program known as Dr  Dynasaur      The bill before the Senate would allow Vermont to maintain coverage for     the kids currently covered  but also reach out to the remaining children     that are eligible but not enrolled in the program   The Finance Committee proposal would also have a     positive impact on health care by increasing the tobacco tax  This     action will have a significant affect on our countrys health  reducing     the rate of cancer  strokes and heart attacks  Further  an increase in     the tobacco tax will also reduce the prevalence of smoking  especially     among adolescents  We know that when cigarettes become more expensive      both kids and adults will change how much they smoke  This is a     positive outcome and one that I support   I appreciate the hard work that has gone into     crafting this bipartisan legislation  I believe it puts the country on     the right track towards ensuring all children have health insurance and     I strongly support it
