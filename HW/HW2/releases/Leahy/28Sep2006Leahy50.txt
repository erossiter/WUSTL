       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Amendment To Strike Section 7 Of The   Military Commission Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  We have a profoundly important and dangerous     choice to make today         What     has changed in the last five years that our Government is so inept and     our people so terrified that we must do what no bomb or attack could     ever do by taking away the very freedoms that define America  Why would     we allow the terrorists to win by doing to ourselves what they could     never do  and abandon the principles for which so many Americans today     and through our history have fought and sacrificed                Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    On Specter Leahy Dodd Amendment To Strike Section 7    Of The Military Commission Bill     Senate Floor     September 28  2006   Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  there are     approximately 12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States     today  people who work for American firms  raise American kids  and pay     American taxes  Section 7 of the bill before us represents a choice     about how to treat them  This bill could have been restricted to     traditional notions of enemy combatants  foreign fighters captured on     the battlefield  but the drafters of this bill chose not to do so  So     lets be clear about the choice this bill would make  Lets be     absolutely clear about what this bill says to lawful permanent residents     of the United States  And then lets decide if its the right message     to send to them  and to the rest of the world   Imagine that you are a law abiding  lawful     permanent resident  In your spare time  you do charitable fundraising     for international relief agencies that lend a hand in disasters  You     send money abroad to those in need  You are selective in the charities     you support  but you do not discriminate on grounds of religion  Then     one day there is a knock on your door  The Government thinks that the     Muslim charity you sent money to may be funneling money to terrorists      and it thinks you may be     involved  And perhaps an overzealous neighbor who saw a group of     Muslims come to your house has reported suspicious behavior  You are     brought in for questioning    Initially  you are not too worried  This     is America  you are innocent  and you have faith in American justice      You know your rights  and you ask for a lawyer  But no lawyer comes      Once again  since you know your rights  you refuse to answer further     questions  Then the interrogators get angry  Then comes solitary     confinement  then fierce dogs  then freezing cold that induces     hypothermia  then waterboarding  then threats of being sent to a country     famous for its torture techniques  then Guantanamo  And then nothing      for years  for decades  for the rest of your life    That may sound more like an experience     from some oppressive and authoritarian regime  something that would have     happened under the Taliban  something that Saddam Hussein would have     ordered or something out of Kafka  There is a reason why that does not     and cannot happen in America  The protection is called habeas corpus     or  if you do not like the Latin phrase by which it has been known     throughout out history  call it access to the independent federal courts     to review the authority and legality by which the Government has taken     and is holding someone in custody  It is a fundamental protection woven     into the fabric of our Nation     Proposed Bill     Eliminates Freedoms  Casts Wide Net in Defining Enemy Combatants  Habeas corpus provides a remedy against     arbitrary detentions and constitutional violations  It guarantees an     opportunity to go to court  with the aid of a lawyer  to prove ones     innocence  As Justice Scalia stated in the  Hamdi case  The very core     of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of separated powers has     been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the will of the     Executive  The remedy that secures that most basic of freedoms is     habeas corpus   If we pass this bill today  that will all     be gone for the 12 million lawful permanent residents who live and work     among us  to say nothing of the millions of other legal immigrants and     visitors who we welcome to our shores each year  That will be gone for     another estimated 11 million immigrants that the Senate has been working     to bring out of the shadows with comprehensive immigration reform       The bill before us would not merely     suspend the writ of habeas corpus  it would eliminate it permanently      It would cut off all habeas petitions  not just those founded on     relatively technical claims  but also those founded on claims of     complete innocence  It would not be limited to enemy combatants in the     traditional sense of foreign fighters captured on the battlefield  it     would apply to any alien     picked up anywhere in the world and suspected of possibly supporting     enemies of the United States  We do not need this bill for those truly     captured on the battlefield who had taken up arms against the United     States  That is why the definition of enemy combatant has been so     expansively redefined in the dark of night  This bill is designed     instead to sweep others into the net and it would not require even an     administrative determination that the Governments suspicions have a     reasonable basis  By its plain language  it would deny all access to     the courts of any alien awaiting a Government determination as to     whether the alien is an enemy combatant  a determination that the     Government would be free to delay as long as it likedfor years  for     decades  for the length of the conflict which is so undefined and may     last for decades or more    That is not speculation  It is not a     critics characterization of the bill  It is what the bill plainly     says  on its face  It is what the Bush Cheney Administration is     demanding  It is what any member who votes against the Specter Leahy     amendment and for the bill today will be endorsing     Bill Goes Beyond     Detainee Treatment Act  The habeas stripping provisions in the     current bill go far beyond what Congress did in the Detainee Treatment     Act in at least three respects  First  as the Supreme Court pointed out     in Hamdan  the DTA     removed habeas jurisdiction only prospectively for future cases  By     contrast  the new bill would strip habeas jurisdiction retroactively     even from pending cases  That is an extraordinary action that runs     counter to long held U S  policies disfavoring retroactive legislation      Second  the DTA applied only to detainees at Guantanamo  The new     legislation goes far beyond Guantanamo and strips the right to habeas of     any alien  even in the United States  if the alien has been determined     an enemy combatant or is awaiting a determination whether he is an enemy     combatant  That would allow the government to hold even a permanent     resident alien forever without the right to habeas while the government     decides whether he is an enemy combatant  And third  the impact of     those provisions is extended by the new definition of enemy combatant     proposed in the current bill  The bill would extend the definition to     include persons who supported hostilities against the United States      even if they did not engage in armed conflict against the United States     or its allies  That  again  is an extraordinary extension of existing     law and of the persons whom the law would authorize the government to     detain without any access to the historic writ of habeas corpus   If we vote today to abolish rights of     access to the justice system to any alien detainee who is suspected      not determined  not even charged  but just suspected    of assisting     terrorists  that will do by the back door what cannot be done up front      That will remove the check that our legal system provides against     arbitrarily detaining people for life without charge and  for that     matter  could make any limits against torture and cruel and inhuman     treatment obsolete because they will be unenforceable  We will have     removed the mechanism the Constitution provides to check Government     overreaching and lawlessness  If this bill became effective  it would     make it impossible for aliens ever to challenge and prove such abuses       This is wrong  It is unconstitutional  It     is un American  It is designed to ensure that the Bush Cheney     Administration will never again be embarrassed by a United States     Supreme Court decision reviewing its unlawful abuses of power  The     conservative Supreme Court  with seven of its nine members appointed by     Republican Presidents  has been the only check on the Bush Cheney     Administration lawlessness  Certainly the rubberstamp Republican     Congress has not done it  or even investigated it  With this bill  the     Congress will have completed the job of eviscerating its role as a check     and balance on the Administration  The Senate has turned its back on     the Warner Levin bill  a bipartisan bill reported by the Armed Services     Committee  to jam through the Bush Cheney bill  With a few     corrections  the Senate committee bill would have done the job  This     bill gives up the ghost  This bill is not a check on the Administration     but a voucher for future wrongdoing     Betrayal of Basic     Values of Freedoms       Makes Mockery of Bush Administrations Claim of Exporting Freedom     Across the Globe  Abolishing habeas corpus for anyone who     the Government thinks might have assisted enemies of the United States     is unnecessary and morally wrong  It is a betrayal of the most basic     values of freedom for which America stands  It makes a mockery of the     Bush Cheney Administrations lofty rhetoric about exporting freedom     across the globe    I read yesterday from former Secretary of     State Colin Powells letter  in which he voiced concern about our moral     authority in the war against terrorism  This General and former head of     the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary of State was right   Admiral John Hutson testified before the     Judiciary Committee that stripping the courts of habeas jurisdiction was     inconsistent with American history and tradition  He concluded  We     dont need to do this  America is too strong   I ask unanimous consent to place in the     record a letter from more than 60 law school deans and professors  They     note  The Congress would gravely disserve our global reputation as a     law abiding country by enacting bills that seek to combat terrorism by     stripping judicial review   Kenneth Starr  the former Independent     Counsel and Solicitor General to the first President Bush  wrote that     the Constitutions conditions for suspending habeas corpus have not been     met  and that doing so would be problematic    In Wake of 9 11     Congress Provided Executive Authority to Detain Aliens With Appropriate     Judicial Check     Section of the 2001 PATRIOT Act    The post 9 11 world requires us to make     adjustments  In the original PATRIOT Act five years ago  we made     adjustments to accommodate the needs of the Executive  and more     recently  we sought to fine tune those adjustments  I think some of     those adjustments sacrificed civil liberties unnecessarily  but I also     believe that many provisions in the PATRIOT Act were appropriate  I     wrote many of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act  and I voted for it   This bill is of an entirely different     nature  Where the PATRIOT Act took a cautious approach to civil     liberties  this bill takes an entirely dismissive and cavalier approach     to basic human rights and to the Constitution    In the aftermath of 9 11  Congress     provided in section 412 of the PATRIOT Act that an alien may be held     without charge if  and only if  the Attorney General certifies that he     is a terrorist or that he is engaged in activity that endangers the     national security  He may be held for seven days  after which he must     be placed in removal proceedings  charged with a crime  or released      There is judicial review through habeas corpus proceedings  with appeal     to the D C  Circuit   Compare that to section 7 of the current     bill  The current bill does not provide for judicial review  It would     preclude it  It does not require a certification by the Attorney     General that the alien is a terrorist  It would apply if the alien was     awaiting a Government determination whether the alien is an enemy     combatant  And it is not limited to seven days  It would enable the     Government to detain an alien for life without any recourse whatsoever     to justice    An Important And     Dangerous Choice With This Bill  What has changed in the past five years     that justifies not merely suspending  but abolishing the writ of habeas     corpus for a broad category of people who have not been found guilty or     even charged with any crime  What has changed in the last five years     that our Government is so inept and our people so terrified that we must     do what no bomb or attack could ever do by taking away the very freedoms     that define America  Why would we allow the terrorists to win by doing     to ourselves what they could never do and abandon the principles for     which so many Americans today and through our history have fought and     sacrificed  What has happened that the Senate is willing to turn     America from a bastion of freedom into a caldron of suspicion ruled by a     Government of unchecked power    Under the Constitution  a suspension of     the writ may only be justified during an invasion or a rebellion  when     the public safety demands it  Six weeks after the deadliest attack on     American soil in our history  the Congress that passed the PATRIOT Act     rightly concluded that a suspension of the writ would not be justified      Yet now  six weeks before a mid term election  the Bush Cheney     Administration and its supplicants here in Congress deem a complete     abolition of the writ the highest priority  a priority so urgent that     we are allowed no time to properly review  debate and amend a bill we     first saw in its current form less that 72 hours ago  Notwithstanding     the harm the Administration has done to national security with its     mismanaged misadventure in Iraq  there is no new national security     crisis  There is only a Republican political crisis  And that  as we     all know  is why this un American  unconstitutional legislation is     before us today   We have a profoundly important and     dangerous choice to make today  The danger is not that we adopt a     pre 9 11 mentality  We adopted a post 9 11 mentality in the PATRIOT     Act when we declined to suspend the writ  and we can do so again today      The danger  as Senator Feingold has stated in a different context  is     that we adopt a pre 1776 mentality  one that dismisses the Constitution     on which our American freedoms are founded  Actually  it is worse than     that  Habeas corpus was the most basic protection of freedom that     Englishmen secured from their King in the Magna Carta  The mentality     adopted by this bill  in abolishing habeas corpus for a broad swath of     people  is a pre 1215 mentality   Every one of us has sworn an oath to     uphold the Constitution  In order to uphold that oath  I believe we     have a duty to vote for this amendment and against this irresponsible     and flagrantly unconstitutional bill  That is what I shall do  and I     urge all Senators on both sides of the aisle to join me
