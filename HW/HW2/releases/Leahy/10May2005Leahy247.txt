       Leahy Presses For Oversight And Openness In PATRIOT Act Review                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy Presses For       Oversight And Openness In PATRIOT Act Review   WASHINGTON  Tuesday  May      10   The Senate Judiciary Committee continued its review of the USA      PATRIOT Act on Tuesday with Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   pressing      for vigorous congressional oversight as a vital part of the process      of revising and renewing the sweeping anti terrorism law  Leahy         the ranking Democratic member of the panel who  as a co author of      the law  added a variety of checks and balances to the USA PATRIOT      Act    highlighted the importance of the sunset provisions over      governmental powers contained in the PATRIOT Act that he and former      House Majority Leader Dick Armey included in the law when it was      passed in 2001  weeks after the Sept  11 attacks  These sunsets       set to expire at the end of the year  are the impetus for this and      other recent congressional hearings on the law and its use  His      statement from the hearing follows          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Hearing On Continued Oversight Of The USA Patriot Act     May 10  2005  Todays hearing continues this      Committees oversight and review of the USA PATRIOT Act  We heard      from Attorney General Gonzales and FBI Director Mueller at our      hearing on April 5th  We heard further from the      Department of Justice at a classified briefing on April 12th       This morning  we will hear from several non government witnesses      about their views of the PATRIOT Act   It is interesting to note that our      counterparts in the other body are also holding another hearing this      morning on the PATRIOT Act  In addition  the Senate Select      Committee on Intelligence has held a series of hearings on the      PATRIOT Act  All told  the enhanced surveillance provisions of the      PATRIOT Act have been the focus of more than a dozen hearings this      year alone  and more during the last Congress   It is no mystery why the      Republican controlled Congress  which has all but abdicated its      oversight responsibilities in many other areas  has devoted so much      attention to the PATRIOT Act  In the final negotiating session on      the PATRIOT Act  former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I      insisted on adding a sunset provisions for certain governmental      powers that have great potential to affect the civil liberties of      the American people  These sunset conditions are the reason we are      here today  It is the reason our colleagues on other committees are      revisiting the PATRIOT Act  And it explains why we are finally      getting some answers from the Department of Justice  although the      fact that Chairman Specter takes his oversight responsibilities as      seriously as he does has also helped a great deal   The PATRIOT Act is not a perfect piece      of legislation  if such a thing even exists  I said as much when we      passed it  just six weeks after the 9 11 attacks  In negotiations      with the Administration  I did my best to strike a reasonable      balance between the urgent need to address the threat of terrorism       and the need to protect our constitutional freedoms  I was able to      add many checks and balances that were absent from the      Administrations draft  along with provisions to address such other      concerns as border security and the FBIs translator problem  Other      members of this Committee and in Congress were able to include      improvements as well  I made clear that congressional oversight      would be especially important for these new government powers  I      always knew  and noted at the time  that we in Congress would have      to revisit these issues when the immediate crisis  and the emotional      aftermath of the crisis  had receded a bit   As we all know  the vast majority of      the provisions of the PATRIOT Act are not subject to sunset  Of the      handful that will expire at the end of the year  some are      non controversial and can be renewed with little or no      modification  Others require greater scrutiny    At our hearing in April  Attorney      General Gonzales said he was open to any ideas that may be offered      for improving these provisions  This was a refreshing departure      from the combative stance of his predecessor  who spent hundreds of      thousands of dollars of taxpayer money on a public relations      campaign to stem criticism of the PATRIOT Act  Now  with the      impending sunset less than eight months away  we need to move beyond      the positioning rhetoric and focus on what really matters for the      country and for the American people   Legitimate concerns have been raised      about various powers granted by the PATRIOT Act  not so much for how      they have been used  but for how they could be used  and for cloak      of secrecy under which they operate  Since September 11th       Americans have been asked to accept restrictions on their liberties       they deserve to know what they are getting in return  Until then       this Senator will not ask the American people to give up anything      more    Many of us on the Committee have been      working on ways to improve the PATRIOT Act  and a number of      proposals are already on the table  For example  Senator Durbin       Senator Craig  and Senator Feingold have proposed corrective      legislation  and I commend them for their leadership and hard work   One thing that I hope we can all agree      upon is the need to clarify the procedures for compelling the      production of records from third parties in terrorism and      intelligence investigations  Last September  Judge Victor Marrero      in the Southern District of New York enjoined the FBI from issuing      certain national security letters  both because they bar or      substantially deter judicial review  and because their permanent ban      on disclosure operates as a prior restraint on speech in violation      of the First Amendment   The invalidated provision first passed      Congress nearly 20 years ago  as part of the Electronic      Communications Privacy Act  or ECPA  I was proud to be the primary      Senate sponsor of that law  although the national security letter      provision was added by a Republican member of the Intelligence      Committee  Since then the provision has been amended  or relevant      definitions within it have been amended  at least three times since      1986    most drastically by the PATRIOT Act  It was only after      these amendments to the law that Judge Marrero raised issues about      its expanded use by the FBI and the Department of Justice     These are legitimate issues  in my      view  but whatever we may think of Judge Marreros decision  we need      to address it promptly  before the constitutional defects he      identified jeopardize the FBIs anti terrorism mission  At the same      time  it may make sense to require approval at the highest levels of      the Department before a national security demand may be made for      certain highly confidential materials such as library  bookseller       and medical records   I also hope we can reach consensus to      modify section 206 of the PATRIOT Act  which authorized the use of      roving wiretaps in foreign intelligence investigations  I      supported the inclusion of this authority in the PATRIOT Act in      order to bring FISA into line with criminal procedures  As I said      at the time  This is the kind of change that has a compelling      justification  because it recognizes the ease with which targets of      investigations can evade surveillance by changing phones  In fact       the original roving wiretap authority for use in criminal      investigations was enacted as part of ECPA  But while the need for      roving wiretap authority is undisputed  the language of section 206       as amended by later legislation  is troubling in its ambiguity and      clearly could be improved   Much has been written about the pen      register provisions of the PATRIOT Act  Long before September 11       2001  I supported modifying the pen register and trap and trace      device laws in three respects  first  to give nationwide effect to      pen register and trap and trace orders  second  to clarify that such      orders can cover computer transmissions and not just telephone      lines  and third  to update the judicial review procedure which       unlike any other area in criminal procedure  bars the exercise of      judicial discretion in reviewing the justification for the order       The PATRIOT Act modified the pen register and trap and trace laws in      the first two respects  but did not allow for meaningful judicial      review  The impending sunset of section 214 of the PATRIOT Act      gives us another opportunity to consider this essential guard      against abuse   These are just some of the matters      before us as we revisit the PATRIOT Act  We will also hear today      from David Cole  an authority on the immigration provisions that      were included in the PATRIOT Act  It is regrettable that at the      same time our committee is conducting this careful review of the      PATRIOT Act  the Republican conferees on the supplemental      appropriations bill agreed to include the REAL ID Acts expansion of      the terrorism related grounds for inadmissibility and deportability      that we negotiated in the PATRIOT Act  This committee never had the      opportunity to consider those expansions  and none of the Democratic      conferees on the supplemental bill were even included in conference      negotiations   Earlier this year  we celebrated the      first National Sunshine Week with a hearing on open government and      bipartisan calls for responsiveness and accountability  We should      carry that theme into this process of oversight and legislating        The sunset provisions of the PATRIOT      Act ensured that we would revisit that law and shine some sunlight      on how it has been implemented  Dick Armey and I were afraid that      the Administration would not tell the American people what was going      on  as it turned out  we were right   I believe that many of us would      consider reauthorizing the expiring PATRIOT Act powers  with some      modifications  but there must be mechanisms in place to guarantee      that the government remains accountable for the use of those      powers  Judicial review  public reporting  congressional oversight      and sunsets    all offer a window into the governments use of its      powers  and all provide essential protection against abuse   I welcome all our witnesses and look      forward to making progress on these important issues
