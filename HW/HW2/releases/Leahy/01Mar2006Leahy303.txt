       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  USA PATRIOT Act Additional   Reauthorizing Amendments Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     USA PATRIOT Act      Additional Reauthorizing Amendments Act Of 2006  March 1  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  earlier      this month  I joined with a majority of Senators in voting to      proceed to consideration of S 2271  I said then that the bill made      modest improvements over both the original PATRIOT Act and the      reauthorization proposal produced by the House Senate conference  I      said  too  that the bill included one set of changes that I strongly      opposed  and that I hoped there would be an opportunity to make      further improvements to the bill  the conference report  and the      PATRIOT Act    Regrettably  no sooner had the Senate      voted to proceed to S 2271 than the majority leader filled the      amendment tree with sham amendments  locking out real amendments      that sought to improve the law further  An amendment that I filed      but was denied the opportunity to offer would have corrected one of      the most egregious police state provisions regarding gag orders       Senator Feingold also filed but could not offer amendments aimed at      bringing the conference report more in line with the bipartisan      reauthorization bill that every Member of the Senate approved last      year  In light of the abuse perpetrated by the Republican      leadership  I felt compelled yesterday to oppose cloture on the bill      and the stifling of meaningful debate   Todays vote is a different and more      difficult matter  Because the Republican leadership obstructed      efforts to improve the bill  the police state provisions regarding      gag orders remain uncorrected  This is a big step backward  in my      view  from both the conference report and existing law     At the same time  the bill takes two      steps forward  It modifies a provision I objected to in the      conference report that would have required American citizens to tell      the FBI before they exercise their right as Americans to seek the      advice of counsel  Chairman Specter and I worked together to      correct this provision  Senator Sununu was able to improve it      further in this bill and I commend his efforts   Another significant change provided by      the Sununu bill builds upon another objection I had and an idea I      shared with him to ensure that libraries engaged in their customary      and traditional activities are not subject to national security      letters  This is a matter I first raised and feel very strongly      about  I commend Senator Sununu for the progress he was able to      make in this regard    The bill is intended to clarify that      libraries as they traditionally and currently function are not      electronic service providers  and may not be served with NSLs for      business records simply because they provide Internet access to      their patrons  Under this clarification  a library may be served      with an NSL only if it functions as a true Internet Service      Provider  as by providing services to persons located outside the      premises of the library  I expect that this will occur rarely or      never and that in most if not all cases  the Government will need a      court order to seize library records for foreign intelligence      purposes    The language I proposed to Senator      Sununu in this regard was less ambiguous than that to which the      Bush Cheney Administration would agree  Still  my intent  Senator      Sununus intent and the intent of Congress is this regard should be      clear  It is to strengthen the meaning and ensure proper      implementation of this provision that I will support this bill  As      a supporter I trust my intent will inform those charged with      implementing the bill and reviewing its proper implementation   I will continue to work to improve the      PATRIOT Act  I will work to provide better oversight of the use of      national security letters and to remove the un American restraints      on meaningful judicial review  I will seek to monitor how sensitive      personal information from medical files  gun stores and libraries      are obtained  used  and retained  Today  I will join Senators      Specter  Sununu  Craig  and others in introducing a bill to improve      the PATRIOT Act and reauthorization legislation in several important      respects  While we have made some progress  much is left to be      done
