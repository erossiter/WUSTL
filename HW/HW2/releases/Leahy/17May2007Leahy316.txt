OKs Bill To Allow Qualified  Retired Law Enforcement Officers    To Answer Call Of Duty  WASHINGTON  Thursday  May 17   The Senate     Judiciary Committee Thursday reported a bipartisan bill that would     establish uniform standards so that  trained     and certified retired law enforcement officers could continue to answer     the call of duty    The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of     2007  S 376  revises existing laws to permit trained and certified     retired law enforcement officers  to carry     concealed firearms in most situations   The dedicated public servants who are     trained to uphold the law and keep the peace deserve our support and our     thanks  said Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the committee     and the chief sponsor of the bill  We also act in our own interest     when we give law enforcement officers the ability to answer the call of     duty wherever they may be   The men and women who have served as     peace officers are a tremendous resource in all of our communities      Leahy added    The bill enjoys support from a broad     coalition in the Senate  It is cosponsored by Senator Arlen Specter      R Pa    ranking member of the committee  and Senators Max Baucus      D Mont    John Cornyn  R Texas   Jon Kyl  R Ariz    Kent Conrad  D N D        Charles Grassley  R Iowa   and Jeff Sessions  R Ala     The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of     2007 was passed by voice vote and updates a previous law that was passed     in 2004 after being cosponsored by 70 senators    Below is Chairman     Leahys statement from the meeting followed by a summary of the bill    Statement of Senator     Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007  S 376    Executive Business Meeting    May 17  2007  This morning the Judiciary Committee has     another opportunity to consider a bill of interest to many of our law     enforcement officers across the country  the Law Enforcement Officers     Safety Act of 2007  S 376  Without the cooperation of Members we did     not have a quorum last week and were unable to proceed  I hope we do     better today   With the enactment of the Law Enforcement     Officers Safety Act  LEOSA  in 2004  Congress and the President     recognized that law enforcement officers are never off duty  Under     this law  qualified retired officers seeking certification to carry a     firearm have been subject to varying procedures from State to State      Differing interpretations have complicated the implementation of the     law  and some retired officers have experienced significant frustration     in getting certified under LEOSA    With the input of the law enforcement     community  this bill proposes modest amendments to the current law  For     example  where a State has not set active duty standards  the retired     officer can be certified pursuant to the active duty standards set by     law enforcement agencies in the State  In addition  the bill clarifies     that Amtrak police officers  along with officers of the Executive branch     of the Federal Government  are covered by the law  The bill also resets     at 10  the number of years of service required for a retired officer to     qualify under the law  and removes the requirement that an officer be     entitled to non forfeitable benefits  which some smaller law enforcement     agencies do not provide  The requirements for eligibility still involve     a significant term of service for a retired officer to qualify  a     demonstrated commitment to law enforcement  and certification     In order to qualify under the law  all     officers seeking certification to carry a firearm must have retired in     good standing  With respect to the changes allowing a certified     firearms instructor to conduct testing  the testing still must be     pursuant to active duty standards  and conducted by a firearms     instructor certified by the state to test active duty officers     The dedicated public servants who are     trained to uphold the law and keep the peace deserve our support and our     thanks  We also act in our own interest when we give law enforcement     officers the ability to answer the call of duty wherever they may be      For example  just recently in a tragic shooting spree that killed five     people in a shopping mall in Utah  an off duty officer  Ken Hammond      likely saved lives when he confronted a killer who was heavily armed and     engaged him until other officers arrived  He could have just as easily     been a retired officer as an off duty officer    The men and women who have served as peace     officers are a tremendous resource in all of our communities  Earlier     this week  I was honored to participate in the 26th Annual     National Peace Officers Memorial ceremonies here at the Capitol hosted     by The Grand Lodge of the Fraternal Order of     Police and its auxiliary  As we do each year  we gathered with the     families of those who lost a loved one in 2006 in the line of duty and     commemorated their sacrifice to keep us safe and secure  This week  we     honored them and the dedication and courage of the more than 900 000 men     and women who put themselves on the line to protect all of us     The technical fixes     in this bill will continue our aim of establishing national measures of     uniformity and consistency to permit trained and certified retired law     enforcement officers to carry concealed firearms in most situations so     that they may protect themselves and their families from vindictive     criminals  and  when extraordinary circumstances occur  respond to the     call of duty wherever they may be   I look forward to the     Committee approving this bill today to make our communities safer and     better to protect law enforcement officers and their families
