       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Comprehensive Immigration Reform    Ensign Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Comprehensive Immigration Reform      Ensign Amendment        S A  3985  to S  2611  Senate Floor   May 18  2006  When President Bush spoke to the       Nation about comprehensive immigration reform earlier this week        he said that every human being has dignity and value no matter       what their citizenship papers say  I couldnt agree more with       the President that it is our sense of common humanity that       should frame this debate    Senator Ensign has proposed an       amendment antithetical to the sentiments that the President       expressed  and which most Americans share  Americans understand       that for years there are undocumented workers who have tried to       follow our laws and be good neighbors and good citizens  and       have paid into the Social Security Trust Fund  Many do not yet       have Social Security numbers but they and their American       employers have paid in their contributions  Once that person       regularizes his or her status  and as they proceed down the path       to earned citizenship  they should have the benefit after having       followed the law and made those contributions  Americans       understand fairness  That is fairness  We should not steal       their funds or empty their Social Security accounts  That is       not fair  It does not reward their hard work or their financial       contributions  It violates the trust that underlies the Social       Security Trust Fund    Senator Ensign proposes to change       existing law to prohibit an individual from gaining the benefit       of any contributions made while the individual was in an       undocumented status  I oppose this amendment and believe it is       wrong    Under current law  immigrants who       have paid Social Security while in an undocumented status may       gain the benefit of all of their contributions once they gain       legal status and become eligible to collect Social Security       benefits  They paid in and they should be entitled to the       benefits they have earned  The whole purpose of the path to       citizenship program in the bill is to encourage people to become       lawful  productive citizens  Penalizing these people is unfair        especially since under the law they are not only working hard       and contributing to the Social Security Trust Fund  but also       working hard to achieve legal status and earned citizenship        Hard work is rewarded in the country  not penalized  Following       the law and advancing on the path toward earned citizenship       should be encouraged  not punished    For example  the children of an       undocumented worker who has worked for 20 years  and who has       paid into the system  would be denied all Social Security       benefits if their parent dies before becoming a legal resident       or citizen  Even though the children are citizens  they would       be denied the benefit their parent worked many years and       contributed to earn  Not only is this unfair  but it risks       encouraging others in similar situations to stay in the shadows       and not to pay into the Social Security Trust Fund  This will       also have the effect of shifting burdens to the States and local       communities and away from the Social Security safety net  I am       confident that Vermonters and all Americans understand       fairness  They understand respecting other people and       respecting their contributions in terms of work and Social       Security payments  They will not want to steal those       contributions and benefits and deny fairness to lawful       immigrants and their families    They also understand that if the       Republican controlled Senate is prepared to take these Social       Security funds today  the risk increases that their Social       Security funds could be targeted tomorrow  After all  the       Social Security Trust Fund is already being used to mask the       deficit  As it becomes harder and harder to pay for tax breaks       for millionaires and rising gas prices and lucrative government       contracts  some will be tempted to use money diverted from the       Social Security Trust Fund  The President has already proposed       draining the Crime Victims Trust Fund  We should maintain these       trust funds for the purposes for which Congress created them and       keep them safe  We should respect the contributions that people       make to these trust funds and not look for excuses to start       denying legal residents and citizens the benefits they have been       promised    Let us not take a giant misstep       that we will surely regret  If we are going to encourage and       support a path to citizenship for many people under this bill        we must do so in a way that ensures independence and security       once that journey is completed
