       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Thomas B    Griffith To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     On The Nomination Of Thomas B  Griffith     To The United States Court Of Appeals For The      D C  Circuit June 13  2005  I oppose the nomination of Thomas      Griffith to the U S  Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  Mr       Griffiths decision to practice law without a license for a good      part of his career should be disqualifying  Mr  Griffith has      foregone at least 10 opportunities to take the bar in  Utah  and has continued to refuse to      do so during the pendency of his nomination  In this regard he      appears to think he is above the law  That is not the kind of      person who should be entrusted with a lifetime appointment to a      federal court and  least of all  to such an important court as the      D C  Circuit  which is entrusted with protecting the rights of all      Americans  This is the wrong nomination for this court and I will      vote against it    The D C  Circuit is an especially      important court in our nation s      judicial system for its broad caseload covering issues as varied as      reviews of federal regulation on the environment  workplace safety       telecommunications  consumer protection  and other critical federal      statutory and constitutional rights  The White House has rejected      all Democratic efforts to work together on consensus nominees for      this court and refused to engage in consultation  That is too bad      and totally unnecessary  This is another in a series of      inappropriate nominations this President has made to this court       Last week  Senate Republicans voted in lockstep to confirm Janice      Rogers Brown to this court  The takeover of this court is now      complete  Mr  Griffith is the third nominee from President Bush to      be considered by the Senate  If confirmed the 11 judges on the      court will include a majority of 7 judges appointed by Republican      Presidents    At Mr  Griffiths hearing last March       I noted that unlike the many anonymous Republican holds and pocket      filibusters that kept more than 60 of President Clintons moderate      and qualified judicial nominees from moving forward  the concerns      about Mr  Griffith were no secret  Unlike the Republicans pocket      filibusters of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan  who were each denied      consideration and an up or down vote when nominated to the D C       Circuit  Mr  Griffith knows full well that I think he has not      honored the rule of law by his practicing law in Utah for five years      without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to become a member      of the Utah Bar    He has testified that he has obtained      a Utah drivers license      and pays Utah State taxes  but he is not a member of the bar despite      admitting practicing law there since 2000  According to his answers      to my questions  he has taken no steps to fulfill the requirements      for practicing law in Utah by taking the Utah bar exam and becoming      a member of the Utah Bar  He was also derelict in his duty toward      the D C  Bar  and less than forthcoming with us on questions related      to his repeated failures to maintain his D C  Bar membership and his      failures to pay his annual dues on time not just once  not twice       but in 1996  1997  1998  1999  2000 and 2001  He was twice      suspended for his failures  including one suspension that lasted for      three years    As was reported last summer in  The Washington Post  and      confirmed through Committee investigation  Mr  Griffith has spent      the last five years practicing law in  Utah as the General Counsel to Brigham      Young University  In all that time he has not been licensed to      practice law in Utah  nor has he followed through on any serious      effort to become licensed  He has hidden behind a curtain of      shifting explanations  thrown up smokescreens of letters from      various personal friends and political allies  and refused to      acknowledge what we all know to be true  Mr  Griffith should have      taken the bar    Mr  Griffith has so far foregone 10      opportunities to take the  Utah bar exam while applying for and      maintaining his position as General Counsel at BYU  This conscious      and continuous disregard of basic legal obligations is not      consistent with the respect for law we should demand of lifetime      appointments to the federal courts  Neither has Mr  Griffith yet      satisfactorily explained why he obstinately refuses to take the Utah      Bar    This is not Mr  Griffiths first or      only bar problem  He was suspended for failing to pay his D C  Bar      dues and then misled this Committee on the facts of that suspension      as well as other late payments  Contrary to his misleading      testimony at his hearing  it seems that the only year Mr  Griffith      actually paid his D C  Bar dues on time  after coming to the Senate      in 1995  was in 1995       Two suspensions from the practice of law in two years  three late or      non existent payments in four years  and an attempt to      mischaracterize this embarrassing record are hardly just an single      administrative oversight unless by that Mr  Griffith means to      indicate that his single admitted error is that he does not comply      with the law    What may be more disturbing than Mr       Griffiths failure to pay his D C  dues  is his lack of concern      about the implications of having practiced law in D C  without      proper licensure  When I asked him if he had notified his clients      or law firm from the period he was suspended  he brushed me off       telling me that his membership in good standing was reinstated once      he got around to paying his unpaid dues  Of course  that ignored my      question  which was about the ramifications of having been suspended      for two separate periods over the course of years while he continued      to practice  Clients and partners should have been notified and      courts should have been informed    The Department of Justice apparently      agrees that suspension for failure to pay bar dues is a serious      matter  Recent newspaper reports disclosed that the Departments      Office of Professional Responsibility takes such a matter seriously      enough to have opened an investigation into the case of a longtime      career attorney there who  like Mr  Griffith  was suspended from the      D C  Bar because he did not pay his dues  Unlike Mr  Griffiths      case  the Department is concerned enough about such a suspension      that they filed notices with the courts in every case this attorney      worked on during the period of his suspension  notifying them that      he was not authorized to practice at the time  Practicing law      without a license is a serious matter    The facts surrounding Mr  Griffiths      nonexistent membership in the Utah Bar are even more troubling  He      began his service as Assistant to the President of the university      and General Counsel of BYU in 2000  At that time he was not a      member of the Utah Bar  he was suspended from membership in the Bar      of the District of      Columbia  and he was an inactive member of the North Carolina Bar       Mr  Griffiths own testimony is that for the last five years  as      part of his responsibilities as BYU General Counsel  he has been      practicing law in Utah   So  what made Mr  Griffith think he      could practice law without being a member of the Utah Bar  Mr       Griffith testified that he relied on an in house counsel exception      that does not exist in      Utah statutes and is not recognized by the Utah Supreme Court  as      Mr  Griffith was forced to concede  It was a most convenient and      self serving excuse  There is no such general counsel exception      in Utah and there never has been  He could not point to any Utah      statute or Utah Supreme Court pronouncement allowing this behavior         because it does not exist as a matter of law  Moreover  his      predecessor at BYU and the general counsels of the other      universities in Utah are all members of the Utah Bar   Mr  Griffith has never been able to      identify who at the Utah Bar he claims advised him that he did not      need to join the bar  This fundamental refusal to abide by the law      is all the more troubling by Mr  Griffiths obstinate behavior in      refusing to take the bar in order to cure his failure  This is not      complicated  Get licensed  Indeed  during the course of Committee      consideration he admitted that when he asked a second year law      student to research the matter she came back to him and advised that      he should take the bar  Yet here we are  with the Senate being      urged to confirm someone to a lifetime appointment as a federal      judge on a court with jurisdiction over important cases that can      have nationwide impact and that nominee has adamantly refused to      follow legal requirements in his own legal practice    The General Counsel of the Utah Bar       Katherine Fox  wrote to Mr  Griffith on May 14  2003  telling him      she was surprised he thought there was a general counsel      exception  and explained that there was no way under his      circumstances to waive into the Utah Bar without taking the bar      exam  This response from a career lawyer in the Utah Bar made      before political pressure was ratcheted up to defend a Republican      nominee seems pretty straightforward to me  In plain  simple to      understand words  Ms  Fox instructed Mr  Griffith to take the bar      examination at the earliest opportunity  That was more than two      years ago  Mr  Griffith refused to comply    In an interpretation worthy of the      Queen of Hearts from      Alice in Wonderland  Mr  Griffith and his supporters have defied      logic and reason by turning Ms  Foxs letter upside down in an      attempt to characterize it as something other than it is and to      condone his conduct  If he will make this self serving      interpretation in this case  what makes anyone think that he will      not be the same sort of ends oriented judge that will twist facts      and law in cases he rules on from the federal bench  Ms  Foxs      recommendation that he closely associate himself with a Utah      lawyer until he takes the bar and becomes a member of the bar was      not offered as an indefinite safe harbor that permits him to violate      Utah law  Ms  Foxs letter is being misused and mischaracterized as      an invitation to flout the law  This is the kind of      reinterpretation in ones own interest that characterizes judicial      activism of the worst sort when employed by a judge    There are more reasons for serious      concern about Mr  Griffiths fitness to be a member of the D C       Circuit Court  His judgment is brought into serious question by his      views on Title IX of our civil rights laws  This charter of      fundamental fairness has been the engine for overcoming      discrimination against women in education and the growth of womens      athletics  I urge all Senators to think about our daughters and      granddaughters  the pride we felt when the  U S  womens soccer team began winning      gold medals and World Cups  the joy they see in young women with the      opportunity to play basketball and ski and compete and grow     With the recent reinterpretation of      Title IX being imposed by this Administration in ways that will no      doubt be challenged through the courts  we may now understand why      the Bush Administration sees the appointment of Mr  Griffith to the      D C  Circuit Court as such a priority  His narrow views on Title IX      were unveiled during his efforts as a member of the Bush      Administration Secretary of Educations Commission on  Opportunity in Athletics  to constrict      the impact of Title IX  Does anyone doubt that he would rule that      the Bush Administrations revision through regulations should be      upheld   The United States Supreme Court      recently decided that whistleblowers are protected in the Title IX      context  That was a close   5 4 decision  in which Justice      OConnor wrote for the majority  Just the other day the Justices      refused to hear a challenge to an appellate court decision that      essentially found that Title IX could not be blamed for cutbacks in      mens athletic programs  These recent legal developments regarding      Title IX serve to remind us how important each of these lifetime      appointments to the federal courts is  In light of the record on      this nomination  I am not prepared to take a chance on it and will      vote against it   I also note that during the  Clinton presidency  Senate      Republicans ensured that the 11th and 12th      judgeships on the D C  Circuit were not filled  They had argued      since 1995 that the caseload of the D C  Circuit did not justify a      full complement on the court  Indeed at a 1995 hearing  they called      Judge Laurence H  Silberman of the circuit to so testify       Republicans have argued for years this circuits caseload per judge      is one of the lightest in the country  In a May 9  2000  letter to      Senator Kyl  Judge Silberman argued that the D C  Circuits caseload      continued to decline from 1995 to 2000 and to oppose confirmation of      additional Clinton nominees    In fact  the D C  Circuit caseload has      continued to decline and in 2004 was less than it was in 1999 when      Senate Republicans refused to consider two highly qualified and      moderate nominations by President Clinton to vacancies on the      circuit  With the confirmation of  Janice Rogers Brown to that court       there are now 10 confirmed  active judges for the D C  Circuit       which is what Republicans maintained was appropriate since 1999   With all the self righteous talk from      the other side of the aisle about their new found principle that      every judicial nominee is entitled to an up or down vote  the facts      are that in 1999 and 2000 the nomination of Elena Kagan to the D C       Circuit was pocket filibustered by those same Senate Republicans       Ms  Kagan is now Dean of the  Harvard Law School  Qualified  Yes       Was she given consideration in a Republican run Senate  Not on your      life  Likewise the nomination of Allen Snyder to a vacancy on the      D C  Circuit was never voted upon  Mr  Snyder is a former clerk to      Chief Justice Rehnquist and was a highly respected partner in a      prominent D C  law firm  the same law firm from which President Bush      nominated John Roberts to the same court  Senate Republicans pocket      filibustered President Clintons nomination of Mr  Snyder but      unanimously supported the confirmation of Mr  Roberts  Senate      Republicans played a cruel joke on Mr  Snyder when they allowed him      a hearing but would never list him for a vote before the Judiciary      Committee or the Senate    In September 2002  Senator Sessions      explained that Clinton      nominees Elena Kagan and Allen Snyder were blocked  Because the      circuit had a caseload about one fourth the average caseload per      judge And the chief judge of the circuit said 10 judges is enough       instead of 12  And I actually thought that was too many  I thought      ten was too many    Well  the D C  Circuits caseload per      judge is lower now than it was during the Clinton Administration       Let us see whether the votes of Republican Senators this time will      be based on the same rationale they gave to pocket filibuster  Clinton nominees    Last week we witnessed a Republican      Senator  who had voted against the confirmation of a  Clinton judicial recess appointment      and had explained his vote as opposition to recess appointments       reverse himself to vote for a Bush judicial recess appointment       Last week we witnessed dozens of Republican Senators  who had voted      against confirmation of Ronnie White of Missouri in 1999 and      explained their vote as compelled by the opposition of his      home state Senators  reverse themselves and vote in favor of Justice      Janice Rogers Brown and ignore the strong  consistent and well      founded opposition of her two home state Senators    Tomorrow we will see whether the many      Republican Senators who delayed and opposed the confirmation of      judge Merrick Garland in 1996 and 1997 and who pocket filibustered      the nominations of Allen Snyder and Elena Kagan in 1999 and 2000      vote against a Bush nominee to the D C  Circuit because the caseload      of the circuit does not justify more judges  Tomorrow we will see      if many Republican Senators again retreat from their earlier      rationale because today a Republican controls the White House
