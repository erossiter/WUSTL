       Democratic Senators Seek Key Information From Judge Alito s Work In   Justice Department                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                    Democratic Senators Seek Key Information       From Judge Alito s Work In Justice Department  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Dec  20            The Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee        sent the following letter to Attorney General Alberto        Gonzales Tuesday seeking key documents relating to the        nomination of Samuel Alito to be Associate Justice of the        Supreme Court  In their letter  Senators have requested        information omitted from the Committees questionnaire         including work material from Judge Alitos time in the        Justice Department during the Reagan Administration  Judge        Alito worked in the Solicitor Generals office from 1981 to        1985         and then in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1986 to 1987         In their letter  Senators noted that some documents        relating to Alitos work in the Solicitor Generals office        have already been released to the public  The Senators are        also seeking approximately 45 opinions Judge Alito worked on        during his time in the Departments Office of Legal Counsel           PDF                    December 20  2005  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales       Attorney General       United States Department of Justice       950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC        20530  Dear Attorney General        Gonzales   As part of the Judiciary        Committees preparation for the hearings on the nomination        of Judge Samuel A  Alito  Jr   to the Supreme Court of the       United States  we write to request that the        Department of Justice provide to the Committee materials in        its possession relating to his service in the Department         Most or all of these materials were called for by the        Senate Judiciary Committee Questionnaire  and all will be        important in evaluating Judge Alitos nomination  As you        know  the Department of Justice has provided similar        documents in the consideration of past nominees   We write specifically to        request   1  internal memoranda that Judge Alito produced        within the Office of the Solicitor General  OSG  relating to        cases before the Supreme Court  and  2  the approximately 45        opinions we have not yet received  as well as any internal        memoranda  which Judge Alito wrote or supervised at the        Office of Legal Counsel  OLC    As to the OSG memoranda  the        Department of Justice has on many occasions in the past        provided the Senate with internal documents in response to        similar requests  In a break from this pattern of        cooperation  this administration has in a few instances        flatly refused requests for OSG documents based on the idea        that the release of internal OSG documents would hamper the        free flow of ideas among attorneys within the office  That        argument carries little weight in this instance  however  as        three memoranda that Judge Alito prepared within the OSG        have already been released  only because they happen to have        made their way to the National Archives  In addition to the        legal point that the release of these documents represents a        waiver of any privilege that could apply to Judge Alitos        OSG memoranda  the release of these documents makes several        points very clear to us   First  the internal memoranda        Judge Alito produced at the OSG appear to have been        substantive and extremely relevant to the Senates        consideration of his nomination  The memoranda we have        received thus far illuminate Judge Alitos personal legal        views of important constitutional issues  as well as his        approach to precedent and other key judicial concepts  The        OSG memoranda we have already seen make it clear that we and        the American people could learn much about Judge Alitos        judicial philosophy and legal thinking from his remaining        OSG memoranda   In addition  the public        disclosure of memoranda revealing Judge Alitos role in the        inner workings of the OSG does not appear to have impacted        the present operation of that office or hampered the free        flow of ideas within the Department of Justice  Just as the        Department continued to function effectively after the        release of internal OSG memoranda and other internal        Department of Justice materials in connection with numerous        past nominations  so the Department moves forward unscathed        now  Many of these confidential documents  as we have        seen  make their way into the files of various government        officials and to the public through Freedom of Information        Act requests over time anyway  with no apparent ill effect         There is no reason to think that the release of additional        memoranda produced by Judge Alito will impact the current        workings of the Department  when the memoranda released thus        far have not   As we have set out in detail        in the past  the attorney client privilege does not apply to        requests from the Senate in furtherance of its explicit        constitutional responsibility  Senator Hatch has said         AThe        attorney client privilege exists as only a narrow exception        to broad rules of disclosure  And the privilege exists only        as a statutory creation  or by operation of State common        law  No statute or Senate or House rule applies the        attorney client privilege to Congress  In fact  both the        Senate and the House have explicitly refused to formally        include the privilege in their rules           Congressional Record  Dec  20  1995   Nor do we believe        that the President holds the attorney client privilege in        relation to work that Judge Alito performed for the American        people at the OSG  We need not fully rehash our previous        discussion of the attorney client privilege in detail here         however  because the disclosure of several of Judge Alitos        OSG memoranda renders the issue of attorney client privilege        moot   We also note that the        requested documents are responsive to question 14 b  of the        Judiciary Committees questionnaire  which asked Judge Alito        to provide  in connection with any public office  he has         held   any reports  memoranda  or policy statements        prepared or produced with  his  participation  These        documents also may be responsive to question 15 f          which asked him to describe his practice before the Supreme        Court of the United States  In spite of these questions on        point  we have learned about several cases in which Judge        Alito participated substantially at the OSG but which do not        appear in his questionnaire responses  so we cannot be sure        which key cases he wrote about in that office  We        accordingly are unable to restrict the list of cases for        which we are requesting documents   As to the OLC memoranda  Judge        Alito indicated in his 1990 questionnaire for his nomination        to the Third Circuit that he wrote or supervised the        preparation of approximately 50 such        memoranda while Deputy Assistant Attorney General at OLC         Four of these memoranda are publicly available  and the        Department of Justice has recently provided a fifth  we now        request the remaining opinions and any internal legal        memoranda  Some OLC opinions in which he participated may        be public already  but not readily identifiable as his work         in those instances  we simply ask that you identify the        relevant opinions    As with the OSG memoranda  the        memoranda that Judge Alito wrote or supervised at OLC        discussing important legal issues facing the government are        responsive to question 14 b  of the questionnaire and are        relevant to evaluating his legal thinking  And once again         several memoranda have already been made public without any        apparent harm to the office  Indeed  OLC memoranda are        generally prepared as advice for other components of        government and therefore are routinely distributed outside        of the office  Moreover  OLC opinions and memoranda from        the 1980s have little relevance to the current operation of        government  and some have been superseded  Sharing these        memoranda with the Senate now will help us to perform our        vital constitutional duty and to evaluate Judge Alitos        legal thinking without compromising Department or other        government interests   To the extent that you do have        concerns about protecting the confidentiality of other        attorneys in the OSG or the OLC  we would welcome working        with you to find ways to address these and any other        confidentiality concerns that may arise as to particular        documents  For several past Supreme Court nominations         there were discussions back and forth between Senators and        the Department of Justice about the production of documents         leading ultimately to mutually satisfactory solutions  We        look forward to such a process now and would welcome        speaking with you in person to discuss these issues further   We would appreciate your        prompt attention to this request so that the Committee may        have adequate time to review the requested documents in        preparation for Judge Alitos hearing  Thank you for your        cooperation with this request   Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY       EDWARD KENNEDY       JOSEPH BIDEN       HERB KOHL
