       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Judge Alito s Responses During   Today s Supreme Court Nominations Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Judge Alitos Responses During Todays      Supreme Court Nominations Hearing      January 10  2006  Judge Alitos      testimony today has raised many questions  There has been vague       inconsistent  and at times  contradictory testimony to what his      record shows and what his answers are today  I am troubled      by these inconsistencies  Fresh in our memories and experience is      the example of the testimony of Chief Justice Roberts  whose      consistent answers helped build a record that gave many of us who      voted for him the confidence in his candidacy that we needed to      have   Judge Alito      needs to do more than distance himself from his early  troubling      writings and views  he needs to explain why his views are different      today and that what he says is not simply the pledge of an eager      applicant trying to win a job
