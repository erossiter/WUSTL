       Remarks Of U S  Sen  Patrick Leahy  Introduction Of The National Guard   Empowerment Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Remarks Of U S  Sen  Patrick Leahy     Introduction Of The National Guard Empowerment Act Of 2007  S  430    January 30  2007        Mr  President  today I introduce legislation about     the National Guard with Senator Kit Bond  my fellow co chair of the     Senates National Guard Caucus  and Senator Ben Nelson  a longtime     caucus member and a subcommittee chair of the Senate Armed Services     Committee  The National Guard Empowerment Act of 2007 would improve the     management of the National Guard  and it will give the Guard more     responsibility in improving our defense arrangements at home  where the     Guard works in tandem with the nations governors to help keep our     communities safe  This legislation will strengthen the National Guard      the military  and our nation  and I believe it is something that     deserves our attention and approval  As Senators  we know all too well the many ways in     which our communities rely on the National Guard  The soldiers of the     National Guard  like their active duty counterparts  have expended an     extraordinary amount of will and sacrifice in the wars in Afghanistan     and Iraq  The National Guard comprised almost fifty percent of the     forces on the ground in Iraq less than two years ago  and now  as the     Pentagon plans to implement the Presidents plans for a troop     escalation  the percentage of Guard troops on the ground is set to rise     once again At the same time  we are constantly witness to the     equally heralded work that the National Guard has done to increase     security at home  Along with efforts to increase security along both     the Northern and Southern Borders  the Guard has bolstered security at     special events across the country  including the Olympics  the national     political party conventions  and events here in our nations Capital      Most importantly  the National Guard provided the best  the very best      response of any agency  Federal  State or local  in the disastrous     aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  sending tens of thousands of troops to     the hardest hit communities in relatively short order  When you look at these examples  it is indisputable     that the National Guard is only limited in what it can do for us by the     authorities  policies  available equipment  responsibilities  and     support that we give them   It is time to give the Guard more tools and support     to effectively carry out these responsibilities  With the knowledge that the use of the National     Guard is sure to increase in the future  the President  the Secretary of     Defense  and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs need unfettered and     unmediated advice about how to utilize the force  whether balancing both     the domestic and overseas missions of the National Guard or using the     Guard to support of the nations governors in domestic emergencies      Given this need for greater input on Guard matters  it is only logical     that the leadership within the National Guard should be the ones doing     the advising  And  as the Guard becomes more active within the     militarys Total Force  it only makes sense to increase the number of     Guard generals at the highest reaches of the military command  where key     force management decisions are made   At the same time  the National Guard is in a     position to deal with some of the basic missions at home that are simply     not being address by the Department of Defense  We have some real     heroes at the recently established Northern Command  which is working     with various civilian agencies to prevent another attack at home  Yet      the processes to deal with the mission of having military support of     civilian authorities in domestic emergencies are as yet undefined   Northern command  meanwhile  is taking only     perfunctory input from the nations governors who  along with local     officials  will bear much of the responsibility in disaster situations      Five years after September 11th  we cannot wait to give more definition     to how the military will support civil authorities in an emergency  and     we cannot wait until an actual emergency to inform state governors about     what resources are available to them  With some new authorities  we can     give the Guard the mission of leading the effort to support civilian     authorities at home and in working with the states and governors to plan     for such disasters  Elevating the National Guard bureaucratically      increasing the quality advice on the Guard to the senior command  and     improving response to domestic emergencies are exactly what the     provisions of the National Guard Empowerment Act will accomplish   First  the National Guard Empowerment Act elevates     the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from the rank of lieutenant     general to general with four stars  with a seat on the Joint Chiefs of     Staff  This move will give the nations governors and adjutants general     a straight line of communication to the Joint Chiefs Chairman  the     Secretary of Defense  and the President  Having personnel with more     knowledge and experience with the Guard involved in key budget and     policy deliberations  the branches of the active duty services will be     less willing to try to balance budgets on the back of the reserve forces     like the Guard  which only goes against our overall ability to respond      Second  the Act gives the National Guard the     responsibility of working with the states to identify gaps in their     response capabilities  of setting equipment requirements  and procuring     these much needed items  The Act will ensure that a National Guard     commander is the deputy commander of Northern Command and that the     Guardand thus  in turn  the governorswork in tandem with the command     to set out specific plans to support our elected and civilian leaders in     an emergency   Let me be clear about what this legislation does     not do  The Guard Empowerment Act does not make the National Guard a     separate armed service  The Guard will remain an integral partner of     the Army and the Air Force  Nor is the Act some kind of wanton power     grab  Instead  the Act would bring the National Guards bureaucratic     position in line with what it is already doing and what we will expect     of it in the future  Passage of the Act will  utmost  not disturb or     undermine our defense arrangements  Rather  it will empower the entire     military to deal with critically important problems that it is simply     not addressing  This legislation has been carefully crafted over     the past year and half  and it incorporates the input we received from     the adjutants general  the National Guard leadership  the governors  and     key officers across the defense establishment  I would like to submit     for the record letters of support from the National Guard Association of     the Untied States  the Enlisted Association of the National Guard of the     United States  and the Adjutants General Association of the United     States  This drive to empower the Guard is also gaining     momentum in Congress  Since 9 11 we have been asking the Guard to do     more and more  and they have superbly handled their dual role at home     and abroad  But strains are showing in the system  The Guard is a 21st     Century military organization that has to operate under a 20th Century     bureaucracy  The Guards ability to help the nation is limited only by     the resources  authorities  and responsibility we give it  Let us put     the trust in the men and women of the Guard that they have deserved and     earned  by giving them the seat at the table that they need
