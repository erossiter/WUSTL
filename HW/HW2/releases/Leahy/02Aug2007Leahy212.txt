       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The School Safety And Law Enforcement   Improvement Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Panel Passes Law       Enforcement      School Safety Bill  Bipartisan Response To Virginia Tech Tragedy  WASHINGTON  Friday  Aug       3   Just months after the tragic shootings at Virginia Polytechnic      Institute  the Senate Judiciary Committee has approved bipartisan      legislation that would provide essential support for law enforcement      and crucial enhancements to school safety nationwide     The School Safety and Law      Enforcement Improvement Act  SSLEIA   a comprehensive package of six      bills aimed at strengthening law enforcement and school safety  was      approved by the panel late Thursday by voice vote    I recognize that there      is no panacea to end the sad phenomenon of school violence  said      Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the chief sponsor of the reform      package  The tragedy at Virginia Tech should remind us all that we      need to remain vigilant  and that we need to respond in realistic      and meaningful ways when we are presented with such challenges   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The School Safety And Law Enforcement Improvement Act    August 2  2007    Today the Committee will take up the School Safety     and Law Enforcement Improvement Act  which responds to the tragic deaths     that occurred this past April on the campus of Virginia Tech  Obviously     there is no magic Congressional response that will be guaranteed to     prevent another horrific school tragedy  Working with a number of     Senators  we are originating this bill to combine five legislative     pieces into a more comprehensive strategy  In particular  I wish to     acknowledge the hard work and initiative of Senator Boxer and Senator     Jack Reed from outside this Committee and the leadership of Senators     Specter  Feingold  Schumer  and Durbin here   Our Committee originated bill seeks to enlist the     States as partners in the dissemination of critical information  to     distribute Federal dollars to improve the safety and security of our     schools and institutions of higher education and provide equitable     benefits to law enforcement serving those institutions  and to ensure     that law enforcement officers may answer the call of duty wherever they     may be   A number of law enforcement and other organizations     have signaled their support for this package  The Fraternal Order of     Police  the National Consortium for Justice Information and Statistics      SEARCH   the     International Association of Campus Law Enforcement Administrators  and     campus police forces from around the country have all worked with us and     contributed to this package  I thank them for their strong support  I     will make their letters of support part of our record  Support from     this cross section of organizations is a good start to building a solid     bipartisan consensus for this legislation  and I hope all Senators will     join in supporting this bill   In the aftermath of the events last April at     Virginia Tech  Governor Tim Kaine convened the Virginia Tech Review     Panel to provide an independent  thorough  and objective incident     review  and to make recommendations for improved campus safety  I     commend Governor Kaine and the work of the panel and look forward to     their final report  In the meantime  to order to do what we can in     connection with school resuming in the fall  I hope that we will move     forward today  I first listed the bill in our notice of July 5 for our     business meeting on July 12  We circulated the text of the measure on     July 11 expecting to allow until July 19 for all Members to be familiar     with it  Nonetheless  the matter was held over on July 19  and not     enough Members came to last weeks business meeting to make a quorum  I     hope that we can finally complete our work on this important and timely     measure today   Here is a brief outline of what the bill does   Title I  the School Safety Enhancements Act      would improve safety and security of students both at the elementary and     secondary school level  and on college and university campuses  The     K 12 improvements are drawn from a bill that Senator Boxer introduced in     April  and I want to I want to thank Senator Boxer for her hard work on     this issue  I also want to thank Senator Durbin for his commitment to     this issue  This title allows existing Justice Department     grants to now be used for tip lines  surveillance equipment  and capital     improvements to schools  It increases authorized federal funding to     ease the burden on local school districts for implementing security     enhancements  These improvements will make our elementary and secondary     schools safer by funding much needed infrastructure improvements  and     they will enable students to report potentially dangerous situations to     school administrators before they occur   The tragic events at Virginia Tech underscore that     we must be vigilant at all levels of government to ensure that our more     than 4 000 colleges and universities are safe and secure  Institutions     of higher education are home to more than 15 million students  They     serve not only their students  but also the wider community  Campuses     also contain some of our most prized and sensitive assets  such as     world class research facilities and nuclear reactors  There is a strong     federal interest in ensuring the safety and security of colleges and     universities  According to the Congressional Research Service  however      there is currently no federal funding targeted to help these     institutions comply with existing campus security requirements  let     alone to fund new campus safety initiatives   To address the new realities of campus safety in     the wake of the events at Virginia Tech  and in an era of increased risk     of terrorist attacks  the bill creates a matching grant program for     campus safety and security to be administered out of the COPS Office of     the Department of Justice  The grant program allows institutions of     higher learning to apply directly for federal funds to make school     safety and security improvements  The program is authorized to be     appropriated at  50 000 000 for the next two fiscal years  While this     amounts to just  3 per student each year  it will enable schools to more     effectively respond to dangerous and emergency situations on campus  It     is encouraging that the Higher Education bill and perhaps other bills     include similar provisions and may make additional federal funds     available for college and university safety improvements  Title I also authorizes appropriations for the     creation of a National Center for Campus Public Safety  The Department     of Justice COPS Office recommended the creation of a National Center     after its 2004 National Summit on Public Safety  in order to support     research  sharing of best practices  and strategic planning  A national     clearinghouse for campus safety information is needed now more than     ever   Title II of the bill seeks to improve the National     Instant Criminal Background Check System  known as the NICS system  The     senseless loss of life at Virginia Tech revealed deep flaws in the     transfer of information relevant to gun purchases between the States and     the Federal Government  The deficiencies in the current system     permitted the perpetrator of this terrible crime to obtain a firearm     despite the fact that a judge had declared him to be a danger to himself     and thus ineligible under federal law  Sueng Hui Cho was not eligible     to buy a weapon given his mental health history  but he was still able     to pass a background check because data was missing from the system      We are working to close gaps in the NICS system   This bill will correct these problems and should     dramatically improve the NICS system  It incorporates the NICS     Improvement Amendments Act of 2007  which was recently passed by the     House  Senator Schumer has been the Senate sponsor on this measure  I     have worked with many of the Senators on the Committee over the past few     weeks to address concerns with this and other parts of the bill  For the first time  this bill will create a legal     regime in which disqualifying mental health records  both at the State     and Federal level  would regularly be reported into the NICS system      This bill would require Federal agencies to report mental health and     other disqualifying records into NICS  and would create significant new     incentives for States to report this information   For the States  the bill is structured with funding     rewards for States that substantially comply and penalties for States     that do not  in order to encourage every State to reach realistic     compliance targets in reporting to NICS  To accomplish these important     goals  the bill authorizes up to  400 million a year for 5 years to     allow States to make the costly technological improvements necessary to     improve the NICS system   If we are serious about improving the NICS system      the Federal Government must work in partnership with the States  and we     must provide the resources necessary to assist the States in making     these changes  We must avoid unfunded mandates that would hinder this     partnership   Title III of the bill includes a measure to make     sworn law enforcement officers who work for private institutions of     higher education  as well as rail carriers  eligible for death and     disability benefits  and for funds administered under the Byrne Grant     program and the bulletproof vest partnership grant program  Providing     this equitable treatment is in the best interest of our nations     educators and students  and will serve to place the support of the     Federal Government behind the dedicated law enforcement officers who     serve and protect private colleges and universities across the country      I commend Senator Jack Reed for his leadership in this area   Title IV of the bill makes improvements to the Law     Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2003  This Committee recently     ordered these provisions reported  These amendments to existing law     will streamline the system by which qualified retired and active     officers can be certified under LEOSA  Congress passed the 2003 bill in     recognition of the fact that law enforcement officers are never off duty     and face lasting dangers due to the nature of their profession  It     serves us all when we permit qualified officers  with a demonstrated     commitment to law enforcement and no adverse employment history  to     protect themselves and their families wherever they may be   Finally  Title V incorporates the PRECAUTION Act      which Senators Feingold and Specter asked to have included  I thank     them for their work on this important piece  The national commission     created by this provision will identify the most successful violence     prevention and intervention strategies that can be used in schools and     will issue a report for local law enforcement and school boards to     utilize when deciding how to keep their students safe  This provision     also creates a program through the National Institute of Justice that     funds grants to further develop cutting edge prevention and intervention     programs for our schools  Of course  keeping our students and     communities safe does not stop at the schoolhouse doors  so the     PRECAUTION Act also provides funds for this important work in     community based programs and programs run by the police  I have long     been a supporter of crime prevention and intervention programs  and     these programs nicely complement the school safety provisions in this     bill  I recognize that there is no panacea to end the sad     phenomenon of school violence  The tragedy at Virginia Tech should     remind us all that we need to remain vigilant  and that we need to     respond in realistic and meaningful ways when we are presented with such     challenges  I hope we can reach a consensus and move this bill forward     to invest in the safety of our students  who are our nations future      improve the NICS system  and support law enforcement officers across the     country                    Background   School      Safety and Law Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007  In response to the      tragedy at Virginia Polytechnic Institute  Chairman Leahy has      combined several pre existing bills into a comprehensive package      that provides for appropriate improvements in school safety and law      enforcement  The package    titled The School Safety and Law      Enforcement Improvement Act of 2007  SSLEIA     combines six bills      previously reported to or by the Judiciary Committee  with some      modifications  and was reported out of Committee by a unanimous vote      on August 2  2007  As amended  SSLEIA includes the following     The School Safety      Enhancements Act  S 1217     The NICS Improvement      Amendments Act  H R  2640     The Equity in Law      Enforcement Act  S 1448     The Law Enforcement      Officers Safety Act of 2007  S 376      The Prevention      Resources for Eliminating Criminal Activity in our Neighborhoods       PRECAUTION  Act  S  1521     The Terrorism Hoax      Improvements Act of 2007  S  735    Title      I   School Safety Enhancements Act   This      title addresses school safety concerns both at the elementary and      secondary school level  K 12   and for college and university      campuses  The K 12 portion adds tip lines  surveillance equipment       and capital improvements to schools as approved uses for an existing      Justice Department grant program  and increases annual appropriation      authorization for this purpose from  30 000 000 to  50 000 000  It      also creates an interagency task force to develop advisory      guidelines on school safety  The campus public safety portion      authorizes the Attorney General to award grants to establish and      operate a National Center for Campus Public Safety   2 75 million      annually   and creates a new Justice Department grant program to      help pay for improved campus security at institutions of higher      learning  with annual authorized appropriations of  50 000 000   Title      II  The NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007   This title      would substantially improve the National Instant Criminal Background      System  NICS  by providing far more mental health and other      disqualifying records into the system  The bill more clearly      defines what mental health records should be reported to NICS by      federal and state authorities  and mandates all federal authorities      to provide disqualifying information to the NICS system  The bill      also encourages states and the federal government to implement legal      programs for restoration of gun rights  if a person has recovered      from any mental health disability  The bill creates a carrot and      stick approach for states to reach compliance targets in all      disqualifying categories for gun possession under 18 U S C     922 g       and 922 n   The carrot in the bill is a waiver of the 10       matching requirement for states to qualify for the NCHIP grant      program once states reach 90  compliance  The stick is a      graduated penalty which could take away up to 5  of a state s Byrne      grant funding if the state s do not meet certain compliance targets       3  penalty after 3 years  4  after 5 years  and 5  after 10      years   The bill also authorizes up to  400 million a year over 5      years in new grant funding for improvements to the information      technology and state compliance programs to ensure all states meet      the 90  compliance goal for reporting records to NICS    Title      III  Equity in Law Enforcement Act   This title      would provide Federal death and disability benefits  Byrne grants       and grants for bulletproof vests to officers serving rail carriers      and at private colleges and universities  These officers are      currently ineligible for these benefits and law enforcement grants         Title      IV  Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007         The      title also amends existing law  18 U S C  926B  926C  to clarify      that Amtrak and executive branch police officers are law enforcement      officers for purposes of LEOSA  Finally  this title reduces from 15      to 10 years the length of service requirement applicable to retired      law enforcement officers seeking certification to carry concealed      weapons  and no longer requires that an officer be entitled to      non forfeitable benefits for purposes of LEOSA  Finally  the      title also contains a mandate for a study to be conducted by the      Government Accountability Office  GAO   This provision directs      the GAO to commence a study not later than six months following      enactment to determine how many officers are certified for      interstate concealed firearms carriage under the existing law  18      U S C  926B  926C   with specific direction to ascertain how many      retired officers have used the new provisions included in the      amendments made by the SSLEIA    This bill was reported by      the Judiciary Committee on May 17  2007 and awaits consideration by      the Senate  The Chairman has re introduced this bill for      consideration in this package    Title      V  PRECAUTION Act         This title creates a National      Commission on Public Safety to examine existing information on crime      prevention and intervention strategies  to identify those programs      that are most promising for nationwide use  and to issue a      preliminary report on its findings  Based on the preliminary      report  the PRECAUTION Act will fund pilot programs  through the      National Institute of Justice  to test the programs effectiveness      at reducing violence at schools  and in home and law enforcement      settings  The Commission will then issue a second report evaluating      the effectiveness of the pilot programs to help determine future      priorities  Two thirds of the PRECAUTION Acts funding is      youth focused         Title VI  The Terrorist      Hoax Improvements Act of 2007         This title will be added      to SSLEIA before the bill is reported to the full Senate  It   1       expands 18 U S C  1038  the terrorism hoax statute  so that it      punishes hoaxes about any terrorist offense listed in 2332b g  5  B       of title 18  the U S  Codes official list of terrorist offenses         2  increases the maximum penalties for hoaxes about the death or      injury of a U S  soldier during wartime   3  expands current laws      civil liability provisions to allow first responders and others to      seek reimbursement from a party who perpetrates a hoax and becomes      aware that first responders believe that a terrorist offense is      taking place but fails to inform authorities that no such event has      occurred  and  4  clarifies that threatening communications are      punishable under federal law even if they are directed at an      organization rather than a natural person
