Restoring  25M To Boys  Girls Clubs    The        Senate Thursday night adopted Senator Patrick Leahys amendment restoring        funding to the Boys and Girls Clubs of America during consideration of the        FY 2006 Budget Resolution  Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the        Senate Judiciary Committee  offered the amendment to restore  25 million        that was cut from the important youth program in the Budget Resolution   Leahy  who also serves as        a senior member of the Appropriations Committee  was a principal co author        of a bipartisan law last year reauthorizing Justice Department        grants through FY 2010 for the Boys and Girls Clubs program  The Budget        Resolution as proposed would have cut those grants in by  25 million next        year  Leahys amendment restores that funding   Below is Leahys        statement on his amendment          ________________________________  Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy       On Leahy Amendment  237       On Restoring Funding For The Boys And Girls Clubs Of America  To the Budget Resolution  S Con Res  18  March 17  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr  President         I offer an amendment that will restore funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs        of America to current fiscal year levels so the Clubs can continue to help        our nations children to become productive  law abiding teenagers and        contributing adults  We have a responsibility        to make sure that our children are safe and secure  I know firsthand how        well Boys and Girls Clubs work and what topnotch organizations they are         When I was a prosecutor in Vermont  I was convinced of the great        need for Boys and Girls Clubs because we rarely encountered children from        these kinds of programs  In fact  after I became a U S  Senator  a police        chief was such a big fan that he asked me to help fund a Boys and Girls        Club in his district rather than helping him get a couple more police        officers  In Vermont  Boys        and Girls Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and supporting our        children  The first Club was established in Burlington 63 years ago  Now        we have 20 club sites operating throughout the State in Addison         Chittenden  Orange  Rutland  Washington  Windham and Windsor Counties         There are also four new Boys and Girls Clubs in the works in Winooski         Brattleboro  Barre and Vergennes  These clubs will serve well over 10 000        kids statewide  As a senior member of the        Senate Appropriations Committee  I have pushed for more Federal funding for        Boys and Girls Clubs  Since 1998  Congress has increased Federal support        for Boys and Girls Clubs from  20 million to  85 million in this fiscal        year  Due in large part to this increase in funding  there now exist 3 500        Boys and Girls Clubs in all 50 States serving more than 4 million young        people  Because of these        successes  I was both surprised and disappointed to see that the President        requested a reduction of  25 million for FY 2006  That request will leave        thousands of children and their Clubs behind  We cannot allow such a thing        to happen  Last year  Senator Hatch        and I worked together to shepherd into law a reauthorization of        Justice Department grants at  80 million for FY 2006   85 million for FY        2007   90 million for FY 2008   95 million for FY 2009 and  100 million for        FY 2010 to Boys and Girls Clubs to help establish 1 500 additional Boys and        Girls Clubs across the nation with the goal of having 5 000 Boys and Girls        Clubs in operation by December 31  2010  If we had a Boys and        Girls Club in every community  prosecutors in our country would have a lot        less work to do because of the values that are being instilled in children        from the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  Each time I visit a club in       Vermont  I am approached by parents  educators  teachers         grandparents and law enforcement officers who tell me Keep doing this         These clubs give our children the chance to grow up free of drugs  gangs        and crime  You cannot argue that        these are just Democratic or Republican ideas  or Conservative or Liberal        ideas  they are simply good sense ideas  We need safe havens where our        youth  the future of our country  can learn and grow up free from the        influences of drugs  gangs and crime  That is why Boys and Girls Clubs are        so important to our children  Across the nation  Boys        and Girls Clubs are proven and growing successes in preventing crime and        supporting our children  My amendment will restore funding for the Boys        and Girls Clubs of America to the FY 2005 level of  85 million  It also        expresses the sense of the Senate on the value of Boys and Girls Clubs in        their mission to inspire and enable all young people  especially those from        disadvantaged circumstances  to realize their full potential as productive         responsible and caring citizens  Congress has authorized        and appropriated a rising level of funding for the Boys  Girls Clubs of        America in each of the last eight years because of the Clubs proven role        in discouraging youth gangs  drug abuse and youth violence  The Budget        Resolution  following the Presidents lead  reduces funding for Boys and        Girls Clubs by  25 million  from  85 million to  60 million  and        completely ignores the five year authorization for the Boys and Girls Club        grant program enacted by Congress and signed by the President in October        2004  A drop to  60 million in the coming fiscal year will likely result        in an across the board decrease of 30 percent to club pass thru grants  as        well as a 30 percent cut to the overall increase in youth served  Mr  President  I urge the        Senate to adopt the Leahy amendment to restore funding by  25 million for        the 2006 fiscal year for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America  Our        countrys strength and ultimate success lies with our children  Our        greatest responsibility is to help them inhabit this century the best way        possible and we can help do that by supporting the Boys and Girls Clubs of        America
