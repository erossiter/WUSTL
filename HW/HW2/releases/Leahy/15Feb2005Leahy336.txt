       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Michael Chertoff                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Nomination of Michael Chertoff        To Be Secretary Of Homeland Security        February 15  2005         WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Feb  15    The        Senate on Tuesday afternoon overwhelmingly voted  98 0  to confirm Michael        Chertoff to be the next Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security         Below is a statement in support of the nomination from Senator Patrick        Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary        Committee    Today the Senate will complete the        consideration of the nomination of Michael Chertoff to head the Department        of Homeland Security    Judge Chertoff currently serves as a Federal        Judge on the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  This is a lifetime        appointment that he has held for a relatively short time and that he will        be abandoning to return to Executive Branch service  I helped expedite and        voted in favor of Judge Chertoff when his nomination to the Third Circuit        came to the Senate in 2003    Before that he was the Assistant Attorney        General in charge of the Criminal Division at the Department of Justice  I        helped expedite and voted in favor of that nomination in 2001    I have worked with Mike Chertoff and        appreciate his background as a prosecutor  He is very capable  He works        hard  What one sees when you consider his career is that much of the time        he acts as a consummate professional in our best tradition  Although there        have been times when he has shown partisanship in an apparent effort to        earn his spurs with those on the extreme right  it is my hope and        expectation that he will bring his better angels with him as he embarks on        his new role as Secretary of the Office of Homeland Security  That is not        a position that needs or deserves even a hint of partisanship  Indeed  one        of the moments that marred Secretary Ridges tenure was when he stepped out        of character to make a blatantly partisan pitch during the run up to the        recent presidential election    I was astonished when President Bush announced        that he had chosen Bernie Kerik to replace Secretary Ridge  When        newspapers and news magazines began looking at that nomination  it became        apparent that the vetting of that nomination was shoddy and that Mr  Kerik        was an unacceptable choice on a number of grounds  That misadventure cost        us time and led to Judge Chertoffs nomination being made later than it        should have been by the Administration    The Senate has expedited consideration of this        nomination  In what I hope is a sign of better days to come and of        increased responsiveness  I note that this nominee has responded in kind by        seeking to answer in one days time a letter I sent to him  I appreciate        that kind of responsiveness    In light of his effort  I will excuse his        missing the point in failing to respond directly to my first question  I        raised with the nominee an aspect of his conversations with representatives        of the intelligence community while he was serving as a principal law        enforcer charged with prosecutions under the anti torture law  My question        to Judge Chertoff was an opportunity for him to reflect on the        inappropriateness of the chief prosecutor advising lawyers for possible        investigatory targets regarding how he would apply the law and what might        provide a safe harbor when it came to torture    I commend Senator Levin for trying to get to        the substance of those conversations during confirmation hearings  Sadly        but all too characteristically  the Bush Administration has refused to        provide him or the Senate with the relevant materials in this regard  I        am  likewise  concerned that Mr  Chertoff was not more assertive during        discussions with the Office of Legal Counsel as it headed down the wrong        road in trying artificially to narrow the definition of torture to provide        latitude that contributed to widespread international scandals in our        wrongful treatment of prisoners  I wish someone within the Bush        Administration at the time had stood up for the rule of law and had        succeeded in derailing the search directed by Judge Gonzales to create        loopholes in our law    I appreciate that Judge Chertoff has committed        to implementing the recommendations of the Inspector General with respect        to preserving the civil rights of those detained by the Government in his        answer to my second question  That inquiry derived from his testimony to        the Judiciary Committee in November 2001   Finally  I asked a series of questions about        the so called wall between law enforcement investigations and        intelligence  The 9 11 Commission Report went a long way toward        dismantling the myth that former Attorney General Ashcroft had tried to        perpetuate  I recall when even President Bush upbraided Attorney General        Ashcroft following his assault upon Commissioner Gorelick at the 9 11        Commission hearings    I pointed out that during the Clinton        Administration almost one year before September 11  2001  the Department of        Justice Office of Legal Counsel had issued an official memorandum noting        the Governments position on Sharing Title III Electronic Surveillance        Material with the Intelligence Community  which concluded that law        enforcement officials may share surveillance information with the        intelligence community to obtain assistance in preventing  investigating or        prosecuting a crime  or where the information was of overriding importance        to national security or foreign relations    As Judge Chertoff recalls  it was Attorney        General Ashcroft who adopted measures on January 21  2000  and it        was the memorandum issued by Deputy Attorney General Thompson on August 6         2001  that governed information sharing in the days leading to the disaster        that was September 11  Indeed  Judge Chertoff notes  When it was deemed        to be appropriate  additional procedures were put in place in specific        cases  or in sets of related cases  He proceeds to concede that without        any change in the law  in the time between September 11 and enactment of        the USA PATRIOT Act  With court approval  some of these procedures were        modified between 9 11 and October 26  2001  the effective date of the USA        PATRIOT Act    The 9 11 Commission established during its        investigation that in the days and months before September 11  2001         information sharing requirements and procedures were misunderstood and        misapplied at the Department of Justice  I appreciated Judge Chertoffs        offering a glimpse into the inner workings of the Ashcroft Justice        Department in the days that led up to 9 11 when he noted that there was a        vigorous internal debate about the appropriate procedures for sharing        information collected in foreign intelligence and counterterrorism        investigations with criminal agents and prosecutors  That internal        debate was unresolved on September 11  2001  when terrorists struck in New        York and at the Pentagon and were thwarted in the sky over Pennsylvania          When the Justice Department came forward to        work with the Senate in the weeks following the attacks  I worked with Mr         Chertoff to ensure that law enforcement and intelligence efforts were        better coordinated  and I urged him  the Attorney General and the Director        of the FBI to change the culture that had led to destructive and        dysfunctional hoarding of essential security information   I ask that copies of my letter to Judge        Chertoff and his response be included in the Record at this point   Heading the Department of Homeland Security is        a position that may be one of the more difficult assignments in        Washington and in Government  The work of the Department of Homeland        Security  DHS  is crucial to the safety and security of the American        people  There remain many problems in integrating the elements of the        Department and in making them as effective as we need them to be  I remain        concerned with a number of issues in need of greater attention at DHS and        much more significant support from the highest levels of the Bush        Administration  Working with Secretary Chertoff  maybe we will be able to        get that attention and support    First        Responders  The Bush Administration has failed to        provide the necessary assistance for first responders throughout our        nation  As the costs borne by law enforcement agencies across the country        continue to rise  we need to increase the partnership help offered to our        nations first responders  Instead  in the Presidents new budget  he has        proposed cutting overall funding for first responders by  670 million         These cuts target vital emergency services affecting every State         regardless of size or population  The President also proposed cutting the        all state minimum for first responder grants from 0 75 percent to 0 25        percent  That new formula would result in the loss of funds to police         firefighters and emergency rescue squads in dozens of states from coast to        coast  In Vermont  this would mean a loss of at least  10 million dollars        in fiscal year 2006  grant funds that are used to provide security        services along thousands of miles of our border with three states         Vermonts border with Canada spans approximately 95 miles  but the Swanton        Border Patrol is charged with protecting 24 000 square miles  which        includes not only the entire State of Vermont  but also numerous counties        in New York and New Hampshire  Within this area  the Swanton Border Patrol        is required to patrol more than 261 miles of International Boundary    Vulnerable Ports  Our        approach to port security is also insufficient  More than 90 percent of        the worlds trade is moved in cargo containers  The Government        Accountability Office has found that the information that the Bureau of        Customs and Border Patrol uses to determine which cargo should be searched        is one of the least reliable or useful for targeting purposes  In        addition  our government has been slow to install radiation detection        portals at our ports  leaving us vulnerable to the smuggling of a nuclear        or radiological weapon    Mass        Transit Measures Idle  Our mass transit systems are        similarly at risk  While we spent about  4 5 billion on aviation security        last year  we devoted only  65 million to rail security  even though five        times as many people take trains as planes every day  The Madrid bombing        vividly demonstrated the potential vulnerability of mass transit  and I am        concerned that the Administration is not responding effectively enough to        this threat  This needs to be a higher priority than the Administration        has made it  The TSA has been slow in developing security procedures at        port and rail facilities around the country  and our transit and freight        transportation systems remain at risk  The recent DHS budget submission        cuts funding for the following essential security programs port security        grants  port security incident response  intercity bus grants  container        threat assessments  nuclear detection and monitoring  hazmat truck tracking        and training  and rail security inspectors    Air        Security Concerns Linger  Despite the dedicated        resources to aviation security  problems remain  There have been several        reorganizations of the TSAs airport screeners program  but reports from        the GAO and the DHS Office of Inspector General suggest that the screening        programs for baggage and passengers at our nations airports are not as        effective as they should be  We need to ensure that the  4 734 784 000        budget request for aviation security this year is spent wisely and        properly          Immigration  Secretary Chertoff  if he is confirmed         will oversee both the enforcement of our immigration laws and the granting        of immigration benefits  We face a number of important choices on        immigration in the coming years  and I hope that he will play a        constructive role    I urge him to support the bipartisan efforts        in Congress to improve the H 2B visa program  so we can meet the needs of        small employers around our nation who depend on seasonal immigrant labor to        stay in business  I hope he will support the bipartisan AgJOBS bill         which provides relief both to the agriculture industry and to the immigrant        farm workers who make up a majority of the farm workforce in our nation         And as the Congress debates fundamental immigration reform  I hope that        Judge Chertoff will work to help ensure that any reform efforts recognize        and embrace the tremendous contributions of immigrants to our economy and        our culture    I would like to note the release last week of        a report by the U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  a        bipartisan commission created by Congress that we asked to study the        expedited removal system and its effect on asylum seekers  In his response        to me last week  Judge Chertoff showed a commendable concern for the civil        rights of those who were detained due to alleged immigration violations        during the 9 11 investigation  His concern should be even more pronounced        here  where the Commission found that DHS detains people who seek refuge in        the United States  and are not even accused of committing any        criminal or civil violation  under conditions that are entirely        inappropriate for asylum seekers fleeing persecution    If we are to recapture Americas        rightful place as a haven for the oppressed  the tragic situation of asylum        seekers must be rectified  The Commission offered a number of        recommendations that can be implemented through administrative action  such        as establishing an office within DHS to oversee the treatment of refugees        and asylum seekers and issuing formal regulations governing when asylum        seekers should be released from detention  I urge Judge Chertoff to begin        the process of making these changes immediately    As Secretary  Judge Chertoff will also        supervise a number of outstanding federal employees who are Vermonters and        work for various components of the Department  particularly in DHS        immigration agencies  I believe he will be pleased with their efforts and        their expertise    Secretary Ridge and I have disagreed strongly        about DHS efforts to privatize Immigration Information Officer  IIO  and        other positions at the agency  and Congress has barred that privatization        for the current fiscal year  Among other duties  IIOs perform background        checks on applicants for immigration benefits  a function that should be        performed by government employees  I urge Secretary Chertoff to consider        the repeated votes of both the House and Senate to maintain these positions        as government employees and to make no effort to revisit the unwise and        unpopular efforts of his predecessor    I will support this nomination  Secretary Chertoff will face        great challenges ahead  I hope that he will work with me and others  on        both sides of the aisle  in finding the best solutions in meeting them
