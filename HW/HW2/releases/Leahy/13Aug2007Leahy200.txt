       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Resignation Of White House Deputy   Chief Of Staff Karl Rove                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Resignation Of White House Deputy Chief Of Staff Karl Rove    August 13  2007 Earlier this month  Karl Rove failed to comply     with the Judiciary Committee s subpoena to testify about the mass     firings of United States Attorneys  Despite evidence that he played a     central role in these firings  just as he did in the Libby case     involving the outing of an undercover CIA agent and improper political     briefings at over 20 government agencies  Mr  Rove acted as if he was     above the law  That is wrong  Now that he is leaving the White House     while under subpoena  I continue to ask what Mr  Rove and others at the     White House are so desperate to hide  Mr  Roves apparent attempts to     manipulate elections and push out prosecutors citing bogus claims of     voter fraud shows corruption of federal law enforcement for partisan     political purposes  and the Senate Judiciary Committee will continue its     investigation into this serious issue  The list of senior White House and Justice     Department officials who have resigned during the course of these     congressional investigations continues to grow  and today  Mr  Rove     added his name to that list  There is a cloud over this White House      and a gathering storm  A similar cloud envelops Mr  Rove  even as he     leaves the White House
