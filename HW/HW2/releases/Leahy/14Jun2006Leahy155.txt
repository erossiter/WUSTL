       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Flag Amendment News Conference With   Veterans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Flag Amendment News Conference With Veterans      Senate Capitol Grounds      June 14  2006  Good       morning  This feels familiar    another week  another partisan       effort to misuse our Constitution as some sort of political       bulletin board to rally voters and nudge up sagging poll       numbers  This sudden flurry of constitutional amendments is       enough to make a cynic ask whether gay marriage and flag burning       only reach the level of national crisis in even numbered years        which are election years   The Constitution is too important       to be used for partisan gain  and so is our American flag  We       all agree flag desecration is a despicable act  But our       Constitution is the bedrock of our rights and freedom as       Americans  We Vermonters are especially proud that we would not       join the Union until 1791  the year the Bill of Rights was       ratified  We should not now begin whittling away at the First       Amendment for the first time in our history   In this good and great country  we       fly the flag not because the government tells us to  but because       we want to  I hope that will never change   I am       honored to join today these brave veterans who have come to the       Capitol to oppose this divisive and transparent amendment        These veterans know firsthand what it means to risk their lives       for the freedoms our flag represents  It is those freedoms that       they have fought for  and it is those freedoms that matter most   This debate is yet another       diversion from the problems that should be high on the Senates       agenda    the real priorities of the American people and of our       veterans  We have just witnessed the largest theft of private       information from the Government ever  the loss of information on       more than 26 5 million American veterans  including more than 2       million in active service  That is nearly 80 percent of our       active duty force and a large percentage of our National Guard       and the Reserve  Helping veterans who face the threat of       identity theft should be a top priority on the Senate Floor       right now  but it is not  Improving veterans health care is       another pressing need  After the VAs leadership repeatedly       denying  then finally admitted  to a billion shortfall in       funding for veterans health care  it is long past time for us to       fulfill our responsibilities to those who have given so much so       that we could maintain our freedoms and way of life and provide       veterans with the best health care in the world  With hurricane       season once again upon us and the Guard troops carrying a heavy       load in Afghanistan and Iraq  re equipping the Guards depleted       equipment stocks also deserves the Senates attention right now          Instead of parroting partisan       talking points on the Senate floor  our time this month would be       much better spent working to improve veterans health care and       protecting veterans privacy    Just as we must not let the       terrorists succeed in forcing us to compromise the rights and       freedom and the human rights ideals that are central tenets of       our American heritage  we must not let a few hooligans hoodwink       us into defiling our Constitution   I am proud of the veterans who are       with us today and of the veterans who have stepped up before to       defend our Constitution  At one of our earlier hearings on this       amendment  Senator Bob Kerrey said  Real patriotism cannot be       coerced  It must be a voluntary  unselfish  brave act to       sacrifice for others   And former Secretary of State and       former General Colin Powell earlier wrote this to me about his       reasons for opposing this amendment  I would not amend that       great shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants  The flag       will still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away
