       Senate Passes Leahy Backed Measure to Strengthen Court Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Senate Passes Leahy Backed Measure To Strengthen Court Security   Bill Would Help      Protect Judges      Their Families Against Increased Threats Of Violence WASHINGTON       Thursday  Dec  7     The Senate      late Wednesday evening unanimously passed the Court Security      Improvement Act of 2006  The bipartisan bill would strengthen      protections for judges and their families    A version of the bill was first      introduced in the Senate in 2005 by Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt        and Arlen Specter  R Pa   the leading members of the Judiciary      Committee  The pair teamed up to bolster security in courts around      the country in the wake of increasingly violent threats against      judges and their families  including the tragic murder of the family      of Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago  Since then  Leahy and Specter      have worked with Senate Democratic Leaders Harry Reid  D Nev   and      Richard Durbin  D Ill   to get the bill passed  and were successful      in June when key provisions were included in the Department of      Defense Authorization bill  The Senate on Wednesday again backed the      measure in the form of the companion House bill  H R  1751     Threatening or intimidating our      judges cannot be tolerated in this country  The rise in threats      against our judges puts the men and women who serve in our justice      system at risk and is a repugnant assault on our independent      judiciary  said Leahy  who is set to become Chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee in the new 110th Congress  We owe      it to our judges to better protect them and their families from      violence and to ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary to      do their vital and difficult jobs   The bill  which also contains      important provisions extending life insurance benefits to      bankruptcy  magistrate and territorial judges  moves to the House      for its consideration  Below is Senator Leahys statement on the      passage of the bill followed by a section by section of the measure                     Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee  On The Passage Of H R  1751  The Court Security      Improvement Act Of 2006     December 6  2006  It has been a difficult struggle to      pass a measure to improve court security  It should not have been       This bill should have been enacted months ago with bipartisan      support  I want to thank the Democratic Leader  Senator Reid  the      Senate Judiciary Chairman  Senator Specter  and the Assistant      Democratic Leader  Senator Durbin  for their leadership and hard      work in finally passing the Court Security Improvement Act of 2006       to increase protections for the dedicated women and men throughout      the Judiciary in this country    I hope that House of Representatives      will take up and pass this measure  By so doing they can bring to      fruition before the end of this Congress our efforts to provide      increased security  an effort that gained new urgency after the      tragedy that befell Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago  She is the      federal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in their home       As we heard in her courageous testimony in May 2005 before the      Judiciary Committee  this tragedy provided a terrible reminder not      only of the vulnerable position of our judges and their families       but of the critical importance of protecting judges both where they      work and where they and their families live  The shooting last      summer of a State judge in Nevada provided another terrible reminder      of the vulnerable position of our Nations state and federal      judges  We cannot tolerate or excuse or justify violence or the      threat of violence against judges   It is most unfortunate that some in      this country have chosen to use dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric      when talking about judges  comparing judges to terrorists and      threatening judges with punishment for decisions they do not like       This rhetoric can only foster unacceptable violence against judges      and it must stop  for the sake of our judges and the independence of      the judiciary  Judicial fairness and independence are essential if      we are to maintain our freedoms  Let no one say things that might      bring about further threats against our judges  We ought to be      protecting them physically and institutionally  Easy rhetorical pot      shots put judges in real danger   The bill that passes today is a      consensus bipartisan bill  I hope it is a model for what we can      achieve with bipartisan cooperation in the 110th      Congress  Its core provisions  which previously passed the Senate      in June as part of the managers package of the John Warner      National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2007  S  2766       come from S 1968  the streamlined Court Security Improvement Act of      2005  CSIA   which Chairman Specter and I introduced last      November    The bill responds to requests by the      federal judiciary for a greater voice in working with the United      States Marshals Service to determine their security needs  It      enacts new criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal      information to harm or threaten to harm federal judges  their      families or other individuals performing official duties  It enacts      criminal penalties for threatening federal judges and federal law      enforcement officials by the malicious filing of false liens  and      provides increased protections for witnesses  The bill also      contains provisions making available to states new resources to      improve security for state and local court systems as well as      providing additional protections for law enforcement officers  In      particular  I want to thank Chairman Specter for agreeing to include      in the bill an extension of life insurance benefits to bankruptcy       magistrate and territorial judges    Finally  the bill contains provisions      that have passed the Senate several times extending and expanding to      family members the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact      certain information from a federal judges mandatory financial      disclosure  This expired redaction authority was used in      circumstances in which the release of the information could endanger      the filer or the filers family  I hope that the House of      Representatives finally takes up and passes this much needed      extension and expansion of redaction authority    We owe it to our judges to better      protect them and their families from violence and to ensure that      they have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital and      difficult jobs                     Section by Section      of Court Security Improvement Act of 2006  Title I  Judicial      Security Improvements and Funding  Section 101  Directs the Director
