       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  National Guard Equipment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy     National Guard Equipment     August 3  2006 Mr  President  I      will take this opportunity to discuss an amendment that Senator Bond      and I introduced yesterday to guarantee that  2 4 billion of the  13      billion included in the package of the managers on Tuesday for the      Army and Marine Corps be allocated for National Guard equipment       This amendment will ensure that promises made to the Guard about      funding will be fulfilled  and  more importantly  it provides a      needed infusion of equipment to the National Guard   The amendment      follows an amendment that Senator Bond and I introduced last      September to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations  At that      time  our Nation was in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane      Katrina  That terrible storm demonstrated the significant      shortfalls in equipment available to the Guard at home for use in      such natural disasters or other domestic emergencies  If another      storm of the magnitude of Katrina had hit the country in the weeks      and months that followed  the Guard would not have had enough      trucks  tractors and communications gear across the country to      adequately respond  The problem then       and still the problem today  is that much of the National Guards      equipment has been left in Iraq  where the National Guard has been      indispensable  Since the start of the war in Iraq  Guard units have      deployed with their gear and then  after a year  they have left this      gear for use by other units arriving in Iraq  Worse still  the      National Guard has consistently been under funded  leaving it with      well less than the required equipment stocks  These low levels of      equipment threaten the Guards ability to carry out the two critical      prongs of its dual mission   Two days ago  the      top National Guard General  Lt  Gen  Steven Blum  reported that more      than two thirds of the Army National Guard s 34 brigades are not      combat ready  due largely to vast equipment shortfalls  Almost a year after      Katrina  the Department of Defense leadership  which is ultimately      responsible for monitoring the Guards capabilities  has yet to      recognize this clear problem  let alone to develop a real funding      plan to deal with the problem   The  900 million      included in last years Defense Appropriations Bill was only the      beginning of addressing this major problem with shortfalls  a      problem that General Blum himself estimates to total nearly  21      billion  Congress has no      choice but to act  That is why this amendment takes another step      toward addressing the Guards response capabilities at home  It      adds  2 4 billion on top of the funding in the regular bill and      bridge supplemental for the Guard to procure equipment  for items      as diverse as remanufactured tanks  radios  medium sized trucks  and      command and control systems   I would like to      commend Senator Stevens and Senator Inouye  who were able to      identify almost  340 million in National Guard and Reserve Equipment      in the Committee markup of the baseline defense bill  That number      shows the enormous support that exists within the Defense      Subcommittee  especially when the Senate defense allocation was  9      billion below that set in the House of Representatives  On behalf of our      Guard units  our Guard members  and of all Americans who so acutely      rely on their steadfast readiness and service  I urge my colleagues      to vote now for a much needed  higher level for the Guard    This problem is so      pressing and so severe that we cannot afford to lose momentum  Thank you
