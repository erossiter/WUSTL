       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On DHS Announcement Of Draft Plan For New  WHTI Border Crossing Requirements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT                     Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt      On DHS Announcement Of Draft Plan For New WHTI    Border Crossing Requirements    Wednesday  June 20  2007   Today      Wednesday   the U S  Departments of Homeland Security  DHS  and     State announced draft plans for moving forward with implementation     of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI   Their action     comes as momentum is building in both the Senate and the House to     move the next WHTI implementation date forward 17 months  Beginning     Jan 31  2008  DHS plans to begin initial elements of WHTI     implementation at land and sea ports of entry by ending the routine     practice of accepting oral declarations alone  At that point  U S      and Canadian citizens will need to present either a WHTI compliant     document or a government issued photo ID  such as a drivers     license  plus proof of citizenship  such as a birth certificate      The Secretary of Homeland Security  in consultation with the     Secretary of State  will then set a date to implement the full     requirements of the land and sea phase of WHTI  DHS and State     expect the date of full WHTI implementation to be during the summer     of 2008  Leahy is the chief sponsor of the Leahy Stevens Amendment     to delay implementation  passed last week by the Senate     Appropriations Committee  during markup of the annual DHS funding     bill  The House passed a similar amendment a day later  Leahys     comments on the draft plan follow     WHTI in the hands of DHS is like a     skydiver who jumps first and tries to pack his parachute on the way     down  Todays huge passport backlogs  prompted by the launch of     DHSs requirement for air travel passports  are just a taste of the     chaos thats likely next summer when they want to start enforcing     passport checks at our land and sea borders  which account for ten     times the volume for air travel    Month after month and hearing after     hearing  DHS and State have high handedly rushed to impose this new     border crossing plan on the American people before they are ready     with the necessary technology  infrastructure and training  and at     every step their rosy assurances have been wrong  Their record on     this is clear  and it has been abysmal  These hollow demands to     just trust us dont cut it anymore from the agency that defined     competence down after Katrina   There is another train wreck on the     horizon if they continue pushing forward with full implementation of     WHTI before the necessary policies and procedures are in place to     handle the surge in applications  to resolve potential complications     in producing a new and untested passport card  and to prepare for     the lengthy border delays that are in the offing     Frustrated Americans by the thousands     have been calling congressional offices for emergency help during     the current passport backlog mess  and we have been doing what we     can  passport by passport  The State Department and DHS vastly     underestimated the passport demand for WHTIs air component  which     is a small percentage of all cross border traffic  and I remain     concerned that their continued public insistence of full     implementation of the land and sea travel provisions in January 2008     is unrealistic and unachievable on that timetable  Let us not set     the American people up yet again for failure and frustration       Since DHS keeps saying that the WHTI     is a congressionally mandated program  they should stop opposing     the bicameral and bipartisan legislation now moving through Congress     to shift the new passport requirement to June 2009  They have been     warned repeatedly  yet even the fresh embarrassment of this passport     debacle hasnt knocked sense into them  Unfortunately  this     impracticable timetable announcement today shows that DHS and State     are not committed to making fundamental reforms to the program     before they unleash it on the public  By maintaining the fiction     that they will be ready to implement the largest phase of this     program next January  they are recklessly risking the travel plans     of millions of Americans and the economies of scores of states and     communities
