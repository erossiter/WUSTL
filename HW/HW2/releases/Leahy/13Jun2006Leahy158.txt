       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Continuing Need For Section 203   Of The Voting Rights Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick J  Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Continuing Need For Section 203 Of The Voting Rights Act      June 13  2006  Today  we continue  and I hope       conclude  our hearings on the reauthorization of the Voting       Rights Act  I am glad that the Committee has finally resumed       these hearings after weeks of delay and several postponements        I look forward to working with the Chairman to complete our       Committees work on this historic bipartisan legislation by the       end of the month  This hearing will focus on the critical       continuing need for Section 203  one of the Acts critical       language assistance provisions to ensure that our language       minorities are protected and can participate fully in the       democratic process of elections    In the last few weeks  the       Republican led Senate devoted significant time to debating a       constitutional amendment that even its supporters knew had no       hope of passage  It failed not only to attract the necessary 67       votes but failed even to garner 50 votes  Instead       of writing discrimination into the Constitution  we should be       enforcing the Constitutions guarantees against       discrimination    The Voting Rights Act implements       the guarantee to full participation for racial and language       minorities  We should complete the work that was begun last       year in the House of Representatives  This work reached an       important milestone at the beginning of May when Senators and       Representatives on both sides of the aisle joined to introduce       our historic bicameral and bipartisan bill reauthorizing the       Voting Rights Act  Thanks to hard work we have built a robust       record in 18 Committee hearings to support reauthorization         As demonstrated in the Senate and       House hearings  the Act remedies discrimination which still       impedes millions of Americans from fully exercising their right       to vote  It is important that we conclude our Senate hearings       and report our bipartisan bill in the next few weeks so that the       Senate can complete action on reauthorization this year  By       reporting our bill in June  it will allow us to work with the       Republican and Democratic leaders on Senate consideration so       that this critical legislation can be reauthorized during the       short legislative session still available this year  There are       less than 12 weeks in session before the scheduled adjournment       of the Senate   There are few things as critical       to our Nation  and to American citizenship  as voting  Like the       rights guaranteed by the First Amendment  the right to vote is       foundational because it secures the effective exercise of all       other rights  As people are able to register  vote  and elect       candidates of their choice  their interests and rights get attention   The very legitimacy of our       democratic Government is dependent on the access all Americans       have to the political process    The enactment of the Voting Rights       Act in 1965 transformed the landscape of political       inclusion  As amended  the Act contains important provisions       for language assistance  Section 203  added as part of the       second reauthorization of the Voting Rights in 1975  broadened       this landscape by allowing millions more American citizens to       participate fully in our democracy  Section 203  which       requires bilingual voting assistance for certain language       minority groups  was enacted to remove obstacles to voting posed       by illiteracy and lack of bilingual language assistance       resulting in large measure from unequal educational       opportunities available to language minorities  These       provisions helped overcome discriminatory barriers which limited       access to the political process for language minority groups and       resulted in low turnout and registration  Along with Section       4 f  4   Section 203 has led to extraordinary gains in       representation and participation made by Asian Americans and       Hispanic Americans    Hispanic American populations have       been one of the primary minority language groups to benefit from       the protections of the bilingual provisions of the Voting Rights       Act  For example  effective implementation of the bilingual       provisions in San Diego County  California  helped       increase voter registration by more than 20 percent  And voter       turnout among Hispanic Americans in New Mexico rose 26 percent       between 2000 and 2004 after television and radio spots were       aired in districts with Spanish educated listeners about voter       registration and absentee ballots  Yet there is still work to       be done  Historically  Hispanic Americans have low voter       turnout and less than 1 percent of all elected offices in the       United States are held by Hispanic Americans    I was troubled during the       immigration debate that the rhetoric of some Members of the       Senate appeared to be anti Hispanic in supporting the adoption       of an English language amendment  Senator Salazar and I wrote       to the President following up on this provision  We asked       whether the President will continue to implement the language       outreach policies of President Clinton s Executive Order 13166        A prompt and straightforward affirmative answer would have gone       a long way  Sadly  we have received no response from this White       House    I understand why this amendment to       the immigration bill provoked a reaction from the Latino       community as exemplified by the May 19 letter from the League of       United Latin American Citizens  the Mexican American Legal       Defense and Educational Fund  the National Association of Latino       Elected Officials Educational Fund  the National Council of La       Raza and the National Puerto Rican Coalition and from a larger       coalition of interested parties from 96 national and local       organizations    Until that vote  in our previous       230 years we had not found it necessary or wise to adopt English       as our official or national language  I believe it was in the      Commonwealth of Pennsylvania that the state       legislature shortly       after the Revolutionary War authorized official publication of       Pennsylvanias laws in German as well as English to serve the       German speaking population of that state  We have       been a confident nation unafraid to hear expressions in a       variety of languages and willing to reach out to all within our       borders  That tradition is reflected in Section 203 and in       President Clintons Executive Order 13166    We demean our history and our       welcoming tradition when we disparage languages other than       English and those who speak them  I have spoken about our       including Latin phrases on our official seal and the many States       that include mottos and phrases in Latin  French and Spanish on       their State flags  We need not fear other languages  We would       do better to do more to encourage and assist those who wish to       be citizens to learn English  but we should recognize English        as Senator Salazars amendment suggested  as our common and       unifying language    I hope that the President will       join with us to protect language minority voters  As a       presidential candidate  then Governor Bush told a       New Hampshire audience in September 1999  English only would       mean to people me  not you  As the  Washington Times       noted last week     Mr  Bush speaks some Spanish and       occasionally peppers speeches and conversations with words and       phrases from the language  Speaking to a group of adults taking       civics lesions yesterday at the Catholic       Charities operated Juan Diego Center  he lapsed into Spanish        Asked whether Mr  Bush planned to drop Spanish from his stump       speeches  a White House spokeswoman said she does not expect       that to happen    We have been engaged in       a contentious debate about immigrants who are not yet citizens        but the issue we are talking about today       affects people who are American citizens  These provisions       provide assistance to American Indians  who speak languages       which preceded the first English speakers on this continent        These are citizens who are trying to vote but many of them are       struggling with the English language due to disparities in       education and the incremental process of learning  It is       imperative that all citizens be able to exercise their rights as       citizens  particularly a right as fundamental as the right to       vote  Renewing the language provisions of the Voting       Rights Act that are expiring and continue to be needed  will       help make that a reality   Over the course of the hearings        we have heard from outstanding panels of witnesses  I want to       thank the distinguished witnesses we will hear from today        Deborah Wright is the Acting Assistant Registrar Recorder for      Los Angeles County  California  She will testify       about the administration of Los Angeles Countys comprehensive       program that provides much needed assistance to limited English       proficient  LEP  voters throughout Los Angeles County        California  Los Angeles County is the largest and most diverse       local election jurisdiction in the United States  providing       assistance in more languages than any other county     Margaret Fung is the       executive director of the Asian American Legal Defense and       Education Fund  AALDEF   Since 1988  AALDEF has monitored       elections and conducted multilingual exit polls to       document barriers to voting faced by Asian Americans          John Trasvi  a is an       old friend to many of us on the Committee and now serves as the       interim President and General Counsel of the Mexican American       Legal Defense and Educational Fund  MALDEF   MALDEF and the       National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials  NALEO        have prepared a report for inclusion in the record that       documents the inadequate availability in Section 203       jurisdictions of English as a Second Language educational       services required to become fully proficient in English as an       adult  These witnesses will testify about the ongoing need for       language assistance in voting so that all American citizens can       participate fully in our democracy    I welcome all the       witnesses here today  I hope that we conclude these hearings       and report our bill without delay so that we can complete the       important work of reauthorizing this historic bipartisan        bicameral legislation
