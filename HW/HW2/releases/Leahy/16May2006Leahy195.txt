       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Continuing Need For   Section Five Pre Clearance                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On The Continuing Need For Section Five Pre Clearance      May 16  2006  This morning we are convening our       fourth hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the Voting       Rights Act  These are important hearings and I thank the       Chairman for continuing to move forward during this busy time        I trust we will keep to our plan of concluding hearings this       week and reporting our bill before we break for the Memorial Day       recess at the end of the month  The House Judiciary Committee       reported the bill last week by a vote of 33 to one  If we are       to fulfill our commitment to reauthorizing this important       measure this year we need to stay on schedule and push forward       to make progress    Todays hearing is focused on the       continuing need for the provision of the Voting Rights Act that       requires covered jurisdictions to pre clear changes to voting       before they go into effect  This provision has been a       tremendous source of protection for the voting rights of those       long discriminated against and also a great deterrent against       discriminatory efforts cropping up anew  Our country is       changing  thanks in no small part to the Voting Rights Act and       to Section 5s       pre clearance requirements    In the past several hearings  we       have discussed the constitutional standard that we expect the       Supreme Court will apply when reviewing an extension of the       expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act  It is a question       about the power of Congress  and this is  not a gray       area  Under the specific words of the Constitution  Congress       has the power to remedy discrimination under the Fourteenth and       the Fifteenth Amendments  and Congress is at the zenith of its       power when giving enforceable meaning to these Amendments by       enacting laws that address racial discrimination in connection       with voting  The Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments have not       changed  As long as these Amendments are in the Constitution        Congress has the authority to enforce them  especially on       matters of racial discrimination in connection with the right to       vote    I believe the Supreme Court will       again uphold congressional authority in this regard  We would       all agree that Justice Sandra Day OConnor was a vigorous       defender of states rights  And as recently as 1999    over       three decades after the initial passage of the Voting Rights Act          Justice OConnor considered the continuing constitutionality       of Section 5 in her      Lopez v  Monterey County decision  and explicitly affirmed its       constitutionality in accordance with the Fifteenth Amendment        Justice Antonin Scalia is also a vocal defender of states       rights  He has not only agreed that federal measures designed       to stop racial discrimination are permitted  but also argued in       his Tennessee v  Lane       dissent that Congress should be subjected to lesser       constitutional scrutiny on anti discrimination laws that deal       specifically with racial discrimination  This is entirely       consistent with the widely held belief that Congress is at the       zenith of its lawmaking power when it is addressing our nations       historic struggle with racial discrimination    A few witnesses have mentioned the      City of        Boerne decision  which       invalidated an act of Congress aimed at stopping religious       discrimination because that law was not tied closely enough to       the problem it was intended to solve  Yet  in the  City of Boerne decision  the Supreme Court went out of its way to       recognize that the Voting Rights Act is an example of a law       where Congress acted with authority and got it right  In his       opinion in that case  Justice Anthony Kennedy declared that       anti discrimination laws such as the Voting Rights Act do not       require termination dates or geographic tailoring in order to       survive judicial review  Nonetheless our bill includes those       limitations and shows  in Justice Kennedys own words  aspects       that tend to ensure that Congresss means are proportionate        Similarly  in the Morrison       case  which struck down the Violence Against Women Act  the       Supreme Court again pointed to the Voting Rights Act as an       example of Congress acting appropriately under its       constitutional authority  In fact  since upholding the law in       1966  whenever the Supreme Court has reviewed or even cited to       the Voting Rights Act  it has affirmed it as a valid exercise of       congressional authority   Some academic witnesses have       suggested that Section  5 should be a victim of its       success  In my view abandoning a successful deterrent just       because it works defies logic and common sense  Why risk losing       the gains we have made  When this Committee finds an effective       and constitutional way to prevent violations of the law  we       should preserve it    I welcome the witnesses who have       traveled to be with us here today   Ted Arrington was elected as a       Republican to the Mecklenburg County Board of Elections  which       he chaired from 1985 to 1991  He currently serves as Chairman       of the Department of Political Science at the University of       North Carolina at Charlotte  where he specializes in elections       and voting systems and behavior  Anita Earls is currently a       professor at Duke University  specializing in civil rights       litigation topics for the African and African American Studies       Department  She co authored the Voting Rights State Reports for       Virginia and North Carolina  Pam Karlan is a Public Interest       Law Professor and the Associate Dean for Research and Academics       at Stanford University  as well as a Supreme Court       practitioner  I look forward to receiving their testimony
