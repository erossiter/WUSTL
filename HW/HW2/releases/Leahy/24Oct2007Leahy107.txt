       Leahy Calls On Senate To Consider Media Shield Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Calls On      Senate To Consider Media Shield Legislation         Two      Reporters Privilege Bills Await Senate Action              WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Oct  24   Senate Judiciary      Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   is pressing for prompt      Senate action on bipartisan legislation to establish a federal      qualified reporters privilege  The Senate Judiciary Committee on      Oct  4 passed The Free Flow of Information Act  which would protect      the exchange of information between journalists and confidential      sources  and the bill now awaits floor action                The House of Representatives passed similar legislation Oct  16  At      Leahys request  the House bill has been placed directly on the      Senate calendar to expedite its consideration by the full Senate       alongside the bill approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee       Dozens of media organizations across the country support the      Senates legislation  including the Vermont Press Association  the      New England Press Association  the Associated Press  the American      Society of Newspaper Editors  The New York Times Company  and The      Washington Post               The Senate now has two pending legislative efforts to enact a      shield law for reporters  said Leahy  The Senate should      immediately consider these bipartisan  consensus bills to protect      the journalists who work diligently to support and preserve the      publics right to know           The media shield legislation would            Establish a federal qualified       reporters privilege to protect and encourage the free flow of       information between journalists and sources     Reconcile a reporters need to       maintain confidentiality    in order to ensure that sources will       speak openly and freely    with the publics right to effective       law enforcement and fair trials     Balance the public interest in       combating crime and protecting national security and the public       interest in ensuring a free and vibrant press by providing that       a federal court can only force a journalist to reveal       confidential source information when the information is truly       essential or crucial to a case or investigation     Provide exceptions to the       privilege for those situations where information sharing is       critical                 Leahy Tuesday night encouraged the Senate to promptly consider      either of the media shield bills  His statement follows       Statement Of      Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy   On Senate      Consideration Of Legislation   To Establish A      Federal Statutory First Amendment Privilege   October 23  2007              The Senate Judiciary Committee has considered and for the first time      reported a bill to establish a federal statutory privilege to      safeguard the freedom of the press  The      Free Flow of Information Act  S  2035  is bipartisan      legislation that was reported on a strong bipartisan vote  The House      has already passed legislation on this same subject  H R  2102  with      a strong  bipartisan and apparently veto proof majority of 398 to      21  Thus  both S 2035 and H R  2102 are available for Senate action      on the Senate Business Calendar  I strongly support the enactment      of a federal shield law for journalists  and I urge the Senate to      promptly consider federal shield legislation               All of us have an interest in enacting a balanced and meaningful      first amendment privilege  Sadly  the press has become the first      stop  rather than the last resort  for our government and private      litigants when it comes to seeking information  This is a dangerous      trend that can have a chilling effect on the press and the publics      right to know               Enacting federal shield legislation would help to reverse this      troubling trend  In fact  proceeding promptly to consideration of      this legislation is something I strongly support  Should the Senate      take up the bipartisan shield bill that overwhelmingly passed in the      House  federal shield legislation could go immediately to the      President s desk and be signed into law without delay this year               The Senate bill has the support of a bipartisan coalition of      Senators  including Senators Specter  Schumer  Lugar  Dodd  Graham      and myself  who have all united to cosponsor this legislation  In      addition  more than 50 news media and journalism organizations      support this legislation and the call for Senate action on this      historic bill extends to editorial pages across the country       including The New York Times       Arizona Republic  L  A  Times  Salt Lake Tribune  and      San Francisco Chronicle  among others                The Senate and House bills protect law enforcement interests and      safeguard national security  Moreover  both of these bills follow      the lead of 33 States and the District of Columbia which have shield      laws  and many other States  including Vermont  which recognize a      common law reporters privilege  Tellingly  the Bush Administration      has not identified a single circumstance where a reporters      privilege has caused harm to national security or to law      enforcement  despite the fact that many courts have recognized such      a privilege for years               When he testified before the Judiciary Committee in favor of federal      shield legislation in 2005  William Safire told the Committee that      the essence of newsgathering is this   I f you dont have sources      you trust and who trust you  then you dont have a solid story  and      the public suffers for it  On behalf of the American public  I      urge the Senate to protect the publics right to know by promptly      considering and passing a federal shield law
