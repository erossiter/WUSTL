       Closing Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Senate Debate Of Flag   Desecration Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                    Closing Statement Of Sen         Patrick Leahy       On Senate Debate Of Flag Desecration Amendment       June 27  2006   As we close this debate and        move on to a vote on this proposal  I commend to all        Senators the words of the senior Senator from Hawaii  a war        hero and veteran  a patriot  an American of the first        order  He was long denied the Congressional Medal of Honor        that he earned long ago and paid for dearly  He knows why        he fought and sacrificed  No one on this Floor has fought        harder for this country  for its flag  for our freedoms or        for our veterans and their families  He has shown        characteristic leadership and courage in his statement today        against doing damage to our Constitution through this        proposed amendment  I am honored to stand with him in this        fight to preserve our Bill of Rights    The action by the Republican        leadership on this amendment reminds me of the action they        forced in connection with the Terri Schiavo case  Then the        President hurried back from a vacation with great fanfare to        sign a bill rushed through the Republican led Congress to        intrude into a family and personal tragedy  The politicians        overreached and the American people saw through it  Here         too  this election year exercise will be seen for what it        is    This is the second        constitutional amendment that the Senate has considered this        month in the Republican run up to the November election         Of course  among the amendments the Republican majority has        chosen not to consider is the one promised by the        2000 Republican Party Platform  to require a balanced        budget  Even Republican partisans must be embarrassed at        the deficits that the Bush Cheney Administration and the        Republican Congress have generated as they turned an        historic budget surplus into an historic deficit     This proposed amendment        regarding flag desecration is another in a series of        amendments Republicans have pressed that would result in        restricting the rights of the American people  It is one of        more than 60 constitutional amendments introduced so far in        this Congress alone  and more than 11 000 since the First        Congress convened in 1789  Can you imagine what the        Constitution would look like if even a small fraction of        these amendments had been adopted  The Constitution that we        now revere as fundamental law  that provides us with unity        and stability in times of trouble  would be like the old        French Constitution    filed under p for periodicals         We honor our Senate oath when we support and defend the        Constitution  That is what I will be doing by voting today        to uphold the Constitution and by voting against amending        it     I am encouraged by the        Senates bipartisan rejection of action on S J  Res 1  the        proposal to federalize marriage by way of a constitutional        amendment  Forty eight Senators voted against cloture  and        I believe that others who voted in favor of more debate were        nonetheless troubled by the proposal  The failure of the        Republican leadership to obtain even a simple majority of        Senators to support their efforts  on a procedural vote         should indicate to them how unwise it is to abuse the        Constitution in a partisan election year tactic     Like the marriage amendment         the flag amendment would artificially create division among        the American people  The timing of this consideration  four        months before the mid term election  raises concerns  again         that the Constitution is being misused for partisan        purposes  That is wrong   We act here in the Senate as        stewards of the Constitution  guardians and trustees of a        precious legacy  The truly precious part of that legacy        does not lie in outward things  in monuments or statues or        flags  All that these tangible things can do is remind us        of what is truly precious  our liberty    This proposed amendment would        be the first amendment to the Constitution that would narrow        the precious freedoms enjoyed by Americans under the Bill of        Rights  The infringement would fall on the First Amendment         the cornerstone and foundation of all of our rights  of        which we must be especially protective  The First Amendment        has stood up in times of war  during times of bitter        protest  It has been one of the rocks on which our national        unity and our national stability are built   The proposed amendment is a        wrong headed response to a crisis that does not exist  It        would be an unprecedented limitation on the freedom        Americans enjoy under the Bill or Rights and would do        nothing to bolster respect for the flag  Respect for the        flag flows from the freedoms we enjoy and from the        sacrifices of those who have protected that freedom  Our        cherished flag is the symbol of our Nation and of the        Constitution that is the foundational keystone of our        Republic  and of our freedom  This is about defending the        Constitution  my friends  for which our flag stands  Each        generation of Americans owes the next generations the effort        and the dedication it takes to pass along the torch of        freedom  undiminished  We owe it to them  and to those who        have sacrificed so much for us  to cherish and to protect        freedom  and the Constitution which is the written promise        of that freedom    Rather than face the solemn        responsibility of justifying an amendment to the        Constitution  proponents of S J  Res 12 have urged that we        just pass it on to the States and let them decide  They        said that Senators should abdicate their responsibility to        exercise their best judgment and simply pass the buck  I        could hardly believe my ears   Have we utterly forgotten the        words of James Madison and the conservative conception of        amendment the Founders built into our Constitution  The        Constitution intentionally makes it difficult to pass        amendments to our fundamental law  No amendment can pass        unless every level of government  from the House to the        Senate to the States  overwhelmingly supports it  Our        system is undermined if each institution of government does        not exercise independent judgment  if we do not fulfill our        constitutional responsibility   This is the fifth time that        this body has considered a constitutional amendment to        punish flag burners  Some of us have voted on the proposal        before  others have not  But either way  we are undertaking        the gravest of responsibilities  We are taking in our hands        the inalienable rights of Americans  today and the        generations that follow long after we have gone  We are        handling the most precious heirloom that we have  the finest        thing that we can hope to pass on to our children and        grandchildren  I would hope that at this of all times we        would give the Constitution the respect that it deserves and        support and defend it   This week we returned to use        what little time left to the Senate this year to revisit a        debate on that has wisely been rejected in this chamber four        times in the last 17 years  a proposed amendment that would        roll back our First Amendment freedoms for the first time in        our nations history  While we devote precious floor time        to debate this matter  the nation is gripped by the ongoing        war in Iraq  the continuing threat of terrorism  soaring        energy and health care prices  rising inflation  and a        burgeoning deficit   Indeed  this debate is another        illustration of the Republican leaderships disregard for        the needs of the American people and the institutional        responsibilities of this body   They continue to mistreat our        Constitution as if it were a bulletin board on which to hang        political posters or bumper stickers  The Constitution is        too important to be used for partisan political purposes         and so is the American flag    Cynicism and        Symbolic Patriotism   The timing of        this debate raises the question of why the Republican        leadership has made this issue its top priority in the face        of an unfinished agenda of legislative matters that do        concern Americans day in and day out  The Senate has hardly        made progress on a legislative agenda  We have yet to        consider any of the 13 appropriations bills for the year         We have yet to enact a budget resolution  which was required        by law to be in place on April 15  We have yet to enact a        lobbying reform bill  a comprehensive immigration bill  or        pension protection legislation  We have yet to consider or        pass asbestos litigation reform legislation  patent reform        legislation or the reauthorization of the Voting Rights        Act  We have yet to pass a long overdue raise in minimum        wage  to take action to lower gas prices  health care costs        or health insurance costs  Instead  with less than 10 weeks        left in this session of Congress  the Republican leadership        will work on none of those important matters      The amendment we        consider today would artificially create division among the        American people  and the timing of this debate    squarely        in the middle of an election year  demonstrates  again         that the Constitution is being misused for partisan        purposes  The Constitution deserves our respect  vigilant        protection and in the words or our Senate oath our        support  We have a duty to defend it  The Constitution        is not a blog for venting political opinions  curry favoring        with voters or trying to bump up sagging poll numbers           The flag is an        important symbol of all that makes America great  But the        cynical use of symbolic politics in an election year will        not address the very real needs of veterans and other        Americans that are being left unmet by this Administration        and the Republican Congress    Combat Veterans        Reminder of Flags Meaning    I know that many        veterans support the flag desecration amendment and I        respect their views  We must not forget though that there        also are many veterans who oppose it  I appeared with a        number of distinguished veterans on Flag Day who spoke about        their dedication to the principles that make this country        great and for which they fought and sacrificed  Those        principles include our precious freedoms under the First        Amendment  These veterans of World War II  Korea  Vietnam         the First Gulf War and Iraq made clear that they fought for        what the flag stands for  not just the symbol itself           Former Senator        John Glenn  a combat veteran  wrote  The flag is the        Nations most powerful and emotional symbol  It is our most        sacred symbol  And it is our most revered symbol  But it        is a symbol  It symbolizes the freedoms that we have in        this country  but it is not the freedoms themselves           The late John        Chafee  a distinguished member of this body and a highly        decorated veteran of World War II and Korea  opposed this        amendment because  he said  We cannot mandate respect and        pride in the flag  In fact  taking steps to require        citizens to respect the flag  sullies its symbolism and        significance    A Change That        Limits Rights   Flag desecration        is a despicable and reprehensible act  We agree with that           all of us agree that it is contemptible  That is not the        issue  instead  the issue before us is whether we should        amend the Constitution of the United States with all the        risks that entails and whether  for the first time in our        history  we should narrow the precious freedoms ensured by        the First Amendment  Should we amend the First Amendment so        that the government can prosecute the handful of individuals        who show contempt for the flag  those General Powell called        miscreants  Such a monumental step is unwarranted and        unwise     We are being        tested  This generation of Americans is being tested by the        threat of international terrorism  America wins when it        meets that challenge without allowing those who threaten us        to compromise us  We suffer losses not only when we suffer        attacks as we did toward the end of President Bushs first        year in office  but also when we those freedoms that define        us as Americans  For the Congress to surrender our        fundamental rights as Americans as proposed in the        constitutional amendment is wrong     Patriotism Does        Not Come By Decree   Following the        very real attacks on 9 11  Americans embraced the flag like        never before  proudly displaying flags and flag symbols as a        sign of unity and strength in the wake of those horrible        acts against our nation  People around the world grieved        for us  cared for us  and joined with us to fight        terrorism  Over time  missteps and arrogance by the        Bush Cheney Administration have alienated much of the        world  Still  Americans of all political persuasions have        not needed a law to tell them how precious our freedoms are        or how to honor the Stars and Stripes     Supporters of        this constitutional amendment seem to believe that Americans        need rules about respecting the flag punishable by law   I        strongly disagree and the American people have already        proven them wrong  The American people do not need a lesson        in cherishing and honoring our flag and the Republic for        which it stands  That may be necessary in Saddam Husseins        Iraq or in Stalins Soviet Union or in Castros Cuba  but        not in America     In fact  respect cannot be        coerced or compelled  It can only be given voluntarily  We        respect and love our country  but not because we are told        to  Americans do not love our country because we would be        punished if we did not   Some may find it more comfortable        to silence dissenting voices  but coerced silence creates        resentment  disrespect  and disunity  I proudly fly the        flag at my farm in Vermont because  as an American  it is        what I choose to do    In every hamlet        and city and on every rural route in America  you can see        our flag being flown with pride  Americans in overwhelming        numbers are honoring our flag  not defacing it    Of course  there        are times when individuals deface the flag or violate the        rules for its care  For example  President Bush was        captured on film signing a hand held flag at a campaign        rally in the summer of 2004  Appropriate or not  these acts        are protected by our Constitution  They do not need to be        punished by Congress after we pass a constitutional        amendment restricting the First Amendment rights of all        Americans    The Freedom For        Which It Stands  In all of the hearings  all of        the debate that we have devoted to this topic over the past        17 years  not one single person has testified that he        respects the flag less because a protestor burned it  wrote        on it  sewed it in the seat of his pants  or otherwise        misused it  Not one    Not one single person has        testified that they love our country less because Americans        are free to express themselves in this way  Not one  There        is not a single indication that any act of flag burning has        lessened the respect that any American has for the flag or        for our country  It would be pathetic if our love of        country or respect for its fundamental principles was so        weak that it could be diminished by such an act  We know        that it is not   The truth is just the        opposite  Occasional insults to the flag do nothing to        diminish our respect for it  Rather  they remind us of our        love for the flag  for our country  and for our freedom to        speak  think and worship as we please    Our flag is a        cherished symbol  As are the freedoms for which it stands         including the freedom to express unpopular speech or ideas           even extremely unpopular ideas     Veterans        Priorities Ignored   As I have said        many times throughout this debate  I wish the Senate would         instead  use its time to discuss and solve the real problems        that real Americans are facing right now  instead of trying        to stir public passions for political ends      I respectfully        suggest that in the less than 10 weeks left to us in session        this year  the Senates resources would be better spent        working to improve veterans health care services         survivors benefits and protecting veterans and Americans        privacy  There are so many issues that we could turn to        that would help improve the lives of our veterans and their        families  Why not focus on them    Just today on        the front page of the newspaper  we learned        that this Governments bureaucratic bungling has resulted in        widows of those who have served this nation and sacrificed        for all of us are being denied the survivors benefits to        which they should be entitled  This news follows closely        public reports that post traumatic stress disorders among        our veterans are on the rise    Instead of seeking to turn        the flag into a partisan political weapon and the        Constitution into a billboard for political slogans  for        partisan gain  we could be spending time debating these real        issues or much needed funding for services to our veterans         This Presidents budget requests have consistently fallen        short of the levels needed to provide necessary services and        care  President Bushs budgets force our veterans to        subsidize their government health care and simply do not        account for the increase in demand for VA services due to        the Iraq war     We could also be        taking real action to prevent the kind of data losses that        just affected millions of our veterans  We just witnessed        the largest theft of private information from the Government        ever  the loss of information on more than 26 5 million        American veterans  including more than 2 million who are in        active service  nearly 80 percent of our active duty force        and a large percentage of our National Guard and the        Reserve     Last year         Senator Specter and I introduced the Personal Data Privacy        and Security Act  which requires federal agencies and        private data brokers to give prompt notice when sensitive        personal information has been breached or stolen  The        Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved this bill last        fall  but almost a year later  the Senate has still not        acted on this legislation Had this bill been in enacted  it        would have required the VA to promptly notify the millions        of veterans now at risk of identity theft about the theft of        their personal data  Our bill also addresses the        Governments use of personal data by putting privacy and        security front and center in evaluating whether data brokers        can be trusted with Government contracts that involve        sensitive information about the American people    The nations        veterans  who have been willing to make the ultimate        sacrifice for their country  deserve to have the best tools        available to protect themselves and their families from        identity theft  The Senate should be acting to consider and        pass comprehensive data privacy and security legislation           Conclusion  Sadly  the list of what we are        not accomplishing goes on and on  The way things are going         under Republican leadership  this session will make the do        nothing Congress against which President Harry Truman ran        seem like a legislative juggernaut   The days we have spent on this        amendment could be spent more productively on any of the        matters I have mentioned  There are less than 10 weeks        remaining in the Senates scheduled work year  It seems        that even with all that remains undone  at this point in        this election year  floor time is available only for matters        that advance the Republicans narrow political agenda   Republicans have the Senate        majority  they control the schedule  they set the        priorities  In my view  it reflects a strange set of        priorities to think our national interest is best served at        this time by debating a constitutional amendment to roll        back the Bill of Rights for the first time in our history           I treat proposals to amend the        Constitution with utmost seriousness  for it is a serious        responsibility  I began this debate by noting my home state        of Vermonts tradition of independence and commitment to the        Bill of Rights   Vermont did not and would not        become a State until 1791  the year the Bill of Rights was        ratified  At one time  we declared ourselves        an independent republic    I plan to        proudly uphold that tradition today by voting against this        amendment  and I hope  although likely in vain  that  the Senate will move on to more pressing matters that        directly affect the lives and livelihoods of the American        people
