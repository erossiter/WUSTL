       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Asbestos Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       Hearing On Asbestos Legislation      June 7  2006  By calling this hearing  Chairman       Specter has once again demonstrated his commitment to making       constructive changes to the current broken system of asbestos       litigation  Today we renew our discussion about legislation       that will provide fair and quick compensation to asbestos       victims and their families  Unfortunately  this bill fell last       February on a procedural maneuver without getting the       consideration it deserved  I hope this time around we can put       this bill to a vote on its merits  because millions of Americans       who suffer or have suffered from asbestos disease need our       help  I thank the       Chairman for this hearing  and I thank our distinguished       witnesses for their willingness to discuss such an important       issue with the Committee    I want to mention the recent       passing of Judge Edward R  Becker  Judge Becker was a       distinguished Federal jurist and member of the United States       Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit  where he served as Chief       Judge from 1998 to 2003  Without Judge Beckers extraordinary       efforts in helping us to develop this legislation  at the       invitation of Senator Specter    we would not be where we are       today with an asbestos reform bill pending before the Senate        and we would not have a bipartisan bill that balances the       equities as skillfully as this one does  Judge Becker brought       numerous stakeholders to the table  and through his efforts he       helped us accomplish a truly monumental task  We are deeply       indebted to Judge Becker for his selfless work on behalf of so       many Americans affected by asbestos related illness  and on       behalf of the judicial system to which he contributed       significantly  We are grateful for his efforts  and our best       wishes go to his family   Tort reform has been a popular       political issue to some  but too often we find ourselves       considering bills that attempt to force a partisan solution on a       non existent problem  We have recently seen unsuccessful       efforts to cap liability in medical malpractice lawsuits  and we       are likely to deal with proposals to unnecessarily insulate the       makers of food products from accountability as well  But unlike       some of the politically expedient efforts at litigation reform       that we have seen in the past  today we discuss a real problem        which desperately needs to be addressed  The Supreme Court has       declared that the current system of asbestos litigation cries       out for a legislative solution  Chairman Specter and I and       others on this Committee have answered the call  and I hope that       Senators will look at this improved bill long and hard and       carefully compare it to the status quo    Today we discuss an improved       bill  The Chairman and I have been responsive to concerns from       many interested parties  and we have refined the bill to       accommodate many of these concerns  These changes reflect the       bipartisan nature of this process  as well as our desire to do       the right thing for the victims of asbestos exposure  We must       not lose focus of what we want to accomplish  which first and       foremost is the fair compensation for those who have been       injured or killed from exposure to asbestos  While some changes       attempt to further balance the equities among the companies       required to contribute to the Fund  the majority of the       improvements are geared towards improving the system of victim       compensation in the bill    I want to make clear that the       medical criteria in the bill remain unchanged  But additional       safeguards have been put in place to ensure the integrity of the       claims process  For example  the bill now includes a provision       for random audits of both medical and exposure evidence       submitted by claimants  as well as a provision requiring a       detailed and specific affidavit from a claimant attesting to       their exposure  This will prevent fraud in the claims process        thereby ensuring that compensation gets to those who need it         The bill now ensures that veterans       who contracted an asbestos related illness during their service       can claim against the Fund  By providing a special statute of       limitations for veterans who have received government benefits       for their illness  the bill remedies the injustice of veterans       being shut out of the tort system by virtue of their government       employment  I am especially pleased to be able to report this       improvement  as it respects those veterans who have been unable       to get the compensation they deserve simply because they were       injured during their service to our country    Additionally  the improved bill       will preserve more preexisting legal settlements between       plaintiffs and defendants by allowing a plaintiffs       representative or an authorized corporate attorney to sign an       agreement  The new bill allows asbestos victims to claim       against existing bankruptcy trusts during the startup period        which will now withhold some resources for this purpose but will       exclude claims by unimpaired claimants  The new bill also makes       clear that civil rights suits and disability claims are not       preempted by the legislation  All of these changes were       considered with an eye towards creating a bill that will help       those people who suffer disease as the result of asbestos       exposure  and which has a chance of passage in the Senate         At a time when the Senate seems to       be taking up one partisan political issue after another    for       show  and not for real solutions to the real priorities of the       American people  here we have an historic chance to make a       difference in the lives of many Americans who suffer so       tragically  We also have a chance to relieve our Federal and       State judicial systems from the crushing weight of what the       Supreme Court has described as an elephantine mass of       litigation  Let us compensate asbestos victims without delay        and equitably    I want to thank all of our       distinguished witnesses  I look forward to hearing their       insights into the latest changes to this critically important       piece of legislation
