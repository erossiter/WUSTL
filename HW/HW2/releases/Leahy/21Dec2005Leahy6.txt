       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Passage Of The Sununu Leahy Bill To   Extend Provisions Of The USA PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On Passage Of The Sununu Leahy Bill     To Extend Provisions Of The USA PATRIOT Act      December 21  2005   In recent      weeks  Senator Leahy  a co author of the original 2001 USA PATRIOT      Act  joined with Senator John Sununu   R N H   in leading a      bipartisan effort to briefly extend the expiring provisions of the      law to allow Congress to take the necessary time to make      improvements to the reauthorization legislation  Leahy and Sununu      introduced a bill earlier this month calling for a short term      extension of the PATRIOT Act  A bipartisan majority of 52 senators      Wednesday wrote to the Republican leader urging a short term      extension of the law     This is      a victory for bipartisanship  for checks and balances  and for      respecting Americans  civil liberties while protecting their      security  I appreciate the      willingness of the Republican leadership to listen at last to a      bipartisan majority that has acted in good faith and in what we feel      are the best interests of the nation  This is a reasonable step      that will allow the Judiciary Committee time to examine better ways      to strike the right balance  Especially when      security and liberty are in the balance  why not make the extra      effort for a consensus bill that can earn the confidence of the      American people  To ask that question is to answer it    It is      worth the extra effort and a few more months to produce a balanced      PATRIOT Act and a consensus PATRIOT Act  We can do better for      Americans  and this extension gives us the time to do it  There is      no reason why the American people cannot have a better PATRIOT Act       and now we have the opportunity to achieve that
