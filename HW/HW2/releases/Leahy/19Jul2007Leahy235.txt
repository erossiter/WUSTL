       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On The Introduction Of The Protect Our   Children First Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On The Introduction Of The   Protect Our Children First Act     Of 2007    July 19  2007 Mr  LEAHY  I am pleased to introduce the Protect     Our Children First Act of 2007    which will reauthorize funding for the     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC  through     Fiscal Year 2013  and increase Federal support and coordination to help     NCMEC programs to find missing children across the Nation  I am glad     that Senator Hatch has joined me in introducing this bill  along with     Senators Lincoln and Shelby  As members of the Missing and Exploited     Childrens Caucus  we have all worked together on numerous pieces of     legislation to protect the safety and welfare of our children  and I     thank them for their continued leadership and for joining me in     introducing this bill  Just a few months ago  we commemorated the 25th     National Missing Childrens Day  when our Nation particularly remembers     our commitment to work together in locating and recovering missing     children  It pains us all to see on TV  in the newspapers or on milk     cartons photo after photo of missing children from various corners of     our country  As a father and grandfather  I know that an abducted child     is the worst nightmare  Unfortunately  it is a nightmare that happens     all too often  Indeed  the Justice Department estimates that 2 200     children are reported missing each day  There are approximately 114 600     attempted stranger abductions every year  with 3 000 to 5 000 of those     attempts succeeding  Experts estimate that children and youth comprise     between 85 percent and 90 percent of missing person reports  These     families deserve the assistance of the American people and a helping     hand from the Congress and from federal agencies   As the Nation s top resource center for child     protection  the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children     spearheads national efforts to locate and recover missing children and     raises public awareness about ways to prevent child abduction      molestation and sexual exploitation  NCMEC works to make our children     safer by being a national voice and advocate for those too young to vote     or speak up for their own rights  The Center operates under a     Congressional mandate and works in cooperation with the U S  Department     of Justice s  DOJ  Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention     to coordinate the efforts of law enforcement officers  social service     agencies  elected officials  judges  prosecutors  educators  the United     States Marshals Service  and the public and private sectors to break the     cycle of violence that historically has perpetuated these needless     crimes against children  Child advocates like John Walsh  who worked     hard in helping Congress enact the National Centers charter  also     continue to support the Centers vital work   The Center s professionals have disturbingly busy     jobs    they have worked on more than 127 700 cases of missing and     exploited children since its 1984 founding  helping to recover more than     110 200 children  The Center raised its recovery rate from 64 percent     in the 1990s to 96 percent today  The Center has set up a nationwide      toll free  24 hour telephone hotline to take reports about missing     children and clues that might lead to their recovery  a National Child     Pornography Tipline to handle calls from individuals reporting the     sexual exploitation of children through the production and distribution     of pornography  and a CyberTipline to process online leads from     individuals reporting the sexual exploitation of children  It has taken     the lead in circulating millions of photographs of missing children  and     it serves as a vital resource for the 17 000 law enforcement agencies     located throughout the Nation in the search for missing children and in     the pursuit of adequate child protection   The Center has also developed a Cold Case Unit     within the Missing Children Division that focuses on long term missing     children cases  By using age progression technology  NCMEC has     recovered 741 missing children  NCMEC forensic artists have also     identified 24 missing children by using facial reconstructions of     unidentified remains   In order to help the Center solve these long term     cases  Section 5 of this bill would allow an Inspector General to     provide staff support to NCMEC for the purpose of conducting reviews of     inactive case files to develop recommendations for further     investigation  The Inspector General community has one of the most     diverse and talented criminal investigative cadres in the Federal     government  A vast majority of these special agents have come from     traditional law enforcement agencies  and they are highly trained and     extremely capable of dealing with complex criminal cases  Under current law  an Inspector Generals duties     are limited to activities related to the programs and operations of an     agency  Our bill would allow an Inspector General to permit criminal     investigators under his or her supervision to review cold case files  so     long as doing so would not interfere with normal duties  An Inspector     General would not conduct actual investigations  and any Inspector     General would only commit staff when the offices mission related     workloads permitted  At no time would these activities be allowed to     conflict with or delay the stated missions of an Inspector General  The Protect Our Children First Act also gives the     Center better tools for working in coordination with Federal  State  and     local law enforcement agencies to find missing children  This bill     would provide analytical and technical support to assist law enforcement     agencies in searching public databases to identify missing children and     to locate abductors and would facilitate the deployment of the National     Emergency Child Locator Center to assist in locating children in times     of national disasters  In addition  the bill would allow NCMEC to work     in conjunction with the FBI to provide fitness determinations based on     criminal history of volunteers in child serving organizations and track     the incidence of attempted child abductions to report any links or     patterns to law enforcement agencies  NCMEC is headquartered in Alexandria  Virginia  and     operates branch offices in five other locations throughout the country     to provide hands on assistance to families of missing children      advocating legislative changes to better protect children  conducting an     array of prevention and awareness programs  and motivating individuals     to become personally involved in child protection issues  It has also     grown into an international organization  establishing the International     Division of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children      which has been working to fulfill the Hague Convention on the Civil     Aspects of International child Abduction  The International Division     provides assistance to parents  law enforcement  attorneys  nonprofit     organizations  and other concerned individuals who are seeking     assistance in preventing or resolving international child abductions      NCMEC manages to do all of this good work with an     annual DOJ grant  which expires after fiscal year 2008  We must act now     to extend its authorization so that it can continue to help keep     children safe and families intact around the Nation  There is so much     more to be done to ensure the safety of our children  and the     legislation we introduce today will help the Center in its efforts to     prevent crimes that are committed against them   We have before us the type of bipartisan     legislation that should be moved easily through the Senate and the     House  The children we seek to protect through legislation like this     should not be used as pawns by groups who would play politics by     saddling such efforts with controversial measures  I applaud the     ongoing work of the Center and hope both the Senate and the House will     promptly pass this bill to show our support for the NCMEC to continue to     find our missing children and to protect exploited children across the     country   I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill     printed in the Record
