       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Importance Of Consultation On   Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement      Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Importance Of Consultation On Judicial Nominations     June 13  2004      On      Consultation  I spoke on the Senate      floor last week about the benefits to all if the President were to      consult with Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle on      important judicial nominations  I return today to emphasize again      the significance of meaningful consultation on these nominations      because it bears repeating given what is at stake for the Senate       the judiciary and this country    In a few more days      the United States Supreme Court will complete its term  Last year      the Chief Justice noted publicly that at the age of 80  one thinks      about retirement  I get to see the Chief from time to time in      connection with his work for the Judicial Conference and the      Smithsonian Institution  Sometimes we see each other in Vermont or      en route there  and I am struck every time by his commitment  I      marvel at him  I think that his participation at the inauguration      earlier this year sent a powerful positive message to the country       I know that the Chief Justice will retire when he decides that he      should  not before  He has earned that right  I have great respect      and affection for him and he is in our prayers    In light of the age and health of our      Supreme Court Justices  speculation is accelerating about the      potential for a Supreme Court vacancy this summer  In advance of      any such vacancy  I have called upon the President to follow the      constructive and successful examples set by previous Presidents of      both parties who engaged in meaningful consultation with Members of      the Senate before selecting a nominee  This decision is too      important to all Americans to be unnecessarily embroiled in partisan      politics   I said again last week that should a      vacancy arise  I stand ready to work with President Bush to help him      select a nominee to the Supreme Court who can unite Americans  I      have urged consultation and cooperation for four years and have      reached out  again  over the last several months to this President       I hope that if a vacancy does arise he will finally turn away from      his past practices  consult with us and work with us     Some Presidents  including most      recently President Clinton  found consultation with the Senate in      advance of a nomination most beneficial in helping lay the      foundation for successful nominations  President Reagan  on the      other hand  disregarded the advice offered by Senate Democratic      leaders and chose a controversial  divisive nominee who was      ultimately rejected by the full Senate    In his recent book  Square Peg       Senator Hatch recounts how in 1993  as the Ranking Minority Member      of the Senate Judiciary Committee  he advised President Clinton      about possible Supreme Court nominees  In his book  Senator Hatch      wrote that he warned President Clinton away from a nominee whose      confirmation he believed would not be easy  Senator Hatch goes on      to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen Breyer and Ruth      Bader Ginsburg  both of whom were eventually nominated and confirmed      with relative ease  Indeed  96 Senators voted in favor of Justice      Ginsburgs confirmation  and only three Senators voted against       Justice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes  and only nine Senators      voted against    The Constitution provides that the      President shall nominate  and by and with the Advice and Consent of      the Senate  shall appoint judges  For advice to be meaningful it      needs to be informed and shared among those providing it     Those recent examples are not the only      examples of effective and meaningful consultation with the Senate       According to historians  almost 150      years ago  in 1869  President Grant appointed Edwin Stanton to the      Supreme Court in response to a petition from a majority of the      Senate and the House  More than 70 years ago  in 1932  President      Hoover consulted with Senator William E  Borah regarding who he      should nominate to succeed Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes  According      to historical reports  as has been confirmed by Republican Senators       Senator Borah counseled the President to select Benjamin Cardozo      from his list of potential nominees   Bipartisan consultation would not only      make any Supreme Court selection a better one  it would also      reassure the Senate and the American people that the process of      selecting a Supreme Court justice has not become politicized     Recently  a bipartisan group of 14      Senators joined together to avert an unnecessary showdown in the      Senate over the effort to invoke the nuclear option  That would      have changed 200 years of Senate tradition and the protection of      minority rights  In their agreement the bipartisan coalition say      the following        We believe that  under Article II  Section 2  of the United States      Constitution  the word Advice speaks to consultation between the      Senate and the President with regard to the use of the Presidents      power to make nominations  We encourage the Executive branch of      government to consult with members of the Senate  both Democratic      and Republican  prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the      Senate for consideration         Such a return to the early practices of our government may well      serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice      and consent process in the Senate        We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions      of the United States Senate that we as Senators seek to uphold   I agree  Bipartisan consultation is      consistent with the traditions of the Senate and would return us to      practices that have served the country well  They are right to urge      greater consultation on judicial nominations   In that regard  I was pleased to see      the President respond to a question at a news conference two weeks      ago by agreeing to consult with the Senate about his nomination      should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court  I see that as a      positive development  More troubling are reports that the White      House plan does not include meaningful consultation at all  but a      war room and some sort of preemptive contact to allow them to      pretend they consulted without anything akin to the kind of      meaningful consultation this important matter deserves  If the      White House intends to follow that type of plan  it would be most      unfortunate  unwise and counterproductive    Though the landscape ahead is sown      with the potential for controversy and contention should a vacancy      arise on the Supreme Court  confrontation is unnecessary  Consensus      should be our mutual goal  I would hope that the Presidents      objective will not be to send the Senate nominees so polarizing that      their confirmations are eked out in narrow margins  This would come      at a steep and gratuitous price that the entire nation would have to      pay in needless division  It would serve the country better to      choose a qualified consensus candidate who can be broadly supported      by the public and by the Senate        The process begins with the President  He is the only participant      in the process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court      vacancies  If there is a vacancy  the decisions made in the White      House will determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the      nation or will divide the nation  The power to avoid political      warfare with regard to the Supreme Court is in the hands of the      President  No one in the Senate is spoiling for a fight  Only one      person will decide whether there will be a divisive or unifying      process and nomination  If consensus is a goal  bipartisan      consultation will help achieve it  I believe that is what the      American people want and what they deserve         If the President chooses a Supreme Court nominee because of that      nominees ideology or record of activism in the hopes that he or she      will deliver political victories  the President will have done so      knowing that he is starting a confirmation confrontation  The      Supreme Court should not be an arm of the Republican Party  nor      should it be a wing of the Democratic Party  If the right wing      activists who were disappointed that the nuclear option was averted      convince the President to choose a divisive nominee  they will not      prevail without a difficult Senate battle  And if they do  what      will they have wrought  The American people will be the losers  The      legitimacy of the judiciary will have suffered a damaging blow from      which it may not soon recover  Such a contest would itself confirm      that the Supreme Court is just another setting for partisan contests      and partisan outcomes  People will perceive the federal courts as      places in which the fix is in         Our Constitution establishes an independent federal judiciary to be      a bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of      power by the political branches  That independence is at grave risk      when a president seeks to pack the courts with activists from either      side of the political spectrum  Even if successful  such an effort      would lead to decision making based on politics and forever diminish      public confidence in our justice system   The American people will cheer if the      President chooses someone who unifies the nation  This is not the      time and a vacancy on this Supreme Court is not the setting in which      to accentuate the political and ideological division within our      country  In our lifetimes  there has never been a greater need for      a unifying pick for the Supreme Court  At a time when too many      partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to force the Senate to      confirm the most extreme candidate with the least number of votes      possible  I have been urging cooperation and consultation to bring      the country together  There is no more important opportunity than      this to lead the nation in a direction of cooperation and unity             The independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our      American concept of justice for all  We all want Justices who      exhibit the kind of fidelity to the law that we all respect  We      want them to have a strong commitment to our shared constitutional      values of individual liberties and equal protection  We expect them      to have had a demonstrated record of commitment to equal rights       There are many conservatives who can meet these criteria and who are      not rigid ideologues    This is a difficult time for our      country and we face many challenges  Providing adequate health care      for all Americans  improving the economic prospects of Americans       defending against threats  the proliferation of nuclear weapons  the      continuing upheaval and American military presence in  Iraq  are all      fundamental matters on which we need to improve  It is my hope that      we can work together on many issues important to the American      people  including maintaining a fair and independent judiciary  I      am confident that a smooth nomination and confirmation process can      be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work together  The      American people we represent and serve are entitled to no less
