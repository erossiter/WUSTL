       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Oversight Of The Department   Of Justice                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  Chairman      Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Oversight Of The Department Of Justice     July 24  2007      Three months ago  when Attorney      General Gonzales last appeared before this Committee  I said that      the Department of Justice was experiencing a crisis of leadership      perhaps unrivaled during its history  Unfortunately  that crisis      has not abated  Until there is independence  transparency and      accountability  it will continue  The Attorney General has lost the      confidence of the Congress and the American people  Through      oversight we hope to restore balance and accountability to the      Executive Branch  The Department of Justice must be restored to be      worthy of its name  It should not be reduced to another political      arm of the White House  The trust and confidence of the American      people in federal law enforcement must be restored   With the Department shrouded in      scandal  the Deputy Attorney General has announced his resignation       The nominee to become Associate Attorney General requested that his      nomination be withdrawn rather than testify under oath at a      confirmation hearing  The Attorney Generals chief of staff  the      Deputy Attorney Generals chief of staff  the Departments White      House liaison and the White House Political Director have all      resigned  as have others  I would joke that the last one out the      door should turn out the lights  but the Department of Justice is      too important for that    we need to shine more light there  not      less    The investigation into the firing for      partisan purposes of United States Attorneys  who had been appointed      by this President  along with an ever growing series of      controversies and scandals have revealed an Administration driven by      a vision of an all powerful Executive over our constitutional system      of checks and balances  that values loyalty over judgment  secrecy      over openness  and ideology over competence    The accumulated and essentially      uncontroverted evidence is that political considerations factored      into the unprecedented firing of at least nine United States      Attorneys last year  Testimony and documents show that the list was      compiled based on input from the highest political ranks in the      White House  that senior officials were apparently focused on the      political impact of federal prosecutions  on whether federal      prosecutors were doing enough to bring partisan voter fraud and      corruption cases  and that the reasons given for these firings were      contrived as part of a cover up   What the White House stonewalling is      preventing is conclusive evidence of who made the decisions to fire      these federal prosecutors  We know from the testimony that it was      not the President  Everyone who has testified has said that he was      not involved  None of the senior officials at the Department of      Justice could testify how people were added to the list or the real      reasons that people were included among the federal prosecutors to      be replaced  Indeed  the evidence we have been able to collect      points to Karl Rove and the political operatives at the White      House  The stonewalling by the White House raises the question       What is it that the White House is so desperate to hide    The White House has asserted blanket      claims of executive privilege  despite officials contentions that      the President was not involved  They refuse to provide a factual      basis for their blanket claims  have instructed former White House      officials not to testify about what they know  and then instructed      Harriet Miers to refuse even to appear as required by a House      Judiciary Committee subpoena  Now  anonymous officials are claiming      that the statutory mechanism to test White House assertions of      Executive privilege no longer governs  In essence this White House      asserts that its claim of privilege is the final word  that Congress      may not review it  and that no court can review it  Here  again       this White House claims to be above the law    My oath  unlike those who have      apparently sworn their allegiance to this President  is to the      United States Constitution  I believe in checks and balances and in      the rule of law    Despite the stonewalling and      obstruction  we have learned that Todd Graves  U S  Attorney in the      Western District of Missouri was fired after he expressed      reservations about a lawsuit that would have stripped many      African American voters from the rolls in Missouri  When the      Attorney General replaced Mr  Graves with Bradley Schlozman  the      person pushing the lawsuit  that case was filed and ultimately      thrown out of court  Once in place in Missouri though  Mr  Schlozman      also brought indictments on the eve of a closely contested election       despite the Justice Department policy not to do so  This is what      happens when a responsible prosecutor is replaced by a loyal Bushie      for partisan  political purposes   Mr  Schlozman also bragged about      hiring ideological soulmates  Monica Goodling likewise admitted      crossing the line when she used a political litmus test for career      prosecutors and immigration judges  Rather than keep federal law      enforcement above politics  this Administration is more intent on      placing its actions above the law    The Attorney General admitted recently      in a video for Justice employees that injecting politics into the      Departments hiring is unacceptable  But is he committed to      corrective action and routing out the partisanship in federal law      enforcement  His lack of independence and tendency to act as if he      were the Presidents lawyer rather than the Attorney General of the      United States makes that doubtful  From the infamous torture memo       to Mr  Gonzales attempt to prevail on a hospitalized Attorney      General Ashcroft to certify an illegal eavesdropping program  to the      recent opinion seeking to justify Harriet Miers contemptuous      refusal to appear before the House Judiciary Committee  the Justice      Department has been reduced to the role of enabler for this      Administration  What we need instead is genuine accountability and      real independence   We learned earlier this year of      systematic misuse and abuse of National Security Letters  a powerful      tool for the Government to obtain personal information without the      approval of a court or prosecutor  The Attorney General has said he      had no inkling of these or other problems with vastly expanded      investigative powers  Now we know otherwise  Recent documents      obtained through Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and reported in     The Washington Post      indicate that the Attorney General was receiving reports in 2005 and      2006 of violations in connection with the PATRIOT Act and abuses of      National Security Letters  Yet  when the Attorney General testified      under oath before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in      April 2005  he said that  t he track record established over the      past three years has demonstrated the effectiveness of the      safeguards of civil liberties put in place when the Act was      passed  Earlier this month  in responses to written questions I      sent to the Attorney General about when he first learned of problems      with National Security Letters  he once again failed to mention      these reports of problems   Only with the openness and honesty      that brings true accountability will the Department begin to move      forward and correct the problems of the last few years  Instead  we      have leadership at the Department of Justice whose expressions of      concern and admissions that mistakes were made only follow public      revelations and amount to regrets that their excesses were      uncovered    In the wake of growing reports of      abuses of National Security Letters  the Attorney General announced      a new internal program  This supposed self examination  with no      involvement by the courts  no report to Congress  and no other      outside check  essentially translates to trust us  With a history      of civil liberties abuses and cover ups  this Administration has      squandered our trust  Earlier internal reviews  like the      Intelligence Oversight Board and the Privacy and Civil Liberties      Oversight Board have been ineffective and inactive  failing to take      action on the violations reported to them  Only with a real check      from outside of the Executive branch can we have any confidence that      abuses will be curbed and balance restored   A tragic dimension of the ongoing      crisis of leadership at the Justice Department is the undermining of      good people and the crucial work that it does  Thousands of honest       hard working prosecutors  agents  and other civil servants labor      every day to detect and prevent crime  uncover corruption  promote      equality and justice  and keep us safe from terrorism  Sadly       prosecutions will now be questioned as politically motivated and      evidence will be suspected of having been obtained in violation of      laws and civil liberties  Once the government shows a disregard for      the independence of the justice system and the rule of law  it is      very hard to restore the peoples faith  This Committee will do its      best to try to restore independence       accountability  and commitment to the rule of law to the operations      of the Justice Department                                                Questions  Round One                               Questions  Round Two                               Closing Remarks
