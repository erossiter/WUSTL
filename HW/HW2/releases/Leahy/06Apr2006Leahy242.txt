       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Cloture On Comprehensive Immigration   Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On Cloture On Comprehensive Immigration Reform     April 6  2006  I began this debate by praising the      bipartisanship of the Judiciary Committee for reporting a      comprehensive and realistic immigration bill to the Senate  I have      said from the outset that Democratic Senators could not pass a good      immigration bill on our own  With fewer than 50 Democratic      Senators  we will need the support of Republican Senators if the      Senate is to make progress on this important matter today   With all the dramatic stagecraft of      the last few days and the protestations from the other side of the      aisle it may seem surprising but the truth is that by invoking      cloture on this bill we move to consideration of germane      amendments  If the Kyl amendment is germane and pending  it would      be in line for a vote  So much for all the bluster and false claims      of Democratic obstruction we have heard  If Republicans want to      move forward on this debate  and get one step closer to a vote on      tough but fair immigration reform  they should support cloture  For      the past few days  I have offered and our leadership has offered to      take up a number of bipartisan amendments for debate and votes that      would have easily won the support of the Senate  It was Senator Kyl      who objected to that progress    Late last night  the Republican Leader      came to the floor to file a motion that would require the Senate to      send the immigration bill back to the Committee  He immediately      acted to fill the tree with a series of amendments and filed an      immediate cloture motion  So before any of us even saw the      amendment  the Republican Leader made sure to stop every other      Senator from offering any amendment  How ironic  after all the      posturing by Republicans over the last two days about the rights of      Senators to offer amendments and be heard  the majority party has      returned full force to its standard practices  That is too bad       especially on a matter this important and on which we began with      such a high level of demonstrated bipartisanship   The Majority Leader had set March 27      as the deadline for Judiciary Committee action  and we met his      deadline  I always understood that the Majority Leader had      committed to turn to the Committee bill if we were able to meet his      deadline  That is what I heard the Judiciary Chairman reiterate as      we concluded our markup and heard him say  again  as the Senate      debate began  The Democratic Leader noted that we had agreed to      proceed based on the assurances he had received that the foundation      of the Senates upcoming debate on immigration policy will be the      bipartisan Committee bill    The Majority Leader had often spoken      of allowing two full weeks for Senate debate of this important      matter  Regrettably  what the Majority Leader said and what      happened are not the same  The Senate did not complete work on the      lobbying reform bill on schedule and cut into time for this debate       When the Majority Leader decided to begin the debate with a day of      discussion of the Frist bill  we lost more time  We were left then      with one week  not two  We have lost time that could have been      spent debating and adopting amendments when some Republicans      withheld consent from utilizing our usual procedures over the last      days  When the false and partisan charges of obstruction came from      the other side  the Democratic Leader filed a petition for cloture      that I hope will bring successful action on a comprehensive       realistic and fair immigration bill    I regret that over the last three days      some tried to make this into a partisan fight  I fear they have      succeeded  I urge all Senators  Republicans  Democrats and the      Senates Independent  to vote for cloture on the bipartisan      Committee bill  to bring this debate to a head and a successful      conclusion  in the time and on the terms set by the Majority      Leader  If we are to pass a bipartisan bill by the end of this      week  we will need to join together to support cloture on the      bipartisan Committee bill  proceed to work our way through the      remaining amendments and pass the bill    This is an historic vote on whether      the Senate is committed to making real immigration reform  I urge      all Senators to vote for reform by supporting this cloture motion on      the bipartisan bill that balances tough enforcement with human      dignity    The Republican manager of the bill was      right to take on the smear campaign against the Committee bill from      opponents who falsely labeled it amnesty  The Committee bill on      which cloture is being sought is not an amnesty bill but a tough      bill with a realistic way to strengthen our security and border      enforcement while bringing people out of the shadows to have them      earn citizenship over the course of 11 years through fines and work       and paying taxes and learning English and swearing allegiance to the      United States  As The New York Times noted in a recent editorial       painting the word deer on a cow and taking it into the woods does      not make the cow into a deer    It is most ironic to hear those in the      majority of the Republican Congress talk about amnesty and lack of      accountability  Their record over the last six years is a failure      to require responsibility and accountability or to serve as a check      or balance  They are experts in amnesty and should know that this      bill is not amnesty    I was glad to hear the Republican      Leader begin to change his tune this weekend and to acknowledge that      providing hardworking neighbors with a path to citizenship is not      amnesty  I have not had an opportunity to see  let alone review       the Republican instructions in the motion filed late last night  I      am advised that they would establish a path to citizenship for a      segment of the undocumented  I guess other Republicans will falsely      label that effort as amnesty for some    Tragically  however  the opponents of      tough and smart comprehensive immigration reform do not stop with      smearing the bill  They have also used ethnic slurs with respect to      outstanding Members of this Senate  I spoke yesterday to praise      Senator Salazar  His familys is a distinguished record that should      not need my defense  I deplore the all too typical tactics of      McCarthyism and division to which our opponents have resorted       again  I wish someone on the other side of the aisle had shown the      wisdom of Ralph Flanders and joined with me in criticism of such      tactics  Regrettably  no one did  I  again  thank Senator Salazar       Senator Menendez  Senator Obama and Senator Martinez for their      support of the Committee bill and their participation in this      debate    The Specter Leahy Hagel substitute      amendment that mirrors the Judiciary Committee bill confronts the      challenging problem of how to fix our broken immigration system head      on  It is strong on enforcement  stronger than the majority      leaders bill  In some ways it is stronger than the bill passed by      the House  It includes provisions added by Senator Feinstein to      make tunneling under our borders a federal crime and increases the      number of enforcement agents  It is tough on employer enforcement      and tough on traffickers  But it is also comprehensive and      balanced  I have called it enforcement plus because it confronts      the problem of the millions of undocumented who live in the      shadows  It values work and respects human dignity  It includes      guest worker provisions supported by business and labor and a fair      path to earned citizenship over 11 years through fines  the payment      of taxes  hard work and learning English that has the support of      religious and leading Hispanic organizations  It includes the Ag      Jobs bill and the DREAM Act  the Frist amendment  the Bingaman      enforcement amendment and the Alexander citizenship amendment   Wisely  we have rejected the      controversial provisions that would have exposed those who provide      humanitarian relief  medical care  shelter  counseling and other      basic services to the undocumented to possible prosecution under      felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal law  And we have      rejected the proposal to criminalize mere presence in an      undocumented status in the United States  which would trap people in      a permanent underclass  Those provisions of the bills supported by      congressional Republicans have understandably sparked nationwide      protests being viewed as anti Hispanic and anti immigrant and are      inconsistent with American values   Our work on immigration reform has      accurately been called a defining moment in our history  The      Senate  in its best moments  has been able to rise to the occasion      and act as the conscience of the Nation  in the best true interests      of our Nation  I hope that the Senates work on immigration reform      will be in keeping with the best the Senate can offer the Nation  I      hope that our work will be something that would make my immigrant      grandparents proud  and a product that will make our children and      grandchildren proud as they look back on this debate   Now is the time and this is the moment      for the Senate to come together to do its part and to reject the      calls to partisanship  Now is the time to move forward with the      Committee bill as our framework so that we can bring millions of      people out of the shadows and end the permanent underclass status of      so many who have contributed so much  By voting for cloture we will      take a giant step toward better protecting our security and borders      and allowing the American dream to become a reality for our      hardworking neighbors  History will judge  and the time is now
