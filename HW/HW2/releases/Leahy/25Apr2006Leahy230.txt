       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Immigration  Economic   Impacts                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Immigration  Economic Impacts     April 25  2006 President Bush is right when he says as      legislators and leaders we cannot slavishly follow the ever shifting      polls  It is too bad he has not always followed his own advice       When it comes to immigration reform  the Senate and the Congress      must do the right thing  not just the currently popular thing       Immigration reform encompasses the need to secure our broken borders      while preserving human dignity and human rights  I hope that the      President will do more than just talk about what should be done and      take action by encouraging his fellow Republicans in Congress to      work with us to pass comprehensive  fair and humane immigration      legislation        A GOP Campaign Of Distortion  The bipartisan compromise being considered by      the Senate strikes the right balance between enhanced security and      realistic reform  It is a marked improvement from the punitive      measure passed by the House   Given President Bushs comments in favor of a      comprehensive approach to immigration reform  I was surprised by      published reports that the effort to include these harsh      criminalization provisions in the bill introduced by Chairman      Sensenbrenner in the House actually came from this Administrations      Justice Department  Indeed  I take Chairman Sensenbrenner at his      word  when he noted in House debate last December  At the      Administrations request  the base bill makes unlawful presence a      crime         The Los Angeles Times reported on April 16      that an anonymous White House official confirmed this  as well   I recently wrote to Attorney General Gonzales      in an effort to get beyond the blame game and get to the facts      regarding the origin of these criminalization provisions that have      provoked so much outrage across the country  I hope that the      Attorney General will be more forthcoming in responding to my      request than he has been in the past  There is no reason he cannot      help us get to the facts by sharing with us the communications he      and others at the Justice Department and in the Bush Administration      had with House Republicans as they determined to criminalize      undocumented presence in the United States and humanitarian efforts      to help those in need  Republicans may control the White House and      both branches of Congress  but they do not enjoy a Republican only      lobbying privilege that protects such information between the Bush      Administration and House Republican leadership   If the Attorney General is forthright in his      answer to my inquiry and provides the information and documents I      request  we will know more about where these proposals came from and      why they were so strenuously supported until Senator Durbin exposed      the matter at our Judiciary Committee markups last month  Good      sense and decency prevailed on March 27  when  in a bipartisan      effort  our Committee stripped these provisions from the bill  I am      encouraged that Senator Frist and Mr  Hastert have joined on a      letter revisiting their earlier misguided notions to establish such      new felonies as those contained in the House passed bill and that      were introduced by Senator Frist in his original proposal  We      cannot backslide into criminalization of undocumented presence with      oppressive collateral consequences for hardworking immigrants and      their families   I had hoped that progress on this matter was      significant until I heard that Republican political operatives have      paid for misleading radio ads on Spanish language stations seeking      to blame Democrats for these provisions  This is not spin  it is      downright distortion  These provisions were initiated and supported      by the Bush Administration and congressional Republicans  Revealing      the truth will put the lie to these partisan charges and false      suggestions  The ads run by the Republican National Committee      represent politics at its worst  This is an irresponsible and      shameless example of putting base political interests over      truthfulness  integrity and the security interests of the American      people  and those behind it should be exposed  I hope we can get      beyond this kind of rank partisanship and join together to enact      historic legislation that will comprehensively address our      immigration situation   I ask that a copy of my April 21 letter to the      Attorney General be included in the record  I do hope that he will      be responsive and provide the information and materials that will      show the vicious and partisan Republican ad campaign for what it is       Ineffective Enforcement Requires Improved Security We need to be concerned about the security of      our borders  I was among those who pushed      for added enforcement along the Northern Border as well as our      Southern Border over the last several years and have voted to      provide the resources necessary to make those commitments a      reality  It is the Bush Cheney Administration that has been the      impediment to the hiring and training of the additional Border      Patrol agents we have sought to require legislatively   For all its talk and swagger about security       the Bush Cheney Administration has not lived up to its rhetoric in      securing our borders  A report card issued by the 9 11      Commissioners in December 2005 evaluated this Administrations      efforts on border security at a D  below average  Just      last month we heard about nuclear material being successfully      smuggled across our borders  This April  a U S  Citizenship and      Immigration Services employee  Michael Maxwell  testified before a      House subcommittee about an astonishing culture of corruption  and      misdirected priorities in the agency within the Department of      Homeland Security charged with processing immigration applications       He testified about district offices that reward employees with      bonuses  movie tickets and gift certificates for disposing of      applications rapidly        A Bipartisan and Comprehensive Solution Despite the partisan bickering and idleness of      this Administration  the Senate was able to forge a bipartisan      coalition of its members to join around a proposal that was tough on      security while being fair to the millions of immigrants who work and      live in our country  The Senate made progress  and it was done the      old fashioned way  among Democrats and Republicans working to do      what was right  not what was politically popular  Just before the      Senate adjourned for recess earlier this month  we were focused on a      solution to the problems posed by having millions of undocumented      immigrants inside our borders   Many of us believe that immigration reform      needs to be comprehensive   with strong enforcement and border      security  matched with fair and effective steps to bring millions of      hardworking people out of the shadows and provide them a path to      earned citizenship and a full measure of Americas promise  We were      close to achieving that with a bipartisan compromise   The bipartisan Committee bill and the outline      of the Hagel Martinez bill represent a balance of strong enforcement      of our borders with fair reforms that honor human dignity and our      American values  I continue to work for a bill and a law that is      fair to all  We all agree that it will be tough on security  but it      also has to acknowledge our American values and human dignity  The      House passed bill and the original Frist bill were overly punitive      and did not include a path to earned citizenship        American Traditions of Dignity and Fairness Earlier this month  hundreds of thousands      immigrants and citizens around the country rallied and spoke out for      fairness  In peaceful petitions across the country on April 10      people took part in a National Day of Action for Immigrant Justice       Participants in those rallies acted in a great American democratic      tradition   I am sorry that Republican leaders in the House      have remained so resistant to their calls for fair treatment  a way      out of the shadows and a pathway to earned citizenship  I was      disturbed to hear Republican legislators condemning Mayor      Villaraigosa and California Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamente as      affiliated to a radical racist group  Just yesterday  Governor      Schwarzenegger convened a news conference to report that California      Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante and Los Angeles Mayor Antonio      Villaraigosa had received death threats over the immigration issue       Governor Schwarzenegger was right to say that hate  racism and      intolerance are never accepted in our public debates  A Member of      the House of Representatives recently said that if the recent      protestors really want to honor Americas values  they would stand      up to lawbreakers and embrace an enforcement first approach  In      striking contrast  I have not seen congressional Republicans      adopting that stance with respect to President Bushs violation of      the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act statute by a secret      program for warrantless wiretapping of Americans       A Promise For Real Reform That We Must Keep  I hope that the Republican leadership in the      Congress will work with us to follow through on the promise of fair       comprehensive immigration reform  A bipartisan majority of the      Senate has now voted consistent with moving forward on comprehensive      immigration reform and has rejected the narrow and unrealistic      enforcement only approach  I hope the emergency supplemental      appropriations legislation will not be manipulated into an      enforcement only effort that leaves millions in the shadows   Our work on immigration reform is a defining      moment in our history  We are writing laws that will determine      peoples lives and what it is that America stands for  I continue      to urge the Senate to rise to the occasion and act as the conscience      of the Nation  I continue to work on immigration reform so that the      laws we enact will be in keeping with the best the Senate can offer      the Nation and the best that America can offer to immigrants  I      hope that our work will be something that would make my immigrant      grandparents proud  and a product that will make our children and      grandchildren proud  The question is still before us whether the      Senate is committed to making real immigration reform  I am concerned that the majority leaders      announcement of a breakthrough two weeks ago is having the      unintended effect of creating a false impression and false hopes  I      commended him for changing his position over the course of the      recent Senate debate  I am delighted that he and others who had      been opposing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to earned      citizenship re evaluated their position and joined us in the      effort   But an announcement is easy  enacting a new law      is not  We are still a long way from enacting fair  comprehensive      and humane immigration reform  None has yet passed the Senate  None      has passed the House  The cruelest joke of all would be to have      raised expectations and false hopes by premature talk of a solution      when none has yet been achieved  That promise needs to be      fulfilled   I urge everyone concerned about the lives of      those who are undocumented to remain focused on enacting a law  and      on what it will provide in its final form  It would be      short sighted to pass a bill that ends up serving as a false promise      to those who yearn to be part of the promise of a better life that      is America   I am still hopeful that the Senate can pass      legislation that is similar to the bill we reported from this      Committee  That is why we are here today  I want to thank the      experts who have come here today to share their views on the      economic impact of immigration  I am committed to moving forward      with a fair  humane  and realistic piece of legislation that will      address immigration issues comprehensively
