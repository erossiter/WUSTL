       Leahy  Bon Urge White House Not To Force Lead Disaster Role On Active   Military                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  Bond Urge White       House Not To Force      Lead Disaster Role On Active Military   The bipartisan       leadership of the Senate National Guard Caucus Friday cautioned       President Bush against assigning the lead role in domestic       disaster responses to the active U S  military  The co chairs       of the Caucus  Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo   and Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt          released the letter  text  below   which they sent earlier       Friday to the White House     In another       development  the Senate Thursday night approved an amendment by       Leahy and Bond that adds  1 3 billion to the annual Defense       Appropriations Bill  to help replenish National Guard equipment       stocks that have declined to dangerously low levels due to       National Guard obligations in Iraq  Afghanistan and in the       aftermath of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  more information on       the amendment is                    September 29  2005   The Honorable George W  Bush      The President of the United States      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue      Washington        DC 20501      Dear Mr  President      Hurricanes Katrina and Rita have       focused the nations attention on the use of the military in       domestic emergencies  We understand the desire to examine the       role and responsibilities of the active military in these types       of devastating situations and believe that the current system       that puts the active military in a supporting role is       fundamentally sound  This arrangement preserves local control       and state authorities granted under the Constitution  avoids the       potentially dangerous use of the active military for law       enforcement  and takes advantage of the enormous capabilities       and experience that exist within the National Guard      Putting the military in the lead       role in domestic disaster situations negates one of the most       fundamental attributes of the National Guard  its experience in       working with local and state first responders and its       familiarity with local communities  Under the current system        when a local community relief effort becomes overwhelmed  it       turns to state resources and assistance without relinquishing       control  When a state is overwhelmed it will turn to the       federal government for support  This arrangement flows directly       from the Constitutions separation of powers and has the       practical benefit of ensuring that the elected officials who       best know their communities remain in control    Placing the active military in       control creates an almost certain conflict with Posse Comitatus       statutes that prevent the use of the military for law       enforcement activities  These laws reflect longstanding       conventions that prevent the military from becoming       inappropriately involved in civilian affairs  Exceptions to the       Posse Comitatus statues allow the President in extreme cases to       invoke the Insurrection Statutes to maintain order  and these       good laws create a strong presumption against interjecting the       military into decision making situations best handled by       democratically elected officials     The most expeditious way to       leverage military assets in response to a domestic crisis is to       activate National Guard forces under the Title 32 provision       which provides for the dual benefit of maintaining the National       Guard under the command and control of the governor with federal       financing  The worst lesson to take away from recent natural       disasters would be to alter our emergency management system in a       fundamental way and change the presumption against using the       military as the lead organization  Such a radical change would       go against our Constitution  threaten civil liberties in       emergency situations  and ignore the full capabilities of the       National Guard     As you oversee the many reviews of       the federal governments emergency response capabilities  we       hope you keep our thoughts in mind  We look forward to       discussing this matter with you in the very near future    Sincerely       Christopher S        Bond       Patrick J  Leahy      Co Chair  National Guard       Caucus Co Chair  National       Guard Caucus
