       Judiciary Democrats Addtress Senate Concerns Over Release Of Roberts   Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Judiciary Democrats Urge Openness And Cooperation     In Sharing Key Documents Relating To Roberts Nomination   Panel Members Send      Letter to Colleagues Citing Importance of Cooperation From Bush      Administration and Nominee     In Obtaining Documents Relating to Judge Robertss Record         WASHINGTON  Friday  Aug  5   The eight Democratic members of the      Senate Judiciary Committee sent a letter Friday to all of their      fellow senators citing the importance of cooperation and      transparency in obtaining documents relating to the record of Judge      John Roberts Jr  Judge Roberts has been nominated to be an      Associate Justice on the Supreme Court of the United States  Last      week  the eight members of the panel sent a letter to Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales requesting information on 16 cases that      Roberts handled as a Deputy Solicitor General under President George      H W  Bush  This limited request was winnowed from the more than 300      cases that the Solicitor Generals office was involved with during      John Robertss time in that office  and similar documents were      provided to the Senate in past confirmation proceedings  Attorney      General Gonzales has not yet responded to the request     The      letter follows     August 5  2005   Dear Colleague   As we prepare for hearings on the      Presidents nomination of John G  Roberts  Jr   to be an Associate      Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States  we write to offer      this brief update on the information we have received so far  on      what has been promised and the modest request for documents that we      have made of the Administration  and on why we feel it is important      for the Committee  the Senate  and the American people to have the      benefit of this information before being asked to vote on this      lifetime appointment    We have now come to an agreement with      Chairman Specter on a start date of September 6 and other parameters      have now been set for the confirmation hearings  Much is being done      to prepare the Judiciary Committee and the Senate for this process       In order to be able to meaningfully understand Judge Robertss      relevant career record  the Democratic members of the Judiciary      Committee last week made two formal requests to expedite  obtain and      help organize the production of the documentary record for the      hearings  drawn from his nine year career in the Executive Branch       This includes a modest request for additional documents not yet      provided by the Administration    There are three major categories of      documents in question  The first consists of documents from Judge      Robertss service as Special Assistant to Attorney General William      French Smith from 1981 to1982  The National Archives provided these      documents to the Committee through the Department of Justice on July      26  and a few additional documents on August 2  We are currently      reviewing them for information relevant to the nomination     The second category consists of      documents relating to Judge Robertss work for President Reagan as      Associate White House Counsel under Counsel Fred Fielding from      1982 1986  A relatively small number of these documents had already      been processed and made available to the public at the Reagan      Library by the National Archives  but the large majority    up to 75 000      pages  according to press reports  must still undergo reviews      required under the Freedom of Information Act and the Presidential      Records Act  which includes a possible veto by this White House      under an Executive Order issued by President Bush early in his first      term    Although it has been reported in news      accounts that the Bush Administration has promised to expedite the      review of these documents  the Committee so far has received none of      them  As a way of helping the White House work more efficiently and      expedite the Senates review of this nomination  the Democratic      members of the Judiciary Committee sent a letter to the White House      last week requesting the prioritization of these documents  In that      request  Democratic Senators provided a list of the most pertinent      files to give the White House a guide for processing key documents      first  We have not heard back from the White House on that request       which was sent more than a week ago    The third category of documents we      seek are specific memoranda relating to 16 particular cases on which      John Roberts worked or may have worked while he was a political      appointee  serving as the principal deputy to Solicitor General Ken      Starr in the Administration of President George H W  Bush  from      1989 1993  There is significant precedent for asking for these      kinds of materials from nominees    including nominees to the      Supreme Court    and we do not believe that any sort of privilege      prevents the Senate from having access to them    In the past  Senators have been able      to examine documents relating to controversial issues or cases on      which the nominee worked while at the Department of Justice  and we      would like to do the same  These 16 cases were selected from among      hundreds that went through the office during Judge Robertss time      there and were carefully selected to help us understand what Judge      Robertss views were on legal arguments in some landmark cases that      he either briefed or argued  or in which he may have made      significant litigation decisions  From materials Judge Roberts      submitted to the White House in 1991 before he was nominated to the      D C  Circuit  it appears his work in the Office of the Solicitor      General was quite significant  He explains that he  had final      responsibility for determining whether the United States would seek      further review of adverse decisions in some 380 cases  and that he      even served as Acting Solicitor General in a number of matters from      which Ken Starr was recused  While he is certainly free to answer      questions about these cases in his hearing  we believe his      contemporaneous writings will be the best evidence of the legal      positions he took in these important cases    As part of our system of checks and      balances  the Constitution has divided the authority between the      President and Senate when it comes to giving someone a lifetime job      on our highest court  There is an important process ahead for the      Senate and it is vital that Senators have available the information necessary to fulfill that      constitutionally mandated responsibility  The hearings before the      Judiciary Committee will be the best opportunity for the Senate       and the American people  to learn about Judge Roberts  It is too      important a decision to rush through without careful consideration      and the necessary information    If you or your staff have any      questions about this process  the documents relating to this      nomination or requests that Democratic members have made for      material  please do not hesitate to contact us or our Judiciary      Committee staff    Sincerely    Patrick Leahy      Edward Kennedy     Joseph Biden     Herb Kohl
