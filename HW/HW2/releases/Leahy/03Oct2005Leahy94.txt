       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Harriet Miers To   Be Associated Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee        On The Nomination Of Harriet Miers      To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court      October 3  2005  The stakes for the American people       could not be higher with this new nomination to the Supreme       Court  Justice OConnor brought an open mind to the cases she       reviewed and served as a moderating influence on the Court  The       person who replaces her replaces a pivotal vote on our Nations       most powerful court  The person who replaces her has the       potential to dramatically tilt the balance of the court        Maintaining the stability of the court is crucial for the Nation       and will be a factor for me as I consider this nomination         It is too early to reach any firm       judgment about such an important nomination  I do not know Ms        Miers well and I did not meet her until recently  six months       after she became the White House counsel  What I do know is       that she has a reputation for being loyal to this President        whom she has a long history of serving as a close advisor and in       working to advance his objectives  In an Administration intent       on accumulating Executive power  Ms  Mierss views on and role       in these issues will be important for the Senate to examine  It       is important to know whether she would enter this key post with       the judicial independence necessary when the Supreme Court       considers issues of interest to this Administration     Fairness and independence must       always be primary attributes of those who serve on our courts          The Court that serves  America should reflect       America  Many will be surprised that the President did not pick       an Hispanic woman from the many qualified Hispanics across the       country recommended to the President  I look forward to the       time when the membership of the United States Supreme Court is       more reflective of the country it serves    As the Senate prepares to review       another Supreme Court nomination  we must be careful to draw       upon the lessons learned from the just completed confirmation       process of the Chief Justice  The review of Chief Justice John       Robertss nomination showcased the Senate Judiciary Committee at       its best  but it also highlighted some of the pitfalls in this       process if the Administration and its nominee are not       forthcoming    I supported Chief Justice       Robertss nomination in spite of    not because of    the lack       of cooperation from the White House and the misguided urgings of       some Senators that the nominee not be forthcoming about his       judicial philosophy during the Committees hearings  The       Committees chairman  Arlen Specter  and I committed ourselves       to a fair and thorough hearing process    Is this a nominee who will protect       and expand our constitutional rights  or will she neglect and       narrow those rights  Learning the answer will be at the core of       what the American people and the Senate need to know from the       hearings on this nomination    The White House and this nominee       have a choice and a responsibility in making this process work       the best it can in the interest of serving the American people        I hope that the White House will cooperate with the Senate as it       executes its constitutional duty  The White House should       provide us with the information we need to have a full picture       of Ms  Mierss qualifications and record  and we will expect her       to answer the questions that tell us what kind of a Justice she       would be in this especially crucial seat on our Nations highest       court
