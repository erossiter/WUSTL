       Democratic Senators Urge Consultation On Supreme Court Vacancy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Democratic      Senators Urge Consultation     On Supreme Court Vacancy  From the floor of      the  U S  Senate on      Thursday  Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Edward Kennedy  D Mass        and Charles Schumer  D N Y   called on President Bush to consult in      a meaningful way with all senators in the event of a vacancy on the      Supreme Court  Leahys floor remarks follow   Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Senate Floor  A Successful      Senate Tradition      Meaningful Consultation On Judicial Nominations     June 23  2005  It is now almost one month since the      bipartisan agreement was forged to avert an unnecessary nuclear      showdown in the Senate  Democratic Senators who signed the      Memorandum of Understanding on Judicial Nominations that averted the      nuclear option have fulfilled their commitments with respect to      invoking cloture on several controversial nominees  Sadly  with      Republicans voting party line on almost every one of these nominees       they have been confirmed  Meanwhile  as the Democratic Leader had      offered months ago  the Senate considered and voted upon two Sixth      Circuit nominees and an additional D C  Circuit nominee     What has yet to take place  however       is the kind of meaningful consultation that Republican and      Democratic Senators explicitly called for in that memorandum  They      encouraged the Executive branch of government to consult with      members of the Senate  both Democratic and Republican  prior to      submitting a judicial nomination to the Senate for consideration       They called for a return to the early practices of our government      that reduced conflict and led to consensus  We have not yet noticed      an abundance of consultation  And unfortunately  White House      officials have declared that the President has no interest in and      feels no obligation to assist in implementing this feature of the      Memorandum    Since the White House will not      acknowledge the record  I thought it worth noting that 214 of this      Presidents judicial nominations have already been confirmed by the      Senate  That includes 41 circuit court nominees  an almost 80      percent confirmation rate of his many divisive circuit court      nominees  These figures are all well ahead of the rates during      President Clintons Administration  At a similar point in the last      Administration  only 175 nominees had been confirmed       including only 31 circuit court nominees  which amounted to barely      66 percent of President Clintons circuit court nominees   With all the recent talk from      Republicans about the principle of every nominee being entitled to      an up or down vote  it is striking that such a standard was not      considered at all while Republicans pocket filibustered more than 60      of President Clintons judicial nominees  As I demonstrated during      the time I served as Chairman and since then  President Bushs      nominees have been treated far more fairly than were President      Clintons nominees    I have spoken over the      last four and one half years  most recently in the last few weeks       about the benefits to all if the President were to consult with      Members of the Senate from both sides of the aisle on important      judicial nominations  I return today to emphasize  again  the      significance of meaningful consultation on these nominations  It      bears repeating given what is at stake for the Senate  the judiciary      and the American people   In a few more days      the United States Supreme Court will complete its term  Last year      the Chief Justice noted publicly that at the age of 80  one thinks      about retirement  I get to see the Chief Justice from time to time      in connection with his work for the Judicial Conference and the      Smithsonian Institution  Sometimes we see each other in      Vermont or en route there  and I am struck every time by his      commitment to service  He is waging his personal battle against ill      health with his characteristic resolve  I know that the Chief will      retire when he decides that he should  and not before  He has      earned that right after serving on the Supreme Court for more than      30 years  the last 19 as the Chief Justice  I have great respect      and affection for him  and he is in our prayers    In light of the age and health of our      Supreme Court Justices  speculation has accelerated about the      potential for a Supreme Court vacancy this summer  In advance of      any such vacancy  I have called upon the President to follow the      constructive and successful examples set by previous Presidents of      both parties who engaged in meaningful consultation with Members of      the Senate before selecting nominees  This decision is too      important to all Americans to be unnecessarily embroiled in partisan      politics   I have said repeatedly that should a      Supreme Court vacancy arise  I stand ready to work with President      Bush to help him select a nominee to the Supreme Court who can unite      Americans  I have urged consultation and cooperation for four years      and have reached out to the President  again  over these last few      weeks  I hope that if a vacancy does arise the President will      finally turn away from his past practices  consult with us and work      with us  This is the way to unite instead of divide the Nation  and      this is the way to honor the Constitutions advise and consent      directive  and this is the way to preserve the independence of our      federal judiciary  which is the envy of the rest of the world        Some Presidents  including most      recently President Clinton  found that consultation with the Senate      in advance of a nomination was highly beneficial in helping lay the      foundation for successful nominations  President Reagan  on the      other hand  disregarded the advice offered by Senate Democratic      leaders and chose a controversial  divisive nominee who was      ultimately rejected by the full Senate    In his recent book  Square Peg       Senator Hatch recounts how in 1993  as the Ranking Minority Member      of the Senate Judiciary Committee  he advised President Clinton      about possible Supreme Court nominees  In his book  Senator Hatch      wrote that he warned President Clinton away from a nominee whose      confirmation he believed would not be easy  Senator Hatch goes on      to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen Breyer and Ruth      Bader Ginsburg  both of whom were eventually nominated and confirmed      with relative ease  Indeed  96 Senators voted in favor of Justice      Ginsburgs confirmation  and only three Senators voted against       Justice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes  and only nine Senators      voted against  Nor are these recent examples the only evidence of      effective and meaningful consultation with the Senate over our      history    The Constitution provides that the      President shall nominate  and by and with the Advice and Consent of      the Senate  shall appoint judges and explicitly the members of the      only court established by the Constitution itself  the Supreme      Court  For advice to be meaningful  it needs to be informed       Despite his public commitment at a news conference three weeks ago      specifically regarding the Supreme Court  the President has not even      begun the process of consulting with Democratic Senators  I wrote      to the President  again  last month  urging consultation and even      making suggestions on how he might wish to proceed     Bipartisan consultation would not only      make any Supreme Court selection a better one  it would also      reassure the Senate and the American people that the process of      selecting a Supreme Court justice has not become politicized     The bipartisan group of 14 Senators      who joined together to avert the nuclear option included the      following in their agreement        We believe that  under Article II  Section 2  of the United States      Constitution  the word Advice speaks to consultation between the      Senate and the President with regard to the use of the Presidents      power to make nominations  We encourage the Executive branch of      government to consult with members of the Senate  both Democratic      and Republican  prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the      Senate for consideration         Such a return to the early practices of our government may well      serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice      and consent process in the Senate        We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions      of the United States Senate that we as Senators seek to uphold   I agree  Bipartisan consultation is      consistent with the traditions of the Senate and would return us to      practices that have served the country well  Our fellow Senators      have history and the well being of the Nation on their side in      urging greater consultation on judicial nominations  They are      right   What is troubling are the recent      reports that the White House plan does not include meaningful      consultation at all  but instead plans a political style campaign      and some sort of preemptive contact to allow them to pretend they      consulted  without anything akin to the kind of meaningful      consultation that this important matter deserves  Partisan      activists supporting the White House boasted last week about a war      chest of upwards of  20 million to be used to crush any opposition      to the White Houses selection  That sounds awfully like      preparations for all out partisan political warfare  If the White      House intends to follow that type of plan  it would be most      unfortunate  unwise and counterproductive    Though the landscape ahead is sown      with the potential for controversy and contention should a vacancy      arise on the Supreme Court  confrontation is unnecessary  Consensus      should be our mutual goal  I would hope that the Presidents      objective will not follow the path he has taken with so many      divisive circuit court nominees and send the Senate a Supreme Court      nominee so polarizing that confirmation is eked out in the narrowest      of margins  This would come at a steep and gratuitous price that      the entire Nation would have to pay in needless division  It would      serve the country better to choose a qualified consensus candidate      who can be broadly supported by the American people and by the      Senate        The process begins with the President  He is the only participant      in the process who can nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court      vacancies  If there is a vacancy  the decisions made in the White      House will determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the      Nation or will divide the Nation  The power to avoid destructive      political warfare over a Supreme Court vacancy is in the hands of      the President  No one in the Senate is spoiling for a fight  Only      one person will decide whether there will be a divisive or a      unifying process and nomination  If consensus is accepted as a      worthy goal  bipartisan consultation will help achieve it  I      believe that is what the American people want  and I know that is      what they deserve         If the President chooses a Supreme Court nominee because of that      nominees ideology or record of activism in the hopes that he or she      will deliver political victories  the President will have done so      knowing that he is starting a confirmation confrontation  The      Supreme Court should not be a wing of the Republican Party  nor      should it be an arm of the Democratic Party  If the right wing      activists who were disappointed that the nuclear option was averted      convince the President to choose a divisive nominee  they will not      prevail without a difficult struggle that will embroil the Senate      and the country  And if they do  what will they have wrought  The      American people will be the losers  The legitimacy of the judiciary      will have suffered a damaging blow from which it may not soon      recover  Such a contest would itself confirm that the Supreme Court      is just another setting for partisan contests and partisan      outcomes  People will perceive the federal courts as places in      which the fix is in         Our Constitution establishes an independent federal judiciary to be      a bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of      power by the political branches  That independence is what makes      our judiciary the model for others around the world  That      independence is at grave risk when a President tries to pack the      courts with activists from either side of the political spectrum       Even if successful  such an effort would lead to decision making      based on politics and would forever diminish public confidence in      our justice system   The American people will cheer if the      President chooses someone who unifies the Nation  This is not the      time and a vacancy on this Supreme Court is not the setting in which      to accentuate the political and ideological division within our      country  In our lifetimes  there has never been a greater need for      a unifying pick for the Supreme Court  At a time when too many      partisans seem fixated on devising strategies to force the Senate to      confirm the most extreme candidates with the least number of votes      possible  Democratic Senators are urging cooperation and      consultation to bring the country together  There is no more      important opportunity than this to lead the Nation in a direction of      cooperation and unity         The independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our      American concept of justice for all  We all want Justices who      exhibit the kind of fidelity to the law that we all respect  We      want them to have a strong commitment to our shared constitutional      values of individual liberties and equal protection  We expect them      to have had a demonstrated record of commitment to equal rights       There are many conservatives who can readily meet these criteria and      who are not rigid ideologues    This is a difficult time for our      country  and we face many challenges  Providing adequate health      care for all Americans  improving the economic prospects of      Americans  defending against threats  the proliferation of nuclear      weapons  the continuing upheaval that afflicts our soldiers in     Iraq  all these are fundamental matters on which we      need to improve  It is my hope that we can work together on many      issues important to the American people  including maintaining a      fair and independent judiciary  I am confident that a smooth      nomination and confirmation process can be developed on a bipartisan      basis if we work together  The American people we represent and      serve are entitled to no less
