       Opening Statement Of Sen  Leahy Executive Business Meeting Nov  8  2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary      Committee     On The Nomination Of      Michael B  Mukasey     To Be Attorney General Of      The United States  November 8  2007 This      debate has boiled down to a discussion of principles that are as      vital to American ideals and to the American soul as is the fleeting      issue of who will act as the Attorney General for the next 14      months  During the Judiciary Committees consideration of this      nomination earlier this week  Senators Kennedy  Kohl  Feingold       Durbin  Cardin  Whitehouse and I made clear the fallacy that would      disregard settled law and discredit Americas role in the struggle      for liberty and human dignity   On the      way to rationalizing support for a particular nominee or a      particular bill  it may be tempting  just this once  we might tell      ourselves  tacitly to abet the arguments of those who want to      define torture down  Whatever the temptation  we must not      rationalize away our core American ideals  the rule of law  and the      principle that in America  no one  not even a President  is above      the law  This      President and Vice President should not be allowed to violate our      obligations under the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva      Conventions  or disregard U S  statutes such as our Detainee      Treatment Act and War Crimes Act  They should not be allowed to      overturn more than 200 years of our Nations reverence for human      rights and moral leadership around the world   The      Administration has compounded its lawlessness by cloaking its      policies and miscalculations under a veil of secrecy  leaving      Congress  the courts  and the American people in the dark about what      they are doing  The President says that we do not torture  but had      his lawyers redefine torture down in secret memos  in fundamental      conflict with American values and law   Again       just yesterday  I wrote to the White House counsel  reiterating my      earlier requests for this Administrations secret  purported      justifications for having Americans engage in waterboarding and      other treatment that would violate our Nations obligations and      values   I agree      with the Generals  the Admirals  and our JAG officers that      waterboarding is torture and is illegal  They write with absolute      clarity  Waterboarding is inhumane  it is torture  and it is      illegal  They also quote the sitting Judge Advocates General of      the military services from our Committees hearing last year in      which they unanimously and unambiguously agreed that waterboarding      is inhumane  illegal and a violation of law   If an      American were waterboarded anywhere in the world  no Senator and no      American would have to know the circumstances and purported      justifications for it before condemning it  Tragically  this      Administration has so twisted Americas role  law and values that      apparently our own State Department is now ordered that it cannot      say that waterboarding of an American is illegal  That is how far      we have sunk  Senior      State Department legal officers are told that waterboarding  which      has been recognized as torture for the last 500 years  is a      technique they cannot rule out as something that a foreign      intelligence service might be justified in using against Americans       Never mind that President Teddy Roosevelt prosecuted Americans      soldiers for this more than 100 years ago  Never mind that we      prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding Americans during      World War II  Never mind what repressive regimes are doing to this      day around the world  It is appalling   When it      comes to our core values  the things that make our country great      and that define Americas place in the world  it does not depend on      the circumstances  America  the great and good Nation that has      been a beacon to the world on human rights  does not torture and      should stand against torture   Torture      should not be what America stands for  Indeed  the better example      is set by the Army Field Manual  which instructs our forces to      consider how we would react if what a soldier was about to do to      someone was done to an American soldier  Sadly  when I cited this      very standard in a written question to Judge Mukasey and asked if it      would be an abuse if a foreign country waterboarded an American  the      nominee sidestepped the question and failed to condemn even the      waterboarding of Americans  In      their recent letter to the nominee  Senators Warner  McCain  and      Graham do not take that approach  They recognize  as I do and as I      hope all Senators do  that  Waterboarding  under any      circumstances  represents a clear violation of U S  law   And      when the Administration and others say that we cannot state whether      America waterboards people because it would tip off our enemies       they have it precisely wrong  That is about as effective as Saddam      Hussein hinting that he had weapons of mass destruction when he did      not in order to impress his enemies  In refusing to say that we do      not waterboard prisoners  we give license to others      When the United States cannot state      unequivocally that waterboarding is torture and illegal and will not      be tolerated  what does that mean for other governments  and what      comfort does that provide the worlds most repressive regimes       Some      have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukaseys personal assurance      that he would enforce a future  new law against waterboarding if      this Congress were to pass one  Unsaid  of course  is the fact that      any such prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this      President  But the real damage of this argument is not its      futility  The real harm is that it presupposes that we do not      already have laws and treaty obligations against waterboarding  In      fact  we do  No Senator should abet this Administrations      legalistic obfuscations by those such as Alberto Gonzales  John Yoo       and David Addington by agreeing that the laws on the books do not      already make waterboarding illegal  We have been properly      prosecuting water torture for more than 100 years   Our laws and our values do not permit this to      be an open question or one that depends on who is doing the      waterboarding  That is a prescription for disaster  That is what      heightens the risks to American citizens and soldiers around the      world and gives repressive regimes comfort  That is something I      will not do  I wish that I could support Judge Mukaseys      nomination  I like Michael Mukasey  But this is an Administration      that has been acting outside the law and an Administration that has      now created a confirmation contortion  When many of us voted to      confirm General Petreas  the Administration turned around and  for      political advantage  tried to claim that when we voted to confirm      the nominee  we also voted for the Presidents war policies  Just      as I do not support this Presidents Iraq policy  I do not support      his torture policy or his views of unaccountability or unlimited      Executive power   No one is more      eager to restore strong leadership and independence to the      Department of Justice than I  What we need most right now is an      Attorney General who believes and understands that there must be      limitations on Executive power  America needs to be certain of the      bedrock principles in our laws and our values that no President and      no American can be authorized to violate  That is why I will vote      no on the Presidents nomination
