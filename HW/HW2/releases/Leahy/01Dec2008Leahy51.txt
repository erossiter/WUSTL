       Senator Leahy s Legislative Health Priorities   Vermont Medical Society   Newsletter   December 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                    Senator Patrick Leahys      Legislative Health Priorities      Vermont Medical Society Newsletter      December 2007       As you listen to the national dialogue about pressing issues facing      our country  the conversation is dominated by discussion of the war      in Iraq and national security  Meanwhile  as gas prices increase      and winter sets in  more people are talking about how expensive it      is to fuel up their car and to heat their home  And after every      increase to monthly health insurance premiums or trip to the doctor       we hear from our family  friends  and neighbors about our expensive      and broken health care system  Finding solutions to any of these      issues is by no means an easy task  but for a long time we as a      country have been talking about solving the health care crisis and I      know that you feel as invested and committed to progress as I do                  Federal and State health programs such as Medicare and Medicaid       along with community health centers  provide a critical safety net      for our elderly and indigent populations  But millions of people      are still falling through the cracks  A significant portion of      those that are uninsured in America have jobs but cannot afford to      purchase insurance through their employers  Though we spend twice      as much per person on health care in America as any other country       forty seven million of our fellow citizens are denied access             Efforts to provide health care coverage for the uninsured on both      the state and national level will only be compounded if we fail to      recognize the need to address new trends in the physician      workforce  In Vermont and other rural areas we continue to see a      shortage of primary care physicians and specialists in      anesthesiology  radiology  and other fields  The same trend is true      for our nursing workforce and many of our allied health      professions  These shortages threaten to impact patient access and      care if we do not begin to reverse them              We are fortunate to have a wonderful quality of life to offer      physicians looking to practice in Vermont  Unfortunately  we also      have to compete with places that can offer higher compensation  The      federal governments downward trend on Medicare reimbursement has      served only to further threaten our physician workforce as doctors      have had to cover the growing gap between the cost of treating      patients and what the government will pay for that care              As the first session of the 110th Congress wraps up  we      are working to stave off a ten percent cut in Medicare reimbursement      for 2008  This has regrettably become an annual event  I have      consistently supported blocking these cuts and this year have      advocated for a two year fix to the Medicare reimbursement formula       If we are successful in this effort  Congress and CMS should have      enough time to implement a plan that provides a better method for      reimbursing physicians              Supporting practicing physicians is important to keeping doctors in      Vermont  On the other side of the equation  we must also expand the      pipeline for producing new generations of doctors  For our state       this means making significant investments in the University of      Vermont College of Medicine and ensuring that it remains one of the      top small medical schools in the country  I have worked with the      College to secure funds for its continual need of updated facilities      and equipment  and am currently working to help the College with new      imaging and surgical facilities              There are multiple other federal programs that I have worked to      protect funding for to ensure we have a vibrant medical school in      Vermont  Increased NIH funding is essential to the Colleges work      and to providing research opportunities for younger doctors  The      Title VII Health Professions Program that funds UVMs AHEC provides      continuing education and loan repayment for practicing physicians      and health career information to young Vermonters  These are just      two examples of how federal programs impact Vermonts physician      workforce             Finally  we must bring our health care system fully into line with      the technological advances of the 21st Century  One of      the easiest advances to visualize is the progression to an      electronic medical record for patients  This hardware and software      comes at a significant cost and  as Vermonts hospitals and      physicians move towards implementing EMRs  we must provide financial      support to ensure that all providers  large and small  are able to      adopt this technology  Over the past three years  I have worked to      secure federal funds for Vermont Information Technology Leaders       Inc   these funds would help providers connect with the health      information exchange             We have already seen health care be a central issue for both parties      on the campaign trail for the 2008 presidential election  That is a      good sign as the electorate is clamoring for fresh ideas and  with a      closely divided Congress  it will be up to the next President to set      the agenda for health care reform  Ultimately  any plan that is put      forward should build on the pillars of our current system to ensure      universal access to quality  affordable health care coverage              We are fortunate to have a dedicated workforce of physicians and      nurses who put their patients care above all  Congress and the      federal government have an important role in supporting the work of      our medical professionals and you can be sure I will continue to      advance the health care priorities of Vermonters         Thank you for this opportunity to contribute to the
