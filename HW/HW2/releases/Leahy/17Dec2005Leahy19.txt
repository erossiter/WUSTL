       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The President s Saturday Radio Address   On The USA PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy     To The Presidents Saturday Radio Address     On The USA PATRIOT Act     Saturday  Dec  17  2005  Following is      the reaction of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   ranking member  Senate      Judiciary Committee  chief Senate sponsor of the original USA      PATRIOT Act of 2001  and a former prosecutor  to the Presidents      Saturday radio address on the PATRIOT Act and on efforts led by      Leahy and others in the Senate to make improvements in the proposed      rewrite of the PATRIOT Act  which is now pending before Congress   Many of us who      want improvements in the PATRIOT Act worked hard to help write and      enact the original law in 2001  We want to make sure these tools      are used against terrorists and not abused to undermine the hard won      rights that are the heritage of every American  Why not go the      extra mile for a PATRIOT Act the American people can fully support       knowing that it has sufficient safeguards for their liberty       Threats to our      freedoms are as current and as disturbing as this mornings      headlines  Chairman Specter has pledged hearings on the domestic      eavesdropping that the President has authorized  and I support his      determination to examine these revelations  Electronic surveillance      is an important law enforcement and intelligence gathering tool  but      it can and must be done lawfully  in accordance with our laws and      Constitution  Fear mongering      and false choices do little to advance either the security or      liberty of Americans  Republican and Democratic senators joined      together this week to say we can do better to protect Americans      liberties while ensuring our national security is as strong as it      can be  Every single senator    Republican and Democratic    voted      in July to mend and extend the PATRIOT Act  That bipartisan      solution dissolved when the Bush Administration and Republican      congressional leaders rewrote the bill in ways that fall short in      protecting basic civil liberties and then tried to ram it through      Congress as an all or nothing proposition   I have joined      with senators of both parties in an effort to enact a short term      extension so that we can keep working to improve the bill  For the      Bush Administration and Republican congressional leaders to allow      the PATRIOT Act to expire would be irresponsible  Instead of      playing partisan politics and setting up false attack ads  they      should join in trying to improve the law  We ask the President and      Republican leaders to reconsider their opposition to briefly      extending the expiring provisions of the PATRIOT Act until these      improvements are made  Most      importantly  our government must follow the laws and respect the      Constitution while it protects Americans security and liberty  The      Bush Administration seems to believe it is above the law  It is not      and neither is any administration  Our nation is a democracy       founded on the principles of balanced government  We need to      restore checks and balances in this country to protect us all and      all that we hold dear
