       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh     April 27  2006 Listed on the      Committees agenda today is the nomination of Brett Kavanaugh  a      young Republican lawyer with a relatively short career  whose ABA      rating over time has been downgraded  I have many concerns about      his nomination to the second most important court in the Country       the Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit   Most immediately       I am concerned that this Committee has fallen short of the kind of      careful scrutiny it should apply to such an important nomination       especially one whose career is dominated by partisan and political      positions  Not only did Mr  Kavanaugh fail to provide complete and      forthright answers to the Committee  he delayed providing any      answers at all to written questions for seven months   Since Mr       Kavanaughs renomination  new and significant questions have arisen      that deserve answers relating to his knowledge and involvement in      the Presidents illegal domestic spying program  controversial      detainee policies  and the recent scandals plaguing this White      House  All Democratic Members of this Committee have twice asked      for another hearing in connection with this nomination  That is      hardly without precedent  and in this case  completely justified  We initially made      this request in a letter on May 11  2005  Since we sent that      letter  Mr  Kavanughs nomination was returned by the Senate to the      White House at the end of the first session of this Congress  We      were hopeful that the President would consult with Senators and      local officials in the District of Columbia on a more appropriate      nominee but  instead  he renominated Mr  Kavanaugh at the beginning      of this session  On March 3  2006  we again sent a letter      requesting a hearing on the Kavanaugh nomination  I ask that copies      of those letters be included in the record   These requests      were made because Mr  Kavanaugh failed to provide meaningful and      substantive responses to many of the questions posed to him      previously  His evasive and incomplete answers were even more      troubling because of his seven month delay in answering them       A new hearing is      necessary also to explore new developments regarding this      nomination  As Associate White House Counsel and staff secretary       Mr  Kavanaugh has served in the inner circle of the White House at a      time when many controversial policies and decisions were being      considered  Senators have not had a chance to question him about      his role in connection with those matters  For example  what was      Mr  Kavanaughs role in connection with the warrantless spying on      Americans  What was his involvement in the policies affecting      detainee treatment and interrogation  What was his involvement in      connection with military tribunals  torture  and rendition of      prisoners to other countries  Given the      scandals now plaguing the White House  it is important to know      whether Mr  Kavanaugh has had a role in connection with the actions      of Jack Abramoff  Michael Scanlon  David Safavian  the matters being      investigated in connection with the Plame matter  and many other      matters  The wall of secrecy that the Administration has maintained      has proven a barrier for this Committee in being able to carefully      consider this Administration insider for a lifetime appointment to      an important federal judicial position   Committee      consideration of this nomination is inappropriate at this time  It      comes in advance of a hearing and thorough understanding of the      matters on which Mr  Kavanaugh has been involved  The      Administration knows why it is rewarding this person with this      nomination  The Senate  and certainly the Democratic Senators on      this Committee  do not
