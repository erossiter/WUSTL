       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  An Examination Of The Call To Censure  The President                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee Hearing On    An Examination Of The Call To Censure The President    March 31  2006     This is our     fourth hearing to consider the Presidents domestic spying     activities  Regrettably  this hearing  like the two that preceded     it  is not an oversight hearing  After this hearing  we will have     heard from a total of 20 witnesses  Of those  only one had any     knowledge of the spying activities beyond what he had read in the     newspapers  That witness was Attorney General Gonzales  who flatly     refused to tell us anything beyond those facts the President has     publicly confirmed  nothing more   What the     President has publicly confirmed is that  for more than four years      he has secretly instructed intelligence officers at the National     Security Administration to eavesdrop on the conversations of     American citizens in the United States without following the     procedures set forth in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act      After its secret     domestic spying activities were revealed  the Administration offered     two legal justifications for the decision not to follow FISA      First  it asserted a broad doctrine of presidential inherent     authority to ignore the laws passed by Congress when prosecuting     the war on terror  In other words  the rule of law is suspended      and the President is above the law  for the uncertain and no doubt     lengthy duration of the undefined war on terror   Second  the     Administration asserted that in the Authorization for the Use of     Military Force  or AUMF  which makes no reference to wiretapping      Congress unconsciously authorized warrantless wiretaps that FISA     expressly forbids even in wartime  That is not what we in Congress     said or intended   Because the     Republican controlled Congress has not conducted real oversight  and     because the attempts this Committee has made at oversight have been     stonewalled by the Administration  we do not know the extent of the     Administrations domestic spying activities  But we know that the     Administration has secretly spied on Americans without attempting to     comply with FISA  And we know that the legal justifications it has     offered for doing so  which have admittedly evolved over time are     patently flimsy  I therefore have no hesitation in condemning the     President for secretly and systematically violating the law  I have     no doubt that such a conclusion will be historys verdict  History will     evaluate how diligently the Republican controlled Congress performed     the oversight duties envisaged by the Founders  As of this moment      historys judgment of the diligence and resolve of the     Republican Controlled Congress is unlikely to be kind   Our witnesses     today will address whether censure is an appropriate sanction for     those violations  I am inclined to believe that it is  If     oversight were to reveal that when the President launched the     program  he had been formally advised by the Department of Justice     that it would be lawful  that kind of bad advice would not make his     actions lawful  but might at least provide something of an excuse      If  on the other     hand  he knowingly chose to flout the law and then commissioned a     spurious legal rationalization years later after he was found out      he should bear full personal responsibility  To quote Senator     Graham from an earlier point in his congressional service  when he     bore the weighty role of a House Manager in a presidential     impeachment trial  We are not a nation of men or kings  we are a     nation of laws  I have said     before that this Committee needs to see any formal legal opinions     from this Administration that address the legality of NSA practices     and procedures with respect to electronic surveillance  The     American people have a right to know whether or not their President     knowingly chose to flout the law when he instructed the NSA to spy     on them   That is why our     next step should be to subpoena the opinions  We know the President     broke the law  we should find out why
