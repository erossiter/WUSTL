       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S  214  Preserving United States   Attorney Indpendence Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Closing Statement      Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On S  214  Preserving United States Attorney Independence Act Of      2007     March 20  2007      In a few minutes the Senate will have      an opportunity to begin restoring accountability and checks and      balances to our Government  We should pass the Preserving United      States Attorney Independence Act  S 214  We need to close the      loophole exploited by the Department of Justice and the White House      that contributed to the mass firings of United States Attorneys       When we roll back this excessive authority given the Attorney      General by the PATRIOT Act reauthorization  we will take a step      toward restoring the independence of federal law enforcement in this      country  We will be acting to reverse one more incident of      overstepping by an earlier rubberstamp Congress  which all too often      was all too willing to dance to the tune of a power hungry White      House    The Attorney General is right that      mistakes were made  It was a mistake to conduct this mass firing      to send the message to our United States Attorneys that they had      better act like loyal Bushies rather than objective law      enforcement officers  It was a mistake to malign the reputations of      these officials by contending that the firings were prompted by      their badly performing their law enforcement responsibilities  It      was a mistake to mislead the Senate Judiciary Committee in hearings      and Senators in phone calls and meetings about the firings  It was      a mistake to give the Attorney General the unlimited authority to      fill these critical posts with his selections and without the advice      and consent of the Senate  But most of all  it was a mistake to      inject crassly partisan objections into the selection  evaluation       firing and replacement of the top federal law enforcement officers      around the country    In the same way that any employer has      the power to hire  we understand that people cannot be fired because      they are Catholic or because of their race or because they are a      whistleblower  The power of employment is not without limit  It      can be abused  When it is abused in connection with political      influence over federal law enforcement the American people and their      representatives in Congress have a right to be concerned  We need to      get to the bottom of this situation  We need the facts  not more      spin  and not another concocted cover story    The United States Department of      Justice must be above politics  The Attorney General of the United      States has to ensure the independence of federal law enforcement      from political influence  The Department of Justice should serve      the American people by making sure the law is enforced without fear      or favor  It should not be a political arm of the White House   One of the finest Attorneys General of      the United States ever to serve was Robert H  Jackson  Of course       he subsequently served as one of our most admired Justices on the      United States Supreme Court and as the principal prosecutor at the      International Military Tribunal for German war criminals in      Nuremberg after World War II  In April 1940  as a new Attorney      General  he spoke to the United States Attorneys from across the      country assembled in the Great Hall at the Department of Justice in      Washington about the responsibilities of being a federal      prosecutor  I think it appropriate to today to recall his      guidance  His words serve to show the Senate and the American      people how wrong this Administrations practices are and how far off      the mark  Attorney General Jackson said        The prosecutor has more control over life  liberty  and reputation      than any other person in America  His discretion is tremendous             While the prosecutor at his best is one of the most beneficent      forces in our society  when he acts from malice or other base      motives  he is one of the worst                       Because of this immense power to strike at citizens  not with mere      individual strength  but with all the force of government itself       the post of Federal District Attorney from the very beginning has      been safeguard by presidential appointment  requiring confirmation      of the Senate of the United States  You are thus required to win an      expression of confidence in your character by both the legislative      and the executive branches of the government before assuming the      responsibilities of a federal prosecutor        Your responsibility in your several districts for law enforcement      and for its methods cannot be wholly surrendered to Washington  and      ought not to be assumed by a centralized Department of Justice  It      is an unusual and rare instance in which the local District Attorney      should be superseded in the handling of litigation  except where he      requests help of Washington                      If the prosecutor is obliged to choose his cases  it follows that he      can choose his defendants  Therein is the most dangerous power of      the prosecutor  that he will pick people that he thinks he should      get  rather than pick cases that need to be prosecuted               It is in this realmin which the prosecutor picks some person      whom he dislikes or desires to embarrass  or selects some group of      unpopular persons and then looks for an offense  that the greatest      danger of abuse of prosecuting power lies  It is here that law      enforcement becomes personal  and the real crime becomes that of      being unpopular with the predominant or governing group  being      attached to the wrong political views  or being personally obnoxious      to or in the way of the prosecutor himself        In times of fear or hysteria political  racial  religious  social       and economic groups  often from the best of motives  cry for the      scalps of individuals or groups because they do not like their      views        Those who are in office are apt to regard as      subversive the activities of any of those who would bring about a      change of administration         I ask that a copy of Attorney General Jacksons full statement be      included in the Record following my remarks
