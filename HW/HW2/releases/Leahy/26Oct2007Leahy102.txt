       Sen  Leahy Presses White House For Torture Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Presses White      House For Torture Documents  October 26  2007           WASHINGTON       Friday  Oct  26  2007   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday sent a letter to White House Counsel      Fred Fielding renewing requests for full disclosure of the      Administrations policies on torture and interrogation techniques      for detainees  Earlier this week  the White House provided Leahy      with four previously undisclosed documents  including one classified      document  relevant to the Administrations policies on torture prior      to the tenure of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  Leahy      has sought documents from the White House and Department of Justice      in order to define the Administrations legal policy on torture and      interrogation                      October 25  2007              Mr  Fred Fielding  Esq        Counsel to the President       Office of the Counsel to the President       The White House       1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW       Washington  DC 20530              Dear Mr  Fielding               I appreciate your providing Senator Specter and me several of the      documents we have requested relevant to the treatment and      interrogation of detainees  The release of these documents restarts      the incremental process of providing necessary information to      Congress and to the American people about the Administrations legal      justifications and policies with regard to torture and      interrogation  I have long called for full disclosure of the      Administrations legal opinions in this area and have been      frustrated by continued stonewalling  This release represents a      step in the right direction               This is only a first step  however  I remain deeply troubled by the      Administrations attempts to justify the use of harsh interrogation      techniques and even torture  and I intend to get to the bottom of      what this Administrations legal policy has been on this issue  and      what it is today  One of the documents you provided this week  per      your unclassified cover letter  is a classified March 13  2003       Memorandum for William J  Haynes  General Counsel  Department of      Defense  from John C  Yoo  Deputy Assistant Attorney General  Office      of Legal Counsel  This memorandum should also be provided in      non classified form as completely as possible consistent with      national security requirements  To the extent possible  this      document should become part of a frank and public discussion on      these crucial issues               Further  the Committee does not yet have a complete picture of the      Administrations historic position on the legal basis and standards      for detention  transfer  and interrogation in connection with      counter terrorism efforts  It is important that you share with the      Senate Judiciary Committee all other legal opinions on these issues      from the Office of Legal Counsel and elsewhere in the Department of      Justice and the Administration               Finally  and most importantly  these documents aid our understanding      only as to the Administrations policy until the beginning of      Attorney General Gonzales tenure in February 2005  You have      provided to us some documents demonstrating the Administrations      expansive and disturbing position on torture and related issues in      2002 and 2003  as well as documents from 2004 and very early 2005      withdrawing and minimizing those previous positions  However  we      have not yet seen the 2005 memoranda recently reported in the  New York Times  which      apparently authorize the use by the Central Intelligence Agency of      combinations of cruel and extreme interrogation techniques and      indicate that enumerated harsh techniques do not constitute cruel       inhuman  and degrading treatment of detainees  These documents fall      squarely within the scope of requests that I and other Senators have      made  including my November 15  2006  request to Attorney General      Gonzales for any and all Department of Justice directives       memoranda  and or guidance  regarding CIA detention and or      interrogation methods               I would ask that you promptly respond to the following questions and      document requests  many of which I and others have made on numerous      previous occasions               1  Please produce any and all Department of Justice      directives  memoranda  and or guidance  including any and all      attachments to such documents  regarding detention and or      interrogation methods by the Central Intelligence Agency  the      military  or any other component of the United States government       including but not limited to the two memoranda identified by the  New York Times on      October 4  2007  as well as the August 2002 Memorandum from the      Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel to the CIA General      Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods  the 2nd      Bybee memo                 2  Please provide a non classified version of the March 13       2003  Memorandum for William J  Haynes  General Counsel  Department      of Defense  from John C  Yoo  Deputy Assistant Attorney General       Office of Legal Counsel  to the extent possible consistent with      national security requirements                3  Please produce any and all documents produced by the      Department of Justice regarding the legality of specific      interrogation tactics  and the legal basis for detention and      transfer of terrorism suspects  and the applicability of federal      criminal prohibitions on torture and abuse               4  Please produce any and all Department of Justice      documents that interpret  or advise on  the scope of interrogation      practices permitted and prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act or      the Military Commissions Act                5  Please state which of the documents produced in      accordance with the above requests remain in effect and which have      been withdrawn  replaced or modified  Please produce any and all      revisions or modifications               6  Please produce an index of any and all documents relating      to investigations and or reviews conducted by the Department of      Justice into detainee abuse by U S  military or civilian personnel      in Guantanamo Bay  Abu Ghraib prison  or elsewhere               I look forward to your responses               Sincerely                PATRICK LEAHY        Chairman
