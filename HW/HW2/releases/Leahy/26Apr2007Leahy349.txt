                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy Urges Restoration of Habeas     Corpus Rights Judiciary Chairman Testifies Before Senate Armed Services Committee    On Repealing Provisions Of Military Commissions Act   WASHINGTON      Thursday  April 26     Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    chairman of the     Senate Judiciary Committee  today testified before the Senate Armed     Services Committee on the need to restore habeas corpus protections      Leahy and Senator Arlen Specter  R Pa    ranking member of the Judiciary     Committee  introduced the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007  S  185      earlier this Congress  The bipartisan bill would restore these     fundamental protections by repealing provisions of the Military     Commissions Act of 2006    Testimony Of Senator     Patrick Leahy    Before Hearing Of The Senate Armed Services Committee    April 26  2007    I thank Chairman Levin and Ranking Member     McCain for granting my request to testify before the Senate Armed     Services Committee this morning  and for convening this important     hearing  The way that we treat people who are detained by our     government outside of the judicial system  and the laws we pass     governing those detainees  provides a window into our own values  our     own traditions  and our own identity as a country  This issue is     central to the way America is viewed in the world and the way we view     ourselves as a nation    Unfortunately  the image of America     created by our treatment of detainees and by laws we have passed on this     issue is not the kind of image that I  or many of you  would have     preferred to present to the world  Last years Military Commissions Act        reported by this Committee and then altered at the request of the     White House before Senate passage    was a mistake of historic     proportions    It is on the elimination of habeas corpus     rights  that I would like to focus this morning  Speaking as an     American  a Senator and as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  I     believe that it was the worst of the unfortunate changes made by that     hastily passed legislation in the weeks before an election   Senator Specter and I fought hard to     remove the disastrous habeas provision from the bill and  with the     support of Senator Levin and many others  came within a couple of votes     of prevailing  I hope that we will work together in a bipartisan way to     correct this historic wrong  I anticipate that the Judiciary Committee     will hold a hearing on this issue next month  With the help of Chairman     Levin and others  I hope we can fix this serious and corrosive problem     by this summer   As Justice Scalia wrote in the Hamdi case      The very core of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of     separated powers has been freedom from indefinite imprisonment at the     will of the Executive  The remedy that secures that most basic of     freedoms is habeas corpus  It provides a check against arbitrary     detentions and constitutional violations  It guarantees an opportunity     to go to court  with the aid of a lawyer  to prove ones innocence       This fundamental protection was rolled     back in an unprecedented and unnecessary way in the Military Commissions     Act  The Military Commissions Act eliminated that right  permanently      for any non citizen labeled an enemy combatant    even if the detainee     is awaiting determination of that status  The sweep of its habeas     provision goes far beyond the few hundred detainees currently held at     Guantanamo Bay  and includes an estimated 12 million lawful permanent     residents in the United States today  These are lawful residents of the     United States  people who work and pay taxes  people who abide by our     laws and should be entitled to fair treatment    It applies to anyone who is visiting the     United States and other legal immigrants as well  These are people we     have traditionally welcomed to our shores and invited to experience the     freedoms that made America the most admired country in the world  This     new law means that any of these people can be detained  forever  thats     right  forever    without any ability to challenge their detention in     federal court  or anywhere else  simply on the Governments say so that     they are awaiting determination as to whether they are enemy combatants       Last fall  I spelled out a nightmare     scenario about a hard working legal permanent resident who makes an     innocent donation to a charity to help poor people around the world in     the finest American tradition  If that charity is secretly suspected by     the Government to fund critics of the United States Government  that     innocent act could lead to an indefinite and unchallengeable     incarceration  On the basis of a charitable donation and perhaps a     report of suspicious behavior from an overzealous neighbor or from     information secretly obtained from a cursory review of the persons     library borrowings  the permanent resident could be brought in for     questioning  denied a lawyer  confined  and even tortured  Such a     person would have no recourse in the courts for years  for decades      forever    This is the kind of disappearance that     America has criticized and condemned in parts of the world ruled by     autocratic regimes  That is not America  And that is not the image of     America we want the world to have    Many people viewed this kind of nightmare     scenario as fanciful  but sadly it was not  Indeed  last November just     after enactment of these provisions  the scenario I spelled out was     confirmed by the Department of Justice in a legal brief submitted in     federal court in Virginia  The Justice Department  in a brief to     dismiss a detainees habeas case  said that the Military Commissions Act     allows the Government to detain any non citizen designated as an enemy     combatant without giving that person any ability to challenge his     detention in court  And this is not just at Guantanamo Bay for those     who this Administration likes to call the worst of the worst  The     Justice Department said it is true even for someone arrested and     imprisoned in the United States    We have removed a vital check that our     legal system provides against the Government arbitrarily detaining     people for life without charge  This is wrong  It is     unconstitutional  It is un American    A group of four distinguished admirals and     generals  who have served as senior military lawyers  argued     passionately for fixing this problem in a letter they sent to me last     month  They wrote  In discarding habeas corpus  we are jettisoning one     of the core principles of our nation precisely when we should be     showcasing to the world our respect for the rule of law and basic     rights  These are the characteristics that make our nation great      These are the values our men and women in uniform are fighting to     preserve   We should take steps to ensure that our     enemies can be brought to justice  I introduced a bill to do that back     in 2002  as did Senator Specter  when we each proposed to establish     military commissions  Establishing appropriate military commissions is     not the question  But what we must revisit and correct is the     suspension of the writ of habeas corpus for millions of legal immigrants     and others  denying their right to challenge indefinite detention on the     Governments say so     It is from strength that     America should defend our values and our way of life  It is from the     strength of our freedoms  our Constitution and the rule of law that we     can prevail  We should not be legislating from fear  We     can ensure our security without giving up our liberty     I will keep     working on this issue until we restore the checks and balances that are     fundamental to preserving the liberties that define us as a nation
