Patrick Leahy      On The Nomination Of Thomas B  Griffith      To The United States Court Of Appeals For The D C  Circuit     April 14  2005  The Committee today is scheduled to      debate and vote on the nomination of Thomas Griffith to the United      States Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit  The D C  Circuit is      an especially important court in our nation s      judicial system for its broad caseload covering issues as varied as      reviews of federal regulation on the environment  workplace safety       telecommunications  consumer protection  and other critical federal      statutory and constitutional rights  The White House has rejected      all Democratic urging to work together on consensus nominees for      this court and refused to engage in consultation  That is too bad      and totally unnecessary    The nomination of Mr  Griffith to this      court is one I cannot support  The Chairman gave him the      opportunity to come forward at a hearing in March  at which time I      noted that unlike the many anonymous Republican holds and pocket      filibusters that kept scores of President Clintons qualified      judicial nominees from moving forward  the concerns about Mr       Griffith were no secret  He knows full well that I think he has not      honored the rule of law by practicing law in Utah for five years      without ever bothering to fulfill his obligation to become a member      of the Utah Bar  He has by now obtained a Utah      drivers license and pays Utah State taxes  but he is not a member      of the Bar despite practicing law there since 2000  And according      to his answers to my questions  he has taken no steps to abide by      the law and become a member  He was also derelict in his duty      toward the D C  Bar  and less than forthcoming with us on questions      related to his failure to pay his dues to that organization    Mr  Griffith has so far foregone 10      opportunities to take the Utah bar exam while applying      for and maintaining his position as General Counsel at Brigham Young      University  This conscious and continuous disregard of basic legal      obligations is not consistent with the respect for law we should      demand of lifetime appointments to the federal courts  Neither has      Mr  Griffith yet satisfactorily explained why he obstinately refuses      to take the Utah Bar  He has hidden behind a curtain of shifting      explanations  thrown up smokescreens of letters from personal      friends and political allies  and refused to acknowledge what we all      know to be true  Mr  Griffith should have taken the bar    This is not Mr  Griffiths first or      only bar problem  He was suspended for failing to pay his D C  Bar      dues and then misled this Committee on the facts of that suspension      as well as other late payments  Contrary to his testimony  it seems      that the only year Mr  Griffith actually paid his D C  Bar dues on      time was in 1995  He confessed his original suspension and his      other late payments in a letter to the Committee he sent before his      misleading testimony last year  Two suspensions from the practice      of law in two years  three late or non existent payments in four      years  and an attempt to mischaracterize this embarrassing record      from the Committee are hardly the same as the innocent sounding      oversight Mr  Griffith sought to present    What may be more disturbing than Mr       Griffiths failure to pay his D C  dues  is his lack of concern      about the implications of having practiced law in D C  without      proper licensure  When I asked him if he had notified his clients      or law firm from the period he was suspended  he brushed me off       telling me that his membership in good standing was reinstated once      he paid his dues  Of course  that ignored my real question about      the ramifications of having been suspended for two separate periods      totaling more than two years  Clients and partners should be      notified and courts should be contacted    The Department of Justice apparently      agrees that suspension for failure to pay bar dues is a serious      matter  Recent newspaper reports say that the Departments Office      of Professional Responsibility takes such a matter seriously enough      to have opened an investigation into the case of a longtime career      attorney there who  like Mr  Griffith  was suspended from the D C       Bar because he did not pay his dues  Unlike in Mr  Griffiths case       the Department is concerned enough about such a suspension that they      are filing notices with the courts in every case this attorney      worked on during the period of his suspension  notifying them that      he was not authorized to practice at the time  Practicing law      without a license is a serious matter    The facts surrounding Mr  Griffiths      nonexistent membership in the Utah Bar are even more troubling  He      began his service as Assistant to the President and General Counsel      of BYU in 2000  At that time he was not a member of the  Utah bar  he was suspended from membership in the Bar of the      District of Columbia  and he was an inactive member of the North      Carolina Bar  But  as is clear from Mr  Griffiths own testimony       for the last five years  as part of his responsibilities as BYU      General Counsel he has been practicing law in Utah   So  what made Mr  Griffith think he      could practice law without being a member of the Utah Bar  Mr       Griffith testified that  it was my understanding that in  Utah in house counsel need not be licensed in Utah  provided      that when legal advice is given  it is done so in close association      with active members of the Utah Bar  It was an interesting answer      considering there is no such general counsel exception in Utah and      there never has been  He could not point to any Utah statute or Utah      Supreme Court Pronouncement allowing this behavior because it does      not exist as a matter of law  Moreover  his predecessor at BYU and      the general counsels of the other universities in Utah are all      members of the Utah bar    Mr  Griffith has never been able to      identify who it was at the Utah Bar who he claims advised him that      he did not need to join the Bar  The practical matter of joining      the bar is a clear and logical conclusion  not just to me as I sit      here today but it was also clear to the General Counsel for the Utah      Bar and it was clear to a second year law student  We have all told      Mr  Griffith to take the bar and he has ignored all of us     The General Counsel of the Utah Bar      put it in writing  Katherine Fox  wrote to Mr  Griffith on May 14       2003  telling him she was surprised he thought there was a general      counsel exception  and explained that there was no way under his      circumstances to waive into the Utah Bar without taking the bar      exam  In plain  simple to understand words  Ms  Fox instructed Mr       Griffith to take the bar examination at the earliest opportunity       This response from a career lawyer in the Utah Bar made before      political pressure was ratcheted up to defend a Republican nominee       seemed pretty straightforward to me    It is unfortunate that Mr  Griffith      and his supporters have defied logic and reason by turning Ms  Foxs      letter upside down in an attempt to characterize it as something      other than it is  Her recommendation that he closely associate      himself with a Utah lawyer until he takes the bar and becomes a      member of the bar was not offered as an indefinite safe harbor that      permits him to violate Utah law  He would have us believe that Ms       Foxs letter is not an admonition to him to follow the rules  but an      invitation to flout them for as long as it suits him  This is the      kind of reinterpretation in ones own interest that characterizes      judicial activism of the worst sort when employed by a judge     There are more reasons for serious      concern about Mr  Griffiths fitness to be a member of the D C       Circuit Court  His judgment is brought into serious question by his      views on Title IX of our civil rights laws  This charter of      fundamental fairness has been the engine for overcoming      discrimination against women in education and the growth of womens      athletics  I urge all Senators to think about our daughters and      granddaughters  the pride they felt when the U S       womens soccer team began winning gold medals and World Cups  the      joy they see in young women with the opportunity to play basketball      and ski and compete and grow    With the recent reinterpretation of      Title IX being imposed by administrative fiat in ways that will no      doubt be challenged through the courts we may now see why the Bush      Administration sees the appointment of Mr  Griffith to the D C       Circuit Court as a priority  His narrow views on Title IX were      unveiled during his efforts as a member of the Bush Administration      Secretary of Educations Commission on Opportunity in      Athletics  to constrict the impact of Title IX  Does anyone doubt      that he would argue that the Bush Administrations revision through      regulations should be upheld   The United States Supreme Court      recently decided that whistleblowers are protected in the Title IX      context  That was a close  5 4 decision  in which Justice OConnor      wrote for the majority  These recent legal developments regarding      Title IX serve to remind us how important each of these lifetime      appointments to the federal courts is  In light of the record on      this nomination  I am not prepared to take a chance on it and will      vote against                  Opening      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Executive Business Meeting     April 14  2005  The Chairman and I have worked hard to      try to forge a bipartisan compromise on legislation to compensate      asbestos victims  I am pleased that our proposal is already      receiving letters of support from unions  like the UAW  veterans      groups and others  I ask to include some of those letters in the      record    As compared with the legislative      proposal from the last Congress  our bipartisan proposal would      include higher compensation awards for victims  no subrogation by      insurers of victim awards  more front end funding  medical screening      for high risk workers  annual review for sunset of the trust if it      is not paying claims  more transparency  and Senator Feinsteins      expedited settlement process for victims dying within a year        This is a difficult problem  one the      Supreme Court has repeatedly urged Congress to tackle  and one on      which I have been working for more than four years  Other Senators      on the Committee are reviewing the draft language  We may soon be      ready to proceed and begin considering this matter before the      Committee    Today we should be able to make      progress on other bipartisan legislative matters  Senator Feinstein      has led us in a bipartisan effort to better protect unaccompanied      children who come to this country  Her bill has previously been      reported by this Committee  It was listed and held over on March      17  I hope and trust that all Senators are ready to proceed with      S 119 today and that it will be favorably reported to the Senate        The NOPEC bill  S 555  also has      previously been considered and reported  It is another bipartisan      effort led by Senators DeWine and Kohl that many of us have      cosponsored  With gasoline prices at record highs and rising  it is      long overdue for us to pass this bill and provide legal tools to the      Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission to enforce  U S  antitrust laws against OPEC    Earlier this week  the Senate acted to      confirm Judge Paul Crotty  the 205th judicial nomination      confirmation  by a vote of 95 0  We have also reported the      nomination of Michael Seabright of Hawaii unanimously      and we look forward to a hearing soon on the nomination of Brian      Sandoval of Nevada  These nominations demonstrate  as we have more      than 200 times over the last four years  how to make progress in      filling judicial vacancies  This week  the Senate Democratic Leader      and I wrote to the President offering our cooperation in identifying      highly qualified  consensus nominees for the 28 judicial vacancies      in connection with which the President has failed to send the Senate      a nominee    Finally  as we conclude Victims Week       I want to thank all Senators for supporting our efforts in the      budget resolution to protect and preserve the Crime Victims Fund      from the Presidents proposed rescission  That trust fund  which      arises from criminal fines and penalties and not tax dollars  is one      we created to provide stability for victims assistance and      compensation programs  It should not be raided  Its commitment      should be honored  The next step is the appropriations process  and      I invite all Senators to join the request that Senator Crapo will      soon be making  by letter  to the Appropriations Committee    I will have a separate statement in      connection with the Griffith nomination when we take      that matter up for consideration
