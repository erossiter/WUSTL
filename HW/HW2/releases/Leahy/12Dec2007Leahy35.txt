       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Senator Gregg s Amendment About Medical   Malpractice Caps For Rural Woman And Children                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On Senator Gregg s Amendment About Medical      Malpractice   Caps For Rural Woman And Children   December 12  2007        I oppose the amendment offered by Senator Gregg which would limit      the legal rights that rural women and children are eligible to      receive when they are severely injured in our health care system       Rather than providing protections for rural women and children  this      amendment would likely lead to a lower standard of care by treating      them differently than all other patients in the country             The subject matter of this legislation falls squarely within the      jurisdiction of the Judiciary Committee  This amendment would      overturn state laws regarding the statute of limitations and limit      the legal rights of our most vulnerable citizens  Nothing remotely      related to this novel legal treatment for severely injured rural      women and children has been debated or discussed in the Judiciary      Committee             This amendment does nothing to protect rural victims of medical      malpractice and nothing to prevent the serious injuries of      malpractice in the first place  Damages caps  such as the one in      the pending amendment  would arbitrarily limit compensation that the      most seriously injured patients are able to receive             The central truth of the troubles with malpractice insurance is that      it is a problem in the insurance industry  not the tort system       High malpractice insurance premiums are not the direct result of      malpractice lawsuit verdicts  They are the result of investment      decisions by the insurance companies  and of business models geared      toward ever increasing profits  as well as the cyclical hardening of      the liability insurance market         Instead of blaming lawyers and the victims of medical malpractice       we should look at the special treatment Federal law currently      bestows on the insurance industry  a blanket exemption from federal      antitrust laws  Our antitrust laws are the beacon of good      competition practice and  when they are followed  consumers benefit      through lower prices  more choices and better services  When the      insurance industry operates outside the structures of the antitrust      laws and is allowed to collude to set rates  our healthcare system       our physicians and their patients  suffer          Earlier this year I introduced the bipartisan Insurance Industry      Competition Act  S  618   along with Senators Specter  Lott  Reid       and Landrieu  This legislation would assure that malpractice      insurers and others could not artificially raise premiums and reduce      benefits through collusion  This is a responsible solution to      ensure competitive pricing  putting the burden on rural victims of      medical malpractice is not              Arbitrarily capping damages available to rural women and children      will not solve the flawed medical malpractice insurance market  The      problem at hand deserves thoughtful and collaborative consideration      in the Judiciary Committee to achieve a sensible solution that is      fair to patients and that supports our medical professionals in      their ability to practice quality health care             Unfortunately  the partisan amendment before us is not designed for      creating a solution to a serious problem
