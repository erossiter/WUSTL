       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Regulatory Preemption  Are   Federal Agencies Usurping Congressional And State Authority                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Regulatory Preemption      Are Federal Agencies Usurping Congressional And State Authority      September 12  2007     Today the Committee focuses on a little known abuse of Executive     authority that threatens devastating consequences for American     consumers  Diana Levine was a successful musician in Vermont  She and     her husband performed and recorded childrens music  A few years ago      she sought medical treatment at a local clinic for nausea and was     injected with an antihistamine  A subsequent infection resulted in     gangrene and  tragically  Diana had to have her arm amputated   She filed a common law negligence claim at her local courthouse     against the drugs manufacturer  A jury awarded her  2 4 million in     economic damages and  5 million in non economic damages for her     life altering injuries  The drug company defendant appealed  The Vermont     Supreme Court upheld the verdict and judgment upon review   This tragic case demonstrates how our civil justice system can work      It also reveals a practice by this Administration to usurp laws through     federal regulations at the expense of consumers  In this case  the drug     company has not accepted the jury findings and decisions of the Vermont     courts  Instead  it is seeking review from the United States Supreme     Court because it argues that federal regulation of the drugs label     should prevent even the filing of the suit for these injuries   In this case  the Vermont Supreme Court held that the FDA labeling     rules create only minimum requirements  and that the rules are not     intended to and do not immunize drug companies from liability  I agree     with the Vermont Supreme Court  But I fear that some on the United     States Supreme Court will follow the lead of the Bush Administration and     try to throw Diana out of court    just as it did Lilly Ledbetter last     year in a terribly cramped legal opinion written by Justice Alito that     prevented redress for employment discrimination   Dianas story illustrates how an obscure legal theory called implied     preemption is being invoked to shield corporations from culpability and     prevent injured Americans from obtaining redress for their injuries   Todays hearing will examine the Bush Administrations efforts to     assist corporations in this effort and override State laws that protect     Americans  Just yesterday  a judge appointed by this President struck     down a New York City law requiring fast food supposedly conflicted with     federal regulations  Ironically  President Bush once told a group of     governors that the role of the federal government is not to impose its     will on states and local communities       its to empower the states     and people and local communities to be able to realize the vast     potential of this country  That rhetoric rings hollow when the record     shows clearly his Administrations attempt to grant corporate defendants     blanket civil immunity by aggressively preempting State law in the     course of issuing administrative regulations   In addition to concerns about the Administrations actions     threatening principles of federalism  Senator Specter and I joined to     voice our concern about how the Administrations efforts in this regard     violate powers assigned to Congress  On November 17  2005  we wrote to     the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration about a     proposed agency rule on roof crush standards that sought to preempt     numerous State laws  and ultimately weaken consumer protections for     Americans  Senator Specter and I pointed out in our letter that it     appeared the federal agency was plainly acting beyond the authority     granted to it by Congress in the Transportation Equity Act      Unfortunately  the federal agencys response did nothing to address our     questions about its authority to override State laws that may compensate     motorists critically injured in car accidents  Those roof crush     regulations are just one example of at least a dozen issued by the     Consumer Product Safety Commission  the Department of Homeland Security      the Federal Drug Administration and other federal agencies that are     being used to shield drug and other product manufacturers from liability     without congressional action   The Administrations concerted effort to thwart effective consumer     protection and to remove the incentive to improve safety beyond the     minimum standards set by regulatory agencies reminds me of its     politicizing of the Justice Department  Just as we have witnessed     improper political considerations undermine our federal law enforcement     agency for partisan gain  we are now witnessing agency rulemaking turned     into a mechanism to immunize powerful corporations at the expense of     ordinary Americans  Rather than issuing regulations based on facts and     science to benefit the American people  the process has apparently been     hijacked  The intended result of this politically motivated version of     rulemaking not only slams the local courthouse door shut on injured     victims but it prevents State law  State regulators and State courts     from protecting their citizens   Our nations civil justice system serves not only to compensate those     who have been injured by misconduct but to deter future misconduct  For     hundreds of years that system has provided an effective incentive for     manufacturers to improve safety  That is now being threatened by this     aggressive legal theory  As several of todays witnesses suggest  when     this Administration could not get Congress to legislate its     anti consumer agenda  it acted unilaterally through its executive     agencies   Principles of federalism and the separation of powers are crucial to     our constitutional democracy  When one branch begins to encroach upon     the constitutional responsibilities of another  this should concern not     just members of Congress  but all Americans  When this Administration     attempts to override the efforts of State authorities to provide     meaningful health and safety and consumer protections  all Americans are     more vulnerable  I am glad to have a distinguished panel of witnesses     today to shed some light on this important issue
