       Senate Passes Critical Court Security Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Senate Passes Critical       Court Security Legislation     WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Dec  18        2007   The Senate Monday night unanimously passed legislation       championed by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt         and Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa   to help protect Federal       judges  witnesses and officers from threats and attacks       The Court Security Improvement Act       will establish new criminal penalties for the misuse of       restricted personal information to threaten or seriously harm       judges and their families  or other individuals performing       official duties  including witnesses and court officers  The       bill also enhances penalties for tampering with or retaliating       against witnesses  and provides new resources to improve       security for state and local courts       The Senate has waited far too       long to enact this legislation to protect those who guard       justice in our court system  said Leahy  There is no doubt       that we must protect officials of the court from disgruntled or       disturbed individuals seeking to harm them  and the Senate has       finally moved forward to make more resources available to       provide that security to our Federal judiciary       I commend my colleagues for       passing this important legislation which provides for the       security of our Federal judges  Specter said  There is no       doubt that there is an urgent need for additional court       security  in light of a number of attacks on judges  The       independence of our judiciary is fundamental in our society for       the rule of law       Leahy and Specter introduced the       Court Security Improvement Act in the Senate earlier this year        and the legislation has received bipartisan support  The House       earlier this year passed a similar measure  The bill passed       Monday by the Senate incorporates language from the House passed       bill  as well as provisions key to Senate passage  The bill       will be sent back to the House for a final vote before it is       sent to the President                     Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee       On Senate Passage Of The Court Security Improvement Act Of 2007      December 17  2007    At the very beginning of this       Congress  one of the very first actions I took was to       re introduce the Court Security Improvement Act of 2007  along       with Senators Reid  Specter  Durbin  Cornyn  Kennedy  Hatch        Schumer and Collins The Judiciary Committee considered this       important legislation  and recommendedit to the full Senate        When Majority Leader Reid wanted to move to consider it  he       could not get a time agreement  We were forced to dedicate       almost a week of precious floor time to overcome a Republican       objection  just to proceed to debate on the bill  Eventually        the measure passedby a 97 to 0vote  Not a single Senator voted       against it  A short time later  a nearly identical bill passed       the House by a voice vote  Despite the broad bipartisan support       for both bills  however  we were blocked from going to       conference to resolve the minor differences between them by an       anonymous hold placed by a Republican Senator  For months  we       negotiated the minor differences between the House and Senate       versions of this legislation     When we are responding to attacks       and threats on our federal judges  witnesses and officers  time       is of the essence  Just last month in Nevada  a man admitted to       shooting and injuring the family court judge who was presiding       over his divorce  This type of violence against our judiciary       can and must be prevented  For our justice system to function       effectively  our judges and other court personnel must be safe       and secure  They and their families must be free from the fear       of retaliation and harassment  Witnesses who come forward must       be protected  and the courthouses where our laws are enforced       must be secure Today  almost eleven months after introducing       this legislation  we may actually reach consent to pass a       compromise version that will pass the House and be sent to the       President     We must act now to get these       protections in place and stop delaying such protective measures       by anonymous holds I urge Senators to take up and pass this       compromise version of the Court Security Improvement Act so that       we can provide the necessary protections that our Federal courts       so desperately need  The security of our Federal judges and our       courthouses around the nation is at stake
