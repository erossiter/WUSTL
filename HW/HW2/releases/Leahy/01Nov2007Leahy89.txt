       Judiciary Committee Passes Leahy Bill To Combat Public Corruption                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Judiciary Committee Passes Leahy       Bill To Combat Public Corruption      WASHINGTON        Thursday  Nov  1  2007   The Senate Judiciary Committee       Thursday passed bipartisan legislation introduced by Committee       Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Senator John Cornyn  R Texas        and co sponsored by Senator Jeff Sessions  R Ala   that       strengthens and clarifies key aspects of federal criminal law        and provides new tools to help law enforcement combat public       corruption nationwide       The Public Corruption Prosecution       Improvements Act gives prosecutors more time  resources  and       legal tools to detect and prosecute public corruption  Congress       earlier this year passed important ethics and lobbying reform       legislation  The Public Corruption Prosecution Improvement Act       goes one step further by providing additional tools to help law       enforcement root out corrupt criminal conduct by public       officials that threatens to undermine our democracy         The bill authorizes funding for       more personnel to investigate and prosecute corruption cases       involving public officials  and extends the statute of       limitations on select public corruption offenses by one year        It also enhances the effectiveness of existing statutes by       resolving ambiguities in the law  For example  the legislation       closes a loophole in existing law by broadening the definition       of what it means for a public official to perform an official       act under the bribery statute  The bill also amends the       federal gratuities statute to restore Congressional intent in       clarifying that public officials may not accept anything of       value  other than as permitted by existing rules or regulations        given to them because of their official position       This bipartisan legislation has       the support of the Department of Justice  as well as public       interest groups that have long advocated the vigorous       enforcement of fraud and public corruption laws  including the       Campaign Legal Center  Common Cause  Democracy 21  the League of       Women Voters  Public Citizen  and U S  PIRG       Leahys statement on the Public       Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act follows       Statement of       Senator Patrick Leahy   On Committee       Consideration of the Public Corruption Prosecution     Improvements       Act of 2007   November 1        2007      Today  the Committee will consider       the bi partisan Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act       of 2007  a bill that Senator Cornyn and I introduced to       strengthen and clarify key aspects of federal criminal law and       provide new tools to help law enforcement attack public       corruption nationwide  I thank Senator Sessions for working       with us and joining as a co sponsor       Congress took an important step in       restoring Americans faith in their elected officials earlier       this year by passing long awaited ethics and lobbying reforms       that will tighten restrictions on those of us who hold public       office  as well as those who seek to lobby us on behalf of       private industry  But rooting out the kinds of rampant public       corruption we have seen in recent years requires us to go       further and to give law enforcement the resources it needs to       effectively investigate and prosecute public corruption crimes             The most serious corruption cannot       be prevented only by changing our own rules  Bribery and       extortion  in all branches and at all levels of government  are       committed by people bent on getting around the rules and banking       that they will not get caught  These offenses are very       difficult to detect and even harder to prove  Because they       attack the core of our democracy  these offenses must be found       out and punished  Congress must send a strong signal that it       will not tolerate this corruption by providing better tools for       federal investigators and prosecutors to combat it  This bill       will do exactly that        The bill gives investigators and       prosecutors more time and resources to effectively enforce       existing anti corruption laws  The bill extends the statute of       limitations from five to six years for the most serious public       corruption offenses  Public corruption cases are among the most       difficult and time consuming cases to investigate and       prosecute  Bank fraud  arson and passport fraud  among other       offenses  all have ten year statutes of limitations  Public       corruption offenses cut to the heart of our democracy  and a       more modest increase to the statute of limitations is a       reasonable step to help our corruption investigators and       prosecutors do their jobs       The bill would also provide       significant and much needed additional funding for public       corruption enforcement  Since 9 11  FBI resources have been       shifted away from the pursuit of white collar crime to       counterterrorism  FBI Director Mueller has said recently that       public corruption is now among the FBIs top investigative       priorities  but a September 2005 report by Department of Justice       Inspector General found that  from 2000 to 2004  there was an       overall reduction in public corruption matters handled by the       FBI  More recently  a study by the research group Transactional       Records Access Clearinghouse found that the prosecution of all       kinds of white collar crimes is down 27 percent since 2000  and       official corruption cases have dropped in the same period by 14       percent  The Wall Street       Journal reported recently that the investigation of a       federal elected official stalled for six months because the       investigating U S  Attorneys Office could not afford to replace       the prosecutor who had previously handled the case         We must reverse this trend and       make sure that law enforcement has the tools and the funding it       needs to address serious and corrosive crimes occurring right       here at home  Efforts to combat terrorism and official       corruption are not mutually exclusive  A bribed customs       official who allows a terrorist to smuggle a dirty bomb into our       country  or a corrupt consular officer who illegally supplies       U S  entry visas to would be terrorists  can cause grave harm to       our national security        This bill goes further by amending       several key statutes to broaden their application in corruption       and fraud contexts  This series of fixes will prevent corrupt       public officials and their accomplices from evading or defeating       prosecution based on existing legal ambiguities       For example  the bill includes a fix to the       gratuities statute that makes clear that public officials may       not accept anything of value  other than what is permitted by       existing regulations  given to them because of their official       position  Senator Cornyn and I have introduced a substitute       amendment today which makes explicitly clear that anything       permitted by House and Senate rules  including a small gift like       a baseball cap  or a bona fide campaign contribution  is not       covered by this statute       The bill also appropriately       expands the definition of what it means for a public official to       perform an official act for the purposes of the bribery       statute and closes several other gaps in current law         Finally  the bill raises the       statutory maximum penalties for several statutes dealing with       official misconduct  including theft of government property and       bribery  These increases reflect the serious and corrosive       nature of these crimes  and would harmonize the punishment for       these crimes with other similar statutes        This bi partisan bill is supported       by the Department of Justice and by a wide array of public       interest groups that have long advocated for vigorous       enforcement of our fraud and public corruption laws  including       the Campaign Legal Center  Common Cause  Democracy 21  the       League of Women Voters  Public Citizen  and U S  PIRG         If we are serious about addressing       the kinds of egregious misconduct that we have recently       witnessed in high profile public corruption cases  Congress must       enact meaningful legislation to give investigators and       prosecutors the tools and resources they need to enforce our       laws  Passing the ethics and lobbying reform bill was a step in       the right direction  But we must finish the job by       strengthening the criminal law to enable federal investigators       and prosecutors to bring those who undermine the public trust to       justice  I hope the Committee will join Senator Cornyn and me       in promptly reporting this bill to the full Senate
