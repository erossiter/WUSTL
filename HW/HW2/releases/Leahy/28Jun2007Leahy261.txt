       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations    June 28  2007  The Senate continues to make progress today with     the confirmation of three more lifetime appointments to the federal     bench  Benjamin Hale Settle to the District Court for the Western     District of Washington  Richard Joseph Sullivan to the District Court     for the Southern District of New York  and Joseph S  Van Bokkelen to the     District Court for the Northern District of Indiana  The nominations of     Mr  Settle and Mr  Sullivan are for vacancies deemed by the     Administrative Office of the U S  Courts to be judicial emergencies      All three nominees have the support of their home state Senators  I     thank Senators Murray  Cantwell  Clinton  Schumer  Lugar and Bayh for     working with us and with the President on the nomination   These three judges will bring this years judicial     confirmations total to 21  It is before the July 4th recess      and we have already confirmed many more judges than were confirmed     during the entire 1996 session when President Clintons nominees were     being reviewed by a Republican Senate majority  That was the session in     which not a single circuit court nominee was confirmed  We have already     confirmed three circuit court judges in the early months of this     session  As I have previously noted  that also puts us well ahead of     the pace established by the Republican majority in 1999   As the Judiciary Committee Chairman  I have always     treated this Presidents judicial nominees more fairly than Republicans     treated President Clintons  With these confirmations  the Senate will     have confirmed 121 judges while I have served as Judiciary Chairman  It     is a little known and wholly unappreciated fact that during the more     than six years of the Bush Presidency  more circuit court judges  more     district court judges  and more total judges have been confirmed while I     served as Judiciary Chairman than during the longer tenures of either of     the two Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities      The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts lists     48 judicial vacancies after these nominations are confirmed  yet the     President has sent us only 26 nominations for these vacancies  Twenty     two of these vacancies almost half  have no nominee  Of the 15     vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial     emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees for six of them      That means more than a third of the judicial emergency vacancies are     without a nominee   Of the 13 circuit court vacancies  more than half     are without a nominee  If the President had worked with the Senators     from Rhode Island  New Jersey  Maryland  California  Michigan  and the     other states with the remaining circuit vacancies  we could be in     position to make even more progress   As it is  we have cut the circuit vacancies in     half  from 26 to 13  Contrast that with the way the Republican led     Senates lack of action on President Clintons moderate and qualified     nominees resulted in circuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26      During most of the Clinton years  the Republican led Senate engaged in     strenuous efforts to keep circuit judgeships vacant in anticipation of a     Republican President  To a great extent they succeeded   The Judiciary Committee has been working hard to     make progress on those nominations the President has sent to us  Of     course  when he sends us well qualified  consensus nominees with the     support of his home state Senators like those before us today  we can     have success   Mr  Settle is a partner     and co founder of the Shelton  Washington  law firm of Settle  Johnson      PLLC  where he has worked for 30 years  He also served seven years as a     prosecutor and defense counsel in the U S  Army Judge Advocate General     Corps   Mr  Sullivan is General Counsel to Marsh  McLennan     Companies  Inc   where he has worked since 2005  Before that  he worked     as a federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York and in     private practice at the Wall Street law firm of Wachtell  Lipton  Rosen       Katz  Mr  Van Bokkelen is the U S  Attorney for the     Northern District of Indiana  where he has served since 2001  He has     worked in private practice for the law firms of Goodman  Ball  Van     Bokkelen  Leonard and Wilson  Donnesberger  Van Bokkelen  Reid  He     previously served as an Assistant U S  Attorney and as an Assistant     Attorney General in the Indiana Attorney Generals office   I congratulate the nominees and their families on     their confirmation today
