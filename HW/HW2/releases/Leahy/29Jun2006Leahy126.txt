       Key Senate Panel OKs Leahy Stevens Amendment Delaying Implementation Of   The Pass Card System                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Key Senate       Panel OKs Leahy Stevens Amendment      On The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI        Delaying Implementation Of The Pass Card System    WASHINGTON        Thursday  June 29     The Senate Appropriations Committee       Thursday approved an amendment authored by Senator Patrick Leahy        D Vt   and Senator Ted Stevens  R Alaska  to  delay implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel       Initiative  WHTI  for 17 months  until June 1  2009  and to       require the Secretary of Homeland Security and the Secretary of       State to certify to Congress that several standards are met       before the program moves forward       Leahy and Stevens included their       amendment in two separate funding bills    for the Department of       Homeland Security and for the Department of State    that passed       the Appropriations Committee on Thursday  Leahy is a senior       member of the Appropriations Committee and is the Ranking Member       of its Subcommittee on State  Foreign Operations and Related       Programs  which handled the Senates work in writing the annual       spending bill  He is also a senior member of the Homeland       Security Subcommittee        The amendment parallels the       17 month delay included in the amendment that Leahy and Stevens       successfully added to the Senate passed immigration reform       package  Because the future of the immigration bill now is       clouded  they have worked to attach the amendment also to       must pass legislation like these two appropriations bills        Leahy says that  because of the       lack of sufficient coordination on the Passport Card  or PASS       Card  system between DHS and State and between the       Administration and the Government of Canada  the system is a       train wreck on the horizon  Leahy adds  It will be far       easier and less harmful to fix these problems before this system       goes into effect than to have to mop up the mess afterward       In addition to delaying       implementation  the Leahy Stevens Amendment also includes       prerequisites for implementation of WHTI that they have largely       drawn from another amendment added to the Senates immigration       bill  the Coleman Dorgan Leahy Stevens Amendment  The       Leahy Stevens Amendment requires DHS and the State Department to       meet these standards before implementing the Passport Card       system     1       Ensure that the technology for any       Passport Card meets certain security standards  and that DHS       and State agree on that technology     2       Share the technology with the       governments of Canada and Mexico    3       Justify the fee set for the Passport       Card     4       Develop an alternative procedure for       groups of children traveling across the border under adult       supervision with parental consent    Install all necessary        technological infrastructure at the ports of entry to        process the cards and train U S  agents at the border        crossings in all aspects of the new technology       6       Make the Passport Card available for       international land and sea travel between the United States and       Canada  Mexico  or the Caribbean and Bermuda    7       Establish a unified implementation       date for all sea and land borders         Text of the       amendment is below                     LEAHY STEVENS AMENDMENT      At the end of       the bill  insert the following             Section XXX       Section 7209 b  1  of the Intelligence       Reform
