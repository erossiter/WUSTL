       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Transcript Of Excerpts Of Dr  Dobson s   Explanation Of His Discussions With The White House About The Miers Nomination                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On Transcript Of Excerpts Of Dr  Dobsons Explanation      Of His Discussions With The White House      About The Miers Nomination      Wednesday  October 12  2005  Dr  Dobson earlier seemed       confident that he had all the assurances he needed about how she       would vote as a justice on issues that are his litmus test        Now  more than a week later  he has offered an explanation for       his earlier cryptic remarks  The rest of America  including the       Senate  deserves to know what he and the White House know  We       don t confirm Justices of the Supreme Court on a wink and a       nod  And a litmus test is no less a litmus test by using       whispers and signals   No political faction should be       given a monopoly of relevant knowledge about a nomination  just       as no faction should be permitted to hound a nominee to       withdraw  before the hearing process has even begun  What we       have seen so far is more of a commentary on the litmus tests and       narrow motivations of vocal factions on the Republican right       than it is a commentary on the qualifications of Harriet Miers   The Senate has an established       process for evaluating nominations to high office  and that       process will gather and weigh the facts to the best of our       ability  with  I hope  the cooperation that the Senate deserves       from the White House  The American people expect the Senate to       make informed decisions about lifetime appointments to our       highest court  The Judiciary Committee has bipartisan       procedures for evaluating pertinent information about       nominations  As Chairman Specter has said  the staff needs to       finish a preliminary review before a decision is reached about       how to proceed on this and other issues
