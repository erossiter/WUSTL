       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Passing Of The Honorable James L    Oakes                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy    On The Passing Of The Honorable James L  Oakes    October 22  2007 Mr  President  last week  I had a long talk with Mara     Williams  the wife of former U S  Court of Appeals Judge James Oakes      Jim  who had served as Vermonts Attorney General  as our Federal     District Judge  and with distinction as Chief Judge of the Second     Circuit  had died the previous weekend at the age of 83       Mara told me how the family had been with Jim a few days before he died      and we then talked about the legacy he left      I spoke of knowing Jim for forty years  and how I  and my family of     lifelong Democrats  had voted for him for Attorney General and had hoped     he might be our governor  As it turned out  the country was far better     off having him on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals  and would have     been even better off had he been elevated to the Supreme Court  a     position he would have held with great distinction      We all knew of Jims legal mind and great ability  his dedication to     public service  his wonderful sense of humor  and his love for his     family  but I knew him especially as a man with a great and good     conscience      Jim Oakes epitomized the role of judge as the protector of our     fundamental rights  A decade ago he noted that he was a person who     still believe d  that a federal judge can make a difference andin     cases of extreme necessity where basic rights are being infringedshould     make a difference when the rest of our political structure bogs down      This appreciation for the role of judicial independence is something we     must admire and remember      We worked together when he was Attorney General and I was States     Attorney  and I particularly remember one very difficult and tragic     murder case where we were able to forge an unprecedented use of a grand     jury to bring about justice when it looked like that would not have been     possible  We talked about that as recently as a couple of years ago  but     then  with Jim  we could pick up a conversation from where we had left     off six months before when we had last seen each other      Fran Lynggaard Hansen quoted his eldest daughter  Cynthia Meketa  as     saying  He had a very high intellect  but he was never a snob  He had     ups and downs in his early life and always identified with everybody      the cashier at the bank  the guy at the market  the man working at the     dump But that was who he was  kind  generous to people who needed a     helping hand  He was a sentimental softie and loved to be a mentor to     people  especially his law clerks  shepherding their careers along      My good friend  Judge Garvan Murtha  said  He was never afraid to stand     up for the rights for others and to name what was wrong  He was a     brilliant  caring  funny man and appreciative of people He was a very     wise man In the Pentagon Papers case  he was dissenting  so he ended up     on the wrong side of the Court of Appeals  but the Supreme Court ended     up agreeing with him      His daughter Betsy Oakes said  I think everyone who loved and admired     my father will want to carry on his tremendous spirit of social     justice       Mara tells me of the love all the family had for Jimand I know the love     he had for her  his three children  four stepchildren  grandchildren      and his brother      Adam Liptak wrote of Judge Oakes in The New York Times  and I ask     consent that his article be included in full
