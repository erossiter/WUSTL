                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       To The DOJ Inspector Generals Report     On The FBIs Handling Of The Brandon Mayfield Case      Based On OIGs Unclassified Executive Summary      January 6  2006 The Inspector      Generals report confirms what we all know  The FBI made a mistake      when it identified Mr  Mayfields fingerprint in the Madrid bombing      investigation  What is revealing in this report is the way the FBI      handled the fingerprint investigation  It seized on a similar      fingerprint and did not fully investigate the many clues contained      in the print showing that it was  in fact  a mismatch  Confronted      with a negative match by the Spanish National Police  the FBI      responded not with diligence but with arrogance  In an act the      Inspector General describes as being overconfident  the FBI      dismissed those doubts  For more than two weeks  with that negative      finding in hand  the FBI pursued Mr  Mayfield  and then had him      arrested on a material witness warrant   Several of us with oversight      responsibility for the FBI have long been concerned over the      potential misuse of material witness warrants  It is troubling to      read the Inspector Generals conclusion that the FBI supplied      ambiguous  inaccurate and unfounded information to the court in      seeking a material witness warrant to detain Mr  Mayfield  We know      from publicly released documents that the FBI recognized that ithad      a problem because there was not enough evidence to arrest Mayfield      for a crime   The FBIs reaction to this report      glosses over this issue  but I intend to fight for passage of      S 1739  a bill I introduced to ensure that the material witness law      is used only for the purpose that Congress originally intended  to      obtain testimony  and not to hold criminal suspects without charge      when probable cause is lacking
