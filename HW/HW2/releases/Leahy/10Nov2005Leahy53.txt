       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Meeting Of Conferees On The USA   PATRIOT Improvement And Reauthorization Act OF 2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary     Meeting Of Conferees On H R 3199  The USA PATRIOT Improvement And      Reauthorization Act Of 2005 November 10  2005 I am pleased that      the House has now has appointed conferees and that we are meeting      today  Both houses of Congress passed versions of a PATRIOT Act      reauthorization bill in late July  and the Senate immediately      appointed conferees  We have lost several months that could have      been used in seeking common ground on the two versions of the bill       That process at last has begun  and we need to make prudent use of      the limited time remaining in this legislative session and before      the expiration of several important national security      authorizations  I commend Chairman Specter and Chairman      Sensenbrenner for their efforts to do that  The PATRIOT Act      has always had an image problem  in part because it was negotiated      quickly and largely outside of public view  This may have been      necessary in the fall of 2001  following the 9 11 attacks and the      anthrax letters that shut down much of the Capitol complex  But      there is no reason for lawmakers to act hastily or behind closed      doors now  and no one should accept it   In this bill       Congress once again tries to strike the right balance between the      security and the liberty that are the birthright of every American       The public deserves and expects that we will diligently do our part      in helping to achieve that balance in this bill   I negotiated many      of the provisions of the PATRIOT Act and am gratified to have been      able to add several checks and balances that were not contained in      the initial proposal  But as I said at the time  this was not the      final bill that I  or any of the sponsors  would have written if      compromise had been unnecessary   In the final      negotiating session  former House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I      insisted that we add sunset provisions for certain domestic      surveillance powers that have some of the greatest potential to      undermine the civil liberties of the American people  Chairman      Sensenbrenner and others in the House had strongly supported sunsets      in an earlier version of the Houses bill  We succeeded in that      effort  and the sunsets prompted a constructive national dialogue      about the proper limits of governmental power  They also explain      why we were finally able to pry some information on the use of      surveillance tools out of the Department of Justice  after many      years of stonewalling  Legitimate      concerns and questions have been raised about various powers granted      by the PATRIOT Act    not so much for how they have been used  but      for how they could be used  and for the cloak of the secrecy under      which they operate  I worked with Chairman Specter for months to      address these issues in legislation that became the basis for the      Senate version of the bill  I commend      Chairman Specter for his leadership in this reauthorization process       and I appreciate the dedication of Chairman Sensenbrenner to the      task of completing this work   The Senate bill      reauthorizes the expiring PATRIOT Act authorities  while modestly      improving protections for civil liberties and privacy  It is a bill      with broad appeal  it passed the Committee by a vote of 18 0 and the      full Senate by unanimous consent  It is a clean bill  limited to      the four corners of the PATRIOT Act  it does not include      controversial extraneous provisions  The bill as      passed by the House was loaded with extras  which were tacked on      to the bill as floor amendments with little or no debate  While      some are non controversial  some raise substantial concerns  For      example  the House bill would allow Federal prosecutors a do over      whenever they fail to persuade a jury to impose a death sentence       This proposal demands careful constitutional and practical review      and serious debate  and it has had neither  The House bill would      strike the original PATRIOT Act formula for homeland security      funding  That formula has worked well  despite Administration      efforts to pit large states against small ones  and it should be      preserved   I was encouraged      to see the House yesterday adopt a motion to instruct the House      conferees to agree to the sunsets contained in the Senate bill  In      my view  there also are additional sections that ought to contain      sunset provisions  The sunshine provisions that I worked to include      in the Senate bill would also promote accountability and better      oversight of the use of the PATRIOT Act  Instead of      force feeding the extras added to the bill in the House  we should      devote our energies to fixing a critical area where both bills fall      far short of acceptable  They fail to provide sufficient checks and      guidelines on the use of National Security Letters  NSLs are  in      effect  a form of administrative subpoena  They do not require      approval by a court  grand jury  or prosecutor  They are issued in      secret  with recipients silenced  under penalty of law   When we expanded      the FBIs secret powers in the PATRIOT Act  we believed that      rigorous oversight and existing checks and balances would temper      egregious use  But the rug was promptly pulled from under that kind      of accountability  with resistance to oversight rising to an      all time high and with the unprecedented decision of Attorney      General Ashcroft to strip the Justice Department guidelines of      counter balancing protections  Never before had these guidelines      been adjusted without Congressional involvement  Two years ago  when Congress again      expanded the NSL authority  I raised concerns about what the FBI was      doing with the information about Americans that it obtained through      NSLs  I noted that  with no real limits imposed by Congress  the      FBI could store this information electronically and use it for      large scale data mining operations  As we now know  this is exactly      what is being done with this sensitive data about the American      people   The Departments self provided      loopholes have allowed the FBI to consolidate sensitive personal      information in databases  seemingly in perpetuity  with no clear      protections for managing how that information is used and by whom       or for purging data on innocent Americans  We now also know that      not only the Justice Department but the Defense Department also is      outsourcing data collection about American citizens  contracting      with private data brokers  and this is happening outside the laws       restrictions and privacy limits that would apply to the Pentagon      itself   Security and      liberty are always in tension in our free society  and especially so      in the wake of the attacks of 9 11  The American people of today       and the American people of tomorrow  our children and grandchildren         depend on their elected representatives to strike the right      balance  Preventing the needless erosion of liberty and privacy      requires constant vigilance and vision from those who the people      have entrusted with writing the laws  We have been fully warned of      these risks  and we will have failed in our legislative duties if we      do not correct these deficiencies  We should not finalize the      conference report on the PATRIOT Act without fully addressing the      privacy and civil liberties concerns posed by National Security      Letters
