       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy on President Signing Of The Military   Commissions Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On President Signing Of The Military Commissions Act    October 17  2006 It is a sad day     when the rubberstamp Congress undercuts our freedoms  assaults our     Constitution and lets the terrorists achieve something they could never     win on the battlefield  The Republican led Congress missed another     opportunity to write a good law because this Administration was mostly     interested in trying to score political points in the run up to the     elections and avoiding accountability for its unlawful actions  They instead     should have been interested in setting enforceable guidelines for     fighting and winning the war on terror  The President himself wasted no     time in politicizing the bill and signaling his true priorities in this     debate  The bipartisan Warner Levin bill would have been a better     starting point for legislation  and Congress had no justification for     suspending the writ of habeas corpus    a core value in American law        in order to avoid judicial review that prevents government abuse
