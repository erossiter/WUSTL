       Leahy  Gregg Release Bipartisan Letter To Secretary Rice Urging Charles   Taylor s Transfer To The Special Court For Sierra Leone                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  Gregg Release Bipartisan Letter To      Secretary Rice     Urging Charles Taylors Transfer To The Special Court For Sierra      Leone   WASHINGTON  Thursday       April 28   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Senator Judd Gregg  R N H        Thursday released a bipartisan letter    signed by four Republican      and four Democratic senators    to Secretary of State Condoleezza      Rice  calling for the U S  Government to seek the transfer of      Charles Taylor from Nigeria to the Court as soon as possible    The letter observes that      There are credible reports that Mr  Taylor has repeatedly broken      the terms of his agreement with the Nigerian government  continues      to meddle in the affairs of Liberia and other West African nations       is involved in a number of activities that threaten to destabilize      the region  and has associations with Al Qaeda  Allowing Nigeria to      shield Mr  Taylor from the Special Court for Sierra Leone would set      an unfortunate precedent  Permitting an indicted war criminal to      escape justice from a United Nations and United States supported      tribunal  undermines Security Council resolutions and damages our      countrys efforts to promote and protect human rights around the      world    About the senators      appeal  Leahy said  There is mounting bipartisan support in      Congress for the transfer of Charles Taylor  Despite assurances by      the State Department to Congress over a year ago that Taylor will      ultimately appear before the Court  they have made little effort to      get him there and  even worse  they seem to have no strategy for      getting it done     Gregg said  It is time      for the international community  the UN and the United States to put      an end to this extraordinarily destructive chapter in West African      history  The only way we can put an end to it is if we allow the      Court to try Taylor and bring him to justice     Leahy commended Greggs      persistent efforts on this issue  Senator Gregg has been involved      with the situation in West Africa for years  spanning both the      Clinton and Bush Administrations  said Leahy  His strong      leadership has made a real difference to the people in that region         The letter was drafted      by Leahy and Gregg and signed by six other senators  Arlen Specter       R Pa    Russ Feingold  D Wisc    Mike DeWine  R Ohio   Jack Reed       D R I    Lincoln Chafee  R R I    and Richard Durbin  D Ill           Over the past four      years  Leahy and Gregg have closely collaborated on the Taylor      issue  including writing and enacting legislation that conditions      assistance to nations harboring individuals indicted by the Special      Court for Sierra Leone  Leahy and Gregg have also ensured the      appropriation of  22 million for the Special Court     7 million      above Administration requests     The text of the letter to Secretary      Rice follows                    April      21  2005  The Honorable Condoleezza Rice     Secretary of State     U S  Department of State      Washington  DC 20520  Dear Secretary Rice    We appreciate your      continued efforts to promote peace and prosperity throughout the      world  To this end  the failure of the Nigerian government to      transfer Charles Taylor so that he may stand trial before the      Special Court for Sierra Leone is of paramount importance  As you      know  the Special Court  which was      established by the United Nations Security Council with strong      United States support  has indicted Mr  Taylor for 17 counts      of war crimes and crimes against humanity  It is our belief that      the United States should seek the transfer of Charles Taylor from      Nigeria to the Court as soon as possible    There are credible reports      that Mr  Taylor has repeatedly broken the terms of his agreement      with the Nigerian government  continues to meddle in the affairs of      Liberia and other West African nations  is involved in a number of      activities that threaten to destabilize the region  and has      associations with Al Qaeda  The transfer of Mr  Taylor is not      simply an issue between Charles Taylor and the Special Court       Allowing Nigeria to shield Mr  Taylor from the Special Court for      Sierra Leone would set an unfortunate precedent  Permitting an      indicted war criminal to escape justice from a United Nations and      United States supported tribunal  undermines Security Council      resolutions and damages our countrys efforts to promote and protect      human rights around the world    There is no      question that the United States and the international community owe      the Nigerian government a debt of gratitude for helping to remove      Mr  Taylor from power  However  the job of promoting regional      peace and security cannot be completed until Mr  Taylor appears      before the Special Court to answer to the charges against him  In      addition  we agree with you that Nigeria is a key U S  ally in West      Africa  Transferring Charles Taylor to the Court also is widely      supported within Nigeria  Prominent members of Nigerias military      and civil society have vigorously opposed the decision to shield      Taylor  Moreover  allowing Taylor to continue to interfere      in Liberian affairs    with the possible outcome that those loyal to      him win the upcoming elections    could undermine the entire      international investment in Liberias reconstruction     To date  the Congress has      appropriated over  22 million for the Court  In doing so  we have      made it clear that the Special Court should prosecute Mr  Taylor       We hope that you share our concern and urge you to make it a top      U S  foreign policy priority  as the timely transfer of Mr  Taylor      to the Court will help reduce transnational threats in West Africa       promote peace and security in the region  and enhance respect for      the rule of law throughout Africa         Thank you for your consideration on this matter  We look forward to      hearing from you    Sincerely   Patrick      Leahy      Judd Gregg  Arlen      Specter      Jack Reed  Russ      Feingold      Mike DeWine  Lincoln      Chafee      Richard Durbin
