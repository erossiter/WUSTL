       Leahy Anti War Profiteering Bill Targets Cheats Who Defraud Taxpayers   And Troops                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Anti War      Profiteering Bill     Targets Cheats Who Defraud Taxpayers And Troops       Bill Would Make It A Crime To Exploit Taxpayer Funded     War Reconstruction And Disaster Relief Efforts  WASHINGTON  Thursday  March 2        Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday joined in introducing a      reform bill that would make it a crime to overcharge the government      for goods and services in military contracts and other publicly      funded relief efforts while intending to excessively profit    Leahy  a senior member of the      Appropriations Committee and its Defense and Foreign Operations      Subcommittees  offered the bill as news reports continue to reveal      sizable abuses in military contracts awarded by the Bush      Administration in connection with the reconstruction efforts in      Iraq  News reports earlier this week revealed that the Army has      quietly awarded a Halliburton Co  subsidiary  Kellogg  Brown  Root       more than  250 million in reimbursements  profits and bonuses that      government auditors had concluded were unreasonable and unsupported       said Leahy  who is also the ranking Democratic member on the      Judiciary Committee   Recent examples of contract fraud      and abuse involving Halliburton make clear that the Bush Cheney      Administrations approach to reconstruction in Iraq has been a      formula for mischief  said Leahy  Waste  fraud and abuse in the      name of defense is doubly destructive and doubly offensive  and it      should never be tolerated  It saps resources needed by our troops      and it plays the taxpayers for fools  all the while hiding under the      cover of national defense   The bill is similar to legislation      Leahy introduced in 2003  that was subsequently passed by the Senate      as part of an appropriations bill but later torpedoed by the White      House and the House Republican leadership  which stripped out the      Leahy provision   Under the bill  the new crime would      be a felony  subject to criminal penalties of up to 20 years in      prison and fines of up to  1 million or twice the illegal gross      profits of the crime   Leahys bill is also included as a      provision in a larger Democratic proposal that was also unveiled on      Thursday  Leahy joined Democratic Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   and      Senator Byron Dorgan  D N D   in introducing the Honest Leadership      and Accountability in Contracting Act of 2006  the Democratic      proposal to clean up the persistent problem of waste  fraud  and      abuse in government contracting that rewards cronies and refuses      oversight   Leahys statement  background      information on the documented contract abuses and a      section by section of the bill are below               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On Introduction Of The War Profiteering Prevention Act Of 2006     March 2  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today I      am introducing the War Profiteering Prevention Act of 2006  This      bill creates criminal penalties for war profiteers and cheats who       for ill gotten gain  would exploit the United States Government s      taxpayer funded war and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and elsewhere      around the world  I am pleased that Senator Dorgan has also included      this legislation in the Honest Leadership and Accountability in      Contracting Act of 2006 that is also being introduced today    I previously introduced this      legislation in 2003  It came to be cosponsored by 21 Senators       including Senators Clinton  Dodd  Feinstein  Johnson  Kerry       Landrieu  Bill Nelson  Wyden  Dayton  Durbin  Feingold  Harkin       Jeffords  Kennedy  Kohl  Lieberman and Reid  The Senate      Appropriations Committee unanimously accepted these provisions      during a Senate Appropriations Committee markup of the  87 billion      appropriations bill for Iraq and Afghanistan for Fiscal Year 2004       and it passed the Senate  It was the right thing to do then  and it      is the right thing to do now   Regrettably  the Republican      leadership in the House stripped this legislation out of that      appropriations bill  and we regrettably have been witnessing the      results in the meantime  Billions appropriated for the continuing      war efforts and for reconstruction are unaccounted for  and fraud      has been rampant  The recent report of the special inspector general      confirms that U S  taxpayer funds appropriated for reconstruction      have been lost and diverted   There are  of course  anti fraud      laws to protect against waste of tax dollars at home  But none      expressly prohibits war profiteering  and none expressly confers      jurisdiction for fraud overseas  This bill would criminalize war      profiteering    overcharging taxpayers in order to defraud and to      profit excessively from a war  military action  or reconstruction      efforts  It would prohibit any fraud against the United States      involving a contract for the provision of goods or services in      connection with a war  military action  or for relief or      reconstruction activities  This new crime would be a felony  subject      to criminal penalties of up to 20 years in prison and fines of up to       1 million or twice the illegal gross profits of the crime    The bill also prohibits false      statements connected with the provision of goods or services in      connection with a war or reconstruction effort  This crime would      also be a felony  subject to criminal penalties of up to 10 years in      prison and fines of up to  1 million or twice the illegal gross      profits of the crime  These are strong and focused sanctions that      are narrowly tailored to punish and deter fraud or excessive      profiteering in contracts  here and abroad  related to the United      States Government s war or reconstruction efforts   Congress has sent more than a      quarter of a trillion dollars to Iraq with too little accountability      and too few financial controls  Disturbingly  there are widespread      reports of waste  fraud and war profiteering in Iraq  and the      special inspector general examining the use of reconstruction funds      in Iraq recently found that billions of taxpayer dollars remain      unaccounted for  For example  a recent report on 60 Minutes revealed      that more than  50 billion of U S  taxpayer funds have gone to      private contractors hired to guard bases  drive trucks  feed and      shelter the troops and rebuild in Iraq  This is more than the entire      annual budget of the Department of Homeland Security  In addition       just this week  the New York Times  reported that the Army has      decided to reimburse a Halliburton subsidiary    Kellogg Brown       Root    for nearly all of its disputed costs on a  2 41 billion      no bid contract to deliver fuel and repair oil equipment in Iraq       even though the Pentagon s own auditors had identified more than       250 million in charges as potentially excessive or unjustified       That article further notes that the Armys decision to pay all but      3 8 percent of these questionable charges lies well outside the      normal practice of the military  The recent revelations about      contract fraud and abuse in Iraq make clear that the approach to      reconstruction in Iraq has been a formula for mischief  We need      strong disincentives for those who would take advantage of the chaos      of war to defraud American taxpayers   We also need to strengthen the      tools available to federal prosecutors to combat war profiteering       Despite well publicized allegations of fraud and war profiteering in      Iraq  so far the Government has brought only one case to recover      these funds    a civil lawsuit brought under the False Claims Act       That case involves a contractor accused of overcharging the      Government millions of dollars under a contract to help distribute      new Iraqi currency during the first months after the collapse of the      Hussein government  The Government s ability to recover funds in      that case is being questioned by the defendant  however  who argues      that legal technicalities may constrain current law from reaching      all of the conduct of contractors working in Iraq or elsewhere      overseas  This bill would address this problem by providing clear      authority for the Government to seek criminal penalties and to      recover excessive profits for war profiteering overseas  It should      already be law  but three years ago the House Republican leadership      rejected it   Every penny of our taxpayers money      must be expended carefully and purposefully and protected from      waste  The message sent by this bill is that any act taken to      financially exploit the crisis situation in Iraq or elsewhere      overseas for exorbitant financial gain is unacceptable       reprehensible    and criminal  Such deceit demeans and exploits the      sacrifices that our military personnel and National Guard are making      in Iraq and Afghanistan   When U S  taxpayers have been      called upon to bear the burden of reconstruction contracts    where      contracts are awarded in a system that offers little competition and      even less accountability    concerns about wartime profiteering are      a grave matter  Historical efforts to stem such profiteering have      been successful  Congress implemented excessive profits taxes and      contract renegotiation laws after both World Wars  and again after      the Korean War  Advocating exactly such an approach  President      Roosevelt once declared it our duty to ensure that Aar few do not      gain from the sacrifices of the many  Then  as now  our Government      cannot in good faith ask its people to sacrifice for reconstruction      efforts that allow so many others to profit unfairly   There is urgency to this important      measure because criminal statutes cannot be applied retroactively       These controls should have been put in place at least three years      ago  they need to be in place now  I urge that the Senate make      prompt passage of this legislation a high priority  I hope that this      time the House Republican leadership will have learned the hard      lessons of the last three years and that  this time  they will allow      this bills enactment  on behalf of the Nations taxpayers                 Background      Information        Billions Of Taxpayer Dollars Lost     To Fraud And Waste In Iraq And Elsewhere  The  United States has spent more than a      quarter of a TRILLION dollars during its three years in Iraq        Over  50      BILLION    more than the annual budget of the Department of Homeland      Security    has been spent to hire private contractors to guard      bases  drive trucks  feed and shelter the troops and rebuild the      country     BILLIONS of taxpayer dollars are unaccounted for  according to a      recent finding by the special inspector general examining the  Iraq      reconstruction effort    Since 2000  10 companies with billions      of dollars in  U S  contracts for Iraq reconstruction      have paid more than  300 MILLION IN PENALTIES to resolve allegations      of bid rigging  fraud  delivery      of faulty military parts and environmental damage in      connection with other projects    Seven other companies with  Iraq      reconstruction contracts have agreed to pay financial penalties      without admitting wrongdoing     Custer Bates       Halliburton and Bechtel  Examples of Fraud and Waste    CUSTER BATES      is accused of bilking the government out      of  50      MILLION   Custer Bates billed the government      nearly  10 MILLION when its actual costs were less than  4 MILLION       according to a government investigation    Custer Bates over billed electricity      costs by  326 000   Actual electricity charges of  74 000 were      billed at  400 000    Custer Bates over billed for trucks      that did not run by  572 000       Actual purchase price of  228 000 for faulty trucks were billed to      government for  800 000         The two largest government contractors in Iraq     Bechtel Corp  and Halliburton Co         have been fined several times in the past three years             HALLIBURTON CO       averages about   1 BILLION A MONTH from the government for work in      Iraq this year  according to executives  The company took in  3 6      BILLION last year from contracts to serve U S  troops and rebuild      the oil industry in Iraq          A pattern of fraud  waste  and corruption by Halliburton in Iraq      emerged through news reports between December 2003 and May 2004  In      December  a Pentagon investigation found evidence that Halliburton s      Kellogg  Brown  Root  KBR  had overcharged the U S  government some       61 MILLION for fuel deliveries from Kuwait to Iraq  In January       Halliburton admitted to the Pentagon that two of its employees took      up to  6 million in kickbacks for awarding a Kuwaiti based      company with work in Iraq  Then in early February it was reported      that the company had agreed to repay the U S  government some  27      million for meals that were never served to American troops              Bills From Five Star  Beachfront Hotel And Drivers Paid to Haul      Empty Trucks          In May  the Coalition Provisional Authority s inspector general      started raising questions about the bills that Halliburton had      racked up at a five star beachfront hotel near Kuwait City  And 12      Halliburton truck drivers claimed they risked their lives driving      empty trucks in Iraq while their employer billed the government for      hauling absolutely nothing          Investigation of Overcharging And Potential Connection to Nigeria      Bribery Scheme        Federal authorities are also investigating whether Halliburton      broke the law by using a subsidiary to do business in Iran  whether      the company overcharged for work done for the Pentagon in the      Balkans and whether it was involved in an alleged  180 million      bribery scheme in Nigeria  The company admitted in 2003 that it      improperly paid  2 4 million to a Nigerian tax official          BECHTEL CORP       paid more than  110 000 to the Environmental Protection Agency and      the Energy Department in 2000 and 2001 to settle alleged safety and      environmental violations  Bechtel has prime construction contracts      in Iraq worth more than  2 billion          Fines Exceeding  86 Million        Bechtel hired three subcontractors in Iraq that have been fined more      than  86 million in the past four years  though none had been banned      from getting new contracts         Others Punished For Waste  Fraud and Abuse Of Govt  Contracts         American International Contractors Inc        paid  4 7 million in fines in 2000 after pleading guilty to bid      rigging on a U S  funded water project in Egypt  according to      published reports  AICI has part of a  325 million contract to      rebuild Iraq s transportation systems  has a share of a  500 million      contract for emergency construction needs in the Pentagon s Central      Command region  which includes Iraq and Afghanistan  and is in a      partnership that has a  70 million construction contract at Al Udeid      air base in Qatar  used to support troops in Iraq          Fluor Corp        paid  8 5 million to the Defense Department in 2001 to settle      charges it improperly billed the government for work benefiting its      commercial clients  according to published reports  Fluor and AMEC      created a joint venture that has  1 7 billion in contracts to      rebuild Iraq s electricity  water  sewer and trash removal      infrastructure         Great Lakes Dredge  Dock Co        paid a  969 000 fine in 2002 for environmental damage in the Florida      Keys National Marine Sanctuary  according to published reports       Bechtel awarded the company a subcontract to clear the Iraqi port      of Umm Qasr        Northrop Grumman Corp        whose Vinnell Corp  subsidiary was awarded a  48 million contract to      train the new Iraqi Army last year  according to published reports       Northrop Grumman has been penalized  191 7 million in the past four      years  including  750 000 paid to the Pentagon in 2000 in a case      involving allegations of providing faulty replacement
