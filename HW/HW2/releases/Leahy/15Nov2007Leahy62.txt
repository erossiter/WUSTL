       Comment Of Sen  Leahy On Legislation To Amend The Foreign Intelligence   Surveillance Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        On The Judiciary Committees Action      On Legislation To Amend The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance       Act      November 15  2007    The Senate Judiciary       Committee has passed a better  stronger and more balanced bill       to amend the Foreign Intelligence       Surveillance Act  including reducing the sunset provision from       six to four years  to make it easier to make further       improvements in the years to come  I am proud of the       contribution the Judiciary Committee has made to the process of       setting down clear laws to govern the wiretapping of Americans             These improvements protect our       security without sacrificing the peoples rights against       government abuse of these powerful surveillance tools  We have       found practical  workable answers that keep faith with American       values  We have struck a better balance that does credit to the       reasons we have FISA in the first place       When we give the government       sweeping surveillance powers  there need to be clear rules and       checks and balances to prevent abuses against the American       people        The full Senate will yet need to       resolve the immunity issue  I supported the Feingold amendment        which did not prevail in the committee  While I appreciate the       problems facing the telecommunications companies  the       retroactive immunity issue to me is not about fixing blame on       the companies but about holding government accountable  Passing       a law to whitewash the  Administrations       undermining of another law  would be a disservice       to the American people and to the rule of law
