       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Balancing Privacy And Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Opening Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Balancing Privacy And Security       The Privacy Implications Of Government Data Mining Programs     January 10  2007  Today  the Senate Judiciary Committee      holds an important hearing on the privacy implications of government      data mining programs    This Committee has a special      stewardship role in protecting our most cherished rights and      liberties as Americans  including the right to privacy  Todays      hearing on government data mining programs is our first in the new      Congress  It is the first of what I plan to be a series of hearings      on privacy related issues throughout this Congress     The Bush Administration has      dramatically increased its use of data mining technology    namely       the collection and monitoring of large volumes of sensitive personal      data to identify patterns or relationships  Indeed  in recent      years  the federal governments use of data mining technology has      exploded  without congressional oversight or comprehensive privacy      safeguards  According to a May 2004 report by the General      Accounting Office  at least 52 different federal agencies are      currently using data mining technology  and there are at least      199 different government data mining programs operating or      planned throughout the federal government   Advances in technologies make data      banks and data mining more powerful and more useful than ever      before  These can be valuable tools in our national security      arsenal  but we need to ensure we use them appropriately and with      the proper safeguards so that they can be most effective   One of the most common  and      controversial  uses of this technology is to predict who among our      300 million people are likely to be involved in terrorist      activities  According to the GAO and a recent study by the CATO      Institute  there are at least 14 different government data      mining programs within the Departments of Defense  Justice  Homeland      Security and Health  That does not include the NSAs programs        Congress is overdue in taking stock of      the proliferation of these databases that increasingly are      collecting and sifting more and more information about each and      every American    Although billed as counterterrorism      tools  the overwhelming majority of these data mining programs use       collect  and analyze personal information about ordinary American      citizens  Despite their prevalence  these government data mining      programs often lack adequate safeguards to protect privacy and civil      liberties    Just recently  we learned through the      media that the Bush Administration has used data mining technology      secretly to compile files on the travel habits of millions of      law abiding Americans  Incredibly  under the Department of Homeland      Securitys Automated Targeting System program  ATS   our      government has been collecting and sharing this sensitive personal      information with foreign governments and even private employers       while refusing to allow U S  citizens to see or challenge their own      so called terror scores   Following years of denial  the      Transportation Security Administration  TSA  has finally admitted      that its controversial Secure Flight data mining program  which      collects and analyzes airline passenger data obtained from      commercial data brokers  violated federal privacy laws by failing      to give notice to U S  air travelers that their personal data was      being collected for government use   And last month   The Washington Post      reported that the Department of Justice will expand its ONE DOJ      program  a massive data base that will allow state and local law      enforcement officials to review and search millions of sensitive      criminal files belonging to the FBI  DEA and other federal law      enforcement agencies  This will make sensitive investigative      information about thousands of individuals  including those who      have never been charged with a crime  available to local and state      law agencies   Without the proper safeguards and      oversight of these and other government data mining programs  the      American people have neither the assurance that these massive data      banks will make us safer  nor the confidence that their privacy      rights will be protected  In addition  there are legitimate      questions about whether data mining technology is actually effective      in identifying risks or terrorists    A recent CATO Institute study also      found that data mining is not an effective tool for predicting or      combating terrorism  in part because of the high risk of false      positive results  A front page article several months ago included      interviews with experts who conceded how ineffective and haphazard      these programs have been  We need look no further than the      governments own terrorist watch list  which now contains the names      of more than 300 000 individuals  including infants  nuns  and even      members of Congress  to understand the inefficiencies that can      result from data mining and government dragnets  If these databases      are being used in ways that create more wheel spinning that saps      critical investigative resources from effective tasks  we need to      know that so we can use our tools and our talent more efficiently to      get the real results in needed in thwarting terrorism  We also need      to understand that a mistake in a government data base could cost a      person his or her job  sacrifice their liberty  and wreak havoc on      their life and reputation    Given the many challenges posed by      this technology  we in Congress must do our part to examine data      mining technology and to ensure that government data mining programs      actually do keep Americans safe  not just from enemies abroad  but      also from abuses at home    We begin that important task today  I      am joining with Senator Feingold  Senator Sununu and others in a      bipartisan attempt to provide congressional oversight to these      programs  We are introducing the Federal Agency Data Mining      Reporting Act of 2007  This threshold privacy legislation would      begin to restore key checks and balances by requiring federal      agencies to report to Congress on their data mining programs and      activities  We joined together to introduce a similar bill last      Congress  Regrettably  it received no attention  This year  I      intend to make sure that we do a better job in considering      Americans privacy  checks and balances  and the proper balance to      protect Americans privacy rights while fighting smarter and more      effectively against security threats    This legislation takes a crucial first      step in addressing these concerns by pulling back the curtain on how      this Administration is using this technology  It does not prohibit      the use of this technology  but rather provides an oversight      mechanism to begin to ensure it is being used appropriately and      effectively  Our bill would require federal agencies to report to      Congress about its data mining programs  The legislation provides a      much needed check on federal agencies to disclose the steps that      they are taking to protect the privacy and due process rights of      American citizens when they use these programs    We need checks and balances to keep      government data bases from being misused against the American      people  That is what the Constitution and our laws should provide       We in Congress must make sure that when our government uses      technology to detect and deter illegal activity  the government does      so in ways that also protect our most basic rights and liberties       and in ways that limit opportunities for abuse of these powerful      tools  Our bill advances this important goal   I thank Chairman Specter for      scheduling this hearing at my request while the Republican caucus      proceeds to deliberate Committee reorganization  and I thank our      distinguished panel of witnesses for appearing here today
