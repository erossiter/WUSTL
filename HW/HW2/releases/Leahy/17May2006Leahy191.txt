       Senate Approves Stevens Leahy Amendment To Delay Stiff New   Border Crossing Requirements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Senate Approves Stevens Leahy Amendment      To Delay Stiff New Border Crossing Requirements         Averting       A Train Wreck On The Horizon For The Northern Border  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  May 17         The U S  Senate Wednesday afternoon approved and added to the       Senates immigration reform package a bipartisan amendment by       Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska  to       postpone for 17 months stiff new border crossing requirements        Leahy says federal agencies are ill prepared to implement the       plan  which he says would lead to major disruptions in commerce        tourism and travel  especially across the Northern Border with       Canada    The Stevens Leahy Amendment        approved by the Senate by voice vote on Wednesday afternoon        would delay implementation of the PASS Card system for 17       months  to June 1  2009  The PASS Card system is part of the       Bush Administrations Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI               Leahy calls the PASS Card requirements a train wreck on the       horizon for the Northern Border and has pointed to the lack of       sufficient coordination between the State Department and the       Department of Homeland Security on such basics as which       technology will be used for the new border crossing cards        Leahy has also faulted the Bush Administration for lack of       sufficient coordination with the Canadian Government over new       requirements that will be demanded of Canadian visitors when the       new program takes effect  Senators from Southern Border states       have joined in the coalition that Leahy and Stevens have built       for the postponement amendment  voicing similar concerns about       the programs effects on their states   This will head off the turmoil       that this poorly developed plan would impose on our citizens and       on our economy  especially in border states  said Leahy  We       want to buy enough time to fix these problems beforehand        instead of having to fix the mess it will cause afterward                     BACKGROUNDER        On The Stevens Leahy Amendment To Postpone For 17 Months      The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI       And It s Pass Card Border Crossing Requirements  PASS CARD  The       Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004       included a provision that will require individuals from the       United States  Canada  and Mexico to present a passport or other       documents proving citizenship before entering the United       States  The law takes effect on January 1  2008  The new       Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  and problems with       its implementation raise serious concerns about trade  commerce        and tourism along both the Northern and Southern borders  The       changes would be particularly jarring along the Northern Border       because of the commercial and cultural relationships that would       be bent or broken in implementing these changes along what has       long been the worlds longest friendly border  Canada also is       the largest U S  trading partner  as it also is Vermonts       foremost trading partner   The Homeland Security Department       and the State Department have proposed the introduction of a       PASS Card  similar in size to a drivers license  that is       intended to provide an inexpensive  secure alternative to a       traditional passport  However  despite the looming deadline for       mandatory use of the card at land crossings  the two departments       have yet to agree on the technical requirements for the card        The technology favored by DHS is an open UHF system that would       possibly make our border less secure  In addition  DHS has yet       to request a single dollar for the infrastructure required       needed with whatever card is deployed  A significant investment       is required to upgrade the infrastructure of border crossing       points  avoid gridlock and preserve the flow of commerce with       our largest trading partner   Because the program is mandated by       the 2004 law and State DHS are moving full speed ahead on       implementing it  it is unlikely that full repeal and redesign of       the program is a realistic option  A more realistic goal is to       explore possibilities for postponing implementation of the PASS       Card system until there are sufficient assurances from the       Department of Homeland Security  DHS  and from the State       Department that the programs problems have been satisfactorily       addressed  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has blown the whistle on       the PASS Card programs problems  which he calls a train wreck       on the horizon  sending oversight questions to the federal       agencies involved  raising these issues in oversight hearings        and alerting Vermonts state and business leaders to the looming       disaster  In Senate hearings this March  Senator Leahy       questioned DHS Secretary Chertoff and Secretary of State Rice       about these issues  spotlighting how far behind DHS currently is       on planning and implementing the PASS Card system in time for       the rapidly approaching deadlines when all U S  citizens must       have the card  In addition  DHS and GSA do not seem to be       paying any attention to the infrastructure required to make sure       that there are not ridiculously long lines at the border       stations when this program begins  a situation that would       cripple commerce and travel between the two countries  Also of       great concern is the lack of adequate consultation and       coordination of U S  agencies with the Government of Canada        which is nowhere near implementing anything like this yet  With       the United States requiring similar documents from Canadians       entering this country  their lack of adequate documentation       effectively will halt travel  trade and tourism heading south        To address these mounting problems  Sen  Patrick Leahy and Sen        Ted Stevens built a bipartisan coalition of support for       postponing the programs implementation  Their coalition       succeeded May 17 in adding the Stevens Leahy Amendment to the       Senates immigration reform bill  to delay the programs       implementation by 17 months   N  BORDER BARRIER FENCE WALL        Also of particular interest to Northern Border states during the       current immigration reform debate is the push by some to lay the       groundwork for a fence wall or barrier across the       3 145 mile long Northern Border with Canada  The immigration       bill passed late last year by the House includes this       provision  Senator Leahy succeeded in removing this measure          which would launch this effort by first mandating a federal       study  from the immigration reform package that is now on the       Senate Floor
