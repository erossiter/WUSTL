       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On  The Insurrection Act   Rider  And State Control Of The National Guard                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing On   The Insurrection Act Rider And State Control Of The National Guard   April 24  2007   The Committee is holding this hearing to focus on a    little noticed but sweeping change in the law governing the National Guard    made by the last Congress  Specifically  we are examining the recent    changes to the Insurrection Act  which controls when the President can use    components of the United States military for domestic law enforcement    purposes  The Insurrection Act is one of the major exemptions to our    longstanding statutes and distinctive American tradition not to involve the    military in domestic law enforcement  Last year  both the House and Senate    Armed Services Committees slipped provisions into the Defense Authorization    Bill  apparently at the request of the Administration  to make it easier for    the President to invoke the Insurrection Act in cases well short of    insurrection   In addition  the Presidents authority to nationalize    State units of the National Guard was increased  These State units of the    National Guard are controlled by our Governors  Even though this change in    law authorizes the President essentially to strip control of State Guard    units from a States Governor without consent  none of the Nations    Governors was consulted  The Nations adjutant generals  who command the    State Guard units  were not consulted  The local law enforcement community    was not consulted  Congressional committees with jurisdiction over law    enforcement matters were not consulted  There was no debate about the    significance of this change when the bill was before the House or the    Senate  Even after some of us discovered these add ons to the bill and    raised our concerns and the Governors came forward to raise their strong    objections to these changes  our concerns were ignored  and the Insurrection    Act rider was retained in the final version of the legislation   The changes to the Insurrection Act were not just bad    process  More to the point  the changes reflect bad policy  The    Insurrection Act Rider subverts sound policies for dealing with emergency    situations that keep our Governors and other locally elected officials in    the loop when they are having to deal with disasters that affect the people    they represent  These changes increase the likelihood that the military    will be inserted into domestic situations  One of the distinguishing    characteristics of the United States is that we do not use the military to    patrol our communities and neighborhoods  to make ordinary arrests or to    execute searches and seizures involving American citizens  Our tradition has    been to call on the military as a last resort and only with great care and    caution   The Insurrection Act Rider is emblematic of this    Administrations overreaching unitary executive approach to all things and    its viewing military power as the answer to all problems  Here the    Administration has misunderstood the lessons of Hurricane Katrina  The    National Guard  serving at the State level under the command of the    Governors  actually performed spectacularly after Katrina  Active military    forces did come in to support local relief efforts and worked professionally    alongside the Guard and our first responders after Katrina  So let us be    clear  in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  the problem was a breakdown    in FEMA  a federal agency  which did anything but a heckuva job in    preparing for and responding to that emergency  The disaster response    coordinators from President Bush on down  including Governor Blanco and    Mayor Nagin    did not have an effective  coordinated response  This    dangerous change in statute in which a fundamental law that protects the    basic rights of the American people is being upset to increase presidential    power and score political points is wrong   This change is also part of a pattern of Defense    Department mismanagement of issues concerning the National Guard that we    have seen all too often in recent years  What we should be doing is    ensuring that our 500 000 men and women in the National Guard have the    equipment and the policies in place that provide them the support they need    for the expanded missions they are being asked to perform  Instead     Pentagon leaders generate proposals that reduce and undermine the forces    ability to handle their traditional missions  We should be giving the Army    Guard the billions of dollars in equipment it needs to respond to    emergencies at home  not forcing the Guard to leave its equipment in Iraq    and then providing no backfill  We should be making sure that insightful    and experienced Guard leaders have a voice in key debates  not keeping the    Guard out of vital discussions and then trying to pay for the enormous costs    of the Iraq war by cutting corners on the needs of our citizen soldiers and    our citizen airmen  If we do not take steps to strengthen and protect the    Guard and their ability to respond here at home  we are going to see States    resort to private contracting    that is right  private contractors    to    maintain a baseline level of response capabilities when they are needed to    help a State in a crisis  Who do you want at a time of local need  Do you    want Blackwater  or do you want the Nations Adjutants Generals and the    outstanding men and women from among our neighbors who wear the uniforms of    the National Guard  And do we really want this President to be deciding to    press into service in our communities the active military that is already    overstretched  or do we want the home grown National Guard  That is what is    at stake  It is that simple   Some have argued that the changes made to the    Insurrection Act were just a clarification of existing law  They contend    that there is no real expansion of authority  When you change the title of    something  particularly a law  you change its meaning and purpose  That    in turn changes the way we perceive the law and the way it could be    interpreted  Common sense tells us that a mere technical clarification    would not draw the attention of Governors  Adjutant Generals  and local law    enforcement  Why thumb your nose at Governors and local law enforcement for    a mere technical clarification  The idea that the change is just a little    tinkering to the law here  a little touch up to the wording there  is    hogwash   There is certainly something going on that is far more    than just a clarification  As with so much else this Administration has    done  this is a raw expansion of Presidential power  It is certainly not an    expansion of power that should be granted without thoughtful deliberation     and without extensive consideration of the far reaching consequences  That    is why Senator Bond and I have sponsored bipartisan legislation to repeal    the changes and to restore the Insurrection Act to it its original form  Today we begin to shed light on this change in law  I    thank our distinguished witnesses for being with us  I appreciate all of    you taking the time to testify today  and we look forward to your testimony
