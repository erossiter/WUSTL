       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Testimony Of Former DOJ White House   Liaison Monica Goodling Before The House Judiciary Committee                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Testimony Of Former DOJ White House Liaison Monica Goodling    Before The House Judiciary Committee    May 23  2007  It is curious that yet another senior     Justice Department official claims to have limited involvement in     compiling the list that led to the firings of several well performing     federal prosecutors  What we have heard today seems to reinforce the     mounting evidence that the White House was pulling the strings on this     project to target certain prosecutors in different parts of the country        It is deeply troubling that the crisis of     leadership at the Department allowed the White House to wield undue     political influence over key law enforcement decisions and policies  It     is unacceptable that a senior Justice Department official was allowed to     screen career employees for political loyalty  and it confirms our worst     fears about the unprecedented and improper reach of politics into the     Departments professional ranks   As Congress continues its oversight to     pull back the curtain on the politicization of the Justice Department      it is abundantly clear that we must do all we can to get to the truth     behind this matter and the role White House played in it
