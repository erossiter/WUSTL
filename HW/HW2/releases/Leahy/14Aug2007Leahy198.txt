                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy Urges White House To Work With     Congress    To Accommodate For Testimony  Documents     About U S  Attorney Firings And Politicization Of The Department Of     Justice MONTPELIER  Vt   August 14  2007   Senate     Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Tuesday sent a letter     to President Bush urging him to work with Committee members to reach a     final agreement for the testimony of key officials in the ongoing     investigation into the mass firings of federal prosecutors and the     politicization of hiring and firing within the Department of Justice  The Leahy letter requests a meeting with President     Bush to discuss the firings  in which evidence indicates White House     political operatives were involved  The White House has prevented key     officials  including Karl Rove  from appearing before congressional     oversight committees  and has limited the testimony of others with     claims of executive privilege  The text of the letter is below             August 14  2007 The Honorable George W  Bush    The White House    1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President  For the last several     months  I have been seeking the voluntary cooperation of the White House     with the efforts of the Senate Judiciary Committee to get to the bottom     of the scandal surrounding the firing of so many of the United States     Attorneys you had appointed  If  as the testimony has indicated  this     is about extending improper political influence into our justice system     and then misleading Congress and the American people about that     political corruption of law enforcement  I hope you would agree this is     a grave matter   The accumulated evidence     shows that the list of those to be fired was compiled based on input     from the political ranks in the White House and that the reasons     publicly given for these firings were contrived as part of a cover up      Recently during his sworn testimony  Attorney General Gonzales himself     contrasted these politically motivated firings with the replacement of     other United States Attorneys for legitimate cause   I have sent numerous     letters to your White House counsel to no avail  For example  in a May     16 letter to Fred Fielding I outlined some of the indications of Karl     Roves involvement  Yet  all of my good faith efforts have been     rebuffed  The stonewalling leaves me and the Senate Judiciary Committee     with few options other than considering citations for contempt of     Congress against those who have refused to provide relevant testimony     and documents to the Congress   Senator Specter has     urged me to write to you directly and suggest that we sit down together     to work out our differences with respect to this matter  That is the     purpose of this letter   Respectfully    PATRICK LEAHY    Chairman
