       Senate OKs Farm Bill That Renews MILC Program And Advances A Wide Range   Of Other Vermont Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                        Senate OKs Farm Bill         That Renews MILC Program         And Advances A Wide Range         Of Other Vermont Priorities            WASHINGTON  Friday        Dec  14     The U S  Senate Friday passed a five year Farm Bill       that advances key Vermont agriculture  anti hunger and       environmental priorities  championed by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt          The bills Vermont related features include renewal and       improvement of the MILC safety net program for dairy farmers        greater Vermont access to farmland conservation programs that       have become integral to the cleanup of Lake Champlain  more       support for food banks  and more funding to help farmers make       the transition to the booming organic sector       The bill goes next       to a House Senate conference committee that will negotiate       between the separate bills passed by the Senate and the House to       produce a final version  Leahy  the most senior member of the       Senate Agriculture Committee  will be a leading conferee in       those negotiations        So far  so good        said Leahy  We have cleared every hurdle  including a       filibuster  Vermonts priorities rank high in this bill  and in       the negotiations ahead I will do all I can to keep it that way        Renewing and strengthening the MILC program is especially       important to our state  and Im especially pleased that this       bill would expand full coverage to 90 percent of Vermonts dairy       farms  We need to keep the safety net in place so it will be       there when farmers need it       Leahy said the       improvements in the Farm Bills conservation programs will help       limit phosphorus runoff into Vermonts streams  rivers  and Lake       Champlain  These conservation programs  which partner with       farmers  have become important building blocks for cleaning up       the Lake  he said       Leahy  the father of       the national organic standards and labeling program  noted that       organic farming has become the fastest growing sector of       American agriculture and is especially robust in Vermont  This       bill is welcome news to farmers who want to make the costly       transition to organics  he said       Below are Vermont       highlights of the Farm Bill passed by the Senate             Vermont Highlights      Senates 2007 Farm Bill         Extension  Expansion Of MILC Program      More Funds For Lake Champlain Cleanup      Another Boost For Vermonts Organic Sector         DAIRY      The 2007 Senate Farm       Bill will extend the MILC  Milk Income Loss Contract  program       for the life of the farm bill  2008 2012   In addition the       program will be expanded in two important ways  Senator Leahy       made this possible earlier this year by crafting and enacting       the funding baseline for an extension of the MILC program  then       followed through in including legislation to extend and expand       the program in the Senates version of the Farm Bill         1  Payment       percentage        In 2002 when the MILC program was established  whenever the       federal minimum price for fluid milk in Boston fell below  16 94       per hundred weight  participating dairy farmers were eligible       for a payment on 45 percent of the difference  In the Fiscal       Year 2006 Omnibus Reconciliation Bill  the payment rate was       reduced to 34 percent in order to make it possible to extend the       program until the Farm Bill could be rewritten in 2007  The       2007 Senate Farm Bill will restore the original 45 percent       payment rate for the MILC program   There is no comparable       provision in the House passed Farm Bill        2       Eligibility Increase  Currently producers are eligible       to receive MILC payments on 2 4 million pounds of production per       year  approximately 125 cows   The 2007 Senate Farm Bill will       increase the eligibility to 4 15 million pounds per year        approximately 225 cows   Of Vermonts approximately 1100       dairies that average about 120 cows per operation  nearly 90       percent of Vermonts farms now would be fully eligible under the       Senate Farm Bill   No comparable provision in the House bill                             Dairy Product       Price Support   The 2007 Senate Farm bill establishes       individual product prices for cheddar cheese  butter  and nonfat       dry milk                    Commodities        The bill extends the current farm       safety net through the 2012 crop year  retaining current base       acres and establishing base acres for newly eligible crops        Target prices for crops are rebalanced and direct payments are       maintained  as are fruit and vegetable planting restrictions                         Average Crop       Revenue          A new Average Crop Revenue option for farmers  including       fixed payment rates  recourse loans  and a state level revenue       program for covered commodities and peanuts  is included in the       Senate bill                    Payment       Limitations   The bill reforms current payment       limitations  including provisions to directly attribute payments       to program beneficiaries  and it eliminates the controversial       three entity rule             CONSERVATION LAKE CHAMPLAIN CLEANUP      Agricultural conservation        responsible stewardship and environmental quality are important       to Vermonts farmers and communities and continue to be high       priorities for Senator Leahy in the 2007 Farm Bill  Several       years ago as chairman the Agriculture Committee  Leahy forged       the first Green Farm Bill which created partnerships between       farmers and environmental goals  and since then the Farm Bill       has become the most significant ongoing nationwide funding       source for conservation and environmental quality efforts such       as the cleanup of Lake Champlain  Several of Leahys       conservation initiatives began as pilot programs in Vermont        proved themselves  and since then have expanded nationwide        Much of the available funding in the 2007 Senate Farm Bill for       Vermont will be directed to addressing the water quality       challenges in the Lake Champlain Basin  This crucial funding       will be added to the more than  100 million Senator Leahy has       already secured in Lake Champlain cleanup funds                     Environmental       Quality Incentive Program  EQIP         A program created by Senator Leahy in the 1996 Farm Bill  EQIP       has quickly become a major factor in the ongoing efforts to       clean up Lake Champlain  Phosphorus levels are one of the       foremost challenges in the restoration of Lake Champlain  and       EQIP helps producers implement new practices that reduce the       phosphorus loading in the Lake and its tributaries  Funded in       the Senate Farm Bill at more than  1 27 billion a year  the       program will continue to help producers comply with the State of       Vermonts water quality regulations and assist dairies in       implementing environmentally beneficial changes in their       operations                     Farmland       Protection Program  FPP           The highly successful and popular Farmland Protection Program       was created by Senator Leahy in the 1996 Farm Bill and grew out       of Vermonts Farms for the Future program  Preserving       Vermont s agricultural lands helps to combat urban sprawl and       keeps Vermont farms viable  Funded at  97 million a year in the       Senate Farm Bill  FPP will provide matching funds to       helppurchase development rights to keep productive farms in       agricultural uses  Total FPP enrollment in Vermont since       inception of the program is 40 000 acres                    15 Million Small       State Minimum     The Regional Equity provision       sponsored by Senator Leahy in the 2002 Farm Bill will be       continued and increased from  12 million to  15 million a year       per state  This Leahy effort helps bring more Farm Bill       resources to Vermont and other Northeastern states  This Leahy       provision requires that each state receive an allocation       of at least  15 million a year in the following working lands       conservation programs  EQIP  FPP  Grassland Reserve Program  and       the Wildlife Habitat Incentive Program  This small state       minimum guarantees that states like Vermont will receive the       necessary program funding to better help farmers in their       stewardship of the land                    Agricultural       Management Assistance  AMA    An important       program in Vermont  AMA provides  20 million a year in mandatory       funding to agricultural producers to voluntarily address issues       such as water management  water quality and erosion control  by       incorporating conservation into their farming operations                   Public Access        The bill will create a new  20       million grant program for states that run programs to encourage       owners of private land to allow public access for       wildlife related recreation such as hunting  fishing  and       birding              ORGANICS     As the father of the national       organic standards and labeling program and author of the 1990       Organic Foods Production Act  Senator Leahy has remained organic       agricultures leading champion and has again made the further       development of organic agriculture a top priority in the       Senates Farm Bill  Vermont has taken a strong leadership role       in transiting to organic agriculture and now leads in the nation       on a per capita basis in organic farm conversions  now with       more than 500 organic operations  more than 200 are dairies  In       Vermont and elsewhere across the country  organic agriculture       also is beginning to create major new export opportunities for       U S  farm products                    Organic       Certification Cost Share   The 2007       Senate Farm Bill provides  22 million in guaranteed funding for       a national organic certification cost share program to assist       producers of agricultural products in obtaining certification       under the National Organic Program established by Senator Leahy       under the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990  Each producer       will be eligible for a reimbursement of up to 75 percent of the       costs of certification  not to exceed  750 annually  Last year       Vermont producers received  165 000 under this Leahy led effort       to assist organic certification                    Organic       Conversion Assistance   In addition to assisting with the       costs of organic certification  the 2007 Farm Bill will expand       eligibility of the Environmental Qualities Incentives Program        EQIP  see above        to directly assist producers defray the substantial costs of       transiting to organic production  During a required three year       conversion process  producers often struggle to complete the       conversion to organic production  This new initiative will       offer producers up to  20 000 per year for up to four years of       financial assistance to help in the conversion to organic       production                    Organic Data       Collection   The Senate Farm Bill will provide        5 million in mandatory funds to ensure that data on the       production and marketing of organic agricultural products is       included in USDAs collection of data about agricultural       production and marketing  This mandate and these funds are       vital in establishing adequate crop insurance coverage for       organic crops in the future                   Organic Research        The Senate Farm Bill makes a major commitment for the first       time to funding research on organic agriculture  The bill            provides  80 million in new mandatory funds for organic       agriculture research and extension    to enhance the ability of       organic producers and processors to grow and market organic       food  feed and fiber                   Organic Crop       Insurance Reform        The bill will bar USDA from charging unnecessary and       unwarranted premium surcharges on organic crop insurance       policies             NUTRITION     The nutrition title of the Senate       Farm Bill contains crucial anti hunger programs such as the Food       Stamp Program and The Emergency Food Assistance Program        Senator Leahy has long led on these programs  which extend an       essential safety net to millions of Americans and thousands of       Vermonters  During 2006  an average of more than 47 000       Vermonters received Food Stamps each month  The bill also       includes initiatives to encourage better health and nutrition       for children and seniors and to support self sufficiency and       food security in low income communities                         Strengthening Food       Purchasing Power of Low Income Vermonters        When calculating the Food Stamp help an individual or family       receives  the rules of the program allow a standard deduction       for the cost of such items as housing  utilities and       transportation  A decade ago  the standard deduction was frozen       at  134  a move that has caused significant erosion in the       purchasing power of Food Stamps as costs for these items have       risen and benefits have not kept pace  The 2007 Senate Farm       Bill increases the standard deduction from  134 to  140 and       indexes it to inflation  ending the erosion of benefits and       increasing Food Stamp assistance for the majority of       participating families                    Working Families       with Childcare Expenses     Food Stamp rules       allow households to deduct up to  175 per month for the cost of       childcare  but this deduction has not been adjusted in more than       a decade and now covers only about a quarter of the monthly cost       of childcare in the United States  To better support working       families  the 2007 Senate Farm Bill will eliminate the existing       cap on the deductibility of childcare expenses                   Food Stamp Asset       Reform     Despite broad agreement about the       importance of family savings  the Food Stamp asset test has       remained largely unchanged since established in 1977 and fails       to exempt tax preferred savings accounts from the current asset       limit  To encourage savings among low income families  the 2007       Farm Bill will increase the current asset limit to keep pace       with inflation and exempts tax preferred education and       retirement accounts from counting against the asset limit                         The Emergency Food       Assistance Program  TEFAP      TEFAP provides       commodities for distribution to food banks across the country        which then distribute those commodities to community food       providers  The Farm Bill will provide more than  460 million in       mandatory commodity purchases for distribution through food       banks                    Fruit and       Vegetable Program     To promote child health and       nutrition  the Senate Farm Bill expands the Fresh Fruit and       Vegetable Program to include every state in the country        targeting those benefits to low income children  The proposed       funding level would ensure that Vermont receives at least  2 25       million a year to assist in providing free fresh fruits and       vegetables to children at school                   Senior Farmers       Markets and Community Food Projects   Funding for two       programs fathered by Senator Leahy    the Senior Farmers Market       Program  which provides vouchers for WIC recipients and       low income seniors to use at farmers markets   and Community       Food Projects   which promote self sufficiency and food security       in low income communities   is increased by  10 million       annually in assured funding in the Senate Farm Bill  In       Vermont  Community Food Project grants have supported the       farm to school projects which increase access to fresh  healthy        local foods              ENERGY RENEWABLE ENERGY                     Rural Energy for       America Program   Funded in the Senate Farm Bill at        260 million  this program  previously       called Section 9006    the Renewable Energy Systems and Energy       Efficiency Improvements Program  offers grants and       loan guarantees to agricultural producers and rural small       businesses to help with purchasing renewable energy systems and       to make energy efficiency improvements  The program will also       fund energy audits and will provide technical assistance to       farmers to help them become more energy efficient and to use       renewable energy technology and resources on the farm  Since       the 2002 Farm bill  this program has helped to fund the building       of several energy efficiency projects in Vermont  as well as a       number of  anaerobic digester       projects in Vermont                   Manure to Energy       Facilities   Vermont is at the forefront of       demonstrating that power derived from manure is quickly evolving       from an alternative fuel experiment to a promising new industry        bolstered by high oil costs and by new laws that restrict       harmful gas emissions and require the use of renewable energy        The Senate Farm Bill will create a new grant and loan guarantee       initiative within the Rural Energy for America Program  focused       solely on building and evaluating on farm and community based       animal manure to energy facilities  such as methane digesters        Funded at more than  40 million in the bill  this effort will       help Vermont create more homegrown energy while also reducing       the potentially negative impacts on water and air quality                   Bioenergy       Production     The Senate Farm Bill provides  227       million to initiate dedicated biomass crop production through       incentive payments to farmers to cover production  harvesting        transport and storage costs for advanced biofuels  Biomass       technologies are some of the innovative alternative energy       sources that could be used in Vermont that both minimize       greenhouse emissions  while reducing the nations dependence on       foreign oil                   Rural Energy       Systems Renewal   This is a new program to help       communities assess their energy systems and formulate strategies       for improvements  By keeping energy costs low  this initiative       will help Vermont move toward a cleaner  more sustainable energy       future  This program builds upon Vermonts existing work as the       nation s first statewide provider of energy efficiency services                         Regional Bioenergy       Crop Research   The bill creates a regional crop       research program of side by side bioenergy crop experiments at       10 dispersed land grant universities  funded at  45 million        The crop experiments are to include all appropriate biomass       species  including woody biomass species that will help to       establish best management practices that could be used in       Vermont for growing bioenergy crops                   Community Wood       Energy   The Senate Farm Bill creates a new       Community Wood Energy Program that is a perfect fit for Vermont        offering competitive  cost share grants for communities to       supply public buildings with energy from sustainably harvested       wood              SPECIALTY CROPS      Vermont is the       nations largest producer of maple syrup and a major Northeast       producer of apples  potatoes  eggs  honey  vegetables  Christmas       trees and greenhouse nursery products                   Specialty Crop       Block Grants        The 2007 Senate Farm bill includes  365 million in new       mandatory funds to make block grants to Vermont and other states       to support specialty crop production  marketing and       development              FORESTRY                     Community Forest       and Open Space Conservation Program   While chairman of       the Agriculture Committee  Leahy created the first Forestry       Title in a Farm Bill and has crafted several forestry       initiatives in the years since then  The latest is Leahys new       Community Forest and Open Space Conservation Program in the       Senates Farm Bill  which will provide matching funds to help       local governments or nonprofit groups acquire town forests  In       Vermont  where private forests are threatened by sprawl and       fragmentation  this new Leahy program will help to protect       forestlands that are economically  culturally and       environmentally important to their communities  Lands acquired       through this program will also provide much needed public access       for recreational activities  including hunting and fishing                         National Forest       Priorities   The 2007 Senate Farm Bill will       establish national priorities to guide federal and state efforts       in private forest conservation  including  conserving and       maintaining working forest landscapes for multiple uses        protecting forests from threats to forests and with forest       health  and enhancing public benefits from private forests                         Comprehensive       Statewide Forest Planning     The comprehensive       statewide forest planning program established in the Senate Farm       Bill will provide Vermont with both financial and technical       assistance to develop and implement a new statewide forest       resource assessment and plan  which will identify critical       forest resources  incorporate existing Vermont forestry plans        and identify how our plans connect with larger regional forestry       needs             RESEARCH      The nations       investments in agricultural research  extension  and education       have not kept pace with the challenges Vermont and the nation       face in agriculture  and during this Farm Bill year  various       proposals to breathe new life into the research system at USDA       have been considered and incorporated into the Senate Farm       Bills research title                   Organic Research        The organic agriculture sector is       fast approaching  20 billion in annual sales and continues to       grow at approximately 20 percent every year  Yet funding at       USDA for research on organic production issues lags far behind       conventional crop research  The 2007 Senate Farm Bill dedicates        80 million in new mandatory research funds for organic       agriculture at USDA                   Coordinated       Research          The bill will formalize the coordination between USDAs in house       research agency    the Agricultural Research Service    and the       newly created National Institute of Food and Agriculture  to       facilitate more efficient use of resources                   Improvements in       Research     This research title also offers the       first step in building a robust research  extension and       education system that is responsive to stakeholders  ensures       that funding goes to areas of greatest need  and emphasizes the       best science to keep U S  producers competitive  rural       communities productive  and consumers healthy             RURAL DEVELOPMENT                     Priority for       Vermont   The Rural Economic Partnership Zone        REAP  designation for Vermonts Northeast Kingdom is extended       through the life of the 2007 Senate Farm Bill  That designation       offers the Northeast Kingdom access to additional federal       funding for business development  job creation  housing  and       water and sewer infrastructure projects from USDA Rural       Development and adds priority points to applications for funding       from many other federal agencies  Since 2001  more than  31       million dollars from Farm Bill programs have been directed to       the Northeast Kingdom  most of those investments have come from       funds specifically set aside for the REAP Zone                        Broadband   In too       many of Vermonts rural communities  access to adequate       broadband coverage is still unavailable  The 2007 Senate Farm       Bill reforms the USDA broadband access program to ensure the       funds available will be employed to provide new broadband       development  The bill will make  25 million available annually       to provide loans and loan guarantees to allow rural consumers to       receive high speed  high quality broadband services                             Value Added Market       Development Grants   Knowing the importance of enabling       producers to capture more of the value of their commodities        this bill provides  26 million per fiscal year through 2013 for       value added initiative grants  This will increase participation       in the program by allowing broader standards of eligibility so       agricultural producer groups and business ventures largely owned       by producers can compete for grants designed to develop       value added products or markets  The provision also encourages       grants to be used to assist in the development of       agricultural based renewable energy sources                      Water and       Wastewater Grants   The 2007 Senate Farm Bill provides        135 million in mandatory funds to address the backlog of       pending wastewater grants currently held in each state  Vermont       applications for water and waste water grants and loans still       pending at the end of this fiscal year will be eligible for       these funds                      Grants to       Broadcasting Systems        The Grants to Broadcasting Systems program authorizes grants       to statewide private nonprofit public television systems  whose       coverage areas are predominantly
