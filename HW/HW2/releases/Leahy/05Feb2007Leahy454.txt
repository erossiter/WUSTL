       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Genocide And The Rule Of   Law                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     Committee On The Judiciary Subcommittee On Human Rights And The Law     Hearing On Genocide And The Rule Of Law     February 5  2007  This is the first hearing of our newly      established Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  I want to      commend the Subcommittee Chairman  Senator Durbin  who was      instrumental in the decision to establish this Subcommittee and      whose concern for these issues is longstanding and deeply rooted   It is our intention that this      Subcommittee will closely examine some of the important and      difficult legal issues that have increasingly been a focus of the      Judiciary Committee  Many derive from actions taken by this      Administration over the last five years  Its policies of declaring      persons enemy combatants  imprisoning them incommunicado      indefinitely in isolated and dehumanizing conditions without charge       and denying them lawyers or access to the courts until forced to do      so by the Supreme Court  make our work particularly necessary        The United States played the key role      in the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  Our      Bill of Rights and our independent judiciary have been models for      other nations for more than two hundred years    Justice Jacksons role at the      Nuremberg trials  and our support of war crimes tribunals for      perpetrators of genocide and crimes against humanity in the former      Yugoslavia  Rwanda  and Sierra Leone are part of a tradition of      which we can be proud    During the last five years  Americas      reputation has suffered tremendously  Some of our ability to lead      on human rights issues has been needlessly and carelessly      squandered  Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have tarnished that role and      that tradition  And so has  I believe  our refusal to join the      International Criminal Court  indeed  the Administrations efforts      to undermine the Court  after our nation played a central role in      the negotiations on the Rome Treaty  The secret prisons that the      President confirmed last year and this Administrations role in      sending people to other countries where they would be tortured have      led to condemnation by our allies  to legal challenges and to      criminal charges    One of the reasons the image of our      country has been so damaged during recent years is because the world      believed that we stood for something better  They hold us to a      higher standard  and they want us to live up to our own ideals  as      do we all  When we fall short of that standard it is not only our      reputation that suffers  it is the cause of justice everywhere that      also suffers   In Darfur we see the tragic replay of      suffering and death  Hundreds of thousands of innocent people      killed  or raped  or tortured  or forced to flee the ashes of their      homes  This is the topic of todays hearing    I thank our witnesses  who include a      representative from the Justice Department  a Senator from our ally      Canada  who served as a military officer in the United Nations      mission in Rwanda  a distinguished professor and legal expert  and      an activist who moves us to see the right and  I hope  do what is      right  We will be confronted with the horrific consequences of the      failure to act to stop genocide  What happened in Rwanda was  I      believe  among the most egregious failures of the international      community to protect human rights since the Cambodian genocide of      the 1970s  We cannot allow that kind of horror to be repeated        I commend Senator Durbin for his role      in seeking  at every opportunity  additional humanitarian aid and      funding for international peacekeeping troops in Darfur  I will do      what I can  as well    We need to ask what more can be done      to convince the Sudanese Government to disarm the militias that are      responsible for the genocide and to allow the United Nations to      deploy additional troops to buttress the African Union force  I      know Senator Durbin has some ideas  and I look forward to working      with him   We also need to determine whether our      own laws provide adequate authority to prosecute  in the United      States  acts of genocide by non U S  nationals that occur outside      this country  whether in Darfur or anywhere else     I thank our witnesses for arranging to      be with us and look forward to their testimony
