       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Divisive Judicial Nominees Take   Precedence Over The Nation s Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Divisive Judicial Nominees Take Precedence     Over The Nation s Priorities     June 9  2005  Last month 80 American service men and      women died in Iraq along      with more than 700 Iraqis  This week there are reports that the      Army  National Guard and Marines are not meeting their recruitment      goals in spite of the bonuses and benefits being offered  The price      of gasoline  prescription drugs  health care and so many essentials      for American working families are rising much faster than wages   The Washington Times      reported this week that the rate of increase in the Consumer Price      Index doubled in the last year  This week we learn that General      Motors is planning to lay off another 25 000 workers and that other      companies are not expanding or even worse  downsizing  The report      of only 78 000 jobs created last month was back to the dismal levels      that have characterized so many months during this Administration      and the losses of manufacturing jobs continues its steady drip       Millions are suffering and dying in Africa and the British Prime      Minister visited to urge greater efforts to help   This week  the Republican leadership      in the Senate continued to force the Senate to expend precious days      debating none of these matters  Instead  the Senates time has been      focused almost exclusively on this Administrations divisive and      contentious judicial nominations  For the last several months and      for many days and weeks over the last few years  the work of the      Senate has been laid aside by the Republican leadership in order to      force debate after debate on these divisive nominations      Putting the      American People First  Among the matters the Senate has      neglected this week in order to devote its attention to this and      other controversial nominations are many issues that concern the      American people  That is the choice made by the Republican      leadership  Democrats are right when we urge that the Senate put      the interests of the American people first by working to reduce gas      prices  make health care more affordable  create new and better jobs      and give our veterans and their families the support they need and      deserve   Among the measures being neglected is      consideration and passage of the NOPEC bill  S  555  This is      bipartisan legislation  Our lead sponsors are Senator DeWine and      Senator Kohl  Other      Senate Republican sponsors include Senator Grassley  Senator      Specter  Senator Coburn and Senator Snowe  With the increase of      gasoline prices by almost 50 percent during the Bush Presidency       with Americans having to pay so much more each week to get to work       drive their kids to school and just to get around to conduct the      daily business of their lives  the Republican leadership of the      Senate is ignoring a substantial burden on American working      families    This week  the national average price      for a gallon of regular gasoline was  2 12  In  Vermont  gas is slightly less      expensive  but still a hefty  2 08 per gallon  Just a year ago the      price was  1 92  When President Bush took office it was  1 46 a      gallon  And the unnecessary burden on our working families is not      limited to the price of gasoline  Last week there are reports in      Vermont that home heating oil prices will be up another 30 percent      this fall and winter   The artificial pricing scheme enforced      by OPEC affects all of us  and it is especially tough on our      hard working Vermont      farmers  Rising energy expenses can add thousands of dollars a year      to the costs of operating a 100 head dairy operation  a price that      could mean the difference between keeping the family business alive      for another generation or shutting it down   With summer coming  many families are      going to find that OPEC has put an expensive crimp in their vacation      plans  Some are likely to stay home  others will pay more to drive      or to fly so that they can visit their families or take their      well deserved vacations    Americans deserve better  and if the      White House will not intervene to abate this crisis  then Congress      must act  It is past the time to hold hands and exchange kisses      with Saudi princes who artificially inflate the price of gasoline       The Presidents jawboning with his Saudi friends has proven      unsuccessful  It is now time to act  but the Senate  under the      Republican Majority Leader  is choosing instead to revisit another      extreme judicial nomination that has already been considered        The production quotas set by OPEC      continue to take a debilitating toll on our economy  our families       our businesses  our industry and our farmers  Last year  and again      earlier this year  the Judiciary Committee voted to report favorably      to the full Senate the bipartisan NOPEC bill  which is short for No      Oil Producing and Exporting Cartels Act  S 555  Our legislation      would apply Americas      antitrust laws to OPECs anti competitive cartel  It would prohibit      foreign states from working together to limit production  set prices      or otherwise restrain the trading of petroleum and natural gas when      such actions affect the United States  It would give the United      States Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission      authority to enforce the law through antitrust actions in federal      courts  Why not give the Justice Department the clear authority to      use our antitrust laws against the anti competitive  anti consumer      conduct in which the OPEC cartel has engaged  A successful action      would not only enjoin such anti competitive conduct but could result      in fines and penalties that would go to the Crime Victims Fund        We should take up that bill  debate it      and pass it without further delay  The many days of the Senates      time allocated to the provocative nuclear option and to      controversial judicial nominees come at the expense of our taking up      the NOPEC bill on behalf of the American people  This bipartisan      bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee more than a year ago       in April of last year  It was reintroduced this year and reported       again  in April of this year  It has been stalled on the Senate      Business Calendar for too long  It is a bipartisan initiative that      could help in the fight to reduce gasoline prices now and heating      oil prices in the fall and winter  It deserves a vote  Why not      have an up or down vote on this measure without further delay by the      Republican leadership    Another consequence of the Republican      leaderships fixation to carry out this Presidents attempt to pack      the federal courts with activist jurists may be much needed asbestos      compensation reform  For more than three years I have been working      on asbestos reform to provide compensation to asbestos victims in a      fair and more expedited fashion  Chairman Specter and I have      worked closely on S         852  the FAIR Act  It  too  is pending on      the Senate Business Calendar  It was successfully reported in a      bipartisan effort last month  Chairman Specter deserves enormous      credit for this achievement  which was slowed significantly by the      extensive debate on contentious nominees and the nuclear option in      the last few months  We have been working in good faith to achieve      bipartisan legislative progress on this issue  We have done so      despite criticism from the left and the right  After the bill was      successfully reported by the Committee  Senator Hatch called it the      most important measure the Senate would consider this year for the      American economy  It  too  is stalled on the Senate Business      Calendar    Senate consideration of the asbestos      compensation reform bill will take some time  This week would have      been a great time to begin that consideration and build on the      momentum we have achieved in our effort to provide compensation to      asbestos victims  Sadly  statements like this one calling for      Senate consideration may be the only mention of the important      asbestos compensation reform bill on the Senate floor this week or      even this month    There are many  many items that need      prompt attention  The Armed Services Committee completed its work      on the Department of Defense Authorization bill  Why the Republican      leadership is delaying Senate consideration of the Defense      Authorization bill I do not understand  At a time when we have      young men and women serving their country in combat zones around the      world and here at home we are confronting the fallout from      recently recommended base closings  I would have thought the Defense      Authorization bill would be a priority    The Senate Energy Committee      successfully completed its consideration of an Energy bill and has      reported it to the Senate with a strong bipartisan majority       Despite its balance and the bipartisan vote  the Senate Republican      leadership has foregone consideration of the Energy bill this week      in favor or more debate on more contentious nominees     Let me mention another matter that      comes to us from the House of Representatives that deserves timely      attention  Just before Memorial Day  the House passed the Stem Cell      Research Enhancement Act  H R  810  This is another bipartisan      effort that deserves our attention  This is a bill with 200 House      sponsors  led by      Congressman Castle and Congresswoman DeGette  It passed with 238      votes  The critically important research this legislation would      authorize on embryonic stem cells  which would otherwise be      discarded  holds great promise and hope for those with family      members suffering from debilitating disease and injury  More      effective treatments for Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease  for      diabetes  for spinal cord injuries  and for many other diseases and      conditions are all possibilities  This is vital work  critical      research and its authorization by the Senate is now being shunted      aside by the Republican leadership in favor of contentious      nominations    In addition  while the Administration      continues to talk about its unsound efforts that would weaken Social      Security  there is sensible bipartisan legislation we should be      considering  the Social Security Fairness Act  S 619  This is a      bill that Senators Collins  Boxer   Feinstein and a number of us have      cosponsored over the years to protect the Social Security and      retirement of police officers  Those on the front lines protecting      all of us from crime and violence should not see their Social      Security benefits reduced because they have historically      participated in separate retirement benefit programs  That needs      fixing and this week would be an appropriate time to take that      Senate action   These are merely examples of some of      the business matters the Republican majority of the Senate has cast      aside to force more debate on more contentious nominees  The Senate      could be making significant legislative progress on an agenda that      would result in much needed and tangible relief to the American      people on a number of important fronts  We could be acting to lower      gas prices  authorize actions against illegal cartels  make asbestos      compensation efficient and effective  authorize vital scientific      research  provide fairness to police officers and to make health      care more affordable  create new and better jobs and give our      veterans and their families the support they need and deserve       Instead  the Republican leadership of the Senate continues its      narrow focus on helping this Administration pack the federal courts      with extreme nominees    For more than four years we have seen      this Administration and Republican congressional leadership ignore      the problems of Americans in its single minded effort to pack and      control the federal courts  Unemployment  gas prices  the number of      uninsured  the nations budget and trade deficits were all lower      when President Bush assumed office  Due to Republican Senate      obstruction of more than 60 of President Clintons moderate and      qualified judicial nominees  judicial vacancies were much higher       During the last four years there has been quite a turnaround       Unemployment has increased by 21 percent  The price of gas has      skyrocketed by almost 50 percent  The number of uninsured Americans      has increased by 10 percent  The budget deficit has decreased by a      total of  663 billion  and the trade deficit has increased 53      percent  Of course the budget has gone from projected trillions in      surpluses to trillions in projected deficits with annual deficits      now at record levels of more than  350 billion a year for years to      come  With unemployment going up  the price of gas going up  the      number of uninsured going up  the budget and trade deficits going      up  American families look to us in Washington for relief  and we      are letting them down  focusing on a few extreme judges   One of the few things that has      decreased in the last four years is the number of vacancies on our      federal courts  Four years ago the vacancy rate on our federal      courts was nearly 10 percent  Today it is half that at 5 percent       At the end of the last session of Congress  we had reduced vacancies      to the lowest level  number and rate in decades  since the Reagan      Administration  Regrettably the Administration has grown the      judicial vacancies this year by not working with the Senate and      failing to nominate to 30 existing vacancies  In fact  so far this      year the President has sent us only one new nomination  and the      calendar has turned to June    Still  in spite of the      Administrations failures this year  95 percent of the federal      judiciary is filled  And 96 percent of this Presidents judicial      nominees have been confirmed  210 confirmed judges to date  The      record of Democrats is one of working hard to confirm 100 of this      Presidents nominees in the 17 months that we held the Senate      majority and the Senate has now confirmed 210 judges in the 53      months of this presidency  These are the realities  Yet all the      Senate Republican leadership wants to talk about is judicial      nominees and all it wants to do is try to assist this      Administrations efforts to pack the courts
