Hurricane Katrina on Wednesday focusing on the growing    crisis of violent crime in the city of New Orleans and the Gulf region    following Hurricane Katrina    Violent crime in New Orleans has reached    near epidemic proportions and emerged as the most serious threat to its    recovery since the storm  In the first three months of this year     violent crime is up more than 100 percent compared to the same time a    year ago  said Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    New    Orleans has lost nearly half its population since the storm  but the    number of murders  armed robberies  and assaults are on track to match    totals from before Katrina  In just the last 10 days  there have been 8    more murders  bringing the total to more than 90 so far this year    Senator Mary Landrieu   D La    who    announced a comprehensive plan earlier this year to combat violent crime    in the region  testified before the Committee on Wednesday  along with    Senator David Vitter   R La    and various law enforcement officials    from the region     Statement Of Sen     Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   Hearing On Rising Violent Crime In The Aftermath Of Hurricane Katrina   June 20  2007    When Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans    and the Gulf Coast nearly two years ago  no one knew the extent of the    devastation  or how long it would take to recover from this tragedy  As    we all know now  the federal government s emergency response was    inadequate  uncoordinated  and left far too many to suffer far too long    after the storm  Today  the Committee examines the latest challenge to    recovery from Katrina    the growing crisis of violent crime in the City    of New Orleans   Violent crime in New Orleans has reached    near epidemic proportions and emerged as the most serious threat to its    recovery since the storm  In the first three months of this year     violent crime is up more than 100 percent compared to the same time a    year ago  New Orleans has lost nearly half its population since the    storm  but the number of murders  armed robberies  and assaults are on    track to match totals from before Katrina  In just the last 10 days     there have been 8 more murders  bringing the total to more than 90 so    far this year    The murder rate per capita is now the    highest in America  more than 20 percent higher than in the any other    major city  At its current rate  New Orleans has 12 times as many    homicides as New York City  3 times as many as Philadelphia  and twice    as many as Washington  D C  The crisis is so severe that National    Guardsman and state police have been brought in to help patrol the city    streets    The criminal justice system was battered    by Katrina and is now strained to the breaking point  The New Orleans    police department has lost more than 500 active officers since the storm       that s roughly 30 percent of the force  The police department    continues to lose more than 15 officers a month to retirement     resignation  and the inability to hire and train new recruits  The    courts  prosecutors  and police often work out of temporary facilities     as the Police Commissioner and the District Attorney s offices still    rely on FEMA trailers for office space  Only four of 11 jail facilities    in the city have been reopened  and  in some cases  temporary FEMA    facilities are even used to house inmates  Just this year  the city    reopened its crime lab in a rented facility  but it still has a current    backlog of more than 1 600 cases  and only one fingerprint examiner and    one firearms examiner for the entire city    In its weakened condition  the criminal    justice system has struggled to keep order and bring justice to    offenders  Last year  there were more than 160 murders in the city  and    so far  only one murder case has led to a conviction    just one  The    police have only brought a quarter of those cases to the district    attorney to be charged  and the office has accepted only half of those    for prosecution  In the remaining 20 odd cases  securing convictions    has become increasingly difficult with the lack of forensic    capabilities  delays in court proceedings  and the reluctance of    witnesses to come forward where the system cannot protect them from    retaliation  And the problem is not unique to murder cases  In more    than 3 000 criminal cases last year  the charges had to be dismissed and    suspects released  at least temporarily  where in many cases indictments    could not be brought within 60 days  as required by Louisiana law  The    overall conviction rate is among the lowest in the country     There can be no question that restoring    order and security to the streets of New Orleans must be among our    highest priorities in the rebuilding effort for Louisiana and the Gulf    region  Unfortunately  the response of this Administration to this    crisis has often been too little  too late  And while the Administration    has written a blank check for the war in Iraq  it cannot seem to find    the necessary support for those who need it in New Orleans and the Gulf    coast here at home    Federal funds for rebuilding can be    structured in ways that make it impossible for the cities and towns in    the region to get the help they need  Too often  federal agencies    require prepayment or partial payment by local communities  which is    impossible where the tax base has been decimated  and there are no funds    to even start work on projects  In fact  much of the assistance this    Congress has authorized for those in need after Katrina remains unused     and far too many are still waiting for the federal help we have    promised  This is also true for those working to restore the criminal    justice system in New Orleans    Two weeks ago  Attorney General Gonzales    announced a new violent crime program in response to the second year of    FBI statistics showing violent crime is increasing nationally     Unfortunately  this program included no money at all for new state or    local police officers on our streets  And regrettably  Attorney General    Gonzales failed to even mention the violent crime problem in New    Orleans  which is clearly among the most serious in the Nation   Over the last six years  the    Administration has abandoned any commitment to the COPS program  which    in the 1990s was the model for reducing violent crime to historical lows    in this country  In fact  the COPS program is widely credited with    reducing the murder rate in New Orleans by 30 percent    its lowest rate    ever   from 1995 to 1999  But as this Administration defunded the    program  effectively taking more and more cops off the street  the    murder rate in New Orleans predictably rose to higher and higher levels    until Hurricane Katrina    So far  the largest federal response to    rising violent crime in New Orleans has come at the insistence of    Congress  and in particular it has come from the leadership of Senator    Mary Landrieu  one of the witnesses the Committee will hear from this    morning  We welcome Senator Landrieu and her colleague from Louisiana     Senator Vitter  In January of this year  Senator Landrieu announced a    10 point plan to combat violent crime in the region  and she laid out a    roadmap to restore the criminal justice system in New Orleans and    Louisiana by giving help directly to those who need it most  She called    for measures that I have long supported  such as an emergency COPS    grants to restore the police officer ranks and immediate block grant    funding to restore drug rehabilitation services  She called for the    Administration to speed up its reconstruction projects for criminal    justice facilities  And she called for the Department of Justice to    increase the number of federal agents assigned to New Orleans     Following her lead  in the past few    months  the Department of Justice announced plans to send 20 more    federal agents to New Orleans and the region  and to hire six more    federal prosecutors  And we learned just last week    after this    hearing was announced    the Justice Department released  5 million in    new Byrne grant funding for law enforcement in Louisiana  some of which    can be used for New Orleans  This new support is welcome and needed     but it is a small step in longer journey to restore the police    department to a robust force that is needed to patrol the city s    streets  and help local prosecutors and investigators raise the    historically low conviction rates  We need to do more  and we can do    more   There is a clear roadmap for success in    battling violent crime in cities  such as New Orleans  and Congress must    continue to show the Administration the way forward on this issue  With    Senator Landrieus leadership  Congress has already provided  50 million    for law enforcement reconstruction in Louisiana  which was part of the    supplemental appropriations bill signed into law just this month  The    Administration can now follow the path proven to reduce violent crime in    the past  by supporting full re authorization of the COPS program and    using these newly committed funding to hire and train new police    officers in New Orleans  rebuild the city s courts and jails  and make    their criminal justice system even better than it was before the storm      I hope todays hearing will be a step    toward recovery for the Gulf region  and send a signal to this    Administration that we can fight violent crime in this country by    working cooperatively with our state and local law enforcement    partners  Only then can we bring back the vitality and pride of one of    our Nation s greatest treasures  the City of New Orleans and the Gulf    coast region  and make it a secure and prosperous home again for all its    citizens
