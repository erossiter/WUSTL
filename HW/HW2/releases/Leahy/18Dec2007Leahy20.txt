       Leahy  Hatch  Berman  And Issa Introduce Bipartisan  Bicameral   Legislation To Give Fair Compensation To Musical Artists                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy  Hatch  Berman  And       Issa  Introduce Bipartisan        Bicameral Legislation       To Give Fair Compensation To Musical Artists     WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Dec  18        2007   Leading members of the Senate and House Judiciary       Committees Tuesday introduced bipartisan  bicameral legislation       to end an exemption benefiting traditional  over the air       broadcasters and ensure that performing artists are compensated       when their sound recordings are used  Webcasters  satellite       radio providers and cable companies compensate artists for use       of their sound recordings  but conventional radio stations do       not       Legislation was introduced in the       Senate by Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and       Sen  Orrin Hatch  R Utah   a senior member and former chairman       of the panel  and in the House by Rep  Howard Berman  D Calif          chairman of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts  the       Internet and Intellectual Property  and House Judiciary       Committee member Rep  Darrell Issa  R Calif    Senate Judiciary       Committee member Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and Rep  John       Conyers  D Mich    the chairman of the House Judiciary       Committee  are also co sponsors of the measures  The       introduction of the bipartisan legislation follows hearings in       both the Senate and House Judiciary Committees earlier this year       to discuss performance rights for artists       The bills would end the       broadcaster exemption  and provide that artists be paid for use       of their sound recordings  Both bills would also provide relief       from rates agreed to for use of the sound recordings for       noncommercial radio stations  including public  educational  and       religious stations  by giving those stations the option of a       nominal  annual flat fee  The bills provide similar relief for       commercial stations whose annual revenue is under  1 25 million        roughly 77 percent of all music radio stations  Finally  the       bill ensures that the public performance rights of songwriters       or copyright owners of musical works are not harmed       Radio stations pay songwriters       for the right to broadcast the music they have composed  The       work of songwriters is promoted by the air play  but no one       seriously questions the right of the songwriter to be paid for       the use of his or her work  But the performing artist is not       paid by the radio station  said Leahy  The time has come to       end this inequity  I want to ensure that the performing artist        the one whose sound recordings drive the success of broadcast       radio  is fairly compensated       There is a symbiotic relationship       between musicians and broadcasters  said Hatch  You cant have       one without the other  and both make significant contributions       to our culture and economy  We need to recognize performance       rights  and we want to ensure this legislation is fair to both       the broadcasters and the artists        With introduction of this bill  we have taken the first step to       provide artists  musicians  and labels with compensation for       their contribution tothe music we hear over the radio  said       Berman  Its only fair that we work toward parity for the       different technology platforms that deliver that music  but we       still have a long road ahead of us  We have only started the       lengthy process of addressingsongwriter concerns  broadcaster       issues and greater parity       The right of performing artists       to make a living off the use of their creativity and innovation       should be protected  said Issa  As the music industry       continues to change  it is time that all radio pays performing       artists for the use of their intellectual property       Today we take the first step       toward finally giving artists and musicians their fair due        said Conyers  They are the people who bring the music to life       and should no longer be overlooked  My decision to take a       leading role to remedy this inequity in no way alters my       commitment to working with the songwriters to ensure that their       rights and compensation are protected       The Senate and House Judiciary       Committees are expected to consider the legislation next year                     Statement of Senator       Patrick Leahy  On Introduction of the        Performance Rights Act of       2007  December 18  2007     Today  Senator Hatch and I are        once again  introducing important intellectual property       legislation together  We are introducing the Performance Rights       Act of 2007 for a very simple and clear reason  artists should       be compensated fairly for the use of their work         I am an avid music fan  Music       entertains  enlightens  and inspires us  Much of the music       enjoyed by most Americans  including myself  was first heard on       traditional  over the air radio  There is no question that       radio play promotes artists and their sound recordings  there is       also no doubt that radio stations profit directly from playing       the artists recordings        When radio stations broadcast       music  listeners are enjoying the intellectual property of two       creative artists  the songwriter and the performer  The       success  and the artistic quality  of any recorded song depends       on both  Radio stations pay songwriters for a license to       broadcast the music they have composed  That is proper  and       that is fair  The songwriters work is promoted by the air       play  but no one seriously questions that the songwriter should       be paid for the use of his or her work        But the performing artist is not       paid by the radio station  The time has come to end this       inequity  Its historical justification has been overtaken by       technological change  the economics of the radio industry of       years past has been superseded by entirely new business models        Webcasters compensate performing artists  satellite radio       compensates performing artists  and cable companies compensate       performing artists  only terrestrial broadcasters still do not       pay for the use of sound recordings  Artists should have the       same rights regardless of whether it is a terrestrial       broadcaster or a webcaster using  and profiting from  their       work  Radio play may have promotional value to the artist  but       there is a property right in the sound recording  and those that       create the content should be compensated for its use       In ensuring artists are       compensated  two other principles important to me are reflected       in this legislation  First  noncommercial and small commercial       radio stations should be nurtured  and not threatened by a       change in the law  Second  songwriters  who now are  as they       should be  paid for use of their work should not have their       rights diminished in any way        The legislation we introduce today       on a bipartisan basis  along with companion bipartisan       legislation being introduced today in the House of       Representatives  provides that artists will be compensated by       broadcasters for the use of their work  Noncommercial stations        from Vermont Public Radio which broadcasts Saturday Afternoon       at the Opera  to the campus radio station at St  Michaels       college that plays Those Monday Blues and The Odds and Evens       Jazz Show  have a different mission than commercial stations        and therefore need a different status  one that will subject the       stations only to a nominal flat fee for use of sound       recordings  Commercial radio stations that have a revenue under        1 25 million  which comprises roughly three fourths of all       music radio stations  will also have a flat fee option        Traditional  over the air radio       remains vital to the vibrancy of our music culture  and I want       to continue to see it prosper as it transitions to digital  But       I also want to ensure that the performing artist  the one whose       sound recordings drive the success of broadcast radio  is       fairly compensated                       For Background       Purposes      Performance Rights       Act Of 2007   Section By Section      Sec  1  Short       Title  This Act may be cited as the       Performance Rights Act of 2007       Sec  2        Equitable Treatment for Terrestrial Broadcasts        This section applies the performance right in a sound recording       to all audio transmissions and removes the exemption on paying       public performance royalties currently in place for over the air       broadcasters by amending Sections 106 and 114 of the Copyright       Act        The section also permits       broadcasters to take advantage of the statutory license in       Section 114 by amending subsection 114 j   but does not impose       additional restrictions on the use of the license  Rates for       commercial broadcasters that are not covered by Section 3 will       be set in accordance with subsection 114 f        Sec  3  Special       Treatment for Small  Noncommercial  Educational  and Religious       Stations and Certain Uses  Small commercial       broadcasters    those whose gross revenues are less than        1 250 000 in any given year    will pay  5000 per year for a       blanket license  Noncommercial broadcasters    those stations       that are public  educational  or religious under Section 118          will pay  1000 per year for a blanket license  Such payments       will not be due until the Copyright Royalty Board determines       rates for large commercial broadcasters       Sound recordings used only       incidentally by a broadcaster and sound recordings used in the       transmission of a religious service are exempt         Sec  4        Availability of Per Program License  When       determining rates for broadcasters  the Copyright Royalty Board       shall include a per program license for broadcast stations        Sec  5  No       Harmful Effects on Songwriters  This section       strengthens the provision in Section 114 that preserves the       rights of songwriters and clarifies that nothing in the       Performance Rights Act of 2007 shall adversely affect the public       performance rights of songwriters or copyright owners of musical       works
