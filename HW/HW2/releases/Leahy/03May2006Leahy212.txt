       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Associated Press s Release Of Its   Termination Letter Relating To Chris Graff                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On The Associated Presss Release      Of Its Termination Letter Relating To Chris Graff      Wednesday  May 3  2006  If anything  this letter makes       APs decision all the more difficult to accept and understand   Those of us in public life never       agree with all the news coverage we receive  But within the two       rough and tumble professions of public service and journalism  I       have never heard anything but praise about Chris Graff for his       professionalism and his evenhandedness  and he has earned that       praise   The ironies of censoring       discussion of the publics right to know    during Sunshine       Week  to boot    have already been noted by others     But it must also be noted that AP       itself takes an advocacy position each year during Sunshine       Week  AP bureaus across the country distribute and also produce       materials in which these issues are examined  At a Senate       Judiciary Committee hearing that we recently held  a prominent       AP witness testified  and forcefully    in support of the       publics right to know and of the bipartisan FOIA reform bills       that I have authored and introduced in the Senate with one of       the Senates most conservative Republican members   Earlier this year the American       Society of Newspaper Editors once again asked for my       observations for Sunshine Week  which they distributed to every       newspaper in the country  Making the incidental effort to       ensure that Vermonts editors were aware of this was        apparently  Chris Graffs mistake  in the view of his       supervisor   The letters explanation is all       the more amazing because the piece that I wrote and that Mr        Graff simply called to Vermonts editors attention is all about       the publics right to know  calling on the government to be more       open with the press and the public  Since Sunshine Week  and to       this day  I still have not seen anyone venture forth with any       column arguing otherwise  that the government these days is       sharing too much information with the press and the public
