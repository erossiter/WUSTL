       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On House Committee Report On RNC E Mails                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT                  Media Note     The House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform today released    its interim report on its Investigation of Possible Presidential Records    Act Violations relating to use of RNC e mail accounts by White House    officials  The report found widespread use of RNC e mails by White    House as well as extensive destruction of these RNC e mails over the    years    The    report can be accessed at   Below is Senate Judiciary    Committee Chairman Patrick Leahys comment on the reports findings   Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On The House Committee On Oversight And Government Reform   Report On RNC E Mails   June 18  2007  This Administrations penchant for    secrecy and disdain for oversight seems to know no bounds  It is    troubling that so many senior White House officials  including Karl Rove    and his former deputy Sara Taylor  were engaging in an effort to avoid    oversight and accountability by ignoring the laws meant to ensure a    public record of official government business  This extensive end run    around the laws leads one to wonder what these officials wanted to hide    from the public and Congress    This report indicates that Mr  Rove and    Ms  Taylor were some of the heaviest users of these RNC e mail accounts     and both officials have been linked to a project to fire several    Department of Justice prosecutors that is currently the subject of    congressional investigations  Now that we know more than 100 000 of Mr     Roves secret e mails have not been destroyed  I hope the White House    will respond to my request for any e mails from his account that are    relevant to the Judiciary Committees investigation  I look forward to    Ms  Taylor searching the thousands of e mails from her account in    accordance with a subpoena she was issued last week
