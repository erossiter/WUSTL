       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations     February 1  2007  Today the Senate continues to make      significant progress in its consideration of judicial nominations       The Senate will consider and  I believe  confirm the nominations of      Lawrence Joseph ONeill for the Eastern District of California       Valerie L  Baker for the Central District of California  and Gregory      Kent Frizzell for the Northern District of Oklahoma     When they are confirmed  the Senate      will have granted its consent to 263 of President Bushs nominations      for lifetime appointments to our federal courts  Moreover  with      these three confirmations today  we will have confirmed more of      President Bushs nominations in the 18 months I have served as      Judiciary Committee Chairman with a Democratic majority in the      Senate than in the more than two years when Senator Hatch chaired      the Committee with a Republican Senate majority or during the last      Congress with a Republican Senate majority  This is the 105th      confirmation during my time as Judiciary Chairman   I know some on the other side of the      aisle have tried to raise a scare since I  again  became Chairman of      the Judiciary Committee  They rant as if the sky is falling and we      would not proceed on any judicial nominations  We have proceeded      promptly and efficiently  Last Thursday  the Judiciary Committee      held its first business meeting of the year  We might have met      earlier but for the delay in organizing the Senate from January 4       when this session first began  until the Republican caucus finally      agreed to the resolutions assigning Members to Senate committees on      January 12    The three nominations we consider      today were among the five nominations for lifetime appointments as      federal judges that I included on the agenda at our first meeting       Like the two judges confirmed on Tuesday  Judge ONeills nomination      is for a vacancy that has been designated a judicial emergency by      the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts  All five were among      those returned to the President without Senate action at the end of      last year when Republican Senators objected to proceeding with      certain nominees in September and December last year     Before proceeding  I inquired of each      Member of the Committee whether a hearing was requested on these      nominations this year  I  again  thank all Members of the Judiciary      Committee for working with me to expedite consideration of these      nominations this year  In particular  I extend thanks to our new      Members  the Senators from Maryland and Rhode Island     These nominations were not even sent      to the Senate until January 9  They were considered by the      Committee in a little over two weeks and are being approved by the      Senate in a little over three weeks from their nomination    I have worked cooperatively with      Members from both sides of the aisle on our Committee and in the      Senate to move quickly to consider and report judicial nominations      so that we can fill vacancies and improve the administration of      justice in our nations federal courts  I appreciate the interests      of Senator Chambliss and Senator Isaakson in the confirmation of      Judge Wood  the first judge confirmed this year  Likewise  I was      pleased to be able to respond to the needs of Senator Inhofe and      Senator Coburn by expediting consideration of Judge Frizzell  I      thank Senator Feinstein and Senator Boxer of California for their      efforts on some of these nominations and for working to fill the      vacancies in California   I have long urged the President to      fill vacancies with consensus nominees  The Administrative Office      of the U S  Courts list 57 judicial vacancies  28 of them have been      deemed to be judicial emergencies  So far this Congress  the      President has yet to send us nominees for 17 of those judicial      emergency vacancies    I have also scheduled a confirmation      hearing for next week for additional judicial nominees and another      business meeting at which the Committee may consider still more      judicial nominations  When a Republican chaired the Committee in      1999 and there was a Democratic President  the first hearing on a      judicial nominee was not held until June 16  We intend to hold a      hearing on February 6    I had initially thought that we would      include the nomination of Norman Randy Smith of Idaho to the Ninth      Circuit at that hearing next week  However  with the cooperation of      the Senators from California and the Members of the Judiciary      Committee  I now hope to be able to avoid another hearing on the      Smith nomination   I was pleased when the White House      changed course and nominated Randy Smith for the Idaho seat on the      Ninth Circuit  I had urged President Bush to take this action last      year when he insisted on resubmitting the Smith nomination for a      California seat on the Ninth Circuit  I thank the President for      finally doing the right thing  I will urge the Senate to confirm      his nomination of Randy Smith to the vacant seat on the Ninth      Circuit from Idaho  At long last Senator Craig and Senator Crapo      will then have a judge on that important court from their home      state    Each of the nominees we consider today      has the support of home state Senators   Lawrence Joseph ONeill is nominated      to the U S  District Court for the Eastern District of California       another seat deemed to be a judicial emergency by the Administrative      Office of the U S  Courts  He is a well qualified nominee who has      over 15 years of experience on the bench  seven of them as a      Magistrate Judge on the district court to which he is now      nominated  Before becoming a Magistrate Judge  Judge ONeill spent      nine years as a Fresno County Superior Court Judge and  before that       a decade in private practice  Judge ONeill will bring a valuable      perspective to the federal bench  having served as a police officer      for five years in the city of City of San Leandro  California  He      graduated from law school at the University of California  Hastings      and then clerked for Judge Robert F  Kane on the California Court of      Appeals   Valerie L  Baker  who is nominated to      the U S  District Court for the Central District of California       already has over 20 years of experience on the bench  As a Los      Angeles County Municipal and then Superior Court Judge  she has      handled thousands of cases and has been the recipient of the Alfred      J  McCourtney Trial Judge of the Year Award by Consumer Lawyers of      Los Angeles  After graduating from UCLA Law School  Judge Baker      served as an Assistant United States Attorney and as a commercial      litigator in private practice  Judge Baker was rated unanimously      well qualified by the American Bar Association and has the support      of both her home state Democratic Senators    As a courtesy to Senator Inhofe  I      included the nomination of Gregory Kent Frizzell on the agenda for      Judiciary Committees first executive business meeting last week  I      was glad to see Senator Inhofe say that he was pleased with the      committee action and that Judge Frizell was fast tracked      through  Judge Frizzell is nominated to the U S  District Court      for the Northern District of Oklahoma  He has a decade of      experience on the bench as an Oklahoma District Judge in Tulsa      County  In his 23 years as a lawyer  Judge Frizzell has served as      General Counsel to the Oklahoma Tax Commission and tried more than      25 cases in private practice as a sole practitioner and an attorney      at Jones  Givens  Gotcher  Bogan  P C   representing community      colleges  insurance companies  and other businesses  After      graduating from the University of Tulsa and the University of      Michigan Law School  Judge Frizzell served as a law clerk to Judge      Thomas R  Brett on the court to which he has now been nominated   I congratulate the nominees and their      families on their confirmations today  We continue to make progress      towards filling longstanding judicial vacancies  I intend to do      what I can to ensure that the federal judiciary remains independent      and able to provide justice to all Americans
