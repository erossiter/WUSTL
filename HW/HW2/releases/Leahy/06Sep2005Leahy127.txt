       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Chechnya  A Forgotten War                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy       D Vt         Chechnya  A Forgotten War     September 6  2005 MR  LEAHY  I      rise to speak of Chechnya  a remote part of the world where horrific      crimes and suffering are occurring every day  that has faded from      the newspapers and the minds of many of us here   Contrary to the      myth perpetrated by the Russian Government that the conflict is over      and life in Chechnya is returning to normal  the Russian military      and the militias they support continue to use brutal  even barbaric      tactics  including extra judicial executions  arbitrary detention       kidnappings  rape  and torture  Armed opposition forces are also      terrifying innocent civilians with their indiscriminate attacks       There seems to be no end to this conflict or to the suffering of the      Chechen people   The Bush      Administration has been conspicuously silent about what is      happening  One can only hope that President Bush has expressed      alarm about the atrocities being committed by Russian soldiers in      Chechnya in his meetings or conversations with President Putin  but      there is no indication that if he has it has had any effect  There is      certainly no evidence that the Administration has exerted any real      pressure on President Putin to reign in the Russian military       presumably because it does not want to jeopardize Russias support      for U S  operations in Iraq and combating international terrorism       But contrary to what the Russian Government and some in the Bush      Administration insist  the violence in Chechnya has far more to do      with self determination than with international terrorism  While      acts of terrorism by all parties to the conflict remain common  most      Chechen resistance fighters have taken up arms to seek revenge for      the atrocities and impunity of Russian soldiers   In each of the      last six years  the Foreign Operations Appropriations Act has      included a provision to withhold a portion of our assistance to the      Russian Government unless the President certifies that international      nongovernmental humanitarian organizations are provided full access      to Chechnya  Every year  the Russian Government fails to comply       In the      Senate passed version of the fiscal year 2006 Foreign Operations      Bill  we included  5 million for humanitarian  conflict mitigation       relief and recovery assistance for Chechnya  Ingushetia  and      elsewhere in the North Caucasus region  This funding  in addition      to the  5 million for this purpose in the fiscal year 2005      Supplemental  will provide much needed relief and development      assistance for civilians caught in the midst of this conflict       But it is      essential that this assistance be coupled with a strong message of      concern and condemnation by the Administration  The message should      be loud and clear that war crimes by the Russian military  and by      resistance fighters  must stop   It is obvious      that despite President Putins rosy portrayal of the situation       there is no military solution to the Chechnyan conflict  The only      hope for resolving it is through a process of demilitarization and      political dialogue  and I suspect that will require the active and      sustained participation of a credible third party  such as the      United Nations  This is what the United States should be pressing      for  It is long past time for the White House to stop giving the      Russian Government a free pass on Chechnya
