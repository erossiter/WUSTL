       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Testimony Of General Petraeus And   Ambassador Crocker On The Continued Deployment Of U S  Troops In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt      On The Testimony Of General Petraeus And Ambassador Crocker    On The Continued Deployment Of U S  Troops In Iraq    September 10  2007      The Bush Administration misled the nation into one of the costliest     blunders in our history  wrongly connecting Iraq to the attacks of     September 11  Ever since then they have attacked anyone who has dared     to question their poor judgment  their lack of a coherent strategy and     their incompetence        Six years ago our troops had cornered Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan      Then the Bush Administration diverted our military resources to Iraq      and he slipped away  He remains on the loose today  and terrorism has     increased worldwide  Meanwhile  the war in Iraq has lasted longer than     World War II  squandering hundreds of billions of U S  tax dollars  The     President wants to keep the pedal to the floor in this war  dumping the     Iraq mess onto the next Presidents doorstep       The inescapable reality remains that the Iraqis are no closer today to     any kind of political settlement to end this conflict  No surge of     additional military force will change the situation when the Iraqis     themselves are not willing to make these hard choices  In the meantime      our presence discourages the Iraqis from taking responsibility for their     own future       With no light at the end of the tunnel after more than five years of     war  the answer is not to keep lengthening the tunnel  The answer is to     begin bringing our troops home from the middle of Iraqs civil war
