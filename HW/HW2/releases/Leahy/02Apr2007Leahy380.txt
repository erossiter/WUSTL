       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Supreme Court s Denial Of   Certiorari In Boumediene v  Bush                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comments      Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Supreme Courts Denial Of Certiorari In Boumediene v  Bush     April 2  2007  The      Courts decision today underscores the need for Congress to act      quickly to restore the fundamental habeas protections that were      rolled back as part of last years Military Commissions Act       Congress cannot sit back and wait for the courts to fix this      problem  but should instead pass the bipartisan bill that Senator      Specter and I have introduced that would restore habeas rights to      non citizens  including 12 million legal permanent residents living      in this country  We cannot and should not outsource our legal       moral  and constitutional responsibilities    It      is disappointing that there are not yet the four justices needed for      the Supreme Court to consider the crucial issue of whether our      Constitution allows Congress to deny detainees the habeas corpus      rights that have been a cornerstone of American liberty since the      founding of this Nation  I hope that the Court does decide before      too long to consider the constitutionality of the habeas stripping      provision of last years Military Commissions Act
