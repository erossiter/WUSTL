       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Violence Against Women In Pakistan                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Violence Against Women In Pakistan     October 7  2005  I wish to bring attention to the      appalling human rights abuses against women in Pakistan and to      express my dismay with the recent comments of President Pervez      Musharraf that rape in Pakistan has become an opportunity for women      of his country to make money and emigrate  Victims of rape and      domestic violence in Pakistan and around the world are offended by      these irresponsible remarks    On September 13th President Musharraf      stated the following in an interview with the Washington Post  You      must understand the environment in PakistanThis has become a      money making concern  A lot of people say if you want to go abroad      and get a visa to Canada for citizenship and be a millionaire  get      yourself raped  President Musharraf subsequently denied making      these remarks  but the paper posted an audio link of the interview      on its website  confirming that he had in fact been accurately      quoted   These comments are completely      unacceptable  They are especially so considering the fact that rape      and other acts of violence against women in Pakistan are a      longstanding problem  The U S  State Departments Country Report on      Human Rights Practices for 2004 reported that one out of every two      Pakistani women last year was the victim of mental or physical      violence  That is an astounding number  Additionally  the report      states that husbands frequently beat and even occasionally kill      their wives and that many females are disfigured by intentional      burnings or attacks with acid  So called honor killings  when      husbands murder their wives for alleged infidelity or other acts      deemed to impugn the mans honor  also continue to be a problem in      Pakistan  Yet the perpetrators of these crimes often escape      punishment  Pakistani human rights organizations documented 1 458      cases of honor killings last year  and many more likely went      unreported  A study by Human Rights Watch estimates that a woman in      Pakistan is raped every two hours and that approximately 70 90      percent of women suffer from some form of domestic violence     The terrible stories of two Pakistani      rape victims have been vividly portrayed in moving editorials by New      York Times reporter Nicholas Kristof  From Kristof we first learned      about Mukhtar Mai  who was gang raped in 2002 on the orders of a      council of tribal elders  and also about Dr  Shazia Khalid  a      Pakistani physician who was raped in January 2005 by a military      officer in her place of employment    These stories are tragic  But equally      troubling is the cruel reality that many rape victims in Pakistan      are pressured to drop charges by the authorities  as was the case      for Dr  Khalid  Many who courageously decide to press forward are      ostracized  beaten or even jailed on charges of adultery or      fornication  What we are witnessing is an archaic and twisted      judicial system where too often the victims are punished and the      culprits go free  This practice of blaming and then abusing the      victim is a disgrace    At a time when the Bush Administration      is embracing President Musharraf and giving Pakistan huge amounts of      aid on account of his support for the Administrations policies in      Afghanistan  it should use its influence to press Musharraf to act      immediately to address the rampant abuse of Pakistani women  This      includes abolishing the Hudood Ordinances  a harsh penal code      introduced in 1979 by then dictator General Zia ul Haq to Islamize      the legal system  Unfortunately  President Musharraf has taken few      concrete steps to protect women from this discriminatory and      backward legal system    As we consider the plight of women in      Pakistan and the tremendous obstacles they must surmount  the U S       must take a hard look at the consistency of our own policies       especially with respect to advancing human rights around the globe       I was troubled to hear that the State Department declined to react      to Musharrafs comments  When asked about the interview by a member      of the press  a government spokesman skirted the issue by stating      that The United States Government speaks out very clearly that      violence against women  wherever it may occur  is unacceptable  And      around the world  where this is a problem  we make a point of      speaking out against it   Unfortunately  the Administration is      not practicing what it preaches  The Administration missed an      important opportunity to speak out against a reprehensible      allegation that women are using rape in order to make money and      emigrate  In his inaugural address last year  the President stated      that all who live in tyranny and hopelessness can know  the United      States will not ignore your oppression  or excuse your oppressors       When you stand for your liberty  we will stand with you  I urge      President Bush to live up to his promise to promote democracy and      advance human rights and to not ignore the women of Pakistan
