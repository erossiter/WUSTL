       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Modified Kyl Cornyn Amendment To   The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Modified Kyl Cornyn Amendment  SA 4027      To S 2611  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill     May 17  2006 Senator Kyl      opened debate on this amendment last night by noting that when an      earlier version of this amendment was offered a few weeks ago to      S 2454  it was a somewhat different amendment  I understand and      appreciate this understatement  but I also appreciate that Senator      Kyl and his lead cosponsor Senator Cornyn were willing to compromise      and make improvements to their original text   I want to express      my appreciation to the Democratic Leader  Senator Reid  He was      right to insist that the original version of the Kyl Cornyn      amendment  a much broader version that some senators wanted to      adopt almost immediately when it was introduced a few weeks ago       deserved review and should not be rushed through the Senate to score      political points  He was right  as the latest version of the      amendment attests  In addition  in the immigration debate prior to      the April recess  Senator Durbin recognized and described several      drafting flaws in the original amendment that would have swept in      hundreds of thousands of immigrants  perhaps unintentionally  With      a little time  and thanks to a lot of hard work  the amendment has      been significantly changed  narrowed  and improved  Among the      modifications  the amendment now includes a waiver of its      provisions  It allows the Secretary of Homeland Security to waive      certain conditions of ineligibility to participate in the earned      legalization program in Title VI of the bill  A negative impact on      family members  or humanitarian concerns such as harsh conditions in      the immigrants home country  should allow participation in the      earned legalization program  An aliens failure to obey an order of      deportation may be based upon the aliens trepidation over leaving      behind his U S  citizen children  An immigrant may have had to use      false documents to gain entry into the U S   such as the case of an      asylum seeker who is fleeing persecution  There is a humane      way to treat otherwise law abiding immigrants  This is consistent      with American values  I wish that the Kyl Cornyn amendment could be      modified further so that its exclusions were more specifically      focused on criminals  That is what we have done in our bill and in      underlying law
