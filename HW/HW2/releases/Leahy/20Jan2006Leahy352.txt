       Jeffords And Leahy Push For Fixes To Medicare Drug Benefit Plans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Jeffords And Leahy Push For Fixes     To Medicare Drug Benefit Plans        Senators Say Seniors       Pharmacists And State Coffers     Need Urgent Relief Under Problem Plagued Program  FRIDAY  Jan  20          Less than three weeks into the new Medicare prescription drug      plan  seniors and pharmacists already need relief from the      problem fraught program  say Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Sen  Jim      Jeffords  I Vt    Poor planning for the programs rollout has led      to seniors being overcharged for prescriptions and  in many cases       being turned away from pharmacies without their needed medications       Governors and      legislatures in 26 states  including Vermont  have stepped up to      cover the cost of drugs for seniors who are being denied coverage or      overcharged for their medications  More than 30 000 seniors in      Vermont are being covered by the state at a cost of roughly  245 000      a day  Leahy and Jeffords Friday joined other senators in      introducing a bill to compensate states for their interim efforts to      patch the problems in the flawed federal program   Leahy  Jeffords      and 17 other senators also introduced legislation to offer seniors       pharmacists and counselors assistance in navigating through the      flawed program  The Requiring Emergency Pharmaceutical Access for      Individual Relief  or REPAIR Act  would help ensure that seniors who      have been incorrectly charged premiums or deductibles are      compensated  The bill would reduce Centers for Medicare and      Medicaid Services  CMS  help line wait times and require that CMS      deploy staff to work with State Health Insurance Assistance Program      offices across the country that are helping to enroll seniors in      plans  The bill would also require that prescription drug plans      cover a 30 day supply of transitional medicine  even if the drug is      not ordinarily covered by the plan   Vermonts      seniors are paying the price for the Administrations failure to      properly implement this program  Thats unfair  and its leading to      chaos  said Leahy  With more than two years to prepare for this      start date  it is inexcusable that seniors have been forced to go      without medications or have been dramatically overcharged for their      prescriptions  This legislation would make sure that seniors and      pharmacists are held harmless from the mistakes made by the federal      government in switching beneficiaries to this new prescription drug      plan   I applaud the      state of Vermont for stepping up when the federal government fell      woefully short in administering the new Medicare drug plan  said      Jeffords  The people most affected by this problem  our seniors       disabled and low income citizens  cant afford to have their lives      disrupted by bureaucratic bungling  No one should have to wait even      one day for their medication   As enrollment for      the program began in November  Leahy pressed to add additional      protections for seniors as they made their drug plan choices  That      bill has been brought to the Senate floor in a test vote  and Leahy      and other cosponsors of the bill say they will keep trying until it      passes
