       At Hearing On Iraq Contract Abuses  Leahy Pushes For Accountability                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK     LEAHY            VERMONT          At Hearing On      Iraq Contract Abuses  Leahy Pushes For Accountability   WASHINGTON  Monday       September 18     The Senate Democratic Policy Committee  DPC  held      a hearing Monday on efforts to seek accountability for contracting      abuses in Iraq  The Committee heard from a Halliburton      whistleblower  who described how materials intended to help bolster      the morale of U S  soldiers in Iraq were diverted to benefit the      company  as well as from attorneys for both the whistleblower and      survivors of an April 2004 convoy attack   Senator Patrick Leahy        D Vt    who has led efforts in Congress to target war profiteers       participated in the hearing  Leahy is a senior member of the      Appropriations Committee and its Defense and Foreign Operations      Subcommittees  as well as the ranking Democratic member of the      Judiciary Committee   Earlier this year  Leahy      co sponsored a reform bill that would make it a crime to exploit      taxpayer funded war reconstruction and disaster relief efforts       Leahy introduced a similar bill in 2003  which was passed by the      Senate as part of an appropriations bill  but later torpedoed by the      White House and the House Republican leadership  which stripped out      the Leahy provision    Below is Senator Leahys      statement from Mondays hearing  followed by a recent article in      The Washington Post chronicling some of the contract abuses in      Iraq               Statement of Senator      Patrick Leahy     Democratic Policy Committee Hearing     On Efforts to Seek Accountability for Contracting Abuses in Iraq     September 18  2006  Chairman Dorgan  thank      you for inviting me to participate in this important oversight      hearing on efforts to seek accountability for contracting abuses in      Iraq  This ongoing project is in keeping with the spirit of the      anti war profiteering efforts of the Truman Commission of an earlier      age  and I am pleased to join you and Senators Reid  Dayton and      Bingaman in these oversight efforts    Yesterday  The      Washington Post reported what most Americans already knew       cronyism and political loyalty to the Bush Cheney Administration      trumped expertise and competence in the Administrations      reconstruction policy in Iraq    According to this      report  many who worked for the Coalition Provisional Authority       which ran Iraqs government from April 2003 to June 2004  lacked      vital skills and experience to do the job  Because of this      incompetence  Iraq today is a country that lacks basic services  is      plagued by daily insurgent attacks and is on the brink of a civil      war   Our military commanders      know what is at stake and how waste and fraud undercut the      reconstruction effort that is so essential to success   This past week  in      response to the Marine intelligence report on al Qaeda s gaining a      stronghold in Anbar province  General Chiarelli emphasized that      military strategy alone cannot create the conditions for success       He said that the real heart of the matter is that it is  quote       economic and political conditions that have to improve at Al      Amnbar  as they do everywhere in Iraq  for us to be successful       Contractor fraud undermines these efforts  threatening the safety      and success of our troops  That is why squander in the name of      defense is doubly offensive and doubly harmful    Yet contractor waste       fraud and abuse in Iraq continues  Congress has sent more than a      quarter of a trillion dollars to Iraq with too little      accountability and too few financial controls    From the growing number      of reports that Halliburton and others have defrauded our Government      out of millions of taxpayer dollars  to deeply troubling allegations      that Government contractors have knowingly put their employees in      harms way  it is clear that the Administrations approach to      reconstruction in Iraq has been a formula for mischief  Yet  as      the witnesses here will attest  the Bush Cheney Administration has      allowed this rampant war profiteering in Iraq to go on  at the      expense of our troops and of American taxpayers   To date  the Justice      Department has not brought a single case against a contractor      to recover funds stolen in Iraq  The Bush Cheney Administration and      its allies have also repeatedly blocked the various efforts of many      of us to combat war profiteering    Earlier this year I      again introduced the War Profiteering Prevention Act of      2006 which creates criminal penalties for war profiteers and      cheats who  for ill gotten gain  would exploit the Governments war      and reconstruction efforts in Iraq and elsewhere around the world       I first introduced this bill in 2003  and  for the last three years       the Republican led Congress has repeatedly refused to pass this      legislation    The cronyism and      failures with the reconstruction effort in Iraq raise important      issues for the success of our troops on the ground  It is hard to      win what the military calls the battle for the hearts and minds of      Iraqis when they are still without basic services and watch as      reconstruction funds are being syphoned off by U S  contractors        This is an urgent      matter  often with life or death consequences  We need more      accountability  we must do better  I am pleased that the Democratic      Policy Committee is willing to pursue the truth about the situation      in Iraq and to seek accountability  The American people expect and      deserve a Congress that will do its job              Ties to GOP Trumped Know How Among      Staff Sent to Rebuild Iraq Early U S  Missteps in the Green      Zone  By Rajiv Chandrasekaran     Washington Post Staff Writer     Sunday  September 17  2006  A01      Adapted from Imperial Life in the Emerald City  by Rajiv      Chandrasekaran  copyright Knopf 2006 After      the fall of Saddam Hussein s government in April 2003  the      opportunity to participate in the U S  led effort to reconstruct      Iraq attracted all manner of Americans    restless professionals       Arabic speaking academics  development specialists and war zone      adventurers  But before they could go to Baghdad  they had to get      past Jim O Beirne s office in the Pentagon  To      pass muster with O Beirne  a political appointee who screens      prospective political appointees for Defense Department posts       applicants didn t need to be experts in the Middle East or in      post conflict reconstruction  What seemed most important was loyalty      to the Bush administration       O Beirne s staff posed blunt questions to some candidates about      domestic politics  Did you vote for George W  Bush in 2000  Do you      support the way the president is fighting the war on terror  Two      people who sought jobs with the U S  occupation authority said they      were even asked their views on Roe v  Wade   Many      of those chosen by O Beirne s office to work for the Coalition      Provisional Authority  which ran Iraq s government from April 2003      to June 2004  lacked vital skills and experience  A 24 year old who      had never worked in finance    but had applied for a White House job         was sent to reopen Baghdad s stock exchange  The daughter of a      prominent neoconservative commentator and a recent graduate from an      evangelical university for home schooled children were tapped to      manage Iraq s  13 billion budget  even though they didn t have a      background in accounting  The      decision to send the loyal and the willing instead of the best and      the brightest is now regarded by many people involved in the 3 1 2       year effort to stabilize and rebuild Iraq as one of the Bush      administration s gravest errors  Many of those selected because of      their political fidelity spent their time trying to impose a      conservative agenda on the postwar occupation  which sidetracked      more important reconstruction efforts and squandered goodwill among      the Iraqi people  according to many people who participated in the      reconstruction effort  The      CPA had the power to enact laws  print currency  collect taxes       deploy police and spend Iraq s oil revenue  It had more than 1 500      employees in Baghdad at its height  working under America s viceroy      in Iraq  L  Paul Bremer  but never released a public roster of its      entire staff       Interviews with scores of former CPA personnel over the past two      years depict an organization that was dominated    and ultimately      hobbled    by administration ideologues  We      didn t tap    and it should have started from the White House on      down    just didn t tap the right people to do this job  said      Frederick Smith  who served as the deputy director of the CPA s      Washington office  It was a tough  tough job  Instead we got people      who went out there because of their political leanings       Endowed with  18 billion in U S  reconstruction funds and a      comparatively quiescent environment in the immediate aftermath of      the U S  invasion  the CPA was the U S  government s first and best      hope to resuscitate Iraq    to establish order  promote rebuilding      and assemble a viable government  all of which  experts believe       would have constricted the insurgency and mitigated the chances of      civil war  Many of the basic tasks Americans struggle to accomplish      today in Iraq    training the army  vetting the police  increasing      electricity generation    could have been performed far more      effectively in 2003 by the CPA  But      many CPA staff members were more interested in other things  in      instituting a flat tax  in selling off government assets  in ending      food rations and otherwise fashioning a new nation that looked a lot      like the United States  Many of them spent their days cloistered in      the Green Zone  a walled off enclave in central Baghdad with      towering palms  posh villas  well stocked bars and resort size      swimming pools  By      the time Bremer departed in June 2004  Iraq was in a precarious      state  The Iraqi army  which had been dissolved and refashioned by      the CPA  was one third the size he had pledged it would be  Seventy      percent of police officers had not been screened or trained       Electricity generation was far below what Bremer had promised to      achieve  And Iraq s interim government had been selected not by      elections but by Americans  Divisive issues were to be resolved      later on  increasing the chances that tension over those matters      would fuel civil strife  To      recruit the people he wanted  O Beirne sought r  sum  s from the      offices of Republican congressmen  conservative think tanks and GOP      activists  He discarded applications from those his staff deemed      ideologically suspect  even if the applicants possessed Arabic      language skills or postwar rebuilding experience  Smith      said O Beirne once pointed to a young man s r  sum   and pronounced      him an ideal candidate  His chief qualification was that he had      worked for the Republican Party in Florida during the presidential      election recount in 2000       O Beirne  a former Army officer who is married to prominent      conservative commentator Kate O Beirne  did not respond to requests      for comment  He      and his staff used an obscure provision in federal law to hire many      CPA staffers as temporary political appointees  which exempted the      interviewers from employment regulations that prohibit questions      about personal political beliefs  There      were a few Democrats who wound up getting jobs with the CPA  but      almost all of them were active duty soldiers or State Department      Foreign Service officers  Because they were career government      employees  not temporary hires  O Beirne s office could not query      them directly about their political leanings  One      former CPA employee who had an office near O Beirne s wrote an      e mail to a friend describing the recruitment process  I watched      r  sum  s of immensely talented individuals who had sought out CPA to      help the country thrown in the trash because their adherence to  the      President s vision for Iraq   a frequently heard phrase at CPA  was       uncertain   I saw senior civil servants from agencies like      Treasury  Energy       and Commerce denied advisory positions in      Baghdad that were instead handed to prominent RNC  Republican      National Committee  contributors  As      more and more of O Beirne s hires arrived in the Green Zone  the      CPA s headquarters in Hussein s marble walled former Republican      Palace felt like a campaign war room  Bumper stickers and mouse pads      praising President Bush were standard desk decorations  In addition      to military uniforms and Operation Iraqi Freedom garb       Bush Cheney 2004 T shirts were among the most common pieces of      clothing  I m      not here for the Iraqis  one staffer noted to a reporter over      lunch  I m here for George Bush  When      Gordon Robison  who worked in the Strategic Communications office       opened a care package from his mother to find a book by Paul      Krugman  a liberal New York Times columnist  people around him      stared  It was like I had just unwrapped a radioactive brick  he      recalled       Finance Background Not Required      Twenty four year old Jay Hallen was restless  He had graduated from      Yale two years earlier  and he didn t much like his job at a      commercial real estate firm  His passion was the Middle East  and      although he had never been there  he was intrigued enough to take      Arabic classes and read histories of the region in his spare time  He      had mixed feelings about the war in Iraq  but he viewed the American      occupation as a ripe opportunity  In the summer of 2003  he sent an      e mail to Reuben Jeffrey III  whom he had met when applying for a      White House job a year earlier  Hallen had a simple query for      Jeffrey  who was working as an adviser to Bremer  Might there be any      job openings in Baghdad  Be      careful what you wish for  Jeffrey wrote in response  Then he      forwarded Hallen s resume to O Beirne s office  Three      weeks later  Hallen got a call from the Pentagon  The CPA wanted him      in Baghdad  Pronto  Could he be ready in three to four weeks  The      day he arrived in Baghdad  he met with Thomas C  Foley  the CPA      official in charge of privatizing state owned enterprises   Foley  a      major Republican Party donor  went to Harvard Business School with      President Bush   Hallen was shocked to learn that Foley wanted him      to take charge of reopening the stock exchange  Are      you sure  Hallen said to Foley  I don t have a finance      background  It s      fine  Foley replied  He told Hallen that he was to be the project      manager  He would rely on other people to get things done  He would      be the main point of contact       Before the war  Baghdad s stock exchange looked nothing like its      counterparts elsewhere in the world  There were no computers       electronic displays or men in colorful coats scurrying around on the      trading floor  Trades were scrawled on pieces of paper and noted on      large blackboards  If you wanted to buy or sell  you came to the      exchange yourself and shouted your order to one of the traders       There was no air conditioning  It was loud and boisterous  But it      worked  Private firms raised hundreds of thousands of dollars by      selling stock  and ordinary people learned about free enterprise  The      exchange was gutted by looters after the war  The first wave of      American economic reconstruction specialists from the Treasury      Department ignored it  They had bigger issues to worry about  paying      salaries  reopening the banks  stabilizing the currency  But the      brokers wanted to get back to work and investors wanted their money       so the CPA made the reopening a priority       Quickly absorbing the CPA s ambition during the optimistic days      before the insurgency flared  Hallen decided that he didn t just      want to reopen the exchange  he wanted to make it the best  most      modern stock market in the Arab world  He wanted to promulgate a new      securities law that would make the exchange independent of the      Finance Ministry  with its own bylaws and board of directors  He      wanted to set up a securities and exchange commission to oversee the      market  He wanted brokers to be licensed and listed companies to      provide financial disclosures  He wanted to install a computerized      trading and settlement system       Iraqis cringed at Hallen s plan  Their top priority was reopening      the exchange  not setting up computers or enacting a new securities      law  People are broke and bewildered  broker Talib Tabatabai told      Hallen  Why do you want to create enemies  Let us open the way we      were       Tabatabai  who held a doctorate in political science from Florida      State University  believed Hallen s plan was unrealistic  It was      something so fancy  so great  that it couldn t be accomplished  he      said  But      Hallen was convinced that major changes had to be enacted  Their      laws and regulations were completely out of step with the modern      world  he said  There was just no transparency in anything  It was      more of a place for Saddam and his friends to buy up private      companies that they otherwise didn t have a stake in       Opening the stock exchange without legal and structural changes       Hallen maintained  would have been irresponsible and      short sighted  To      help rewrite the securities law  train brokers and purchase the      necessary computers  Hallen recruited a team of American volunteers       In the spring of 2004  Bremer approved the new law and      simultaneously appointed the nine Iraqis selected by Hallen to      become the exchange s board of governors  The      exchange s board selected Tabatabai as its chairman  The new      securities law that Hallen had nursed into life gave the board      control over the exchange s operations  but it didn t say a thing      about the role of the CPA adviser  Hallen assumed that he d have a      part in decision making until the handover of sovereignty  Tabatabai      and the board  however  saw themselves in charge       Tabatabai and the other governors decided to open the market as soon      as possible  They didn t want to wait several more months for the      computerized trading system to be up and running  They ordered      dozens of dry erase boards to be installed on the trading floor       They used such boards to keep track of buying and selling prices      before the war  and that s how they d do it again  The      exchange opened two days after Hallen s tour in Iraq ended  Brokers      barked orders to floor traders  who used their trusty white boards       Transactions were recorded not with computers but with small chits      written in ink  CPA staffers stayed away  afraid that their presence      would make the stock market a target for insurgents  When      Tabatabai was asked what would have happened if Hallen hadn t been      assigned to reopen the exchange  he smiled  We would have opened      months earlier  He had grand ideas  but those ideas did not      materialize  Tabatabai said of Hallen  Those CPA people reminded      me of Lawrence of Arabia        Loyalist  Replaces Public Health Expert The      hiring of Bremer s most senior advisers was settled upon at the      highest levels of the White House and the Pentagon  Some  like      Foley  were personally recruited by Bush  Others got their jobs      because an influential Republican made a call on behalf of a friend      or trusted colleague       That s what happened with James K  Haveman Jr   who was selected to      oversee the rehabilitation of Iraq s health care system       Haveman  a 60 year old social worker  was largely unknown among      international health experts  but he had connections  He had been      the community health director for the former Republican governor of      Michigan  John Engler  who recommended him to Paul D  Wolfowitz  the      deputy secretary of defense       Haveman was well traveled  but most of his overseas trips were in      his capacity as a director of International Aid  a faith based      relief organization that provided health care while promoting      Christianity in the developing world  Before his stint in      government  Haveman ran a large Christian adoption agency in      Michigan that urged pregnant women not to have abortions       Haveman replaced Frederick M  Burkle Jr   a physician with a      master s degree in public health and postgraduate degrees from      Harvard  Yale  Dartmouth and the University of California at      Berkeley  Burkle taught at the Johns Hopkins School of Public      Health  where he specialized in disaster response issues  and he was      a deputy assistant administrator at the U S  Agency for      International Development  which sent him to Baghdad immediately      after the war  He      had worked in Kosovo and Somalia and in northern Iraq after the 1991      Persian Gulf War  A USAID colleague called him the single most      talented and experienced post conflict health specialist working for      the United States government  But a      week after Baghdad s liberation  Burkle was informed he was being      replaced  A senior official at USAID sent Burkle an e mail saying      the White House wanted a loyalist in the job  Burkle had a wall of      degrees  but he didn t have a picture with the president       Haveman arrived in Iraq with his own priorities  He liked to talk      about the number of hospitals that had reopened since the war and      the pay raises that had been given to doctors instead of the      still decrepit conditions inside the hospitals or the fact that many      physicians were leaving for safer  better paying jobs outside Iraq       He approached problems the way a health care administrator in      America would  He focused on preventive measures to reduce the need      for hospital treatment  He      urged the Health Ministry to mount an anti smoking campaign  and he      assigned an American from the CPA team    who turned out to be a      closet smoker himself    to lead the public education effort       Several members of Haveman s staff noted wryly that Iraqis faced far      greater dangers in their daily lives than tobacco  The CPA s limited      resources  they argued  would be better used raising awareness about      how to prevent childhood diarrhea and other fatal maladies       Haveman didn t like the idea that medical care in Iraq was free  He      figured Iraqis should pay a small fee every time they saw a doctor       He also decided to allocate almost all of the Health Ministry s  793      million share of U S  reconstruction funds to renovating maternity      hospitals and building new community medical clinics  His intention       he said  was to shift the mind set of the Iraqis that you don t get      health care unless you go to a hospital  But      his decision meant there were no reconstruction funds set aside to      rehabilitate the emergency rooms and operating theaters at Iraqi      hospitals  even though injuries from insurgent attacks were the      country s single largest public health challenge       Haveman also wanted to apply American medicine to other parts of the      Health Ministry  Instead of trying to restructure the dysfunctional      state owned firm that imported and distributed drugs and medical      supplies to hospitals  he decided to try to sell it to a private      company  To      prepare it for a sale  he wanted to attempt something he had done in      Michigan  When he was the state s director of community health  he      sought to slash the huge amount of money Michigan spent on      prescription drugs for the poor by limiting the medications doctors      could prescribe for Medicaid patients  Unless they received an      exemption  physicians could only prescribe drugs that were on an      approved list  known as a formulary       Haveman figured the same strategy could bring down the cost of      medicine in Iraq  The country had 4 500 items on its drug formulary       Haveman deemed it too large  If private firms were going to bid for      the job of supplying drugs to government hospitals  they needed a      smaller  more manageable list  A new formulary would also outline      new requirements about where approved drugs could be manufactured       forcing Iraq to stop buying medicines from Syria  Iran and Russia       and start buying from the United States  He      asked the people who had drawn up the formulary in Michigan whether      they wanted to come to Baghdad  They declined  So he beseeched the      Pentagon for help  His request made its way to the Defense      Department s Pharmacoeconomic Center in San Antonio  A few      weeks later  three formulary experts were on their way to Iraq  The      group was led by Theodore Briski  a balding  middle aged pharmacist      who held the rank of lieutenant commander in the U S  Navy       Haveman s order  as Briski remembered it  was  Build us a formulary      in two weeks and then go home  By his second day in Iraq  Briski      came to three conclusions  First  the existing formulary really      wasn t that bad  Second  his mission was really about redesigning      the entire Iraqi pharmaceutical procurement and delivery system  and      that was a complete change of scope    on a grand scale  Third       Haveman and his advisers really didn t know what they were doing       Haveman viewed Iraq as Michigan after a huge attack  said George      Guszcza  an Army captain who worked on the CPA s health team       Somehow if you went into the ghettos and projects of Michigan and      just extended it out for the entire state    that s what he was      coming to save       Haveman s critics  including more than a dozen people who worked for      him in Baghdad  contend that rewriting the formulary was a      distraction  Instead  they said  the CPA should have focused on      restructuring  but not privatizing  the drug delivery system and on      ordering more emergency shipments of medicine to address shortages      of essential medicines  The first emergency procurement did not      occur until early 2004  after the Americans had been in Iraq for      more than eight months       Haveman insisted that revising the formulary was a crucial first      step in improving the distribution of medicines  It was unwieldy to      order 4 500 different drugs  and to test and distribute them  he      said  When      Haveman left Iraq  Baghdad s hospitals were as decrepit as the day      the Americans arrived  At Yarmouk Hospital  the city s largest       rooms lacked the most basic equipment to monitor a patient s blood      pressure and heart rate  operating theaters were without modern      surgical tools and sterile implements  and the pharmacy s shelves      were bare       Nationwide  the Health Ministry reported that 40 percent of the 900      drugs it deemed essential were out of stock in hospitals  Of the 32      medicines used in public clinics for the management of chronic      diseases  26 were unavailable  The      new health minister  Aladin Alwan  beseeched the United Nations for      help  and he asked neighboring nations to share what they could  He      sought to increase production at a state run manufacturing plant in      the city of Samarra  And he put the creation of a new formulary on      hold  To him  it was a fool s errand  We      didn t need a new formulary  We needed drugs  he said  But the      Americans did not understand that  A      9 11 Hero s Public Relations Blitz In      May 2003  a team of law enforcement experts from the Justice      Department concluded that more than 6 600 foreign advisers were      needed to help rehabilitate Iraq s police forces  The      White House dispatched just one  Bernie Kerik       Bernard Kerik had more star power than Bremer and everyone else in      the CPA combined  Soldiers stopped him in the halls of the      Republican Palace to ask for his autograph or  if they had a camera       a picture  Reporters were more interested in interviewing him than      they were the viceroy  Kerik      had been New York City s police commissioner when terrorists      attacked the World Trade Center on Sept  11  2001  His courage  he      shouted evacuation orders from a block away as the south tower      collapsed   his stamina  he worked around the clock and catnapped in      his office for weeks   and his charisma  he was a master of the      television interview  turned him into a national hero  When White      House officials were casting about for a prominent individual to      take charge of Iraq s Interior Ministry and assume the challenge of      rebuilding the Iraqi police  Kerik s name came up  Bush pronounced      it an excellent idea  Kerik      had worked in the Middle East before  as the security director for a      government hospital in Saudi Arabia  but he was expelled from the      country amid a government investigation into his surveillance of the      medical staff  He lacked postwar policing experience  but the White      House viewed that as an asset       Veteran Middle East hands were regarded as insufficiently committed      to the goal of democratizing the region  Post conflict experts  many      of whom worked for the State Department  the United Nations or      nongovernmental organizations  were deemed too liberal  Men such as      Kerik    committed Republicans with an accomplished career in      business or government    were ideal  They were loyal  and they      shared the Bush administration s goal of rebuilding Iraq in an      American image  With Kerik  there were bonuses  The media loved him       and the American public trusted him       Robert Gifford  a State Department expert in international law      enforcement  was one of the first CPA staff members to meet Kerik      when he arrived in Baghdad  Gifford was the senior adviser to the      Interior Ministry  which oversaw the police  Kerik was to take over      Gifford s job  I      understand you are going to be the man  and we are here to support      you  Gifford told Kerik  I m      here to bring more media attention to the good work on police      because the situation is probably not as bad as people think it is       Kerik replied  As      they entered the Interior Ministry office in the palace  Gifford      offered to brief Kerik  It was during that period I realized he      wasn t with me  Gifford recalled  He didn t listen to anything  He      hadn t read anything except his e mails  I don t think he read a      single one of our proposals  Kerik      wasn t a details guy  He was content to let Gifford figure out how      to train Iraqi officers to work in a democratic society  Kerik would      take care of briefing the viceroy and the media  And he d be going      out for a few missions himself       Kerik s first order of business  less than a week after he arrived       was to give a slew of interviews saying the situation was improving       He told the Associated Press that security in Baghdad is not as bad      as I thought  Are bad things going on  Yes  But is it out of      control  No  Is it getting better  Yes  He went on NBC s Today      show to pronounce the situation better than I expected  To Time      magazine  he said that people are starting to feel more confident       They re coming back out  Markets and shops that I saw closed one      week ago have opened  When      it came to his own safety  Kerik took no chances  He hired a team of      South African bodyguards  and he packed a 9mm handgun under his      safari vest  The      first months after liberation were a critical period for Iraq s      police  Officers needed to be called back to work and screened for      Baath Party connections  They d have to learn about due process  how      to interrogate without torture  how to walk the beat  They required      new weapons  New chiefs had to be selected  Tens of thousands more      officers would have to be hired to put the genie of anarchy back in      the bottle  Kerik      held only two staff meetings while in Iraq  one when he arrived and      the other when he was being shadowed by a New York Times reporter       according to Gerald Burke  a former Massachusetts State Police      commander who participated in the initial Justice Department      assessment mission  Despite his White House connections  Kerik did      not secure funding for the desperately needed police advisers  With      no help on the way  the task of organizing and training Iraqi      officers fell to U S  military police soldiers  many of whom had no      experience in civilian law enforcement  He      was the wrong guy at the wrong time  Burke said later  Bernie      didn t have the skills  What we needed was a chief executive level      person        Bernie came in with a street cop mentality  Kerik      authorized the formation of a hundred man Iraqi police paramilitary      unit to pursue criminal syndicates that had formed since the war       and he often joined the group on nighttime raids  departing the      Green Zone at midnight and returning at dawn  in time to attend      Bremer s senior staff meeting  where he would crack a few jokes       describe the night s adventures and read off the latest crime      statistics prepared by an aide  The unit did bust a few kidnapping      gangs and car theft rings  generating a stream of positive news      stories that Kerik basked in and Bremer applauded  But the      all nighters meant Kerik wasn t around to supervise the Interior      Ministry during the day  He was sleeping       Several members of the CPA s Interior Ministry team wanted to blow      the whistle on Kerik  but they concluded any complaints would be      brushed off  Bremer s staff thought he was the silver bullet  a      member of the Justice Department assessment mission said  Nobody      wanted to question the  man who was  police chief during 9 11  Kerik      contended that he did his best in what was  ultimately  an untenable      situation  He said he wasn t given sufficient funding to hire      foreign police advisers or establish large scale training programs  Three      months after he arrived  Kerik attended a meeting of local police      chiefs in Baghdad s Convention Center  When it was his turn to      address the group  he stood and bid everyone farewell  Although he      had informed Bremer of his decision a few days earlier  Kerik hadn t      told most of the people who worked for him  He flew out of Iraq a      few hours later  I      was in my own world  he said later  I did my own thing         2006The Washington Post Company
