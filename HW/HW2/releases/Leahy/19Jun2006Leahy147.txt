       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Commonsense Consumption Act Of   2005                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Commonsense Consumption Act Of 2005  S 908      June 19  2006 Regrettably  on the Senates calendar is      legislation designed to limit the rights of consumers to obtain      justice in their courts  Similar to the medical malpractice bills      that we considered earlier this year  S 908  the so called      Commonsense Consumption Act of 2005  is bad public policy  Ironically  it defies common sense to give      entire industries blanket immunity from potential harms they impose      on Americans  The incentives involved in litigation are one of the      few remaining measures that lead to real corporate responsibility       not to mention accountability  The handful of lawsuits that would      have been barred by this legislation actually resulted in      settlements providing for more nutritious food in our schools  more      accurate labeling for consumers and the removal of harmful trans      fats from some of the foods we eat  A blanket ban on such measures      will lead to more serious health problems like increases in heart      disease and diabetes and other chronic conditions that are taxing      this nations health system   There are many problems with the sweeping      language of this legislation  It would dismiss existing State and      Federal cases  as well as preempt future cases  Sponsors of the      bill claim that it would not prevent false advertising claims but      the language in the bill does not guarantee this result  It      prevents suits against manufacturers  marketers  distributors       advertisers or sellers of specific products but the exception for      false advertising only applies to manufacturers and sellers  Why      should advertisers and sellers be excluded from this exception       They are just as likely to deceive consumers as manufacturers and      sellers  Also  the legal standard will be heightened so that      consumers would be required to prove intentional violation of      Federal or State statutes  rather than simply having to prove      violations of government regulations on advertising and food      safety  Why would we want to give immunity to companies that      violate safety regulations  And why should the injured consumer be      required to prove a corporations intent if it can be proved that      the corporation violated the law  We all know how impossible it is      to prove corporate intent without the extraordinary help of a      whistleblower  And we all know that were it not for citizens      lawsuits  we may never have learned of the harm that big tobacco      companies knowingly caused to so many  for so long  while denying so      much of what they knew  Time and again  the legal system has been      more effective than government watchdog agencies in prying loose      consumer information like that  which we otherwise might never see  This legislation does not create any      alternative method for keeping a check on corporate misconduct that      has a detrimental effect on the health of all Americans  If this      bill passes  American consumers will only be left with the thin hope      that suddenly the Bush Cheney Administration will begin true      regulation of corporations on behalf of American consumers   If we are serious about trying to address the      national health epidemic that is related to obesity  then we should      be considering legislation to clarify food labeling so consumers can      make informed choices  How about legislation requiring nutritious      food in our schools  How about listening to the scientific and      health community about the needless dangers of trans fats in our      food  How about ending cuts in education that lead to the      cancellation of physical education and health courses  Consideration of this corporate immunity      legislation would be especially ill timed in light of the numerous      pressing issues that face this Nation today  The Senate s time      would be better spent debating stem cell research  or the life      saving technologies that would make Americans lives better  We      should also be moving forward with comprehensive immigration reform       reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act  and addressing the horrific      genocide in Darfur  This bill also yet to be subject to committee      consideration  If the Judiciary Committee had considered this      legislation  I am confident we would have amended the sweeping      language of this blanket immunity bill   This legislation favors the interests of      corporations over the health of our children and the health of their      parents  This is not the fix that is needed  Let us direct our      energies towards making American health care better by finding cures      to diseases  making it easier for consumers to make informed      choices  getting more Americans insured and investing in health care      prevention
