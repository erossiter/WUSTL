       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  National Defense Authorization Act For   Fiscal Year 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    National Defense Authorization Act For Fiscal Year 2007    Conference Report    Congressional Record    September 29  2006 Mr  President  I rise to express my grave reservations about certain     provisions of the Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Bill Conference     Report  This legislation poorly handles key provisions related to the     National Guard  which  as the events since September 11th have     highlighted  is critical to our Nations defense  The final conference     report drops the reforms known as the National Guard Empowerment Act  a     bill that would have given the National Guard more bureaucratic muscle     inside the Pentagon  It would have cleared away some of these     administrative cobwebs and given the Guard the seat at the     decision making table that it needs and deserves  It also should concern     us all that the Conference agreement includes language that subverts     solid  longstanding posse comitatus statutes that limit the militarys     involvement in law enforcement  thereby making it easier for the     President to declare martial law  There is good reason for the     constructive friction in existing law when it comes to martial law     declarations    Combined  these moves amount to a double punch against the National     Guard  The National Guard has done so much to protect the security and     safety of our country  Yet the Authorization Bill sends the signal that     we are not interested in truly supporting them  This conference report     says we do not want to address glaring problems that have surfaced     during their increasingly frequent deployments  And  incredibly enough      it says to the Guard that other military forces are better to carry out     tasks here at home  In short  this bill goes in the wrong direction    The Guards Accomplishments   Lets review what the 500 000 men and women of the National Guard do     for the country  The National Guard is essential to the militarys     missions at home and abroad  More than 10 000 members of the National     Guard are currently called up for domestic operations  most along the     border and involved in counter drug operations  Almost 60 000     citizen soldiers are deployed overseas  almost 40 000 involved in Iraq     deployments  Over 6 000 members of the Air Guard are deployed  And lets     remember  that at the high water mark  the Guard made up almost 40     percent of the troops on the ground in Iraq    It is also clear that we are going to need the Guard even more in the     future  Consider the information reported in a New York Times article     from last Friday  The active U S  Army is being deployed at such a high     rate that it appears increasingly likely that the National Guard is     going to need to be tapped once again to make the troop levels    Any way you cut it  the National Guard is absolutely essential to our     Nations defense  We cannot fight our wars abroad  we cannot secure the     country at home  and we cannot response to large scale emergencies     without the Guard    The Need for Empowerment   Given the fact that the National Guard is one of the countrys most     valuable and needed forces  one would think that our leaders in the     Department of Defense would be spending significant time developing     policies and budgets plans that truly support the Guard  For example  I     would think it logical to make the replacement of the Guards aging and     worn equipment a priority  I would think it logical to give the National     Guard a stronger voice in policymaking decisions and in setting     budgetary priorities that affect the National Guard  I clearly see the     benefits of deferring to the Adjutants General and the Nations     governors  those who control and oversee the Guard  when determining how     best to utilize Guard at home during domestic emergencies    Instead of these good policy goals and practices  we have only a long     list of unfair and ill conceived decisions from the Pentagon that do     very little to support the Guard in reality  And these examples are only     the tip of the iceberg    Last December  the Army and the Air Force decided to try to make     precipitous cuts to the National Guard  The Army sought to cut the Army     Guard by almost 17 000 soldiers  while the Air Force drove for     reductions of almost 14 000 airmen  These personnel cuts were made     without consultation with the National Guard Bureau  the States     Adjutants General  and the nations governors  While Congress was     successful in turning those recommendations back  the fact remains that     the active force still desired to balance its budgets at the expense of     the Guard    In late Spring of last year  the Air Force forwarded a list of base     closure recommendations the cut deeply into the Air National Guard  The     closure list took away flying missions in States in which the Air     National Guard is the only Air Force presence in the State  No     consideration was made of this crucial link between local communities     and the armed forces  Nor did the Air Force consider the Air National     Guards homeland security capabilities  Why were such ill advised     recommendations made  The reason is that the Air National Guard was not     involved in the force structure review process    Similarly  in 2002  there was no consultation with the Air National     Guard when the Air Force decided to take away the Air National Guards     B 1 bomber units  which  as a GAO study underscored  were cheaper to     operate  more efficient  and more effective than their active duty     counterparts    Further  since September 11th  a torturous debate has developed in     the Pentagon whenever the National Guard is needed for a large scale     operation at home  such as during Hurricane Katrina  We have learned     that the Guard works optimally at home when it serves under the     command and control of the nations governors  with federal     reimbursement  under Title 32 of the federal code  This Title 32 status     ensures that locally elected officials remain in control of military     forces operating at home  Because the National Guard comes directly out     of these local communities  posse comitatus statutes do not apply  This     Title 32 arrangement has been used most recently to increase security at     the border  but it has previously been used effectively to have the     Guard provide added security at the Republican and Democratic National     Conventions  the G 8 Summit  the nations airports  and around the     Capitol Building in Washington    There seems to be some kind of reflexive reaction within the     Department of Defense against having the Guard and the Governors remain     in control of operations at home  In fact  a sizeable contingent exists     within the Pentagon to have the active duty military control the     National Guard and other military personnel and assets  So  every time     there is a natural disaster or other emergency  the Pentagon engages in     a lengthy debate back and forth about control of the Guard  To date      these debates have led to sensible outcomes  But it should not be so     difficult and uncertain    Finally  the National Guard has little influence at the senior ranks     within the Army and the Air Force  The number of high ranking officers     is completely imbalanced between the Guard and the active forces  While     the National Guard constitutes a high percentage of our total number of     ground troops  it has just a sliver of the overall percentage of three      and four star General officers  And  while the Air National Guard     constitutes a high percentage of the Air Forces mobility assets and a     similarly high percent of its strike assets  the Air Guard has a     negligible share of the high ranking positions  where important     decisions are made    Empowerment  A Sensible Move Ahead   The National Guard Empowerment Act seemed to be a logical response to     these ill advised policy positions and imbalanced bureaucratic     structure  The entire thrust of the legislation rests in increasing the     bureaucratic muscle of the National Guard  The idea behind it is to     prevent some of these ill advised policies from moving forward  More     importantly  the legislation is designed to firmly identify the uses of     the National Guard  ensure the force is ready and equipped for its     critical homeland security missions by bringing its organizational ties     in line with its real responsibilities and accomplishments    Specifically  the legislation  as included in the Senates version of     the Defense Authorization Bill contained four major provisions  First      it would elevate the Chief of the National Guard Bureau from the rank of     Lieutenant General to full General  Second  the Deputy Commander of     United States Northern Command  the military headquarters designed to     oversee military forces used in the United States operationally would be     mandated to come out of the ranks of the National Guard  Third  the     National Guard would be redefined as a joint bureau of the Department     Defense  rather than a branch of Army and the Air Force  enabling the     Guard to maintain its role as the primary military reserve  while     allowing the National Guard to avoid bureaucracy within the Defense     Department  Finally  the National Guard would have formally be tasked     with working with the States to identify gaps in their resources to     respond to emergencies at home    This proposal is not only targeted  but also modest  Our original     legislation  S  2658  the National Defense Enhancement and National     Guard Empowerment Act of 2006  would have additionally placed the Guard     Bureau chief on the Joint Chiefs of Staff and given the National Guard     separate budget authority  Though we still believe these provisions are     important to empowering the National Guard fully  we listened and     understood the objections of other senators  We dropped those provisions     in the amendment to the Defense Authorization bill to reach a consensus     where even more members would agree to the amendment  beyond the already     40 senators who are co sponsoring the baseline legislation    The Defense Authorization Conference      Outcome  Argument Against  And Explanation   We can all acknowledge that the National Guard is essential to our     Nations defense  that there has been some questionable policy making     affecting the Guard in recent years  and that the Empowerment Bill     represents a positive step towards strengthening the Guard  Yet where     does the final Conference Report on the Defense Authorization Bill end     up on Guard Empowerment    Not only does this Conference Report unfortunately drop the     Empowerment amendment entirely  it adopts some incredible changes to the     Insurrection Act  which would give the President more authority to     declare martial law  Let me repeat  The National Guard Empowerment Act      which is designed to make it more likely for the National Guard to     remain in State control  is dropped from this conference report in favor     of provisions making it easier to usurp the Governors control and making     it more likely that the President will take control of the Guard and the     active military operating in the States    The changes to the Insurrection Act will allow the President to use     the military  including the National Guard  to carry out law enforcement     activities without the consent of a governor  When the Insurrection Act     is invoked posse comitatus does not apply  Using the military for law     enforcement goes against one of the founding tenets of our democracy      and it is for that reason that the Insurrection Act has only been     invoked on three  three  in recent history  The implications of     changing the Act are enormous  but this change was just slipped in the     defense bill as a rider with little study  Other congressional     committees with jurisdiction over these matters had no chance to     comment  let alone hold hearings on  these proposals    While the Conference made hasty changes to the Insurrection Act  the     Guard Empowerment Bill was kicked over for study to the Commission on     the National Guard and Reserve  which was established only a year ago     and whose recommendations have no real force of law  I would have never     supported the creation of this panel  and I suspect my colleagues would     agree with me  if I thought we would have to wait for the panel to     finish its work before we passed new laws on the Guard and Reserve  In     fact  we would get nothing done in Congress if we were to wait for every     commission  study group  and research panel to finish its work  I have     been around here over 30 years  and almost every Senator here knows the     National Guard as well as any commission member  We dont need to wait      and we dont need to study the question of enhancing the Guard further      This is a terrible blow against rational defense policy making and     against the fabric of our democracy    Since hearing word a couple of weeks ago that this outcome was     likely  I have wondered how Congress could have gotten to this point  I     can only surmise that we arrived at this outcome because we are too     unwilling to carry out our Article I  Section 8 responsibilities to     raise and support an Army  We have it in our Constitutional power to     organize the Department of Defense  The Goldwater Nicholas Act that     established a highly effective wartime command structure and the     Nunn Cohen legislation that established the now critical Special     Operations Command came out of Congress  If the then stale leadership of     the Pentagon had its way  these two critical bills would never have seen     the light of day  Today  however  the Pentagon is just as opposed to the     Empowerment legislation  and instead of asserting its power  the     Congress is punting  just kicking it down the field and out of play       Also  it seems the changes to the Insurrection Act have survived the     Conference because the Pentagon and the White House want it  It is easy     to see the attempts of the President and his advisors to avoid the     debacle involving the National Guard after Hurricane Katrina  when     Governor Blanco of Louisiana would not give control of the National     Guard over to President and the federal chain of command  Governor     Blanco rightfully insisted that she be closely consulted and remain     largely in control of the military forces operating in the State during     that emergency  This infuriated the White House  and now they are     looking for some automatic triggers  natural disasters  terrorist     attacks  or a disease epidemic  to avoid having to consult with the     governors    A Final Summary   And there you have it    we are getting two horrible policy decisions     out of this Conference because we are not willing to use our     Constitutional powers to overcome leadership that ranges from the poor     to the intemperate in the Pentagon and the White House  We cannot     recognize the diverse ways that the Guard supports the Country  because     the Department of Defense does not like it  simply does not like it       Because of this rubberstamp Congress  these provisions of this     conference report add up to the worst of all worlds  We fail the     National Guard  which expects great things from us as much as we expect     great things from them  And we fail our Constitution  neglecting the     rights of the States  when we make it easier for the President to     declare martial law and trample on local and state sovereignty
