       Senators Dodd  Leahy Join Reps  Lewis And Hulshof To Reintroduce Emmett   Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Senators      Leahy  Dodd Join Reps  Lewis And Hulshof     To Reintroduce Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act   Bill Would Reopen Thousands Of      Unsolved Civil Rights Era Criminal Cases  WASHINGTON  February 8     Senators      Chris Dodd  D CT  and Patrick Leahy  D VT  and        Representatives John Lewis  D GA  and Hulshof  R MO       Thursday reintroduced legislation which would      give the Department of Justice and the FBI the ability to reopen      Civil Rights era criminal cases which have gone cold  The Emmett      Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act was named after teenager Emmett      Till who was murdered and mutilated while on a summer vacation in      Money  Mississippi       in 1955  Public outrage surrounding the case helped to propel the      inception of the modern day Civil Rights movement in America   In many states there are still similar      unsolved Civil Rights crimes on the books  In 1946  a pregnant      African American      woman and her husband driving through Monroe  Georgia       were forced from their car by a mob   They were dragged 50 yards      down a wagon trail and shot while a crowd of 200 people watched      No one      was ever charged for these crimes  Recently  the Georgia Association      of Black Public Officials urged prosecutors to bring charges in the      case    It is critically important that we      work to right the wrongs of the past and bring to justice the people      who perpetrated heinous crimes based solely on racial hatred  said      Sen  Dodd  who introduced a similar bill last Congress  While we      cannot bring back and make whole those who suffered and died at the      hands of racists  we can at least reaffirm our nations commitment      to seek the truth and work to make equal justice a reality   By      shedding light on unsolved civil rights era murders  this bill takes      great strides toward ending our nations quiet game on civil      rights murders  Justice is better served by allowing our nation to      acknowledge past wrongs  including wrongs aided by lax law      enforcement  said Leahy  who serves as Chairman of the Senate      Judiciary Committee  There      is no place for racial violence or political terrorism in a      democracy  We must rededicate ourselves to protecting the full      human equality of all Americans  We start today with this bill that      will ensure we do not let the guilty go unpunished or justice be      denied   These unsolved murders leave a stain      on the integrity of the judicial system in America  said Rep  John      Lewis who was also an original co sponsor of the first bill and has      pushed for reintroduction in this Congress  The credibility of the      government is in question here  These lingering unsolved cases lead      African Americans and other citizens to wonder whether this nation      is truly committed to justice or whether there are times when we      find it convenient to look the other way  That is why it is so      important to bring this chapter of our dark past to a close   It is appropriate that we allocate      the necessary resources to make sure that justice is served  stated      Rep  Hulshof  As a former prosecutor  I believe we must give law      enforcement the necessary tools to aggressively seek those who have      committed these crimes  regardless of the time that has passed   The bill has 57 bi partisan      co sponsors in the House at last count  It would create an Unsolved      Crimes Section within the Department of Justice  an Unsolved Civil      Rights Crime Investigative Office within the FBI  and strengthen      coordinated efforts between federal  state  and local law      enforcement officers and prosecutors to bring these long time      fugitives to justice  Both      offices will focus on prosecuting cases that occurred prior to 1970      and resulted in the death of the victims that still remain unsolved      The bill      requires annual reporting to Congress on the progress made in these      cases and authorizes  11 5 million in annual appropriations to fund      these new services  The Emmet Till Act also provides funding for a      Community Relations Service within the DOJ to work with local      communities to solve these crimes                Below is Senator      Leahys statement on introduction of the bill     Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Introduction Of The Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime      Act     February 8  2007  Today  I am pleased to join Senator      Dodd in reintroducing the Dodd Leahy Emmett Till Unsolved Civil      Rights Crime Act  This bill strengthens the ability of our federal      government to investigate and prosecute unsolved murders from the      civil rights era    I want to thank Senator Dodd for his      leadership and commitment to enacting this meaningful civil rights      bill  And I look forward to working with other Senators as this      bill moves forward   I am also very pleased that the      Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act once again includes the Missing      Child Cold Case Review Act  which I sponsored in the last Congress      to provide the investigative expertise of our Inspectors General in      reviewing the cold cases of missing children    Under current law  an inspector      general s duties are limited to activities related to the programs      and operations of an agency  My bill would allow inspectors general      to assign criminal investigators to assist in the review of cold      case files at National Center for Missing and Exploited Children  NCMEC        so long as doing so would not interfere with normal duties  I      understand that our inspectors general are eager to provide this      assistance  and this measure allows them legal authorization to do      that  These cases need resolution  As parents and grandparents we      all know that and  where our government can provide its resources       it should    The primary thrust of this      bill targets murders from the civil rights era    Nearly fifty two years ago       the brutal murder of Emmett Till  a 14 year old African American      teenager  stirred the conscience of our country  Young Emmett Till      walked into a local country store in Money   Mississippi       to buy some candy and allegedly whistled at the white store clerk       That night  two white half brothers  J W  Milam and Roy Bryant       kidnapped Emmett Till from his great uncles home  Several days      later  his brutally beaten and unrecognizable body was fished out of      the nearby Tallahatchie River  No one was ever punished for this      tragic and brutal murder   Emmett Tills death served      as momentum for change  It inspired a generation of Americans to      demand justice and freedom in a way America had never seen before       During the Civil Rights Movement  the road to Mississippi became      the highway of change for an entire country    Yet the movement had a darker side       Fifty two years after Emmett Tills murder  the families of many      Americans who lost their lives during      the civil rights era are still awaiting justice  We must not forget      their sacrifice  And one way to honor that sacrifice is acting      before the window of time closes  New evidence of cold cases      trickles in while older evidence continues to fade and witnesses      age  We must have a sense of urgency to ensure that justice is      rendered  We cannot afford to wait    The Emmett Till Unsolved      Crime Act would provide the federal government with much needed      tools to expeditiously investigate and prosecute unsolved civil      rights era cold cases  To      accomplish this goal  the legislation      calls for the creation of new cold case units in the Justice      Department and FBI solely dedicated to investigating and prosecuting      unsolved cases that involved violations of criminal civil rights      statutes  resulting in death  and occurring before January 1  1970       This measure also seeks to provide proper coordination between      federal officials and state and local government officials on these      cases   This bill ensures that the      federal government is held accountable by requiring the Justice      Department and FBI cold case units to submit annual reports to      Congress describing which cold cases were selected for further      investigation and prosecution and which were not     By shedding light on unsolved civil      rights era murders  I hope this bill will end our nations quiet      game on civil rights murders  Justice is better served by allowing      our entire nation to acknowledge past wrongs  including wrongs aided      by lax law enforcement  Just this week   The  Washington Post reported      that the briefcase of slain Florida civil rights leader Harry T       Moore  which mysteriously disappeared 55 years ago from a local      courthouse  was found in a barn  We must hold our government      officials more accountable   Progress has been made  According to      a February 4  2007  article in      USA TODAY   entitled Civil rights era killers escape justice  since 1989       authorities in seven states have re examined 29 killings from the      civil rights era and made 28 arrests that led to 22 convictions       including this months arrest of former Klansman James Seale for the      May 2  1964  abduction and killings of Henry Hezekiah Dee and      Charles Eddie Moore    Despite some progress  much remains to      be done  Just how many people died during that period is uncertain       At the National Civil Rights Memorial in Birmingham  Alabama  is      the Civil Rights Memorial Center  where 86 additional names appear      on a wall dedicated to the forgotten others  This bill ensures      that no sacrifice in the pursuit of freedom goes unnoticed   Even today  violence or      the threat of violence serves as a barrier to full and equal      participation in our society  On January 11  2007  the NAACP  asked the FBI to investigate three recent acts of violence      and intimidation against African American mayors  including shots      fired into home of Greenwood  Louisiana s  first black mayor and the      mysterious shooting death of Westlake  Louisiana s  first black      mayor two days before he was scheduled to take office      And two days ago the      Anti Defamation League  which monitors racist hate groups  released      a report showing that Klan      groups have witnessed a surprising and troubling resurgence by      exploiting fears of an immigration explosion    There is no place for racial violence      or political terrorism in a democracy  We must rededicate      ourselves  as a Nation  and as individuals  to protecting the full      human equality of all Americans   We start today by ensuring that the      guilty do not go unpunished  or that justice  even if delayed  is      denied  By passing this bill and enacting it into law  we continue      our march      toward building a more fair and just society
