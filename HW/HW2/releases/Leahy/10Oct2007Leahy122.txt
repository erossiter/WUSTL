       Economic and Community Implications of Northern Border Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                      VERMONT               Statement     of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Committee on the Judiciary    Field Hearing in Newport  Vermont    Economic and Community Implications of Northern Border Security     October 10  2007  Todays Judiciary Committee field hearing in     Newport  Vermont  will focus on the impacts of policies set by the     Department of Homeland Security that have had  are having and will have     severe implications for the social and economic ways of life in border     communities all across our country  I am pleased that a number of     business and community leaders from Vermont are able to join us today to     share their views and testimony with this committee and the people in     Washington   I will start by giving some brief opening remarks     and then turn things over to our witnesses to hear their stories      Hopefully  I will then have time to ask the witnesses about their     statements  Also  without objection  I ask that all written testimony     for this hearing be entered at the appropriate place in the record   Let me take a moment to thank our host today  Mayor    Woody     Guyette  It is always nice to return to Marcelles hometown  and the     city looks great  I would also like to thank representatives from     Senator Sanders staff  Jeff Munger  and Mary Sprayregan from     Congressman Welchs staff  for taking time to be with us today  Senator     Sanders and Congressman Welch have been great partners in Washington on     border issues  And  of course  a special thank you to the citizens of     Canada who have joined us here today  especially the Canadian Consul     General from Boston  Neil LeBlanc   In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks      a number of new border security measures have been put in place  from     constructing border fences  to developing and deploying surveillance     technologies  to adding troops along our borders  all with the     expressed goal of preventing another terrorist incident  We all agree     that we must protect our borders  but we must do it sensibly and     intelligently  It is convenient to forget that most of the 9 11     hijackers entered the United States with legal visas  and some were on     secret watch lists  but not being watched   I am afraid that this Administrations current     policies threaten to fray the social fabric of countless communities     that straddle the border  I have heard from many Vermonters who have     encountered problems at U S  border crossings  from long traffic     backups to invasive searches and questioning to inadequate communication     from federal authorities about new facilities and procedures  Such a     top down approach does not work well in interwoven communities along the     border  where people cross daily from one side to the other for jobs      shopping  and cultural events   Sure  these new procedures have snared some illicit     drug shipments and snared a few criminals  but not many terrorists      Meanwhile  we have needlessly offended our neighbors  sacrificed much of     the traditional good will we have enjoyed  and undermined our own     economy in border communities like Newport  Derby  Richford  Highgate      and Norton  That is why I have worked hard to provide balance and     needed resources along the Northern Border  and I have tried to convey     in Washington something of the special relationship we have with our     Canadian neighbors to the North   Canada has been an important trading partner and     friendly neighbor to Vermont and the United States for more than 200     years  It is in the best interests of both of our countries to keep     those relations as positive and productive as possible  Post 9 11      everyone on both sides of the border recognizes that there are potential     threats and security needs  We have hardened security around the U S      Capitol and the White House and built fences near San Diego  but those     procedures do not work on Canusa Avenue in Beebe Plain or at the Haskell     Free Library and Opera House in Derby Line  Vt   and Stanstead  Que      That is why I am so troubled by the so called     Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  which will require individuals     from the United States  Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean to present     passports or other documents proving citizenship before entering the     United States  This is a dramatic change in the way that border     crossings have been processed in the Western Hemisphere since the Treaty     of Paris set up the international boundary with Canada in 1783   The Departments of State and Homeland Security have     been charged with implementing this law  and they should be coordinating     their efforts with our international neighbors to ensure a smooth     transition at our borders  Unfortunately  as I have detailed to     Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff on several occasions  there are     serious problems in the ways in which their agencies have pushed forward     with implementation of this new initiative before the necessary     technology installation  infrastructure upgrades  and training take     place at our border stations  If these critical features of the     deployment are not in place  we will see severe delays at our border and     law abiding citizens from the United States  Canada  Mexico  and the     Caribbean will have great difficulty moving between our countries  Most     importantly  a hasty implementation without assurances that the     technology to be used is truly effective can result in a less secure     border  The Administrations record on implementing the air     portion of the new passport program is clear  and it has been abysmal      Hundreds of Vermonters have called my office for assistance in salvaging     their travel plans  and I know that Americans from other states have     experienced similar problems  as well  The huge passport backlogs for     air travel are just a taste of the chaos that is likely next summer when     they want to start enforcing passport checks at our land and sea     borders  Those land and sea border crossings account for 10 times more     volume than crossings from air travel   Since DHS and State keep saying that the Western     Hemisphere Travel Initiative is a congressionally mandated program  I     believe they should stop opposing the bicameral and bipartisan     legislation I authored that is now moving through Congress to shift the     new passport requirement date to June 2009  They have been warned     repeatedly that they are not ready  By maintaining the fiction that     they will be ready to implement the largest phase of this program next     January  they are recklessly risking the travel plans of millions of     Americans and the economies of scores of states and communities  Our     borders present security challenges  but the Northern Border is more     than just a security challenge  Its also a great asset to the nation     and to Vermont and other border states  The Northern Border is a     powerful economic engine and focal point for scores of communities      There are clear problems and great risks ahead if our government chooses     one size fits all answers instead of thoughtful  commonsense solutions      This hearing will contribute Vermonts perspectives to the border     security decisions that lie ahead  I look forward to hearing from all of our witnesses     today about the economic impacts they have seen and expect in the     future  I thank them all for taking time from their busy schedules to     be with us today  Everyone recognizes the critical importance of     national security  but when we sacrifice our economic and social ways of     life  Americans lose and the terrorists have taken from us what they     cannot by force of arms
