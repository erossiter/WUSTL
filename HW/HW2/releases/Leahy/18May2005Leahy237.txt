       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Republican Use Of The   Nuclear Option                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Opening Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy      On Republican Use Of The Nuclear Option      May 18  2005   An Abuse Of Power  I trust that everyone understands       the significance of this debate and what the Republican leader       is doing  He has decided to trigger the nuclear option  That       is what this is    The nuclear option is something       any Senate majority could have done at any time over the last 50       years  It boils down to the Republican Senate leaders declaring       that the Senate rules governing filibusters are out of order        The nonpartisan Senate Parliamentarian has indicated that would       violate the Senate Rules  and it would  The nonpartisan       Congressional Research Service has studied the matter and       concluded that this is unprecedented  It amounts to breaking       the Senate Rules  But with a slim majority and the       parliamentary equivalent of brute force  it can be done    The American people ought to       recognize this for what it is  an abuse of power  to advance a       power grab  It is an effort by the White House through the       Republican Senate majority to undercut the checks and balances       of the Senate  They intend to use majority power to override       the rights of the minority    Nor is this an isolated effort        It is part of a sustained effort by this Administration and its       partisan operatives in the Congress to consolidate power in the       Executive  It undercuts the rights of the minority in the       Senate  it undermines the role of the Senate as a check on the       Executive  and it will lead to a Republican rubberstamp on a       less independent judiciary  The constitutional protections of       the American people are at stake in this debate  At stake are       the protections provided for the American people by the Judicial       Branch against overreaching by the political branches  by the       Senate against an aggressive Executive Branch  and by the       minority against the tyranny of the majority     As this debate begins  I urge the       American people to be involved  It is their rights that are at       stake  It is the independence  fairness and nonpartisan       protection of the judiciary that protects their rights that is       being threatened  It is the constitutional check that the       Senate was intended by the Founders to provide  to keep the       Executive from acting like a king  that is being threatened by       curtailing the rights of the minority  This is an exercise in       breaking the rules to change the rules  Note that as this       debate begins  it begins in accordance with the Senate Rules        including Senate Rule 22  That is the longstanding rule that       the Republican majority intends to override at this end of this       process  by parliamentary brute force    The Republican Leader  The Senate is now being threatened       with a fundamental change through a self inflicted wound  In       his masterful work  Master of the Senate  author Robert Caro       recalled an important chapter in the Senates and the Nations       history  Consider the contrast with what is being threatened       today    When Senator Lyndon Johnson of      Texas left the Senate  he had been the most       powerful and successful Majority Leader in history  When he was       elected Vice President with President Kennedy and was preparing       to leave the Senate  he told his prot  g   and successor  Senator       Mansfield of Montana  that he would keep attending the       Democratic caucus lunches and help his successor as Majority       Leader in running the Senate  Senator Mansfield respectfully       said no  Vice President Johnson was no longer a Member of the       Senate but an officer of the Executive Branch  who by means of       that office was accorded the privilege of presiding over the       Senate  What a contrast Senator Mansfields respect for the       separation of powers and of checks and balances is from those in       power today  This White House took an active role in       instituting the present Senate leadership  and this White House       regularly sends Vice President Cheney and Karl Rove to       Republican caucus lunches to give the Senate Republican majority       its marching orders    The current Republican Majority       Leader has announced that he intends to leave the Senate next       year and has made no secret of his intent to run for the       Republican nomination for President  With that in mind  he is       apparently prepared to become the first Majority Leader in       Senate history whose intended legacy would be a significantly       weakened Senate  Many in the current roster of Senate       Republicans are apparently ready to sacrifice the Senates role       in our constitutional system of checks and balances      Republican Senators  It is my hope that our system of       checks and balances will be preserved with a handful of       Republican Senators voting their conscience and standing up to       White House and outside pressures  I know the zealotry of the       narrow special interest leaders who are demanding this       mutilation of the Senates character  I am one of many who have       been the target of their brutal and spurious personal attacks        My hope is that a number of the fine women and men with whom I       am privileged to serve as a custodian of our Nations liberties       will act in the finest tradition of the Senate  One of their       number has come to this floor in recent days to remind all       Senators of senatorial profiles in courage  Sadly  that is what       it will take to avert the overreaching power grab now underway         There have been other recent       threats to our system of government  Republicans partisans in       the House  in a standoff with President Clinton  effectively       shut down the Government in 1995  A few years later the House       impeached a popularly elected President for the first time in       our history  Fortunately  the Senate functioned as was intended       during that trial and rejected those efforts  In 2000 a divided       nation saw an election decided by the successful litigation of       the Republican Party and the intervention of a narrow activist       decision of the Supreme Court to stop vote counting in  Florida  Thereafter we witnessed Senator Jeffords       virtually driven out of the Republican Caucus  We have seen an       aggressive Executive Branch that has been aided by a compliant       congressional majority  If the Senates role in our system of       coequal branches of the Federal Government is to be honored  it       will take Republican Senators joining others in standing up for       the American peoples rights  the independence of the judiciary        the rules of the Senate and the rights of the minority    During the last several days we       have seen the Democratic Leader make offer after offer to head       off this showdown  We have heard stirring speeches from Senator       Byrd and Senator Inouye and Senator Kennedy        Senator Biden  Senator Baucus  Senator Murray  Senator Boxer        Senator Feinstein and others have come to this floor as well to       set the record straight  But this is a setting in which       Democratic Senators alone will not be able to rescue the Senate       and our system of checks and balances from the breaking of the       Senate Rules that the Republican leader is planning to demand        If the rights of the minority are to be preserved  if the Senate       is to be preserved  it will take at least six Republicans       standing up for fairness and for checks and balances    I believe that a number of       Republican Senators know in their hearts that this nuclear       option is the wrong way to go  I know that Republican Senators       with whom I have been privileged to serve for anywhere from two       years to more than 30 years know better  I hope that more than       six of them will withstand the political pressures being brought       upon them and do the right thing and the honorable thing  and       that they will put the Senate first  the Constitution first  and       the American people first  History and those who follow us will       closely scrutinize these moments and these votes  Those voting       to protect the rights of the minority will be on the right side       of history   Like the Senator from  Pennsylvania  I remember President Kennedys publication       of Profiles in Courage  Along with so many Americans  I       remember reading about those Senators who stood up to their       party to vote against the conviction of President Andrew       Johnson  More recently I witnessed the strength it took for       Senator Mark Hatfield  a distinguished Republican  to cast a       vote on conscience against amending the Constitution under       intense and unfair pressures  The Republican Leader is       deliberating taking the Senate to another precipice  It will       take the votes of independent and conscientious Republican       Senators to prevent the fall     Checks and Balances  The Framers of the Constitution       warned against the dangers of such factionalism  undermining       the structural separations of power  Some in the Senate have       been willing to sacrifice the historic role of the Senate as a       check on the President in the area of nominations     Under pressure from the White       House  over the last two years the former Republican Chairman of       the Judiciary Committee led Senate Republicans in breaking with       longstanding precedent and Senate tradition  With the Senate       and the White House under control of the same political party we       have witnessed Committee rule after Committee rule broken or       misinterpreted away  The broken Committee rules and precedents       include the way that home state Senators were treated  the way       hearings were scheduled  the way the Committee questionnaire was       unilaterally altered  and the way the Judiciary Committees own       historic protection of the minority by Committee Rule IV was       repeatedly violated  In the last Congress  the Republican       majority of the Judiciary Committee destroyed virtually every       custom and courtesy that used to help create and enforce       cooperation and civility in the confirmation process  I ask       consent to include a recent article from The Wall Street       Journal noting some of these developments  We suffered       through three years during which Republican staff stole       Democratic files off the Judiciary computer servers  That has       not been helpful to the process  the Senate or the country  It       is as if those currently in power believe that they are above       our constitutional checks and balances and that they can       reinterpret any treaty  law  rule  custom or practice they do       not like or they find inconvenient  It was tragic that the       Committee that judges the judges did not follow its own rules       but bent or broke them to achieve a predetermined result     It was through those means that       divisive and controversial judicial nominees were repeatedly       brought before the Senate in the last Congress  It was through       those abuses of the majority that they acted as handmaidens to       the President to create confrontation after confrontation over       nominees  They dragged the judiciary  which should be above       politics  into the political thicket and did so for partisan       gain    I regret that filibusters have       been necessary in the last two years  I wish Republicans would       not have followed their years of secret holds and pocket       filibusters of more than 60 of President Clintons nominees by       flipping the script and dismembering the rules and traditions of       the Judiciary Committee  I have urged consultation and       cooperation over the last four years  During the 17 months I       chaired the Judiciary Committee  the Senate confirmed 100 of       President Bushs judicial nominees  including a number of       controversial nominees  I proceeded on nominations I did not       support  But the President and his enablers in the Senate would       not take yes for an answer  He rejects our advice but demands       our consent  That is wrong     208 Bush Judicial Nominees Have       Been Confirmed  What the White House ignores is       that President Bush completed his first term with the       third highest total of confirmed judges in our history and more       federal judges on the courts than at any time in our history        The truth is that Senate Democrats have cooperated extensively       in confirming more than 95 percent of this Presidents judicial       nominations  208 of 218  George Washington  the most popular       and powerful President in our history  was not successful in all       of his judicial nominations  the Senate rejected his nomination       of John Rutledge to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court  for       example    The truth is that in President       Bushs first term  the 204 judges confirmed were more than were       confirmed in either of President Clintons two terms  more than       during the term of this Presidents father  and more than in       Ronald Reagans first term when he was being assisted by a       Republican majority in the Senate  By last December  we had       reduced judicial vacancies from the 110 vacancies I inherited in       the summer of 2001 to the lowest level  lowest rate and lowest       number in decades  since President Ronald Reagan was in office   Unfortunately  this President has       chosen confrontation over cooperation  It is mid May and he has       sent only one new nomination to the Senate all year  In       connection with that nomination  Democrats on the Judiciary       Committee have written to the Chairman urging a prompt hearing        We expect that with the support of his home state Senators  one       a Democrat and one a Republican  the nomination of Brian       Sandoval will be added to the long list of Senate       confirmations    But that leaves 30 judicial       vacancies without nominations  Back on April 11  the Democratic       leader and I wrote to the President urging him to work with       Senators of both parties to identify nominees for these       vacancies  I ask consent to include a copy of our April 11       letter in the Record  To date  he has not responded  Instead       he  his Vice President and his Chief of Staff have prodded the       Senate toward triggering the nuclear option   In this area  perhaps above all       others  the President has not acted as a uniter but as a       divider  He has sent the Senate divisive and controversial       nominees  When the Senate debates them and withholds consent        he stubbornly re nominates them over and over again  Rather       than work with us to find consensus nominees  he disparages us       and exploits the issue as a partisan political matter    Senate Designed To Encourage       Consensus  Under our Constitution  the Senate       has an important role in the selection of our judiciary  The       brilliant design of our Founders established that the first two       branches of government would work together to equip the third       branch to serve as an independent arbiter of justice  As       columnist George Will once wrote  A proper constitution       distributes power among legislative  executive and judicial       institutions so that the will of the majority can be measured        expressed in policy and  for the protection of minorities        somewhat limited    The structure of our Constitution       and our own Senate rules of self governance are designed to       protect minority rights and to encourage consensus  Despite the       razor thin margin of recent elections  the majority party is not       acting in a measured way but in complete disregard for the       traditions of bipartisanship that are the hallmark of the       Senate  It has acted to ignore precedents and reinterpret       longstanding rules to its advantage  This practice of might       makes right is wrong  The Senates rules should not be toyed       with like a playground game of King of the Hill  to be changed       at the whim of any current majority   The Senate Majority Leader seems       intent on removing the one Senate protection left for the       minority  the protection of debate in accordance with the       longstanding tradition of the Senate and its Standing Rules  In       order to remove the last remaining vestige of protection for the       minority  the Republican majority is poised to break the Senate       Rules and end the filibuster with the votes of the barest of       majorities  They are intent on doing this to force through the       Senate this Presidents most controversial and divisive judicial       nominees    As the Reverend Martin Luther King       wrote in his famous Letter From A Birmingham Jail  Let us       consider a more concrete example of just and unjust laws  An       unjust law is a code that a numerical or power majority group       compels a minority group to obey but does not make binding on       itself  This is difference made legal  By the same token  a       just law is a code that a majority compels a minority to follow       and that it is willing to follow itself  This is sameness made       legal  Fair process is a fundamental component of the American       system of law  If we cannot have a fair process in these halls       or in our courts  how will the resulting decisions be viewed        If the rule of law is to mean anything  it must mean that it       applies to all equally     Checks and Balances Protect       Against Despotism  No man and no party should be       above the law  That has been one of the strengths of our       democracy  Our country was born in reaction to the autocracy       and corruption of King George  and we must not forget our roots       as a nation of both law and liberty  The best guarantee of       liberty is the  rule of law  meaning that the       decisions of government are not arbitrary and that rules are not       discretionary or enforced to help one side and then ignored to       aid another  James Madison  one of the Framers of our       Constitution  warned in Federalist Number 47 of the very danger       that is threatening our great nation  a threat to our freedoms       from within   The  accumulation of all powers legislative        executive and judiciary in the same hands       may justly be       pronounced the very definition of tyranny   George       Washington  our great first President  reiterated the danger in       his famous Farewell Address To the American People  The spirit       of encroachment tends to consolidate the powers of all the       departments in one  and thus to create  whatever the form of       government  a real despotism    Our freedoms       as Americans are the fruit of too much sacrifice to have the       rules broken in the United States Senate in collusion with the       White House  The effort to appoint loyalists to courts in the       hope that they will re interpret precedents and overturn the       very laws that have protected our most fundamental rights as       Americans is base and wrong  The American people deserve better       than we have seen with the destruction of rule after rule by a       majority willing to sacrifice the role of the Senate as a check       and balance in order to aid a President determined to pack the       federal courts  It is the courts that serve as a check on the       political branches  Their independence is critical and must be       preserved   The record of 208 confirmations       and reduction of judicial vacancies to an historic low provide       no basis on which to break the rules of the Senate  The       Democratic Leaders efforts to make additional progress       demonstrate that there is no reason for the majority to take the       drastic and irreversible step of ending protection of the       minority through the tradition of extended debate in the       Senate  The White House and the Senate Republican leadership s       campaign for the   nuclear option   seeks to end the role of the       Senate serving as a check on the Executive is short sighted and       wrong as well as unjustified  The Constitution intends for the       Senate to provide balance and a check    I will have more to say about       these important matters and about the nomination that the       Judiciary Committee previously rejected and that the Senate has       previously debated as we proceed over the next several days        There is one other aspect of this matter that I need to mention          Injection Of A Religious Test  Supporters of a power hungry       Executive have gone so far as to seek to inject an       unconstitutional religious test into the debate and to       characterize those who oppose the most extreme of the       President s nominees as being   against people of faith   and to       call for mass impeachments of judges and other measures to       intimidate the judiciary  I commended the President for       personally rejecting at least that demagoguery at a recent press       conference    Pat Robertson says that he       believes that federal judges are   a more serious threat to       America than Al Qaeda and the September 11 terrorists   and         more serious than a few bearded terrorists who fly into       buildings   and   the worst threat America has faced in 400       years    worse than Nazi Germany  Japan and the Civil War          This is the sort of incendiary rhetoric that is paving the way       to the   nuclear option    It is wrong  it is destructive   Injecting religion into politics       to claim a monopoly on piety and political truth by demonizing       those you disagree with is not the American way   It was Abraham Lincoln who said        I know that the Lord is always on the side of the right  but it       is my constant anxiety and prayer that I and this nation should       be on the Lords side  He was so right  We all would do well       to spend a little more time wondering whether were on Gods       side and less time declaring that He is on ours   Those driving the nuclear option       engage in a dangerous and corrosive game of religious       McCarthyism  in which anyone daring to oppose one of this       Presidents judicial nominees is branded as being       anti Christian  or anti Catholic  or against people of faith        Dr  Dobson of Focus on the Family awhile back said  of me  I       dont know if he hates God  but he hates Gods people  When       Senator Hatch was attacked during his presidential campaign  I       came to his defense  When Senator Lott was under attack        Senator Jeffords and Specter spoke up in his defense     When they charge us with being       against people of faith for opposing a handful of the most       extreme and controversial judicial nominees  what are they       saying about the 208 Bush judicial nominees who have been       confirmed with Democratic cooperation and support  Are they  by       definition  people without faith  These kinds of charges  this       virulent religious McCarthyism  is fraudulent on its face  It       is contemptible    Chief Justice Rehnquist is right       to refer to the federal judiciary as the crown jewel of our       system of government  It is an essential check and balance  a       critical source of protection of the rights of all Americans        including our religious freedoms   Just this morning the Judiciary       Committee heard the testimony of Judge Joan Lefkow of  Chicago  She is the federal judge whose mother and       husband were murdered in their home  She asked that we       repudiate the gratuitous attacks on the judiciary and I do so        again  here today  She counsels  In this age of mass       communication  harsh rhetoric is truly dangerous   F ostering       disrespect for judges can only encourage those that are on the       edge  or on the fringe  to exact revenge on a judge who ruled       against them  I remember Justice Sandra Day OConnor made a       similar observation recently    A Republic  If You Can Keep It  In September 1787  as the       Constitutional Convention drew to a close  someone came up to       Benjamin Franklin to ask whether all the arduous work of       drafting the Constitution had produced a republic  or a       monarchy  Ben Franklin told him  A republic  if you can keep       it   The checks and balances woven       through our constitutional system can be easily unthreaded by       the abuse of power  Let us hope that never happens  It can       happen through steps small or large  This action that is being       proposed to the Senate is a large step  a large abuse of power        and a step whose consequences we can only begin to imagine  It       would be a vote for confrontation over consensus   I hope each of us will reflect on       its consequences  and that  in the end  such a travesty will       never befall the Senate
