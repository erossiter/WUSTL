       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee    Executive Business Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Judiciary       Panel Considers NSA Bills       Leahy Warns Against GOP Rubber Stamping      White House Proposal Without Enough Info   Statement Of       Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting      Thursday  August 3  2006  Today  the NSA bills are once       again at the top of the Committees legislative agenda  as they       have been for several months now  Yet we are no further along       in our understanding of the NSAs domestic spying activities         How many Americans have had their       conversations wiretapped  How many terrorists have been       identified who would otherwise have escaped detection  Why did       the Bush Cheney Administration choose not to comply with the       Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  Why did officials refuse       to come to Congress for authorization   We also do not know what else is       going on  Are there other domestic spying activities being       conducted behind Congresss back  outside of the law and without       court approval    We were told the one program the       Bush Cheney Administration has admitted to was narrowly focused       on international calls of suspected terrorists  But then the       Attorney General pointedly refused to rule out purely domestic       warrantless wiretaps of conversations between Americans     We also learned  in April  about a       separate program  At least  we believe it to be a separate       program  but since the Administration has refused to confirm or       deny its existence  we are once again left stumbling about in       the dark  That program reportedly has the NSA vacuuming up       information on millions of ordinary Americans for inclusion in a       massive database of Americans phone calls   In June  we learned about yet       another secret spying program  this one involving banking data        that the Administration failed to mention to key members of       the relevant oversight committees   What else is this Administration       doing without legal justification  oversight  or accountability        and whats next  At last weeks hearing  the Administration       witnesses again refused to say whether the President has       authorized warrantless physical searches of Americans homes and       offices    They did  however  support the       language in Chairman Specter s bill  which would immunize from       prosecution anyone who carries out such a search on the       President s say so   This Republican Congresss       oversight efforts to date have been few and far between  and       even the anemic attempts at oversight have been stymied by White       House obstruction  The Republican Chairman of the House       Judiciary Committee has accused the Attorney General of       stonewalling on this issue  That Committee later passed a       Democratic resolution directing the Attorney General to produce       all documents relating to Administration requests to telephone       service providers to obtain information without a warrant  Of       course  the House Republican leadership has refused to allow a       vote on the measure   To a commendable degree  this       Committee and our Chairman have also been trying to elicit the       information to which we are entitled and which we need to       fulfill our constitutional responsibilities  But the fact is        we have not made much headway  After the Attorney General       testified on this matter in February  Chairman Specter summed it       up in six words  He didn t tell us very much     The Attorney General didnt tell       us very much last month  either  I was particularly struck by       his exchange with Senator Specter  The Chairman askedthe       Attorney General to confirm a statement he made when he was  not on camera  when       he was not under       oath  to the effect that the so called Terrorist Surveillance       Program was the only Administration program operating without       judicial authorization  On camera  under oath  the Attorney       General would not give the Chairman a straight answer   We have yet to hear from former       Attorney General Ashcroft or the other senior Administration       officials  past and present  who are reported to have expressed       concerns about the legality of the NSAs activities     We also have yet to hear from the       phone companies that have been assisting the Administration with       its domestic spying activities  Vice President Cheney put the       kibosh on that hearing    behind closed doors  of course    at       the Republican Senators caucus lunch  And when some telephone       executives testified in June in connection with the proposed       merger of ATT and BellSouth  they essentially took the Fifth       and refused to answer any questions about these matters   What are we doing here  Since       when must Congress get the Administrations permission to       conduct oversight of the Administration  or to talk to American       companies about the rights of American consumers  Last I       checked our Constitution  this body was not part of the       so called unitary Executive   We held our one and only hearing       on the Chairman s new bill just last week  The Chairman offered       to hold additional hearings and I think that would be       appropriate  I still have many questions about the bill and  in       particular  the sweeping new changes to FISA proposed in Section       9  Section 9 has a benign sounding title  Other Conforming       Amendments to FISA  But these amendments are more  transforming than  conforming  although       I suppose they do conform FISA to the Presidents vision of       unchecked Executive power  I have submitted detailed questions       to the Administration witnesses regarding these proposed       changes  and I know others have as well    We need to understand what       problems these changes are intended to address  and what they       would enable the government to do that it cannot do now  We       also need to know the extent to which these changes would       sacrifice Americans liberties  We should not wait to find out       what the legislation means until the Presidents inevitable       signing statement  after it is passed    I continue to believe it is       premature to mark up this bill  At a minimum  we should wait       until the Administration has answered our questions in       connection with last weeks hearing and has told us how it       interprets  and would apply  each of the many significant       changes in Section 9    Even then  however  most of us       would still be flying blind with respect to the Presidents       program  which is the whole reason we are considering another       overhaul of FISA in the first place  Of the 18 members of this       Committee  only four    the four who also serve on the       Intelligence Committee    have been briefed on what the NSA is       doing    I have listened closely to my       colleagues who have       been briefed on the NSAs activities  Senator Feinstein has       said that the surveillance the President wants to conduct can be       done under the current FISA law  Representative Jane Harmon has       said the same  The Attorney General himself testified  I       think there is a serious question as to whether or not FISA       could accommodate what it is that the President has authorized        If there is a serious question that current law is       sufficient  why are we messing with it   Perhaps we are going about this       the wrong way  The former presiding judge of the FISA court        Judge Royce Lamberth  said on May 8th that in his view  the       President s warrantless wiretapping program would require some       tweaking to make it comport fully with FISA  Instead of       Congress amending FISA to accommodate what we imagine the       Presidents unlawful program might be  perhaps the President       should consider tweaking his program to comply with the law
