       Specter Leahy Statement On CBO Report On Asbestos Trust Fund                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Specter Leahy Statement On CBO      Report On Asbestos Trust Fund   Friday  August 26    Below is a      joint statement from Senators Arlen Specter   R Pa    Chairman of      the Judiciary Committee  and Patrick Leahy   D  Vt   the Ranking      Member of the panel  on the CBO Report released today on the      Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act  or FAIR Act  According      to the projections in the CBO report  the Asbestos Trust Fund      established by the bill  would cover the costs of the estimated      claims  Specter and Leahy are the chief sponsors of the bill  which      is pending before the Senate    We welcome the independent analysis      issued today by the non partisan Congressional Budget Office that      the Specter Leahy bill will raise sufficient funds to fairly      compensate asbestos victims  Weve spent years working with other      senators and interested parties to balance the interests of victims      and businesses and weve achieved that with the FAIR Act    In its report  the CBO confirmed      that the total receipts to the Asbestos Trust Fund over its      lifetime would amount to about  140 billion  including a small      amount of interest earnings on its balances    According to its expert analysis       the CBO predicted that asbestos claims and award values will total       132 billion over the life of the Fund    Its reassuring to see CBO project       132 billion as adequate to pay the claims in a contest where there      are so many variables that do not lend themselves to precise      projections or predictions  Even in the range of that uncertainty       CBO has estimated that the claims could be as low as  120 billion      and no higher than  150 billion so that our legislation with  140      billion is reasonable and realistically calculated to cover the      claims  especially in the context with the provisions for      congressional review of medical criteria and award values to reduce      expenditures or increase contributions in the trust fund   If the FAIR Act becomes law by the      end of 2005  the CBO expected that certain pending exigent asbestos      claims would be paid by the fund in 2006 and that the Asbestos      Fund could become fully operational during fiscal year 2007                   Contact   202       224 2154  Leahy  or  202  224 9020  Specter
