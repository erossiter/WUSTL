       Senate Judiciary Panel Passes Leahy Specter Data Privacy And Security   Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Senate Judiciary Panel Passes Leahy Specter Data Privacy And Security     Bill        Bill Would Help Consumers Better Protect Personal Information  WASHINGTON  Thursday  May 3   The Senate     Judiciary Committee Thursday passed crucial bipartisan legislation     introduced by Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Ranking Member Arlen     Specter  R Pa   to  to better protect the privacy of     consumers personal information in the face of persistent data security     breaches across the country   The Personal Data Privacy and Security Act     of 2007  S  495  would help combat the devastating effects of identity     theft while providing consumers with much needed protections  The bill     ensures privacy while enhancing criminal penalties and assistance to law     enforcement  It also provides protections against security breaches      fraudulent access and misuse of personally identifiable information   This is a bill that deals with the     underlying problem of lax security and lack of accountability to help     prevent data breaches from occurring in the first place and also     addresses the need to provide Americans with better notice of breaches     that may affect their personal information  Leahy said during the     panels debate on the bill  Passing this comprehensive privacy     legislation is a legislative priority   The bill is cosponsored by Senators     Russell Feingold  D Wisc    Charles Schumer  D N Y    Sherrod Brown      D Ohio   Benjamin Cardin  D Md    and Bernie Sanders  I Vt     Prior to Committee passage  the bill was     amended to include additional bankruptcy protections for victims of     identity theft  That amendment was sponsored by Senator Sheldon     Whitehouse  D R I    The reported bill also contains additional     privacy enhancements to safeguard consumers privacy  including     promoting the use of encryption technology to protect consumers     sensitive information and ensuring that consumers are promptly notified     about data breaches involving their debit cards and other financial     account records    The bill  passed by voice vote  now moves     to the full Senate for consideration                   Below is Chairman     Leahys statement from the meeting followed by a summary of the bill    Statement of Senator     Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary    The Leahy Specter Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2007      S 495    May 3  2007  I would like to begin today moving     straight to debate on S 495  the Leahy Specter Personal Data Privacy and     Security Act  This comprehensive bipartisan privacy bill is aimed at     better protecting Americans privacy from the growing threats of data     breaches and identity theft  I hope after years of work and weeks of     delay we can consider it and report it out this morning     When then Chairman Specter and I first     introduced this bill in 2005  we had high hopes of bringing urgently     needed data privacy reforms to the American people  Although the     Judiciary Committee favorably reported a substantially similar bill in     November 2005  our bill languished on the Senate calendar for more than     a year and the Senate adjourned without passing comprehensive data     privacy legislation   While the Congress waited to act on     passing data privacy legislation  the problems with data breaches     remained a persistent threat to Americans privacy  According to the     Privacy Rights Clearing House  more than 100 million records containing     sensitive personal information have been involved in data security     breaches since 2005  Earlier this year  mega retailer TJX disclosed     that it suffered a major computer breach involving credit and debit card     purchases by millions of American consumers  We have since learned     that this data breach is the largest in U S  history  effecting at     least 45 7 million credit and debit cards   In February  there was a major data breach     involving a state computer server in Vermont that jeopardized the     financial data of at least 69 000 Vermonters  And  the United States     Department of Agriculture  USDA  admitted recently that it posted the     Social Security numbers of 63 000 people who received grants from the     USDA on an agency website  These data security breaches are compelling     examples of why we need to pass the Personal Data Privacy and Security     Act    Our bill requires that data brokers let     consumers know what sensitive personal information they have about them      and to allow individuals to correct inaccurate information  Our bill     also requires that companies that have databases with sensitive personal     information on Americans  establish and implement data privacy and     security programs    In addition  our bill requires notice when     sensitive personal information has been compromised  I know this is an     interest of Senator Feinsteins  She has been a leader on the issue of     notice  just as California has been a leader on this issue  generally    This bill also provides for tough criminal     penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully conceal the     fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach causes economic     damage to consumers    Finally  our bill addresses the important     issue of the governments use of personal data by requiring that federal     agencies notify affected individuals when government data breaches     occur  and placing privacy and security front and center when federal     agencies evaluate whether data brokers can be trusted with government     contracts that involve sensitive information about the American people      This month  the GAO released a new report on lessons learned about the     government data breaches at the VA and elsewhere  which found that when     these data breaches occur  prompt notice to the individuals affected is     critical so that individuals can protect themselves from the dangers of     identity theft and other misuse of their personal information   Of course  Senator Specter and I have no     monopoly on good ideas to solve the serious problems of identity theft     and lax data security  But  we have tried to put forth some meaningful     solutions to this problem in our bill and hope to merit the Committees     support    This is not a perfect bill  It is not the     bill that either of us would have written alone  We have engaged in     much consultation  including with those in the privacy  consumer     protection and business communities  I thank all of them for sharing     their views with us  I also want to thank our cosponsors Senators     Feingold and Schumer  who have worked along with us to help forge a     consensus    I will place into the record support     letters from Microsoft  Vontu  the Center for Democracy and Technology      Consumers Union  the Cyber Security Industry Alliance and Consumer     Federation of America  When we can bring consumer interests and     business interests together to the extent that we have  we hope we are     close to a bill this Committee can support  a bill that can pass  and a     bill that can make a difference    This is a bill that deals with the     underlying problem of lax security and lack of accountability to help     prevent data breaches from occurring in the first place and also     addresses the need to provide Americans with better notice of breaches     that may affect their personal information  Passing this comprehensive     privacy legislation is a legislative priority  I hope the Committee     will join with us to support this privacy legislation and work with us     to see it enacted    We first listed this bill for Committee     consideration at a business meeting on April 19th  That meeting had to     be postponed following the tragedy at Virginia Tech and the rescheduling     of the oversight hearing with the Attorney General for that date  We     then listed it for consideration at our April 25th meeting  but a     Senator asked that it be carried over until today  I hope that we can     complete action without further delay  I am concerned that almost 50     amendments have been filed to the bill that the Ranking Member and I     have worked outincluding almost 40 on behalf on one Senator  I hope we     are not facing another filibuster by amendment situation and urge     cooperation by all Members on this important matter                    Summary     of the     LeahySpecter Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2007   Provides new measures to protect the      privacy and security of personal data  Provides Americans with      notice when they have been harmed  and also addresses the underlying      problem of lax security and lack of accountability in dealing with      personal data    Adds unauthorized access to sensitive      personally identifiable information to the criminal prohibition      against computer fraud under 18 U S C     1030 a   2      Requires data brokers to let      individuals know what information they have about them  and where      appropriate  allow individuals to correct demonstrated inaccuracies       There are exemptions for products and services already subject to      access and correction rules under the Fair Credit Reporting Act  as      well as companies subject to Gramm Leach Bliley and the Health      Information Portability and Accountability Act  In addition  there      are also exemptions for proprietary  fraud prevention tools and      marketing data    Requires companies that have databases      with personal information on more than 10 000 Americans to establish      and implement data privacy and security programs  and vet      third party contractors hired to process data  There are exemptions      for companies already subject to data security requirements under      Gramm Leach Bliley and the Health Information Portability and      Accountability Act    Requires notice to law enforcement       consumers and credit reporting agencies when digitized sensitive      personal information has been compromised  The trigger for notice      is tied to significant risk of harm with appropriate      checks and balances to prevent over notification as well as      underreporting  There are exemptions for national security and law      enforcement needs  credit card companies using fraud prevention      techniques or where a breach does not result in a significant risk      of harm    Addresses the governments use of      personal data by   1  requiring the General Services Administration      to evaluate the privacy and security practices of potential      government contractors handling personal data  and include penalties      in government contracts for failure to protect data privacy and      security   2  requiring Federal departments and agencies to audit      the information security practices of commercial data brokers hired      for projects involving personal data and include protections and      penalties in contracts with data brokers to protect data privacy and      security  and  3  requiring Federal departments and agencies to      conduct privacy impact assessments on their use of commercial      databases to access personal data on U S  persons  and to adopt      regulations to ensure the security and privacy of data obtained      through commercial data brokers    Provides tough monetary penalties for      failing to provide privacy and security protections and notices of      security breaches  and toughens criminal penalties for those who      infiltrate systems to compromise personal data  Also imposes a      criminal penalty in the cases were there is intentional and willful      concealment of a security breach known to require notice
