Specter Lead      Bipartisan  Bicameral Effort     To Bolster Security For Judges Across America   Bill Would Help Protect Judges      Their Families Against Increased Threats Of Violence WASHINGTON       Wednesday  January 24   Picking up where they left off last      Congress  the two leading members of the Senate Judiciary Committee      today joined with key Senators and House members in introducing a      bipartisan  bicameral bill that would strengthen and expand      protections for judges and their families   Senator Patrick      Leahy  D Vt   Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  and Senator Arlen      Specter  R Pa   the panels ranking member  teamed up with Senate      Majority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   Senate Majority Whip  Dick      Durbin  D Ill  as well as Senators Edward Kennedy  D Mass   Orrin      Hatch  R Utah  Charles Schumer  D N Y   John Cornyn  R Texas  and      Susan Collins  R Maine  to introduce the Court Security Improvement      Act of 2007  Rep  John Conyers  D  Mich   the Chairman of the House      Judiciary Committee introduced a companion bill in the House today       The House bill is also a bipartisan measure  sponsored by Chairman      Conyers  Robert C  Bobby Scott  D Va   and Louie Gohmert  R Texas  Threats against      our judges and their families put the men and women who serve in our      justice system at risk and are a repugnant assault on our      independent judiciary  said Chairman Leahy  We owe it to our      judges to better protect them and their families from violence and      to ensure that they have the peace of mind necessary to do their      vital and difficult jobs  The ability of      the judiciary to determine the rule of law without fear or favor is      an indispensable prerequisite to our democratic society  stated      Senator Specter  Our judges personal security  along with their      judicial independence  must be safeguarded at all costs  and I      believe that this bill is an important step toward providing those      safeguards  I m proud that       on a bipartisan basis  work is progressing to make our courthouses      safer  said Senator Reid  The urgent need for this legislation is      especially important to the people of Nevada where someone attempted      to take the life of Judge Weller of Reno just this past summer  I am      committed to fast tracking this legislation   quickly passing this      bill in the Senate and working with the House in order to get it to      the President to become law  Senator Durbin      said  People in Illinois and Chicago know all too well the dangers      to our judges and their families  Judges should always feel secure      in their courtrooms and safe at home  We owe it to them  and to      their families  to do everything we can to protect them      We      must do all we can to provide adequate security to the dedicated men      and women who are too often targeted for violence or harassment      simply because of the position they hold  said Senator Cornyn       Congress should act to ensure that certain and swift punishment      awaits those who engage in these unconscionable acts of violence       This bill takes important steps toward protecting those public      servants who administer justice in our country  Key provisions of      the bill include            New criminal penalties for the misuse of restricted personal      information to threaten to seriously harm judges  their families or      other individuals performing official duties     Enhancing      penalties for tampering with or retaliating against witnesses          New resources for state courts to improve security for state and      local courts           Provisions extending life insurance benefits to bankruptcy       magistrate and territorial judges  Senators Leahy and      Specter first joined forces with Senator Durbin and others to      bolster security in courts around the country in 2005  in the wake      of increasingly violent threats against judges and their families       including the tragic murder of the family of Judge Joan Lefkow of      Chicago  During a Judiciary Committee hearing in May of that year       Judge Lefkow testified about the murder of her husband and her      mother  who were shot to death in the basement of the judge s home      in February 2005  The Chicago man responsible for the killings had      been upset with Judge Lefkow for dismissing a malpractice suit he      had filed  The man confessed to the shootings before committing      suicide   The Senators      introduced a similar court security bill at the time  That bill      passed the Senate last Congress  but not the House                    Below is Chairman Leahys statement      on introduction of the bill  as well as a section by section of the      legislation    Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Introduction Of The Court Security Improvement Act Of 2007     January 24  2007  I was disappointed at the end of last      Congress that  like so much other urgent business of the American      people left unattended  we did not pass a measure to improve court      security  We made some progress on this important issue when the      Senate passed a consensus bipartisan court security bill       Unfortunately we were unable to cross the finish line because the      House Republican leadership did not take up this bill  And so that      still leaves our nations judges and their families without the      vital protections that bill would have provided   Today  I join with other Senators on      both sides of the aisle to try again  Along with the Majority      Leader Senator Reid  the Judiciary Committees Ranking Member       Senator Specter  the Majority Whip  Senator Durbin  and Senator      Kennedy  Schumer  Cornyn  Hatch and Collins  I introduce the Court      Security Improvement Act of 2007  a consensus measure with      bipartisan support nearly identical to the bill we passed in the      Senate last December  House Judiciary Chairman Conyers is      introducing an identical measure in the House with bipartisan      support  This bicameral  bipartisan introduction sends a strong      message that we intend finally to finish this difficult struggle and      enact this bill that should have been enacted months ago to increase      protections for the dedicated women and men throughout the Judiciary      in this country    This is an important issue  and one I      plan to make a priority this Congress  I hope that we can have      quick action on this bill to bring to fruition our efforts to      provide increased security  an effort that gained new urgency after      the tragedy that befell Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago  She is the      federal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in their home       As we heard in her courageous testimony in May 2005 before the      Judiciary Committee  this tragedy provided a terrible reminder not      only of the vulnerable position of our judges and their families       but of the critical importance of protecting judges both where they      work and where they and their families live  The shooting last      summer of a State judge in Nevada provided another terrible reminder      of the vulnerable position of our nations state and federal      judges  We cannot tolerate or excuse or justify violence or the      threat of violence against judges   In a speech last year  Justice Sandra      Day O Connor criticized the uncivil tone of attacks on the courts       noting that they pose a danger to the very independence of the      federal judiciary  It is most unfortunate that some in this country      have chosen to use dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric when talking      about judges  comparing judges to terrorists and threatening judges      with punishment for decisions they do not like  This rhetoric can      only foster unacceptable violence against judges and it must stop       for the sake of our judges and the independence of the judiciary       Judicial fairness and independence are essential if we are to      maintain our freedoms  Our independent judiciary is the envy of the      rest of the world and a great source of our national strength and      resilience  Let no one say things that might bring about further      threats against our judges  We ought to be protecting them      physically and institutionally    When I last chaired the Judiciary      Committee  one of my first efforts was pushing for passage of the      Judicial Protection Act  which toughened criminal penalties for      assaults against judges and their families  In order to meet the      continuing challenges of keeping the federal judiciary safe  in the      last Congress Chairman Specter and I introduced S  1968  the Court      Security Improvement Act of 2005   The bill we are introducing today in      the Senate and House is a consensus bipartisan bill  I hope that      quick action and passage of this bill can serve as a model for what      we can achieve with bipartisan cooperation in the 110th      Congress  Its core provisions  which previously passed the Senate      not only last December  but also in June as part of the managers      package of the John Warner National Defense Authorization Act for      Fiscal Year 2007  S  2766  come the Court Security Improvement Act      of 2005    The bill responds to the needs      expressed by the federal judiciary for a greater voice in working      with the United States Marshals Service to determine their security      needs  It enacts new criminal penalties for the misuse of      restricted personal information to harm or threaten to harm federal      judges  their families or other individuals performing official      duties  It enacts criminal penalties for threatening federal judges      and federal law enforcement officials by the malicious filing of      false liens  and provides increased protections for witnesses  The      bill also contains provisions making available to states new      resources to improve security for state and local court systems as      well as providing additional protections for law enforcement      officers  I am pleased that the bill includes an extension of life      insurance benefits to bankruptcy  magistrate and territorial      judges    Finally  the bill contains provisions      that have passed the Senate several times extending and expanding to      family members the authority of the Judicial Conference to redact      certain information from a federal judges mandatory financial      disclosure  This expired redaction authority was used in      circumstances in which the release of the information could endanger      the filer or the filers family  I hope that we can reinstate and      expand this much needed redaction authority    These protections are crucial to the      preservation of the independence of our federal judiciary so that it      can continue to serve as a bulwark protecting individual rights and      liberty  Our nations founders knew that without an independent      judiciary to protect individual rights from the political branches      of government  those rights and privileges would amount to nothing       It is the ultimate check and balance in our system of government in      times of heated political rhetoric    We owe it to our judges to better      protect them and their families from violence and to ensure that      they have the peace of mind necessary to do their vital and      difficult jobs    I ask that a copy of the bill be      printed in the Record                    Section by Section          Court Security
