       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On President Bush s Intention To Make   Nominations For Vacant Positions In The Department Of Justice                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee       On President Bushs Intention To Make Nominations  For Vacant Positions In       The Department Of Justice      November 15  2007     The exodus of so many top       officials has left the Justice Department rudderless for many       months  The Department of Justice is the keystone of our system       of justice  and these scandals have taken a heavy toll        Attorney General Mukasey testified at his confirmation hearing       that he understands the importance of restoring the Departments       independence and integrity  and the Senate will do all it can to       help repair the damage that has been done       The White House has left these       top posts at the Justice Department without nominees for far too       long  which has compounded the damage to the Departments morale       and mission  The Senate will act purposefully under its       constitutional role to evaluate these nominations when we       receive them to ensure that these vacancies can be filled  but       also that they will be filled with nominees who are committed to       restoring the independence and mission of the Justice       Department       Yesterday I again invited the       President to work with the Senate in filling judicial and       Executive Branch vacancies  We have succeeded this year in       surpassing the total number of the Presidents judicial nominees       confirmed in either of the last two years by the previous       Republican led Senate and in dramatically lowering the number of       outstanding judicial vacancies  Yet we continue to wait for the       President to send qualified  consensus nominees to the Senate       for the more than 20 vacant U S  Attorney positions around the       country and for the 26 judicial vacancies  nine  that are       judicial emergencies  that are without nominees
