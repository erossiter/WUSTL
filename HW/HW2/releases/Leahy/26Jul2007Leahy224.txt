       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The International Commission Against   Impunity In Guatemala                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The International Commission    Against Impunity In Guatemala    July 26  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Last week  I spoke in this chamber     about the current debate underway in Guatemala concerning the     International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala  CICIG   In my     brief remarks I recalled the 30 years of civil war that caused     widespread atrocities against civilians  particularly Guatemalas Mayan     population  A substantial majority of those killings and disappearances     were perpetrated by Guatemalan security forces   Since the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996      most Guatemalans have tried to put the past behind them and rebuild     their country  The United States and other donors have supported that     effort   But key aspects of the Peace Accords remain     unfulfilled  and there has been no justice for the families of the wars     many victims  Meanwhile  gang violence  drug trafficking  brutal     killings of women  and attacks against human rights defenders and others     who speak out against corruption and impunity have increased     exponentially and threaten the very foundations of Guatemalas fragile     democracy  In recent years  the Guatemalan Government has     worked with officials of the United Nations to draft the CICIG     agreement  the latest version of which has been upheld by Guatemalas     constitutional court  The CICIG is necessary to expose the truth about     clandestine groups and to bring accountability for the violence  Far     from weakening national sovereignty  CICIG will support Guatemala by     helping to strengthen the capacity of the countrys dysfunctional     judicial system  On July 18  a majority of members of the     International Relations Committee of the Guatemalan Congress  for     reasons that only they can explain  voted against the CICIG agreement      Since then  several have changed their votes and I understand that on     August 1st the full Congress will approve or reject the CICIG     agreement or refer it to another committee   The question of whether or not to approve CICIG is      of course  a decision solely for Guatemalas Congress to make  But the     importance of this historic decision cannot be overstated for     U S  Guatemalan relations and for Guatemalas future  Guatemala  like many impoverished countries     emerging from years of civil conflict  faces immense social  economic     and political challenges  Without the support of countries like the     United States in building its economy  promoting foreign investment and     trade  and strengthening the institutions of democracy  Guatemala will     lag behind its neighbors  Today  that support hangs in the balance   The Bush Administration has voiced strong support     for CICIG  The U S  Congress has linked a resumption of U S  assistance     for the Guatemalan Armed Forces  in part  on approval of CICIG  In     addition  I would be reluctant to support assistance for Guatemala to     take part in any regional security initiative with the United States      unless CICIG is approved and supported  There is little point in trying     to work with a government that fails to demonstrate a strong commitment     to ending impunity and to combating gang violence and corruption  which     have infiltrated the very institutions that would participate in such a     strategy   CICIG is nothing less than a choice between the     past and the future  Rejecting this historic initiative  an outcome     most Americans would find inexplicable  would signal that the     Guatemalan Congress is more interested in protecting the forces of evil      and in covering up the truth  than in ending the lawlessness that is     taking Guatemala backwards
