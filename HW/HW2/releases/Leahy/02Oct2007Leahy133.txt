                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Senate     Passes Leahy Led Compact     To Facilitate Disaster Relief Efforts     Along New England Canadian Border WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Oct  2   The Senate Tuesday     night approved a compact to speed and facilitate the deployment of     resources and first responders during emergencies along the Northeast     border among New England states and Canada  The bipartisan resolution      introduced by Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        provides structure and form to international mutual aid between     Northeast states and Canadian provinces  shortening delays that would     otherwise hamper the distribution of assistance during emergencies  S J Res 13  the International Emergency Management     Assistance Memorandum of Understanding  IEMAMOU   was forged and adopted     by the New England Governors Conference and the Eastern Canadian     Premiers in 2000  The Senate resolution grants the consent of Congress     to the IEMAMOU to allow emergency responders from both the United States     and Canada to provide assistance on both sides of the border during     natural disasters and other emergencies  The compact addresses issues     including liability and payment before emergencies happen  enabling     first responders to act without delay when they are needed  Leahy introduced and moved the compact legislation     through the Senate at the request of Vermont Governor Jim Douglas  R       on behalf also of other New England governors  Leahy steered the     compact legislation to a unanimous Judiciary Committee vote last week      paving the way for the Senate to consider it this week  It now moves to     the House for consideration  The United States and Canada share the longest     unguarded border in the world  said Leahy  In the Northeast  we also     share many of the most severe storms and natural disasters  This     resolution cuts through some of the red tape and reflects the     longstanding partnership we share with our neighbors to the North  The Compact includes Maine  New Hampshire  Vermont      Massachusetts  Rhode Island and Connecticut  and the Provinces of     Quebec  New Brunswick  Prince Edward Island  Nova Scotia  Newfoundland     and Labrador  Below is Leahys statement on the compact     resolution       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On S J Res 13  The International Emergency Management Assistance     Memorandum Of Understanding    October 2  2007  This Joint Resolution reflects the best traditions     of international cooperation between our nation and our Canadian     neighbors to the North   Formally  this Joint Resolution would grant the     consent of Congress to the International Emergency Management Assistance     Memorandum of Understanding  which allows emergency responders from the     United States and Canada to help each other across our shared border     during natural disasters and other serious emergencies  But beyond this     legal formality  this agreement reflects our longstanding cooperative     partnership with Canada  and how  in times of emergency or natural     disaster  we respond together  as neighbors across a largely unguarded     border   When our communities need help  we must join     together and come to their aid  whether or not a border is drawn between     us  This agreement allows us to honor the extraordinary tradition of     international cooperation and good will between our nations  and will     make the citizens of both the United States and Canada more secure and     safer   We must all do our best to prepare for the most     serious emergencies that can harm our communities  These crises may     arise from natural or manmade disasters  from technological hazards      civil emergencies  or even terrorist events  As those who live in the     Northeast know  extreme weather is not uncommon in New England  or in     the eastern provinces of Canada  and we have endured catastrophic     blizzards and ice storms as recently as this winter that have closed     roads and highways  shut down power for extended periods  and stranded     travelers and rural residents for days  or longer  Under this     agreement  first responders and emergency management professionals from     the United States and Canada can work together to provide the necessary     assistance to secure public safety   This compact works well for New England and the     eastern Canadian provinces  and it stands as a model for emergency     management planning and cooperation  It has the support of all the     emergency management directors in the New England States  and the     bipartisan support of all of the New England Senators who have joined me     and Senator Snowe to cosponsor this resolution  It is a crucial element     of the security and safety planning for all communities in New England     and eastern Canada
