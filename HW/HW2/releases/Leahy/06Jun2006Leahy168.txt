       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Examining The Department Of  Justice s Investigation Of Journalists                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Examining The Department Of Justices Investigation      Of Journalists      Who Publish Classified Information  Lessons From The Jack      Anderson Case     June 6  2006     Today the Committee considers the      important question of how to strike the proper balance between      secrecy and openness in matters that touch on national      security  This is an issue of paramount concern that has vexed      our nation since its founding and continues to challenge us      since the world changed on  September 11  2001  I commend the      Chairman for holding this important hearing   I have long been a champion of      open government and a vibrant and independent press  My      commitment to preserving public debate developed honestly and      early as the son of a  Vermont printer from Montpelier       In my years in the Senate  I have aspired to fulfill the ideals      of my father  fighting for a free press and greater transparency      in government  I have long championed the Freedom of      Information Act  which shines a light on the workings of      government and has proven to be an invaluable tool for both      reporters and ordinary citizens  Last year  I introduced      legislation with Senator Cornyn to improve implementation of      that critical legislation   I also understand that the      collective security of our nation is critical to sustaining our      democracy  and there will always be a need to classify some      information in the interest of national security  In some      instances  the unauthorized release of classified information      can compromise our intelligence gathering capabilities  impede      our efforts to thwart terrorism  and even jeopardize lives   Many observers in and outside of      government have also believed  often with good reason  that      government too frequently is inclined to stamp too much      information with the secrecy stamp  in order to limit      accountability and prevent embarrassment  Congress has often      struggled to find the proper balance between open public debate      and secrecy when it comes to classified information  Shortly      after entering into World War I  Congress passed the Espionage      Act of 1917  which made it a crime for a person to convey      information with the intent to interfere with the operations of      our armed forces  or to help the enemies of the  United States       However  Congress resisted efforts by the Wilson Administration      to criminalize all leaks of government information         essentially rejecting the notion of an Official Secrets Act   After World War II and the      publication of information about the Government s      code breaking capabilities in the  Chicago Tribune       Congress extended the Espionage Act to criminalize the      disclosure of communications intelligence  But once again       Congress resisted calls to enact legislation that would prohibit      the publication of all classified information   More recently    in 2000         Congress did include a provision criminalizing leaks of      classified material in an intelligence authorization bill  But      President Clinton vetoed that legislation because it was overly      broad and could chill the legitimate activities of current and      former government officials   Like most Americans  I appreciate      the need to protect national defense information  But when it      enacted the espionage laws in 1917  Congress clearly understood      that giving the Government the authority to prosecute the press      simply for publishing newsworthy government secrets would      substantially chill First Amendment protected speech    and      Congress chose not to do that   For 90 years  there have been no      prosecutions of the press under our existing federal espionage      laws  Despite this long history  Attorney General Gonzales      claimed during a recent interview with ABC News that the Justice      Department could do just that  And according to the  Washington Times       reporters for the Washington      Post and New York      Times are being investigated by the Justice      Department for publishing stories about the CIA s      secret prisons in Eastern Europe and the NSA s      warrantless surveillance program    Reasonable people can    and do         disagree about the legality and wisdom of such programs  But      there can be no question that these award winning reports      contained newsworthy information for Americans  about      questionable activities of their government  I am deeply      troubled by the Attorney Generals remarks and the specter of      Government intimidation of the press if the espionage laws are      used in ways not intended by Congress   I am also troubled by the      FBI s      request to search the files of journalist Jack Anderson shortly      after his death    reportedly to recover classified documents      leaked decades ago  I fail to see what possible national      security interest is served by the FBI rummaging through Mr       Anderson s files many      years after he published articles about these matters     I am pleased that Mr  Anderson s      son  Kevin  is here with us today  I look forward to hearing      his views on his fathers distinguished career in journalism and      the FBI s contacts      with the Anderson family  We also have a distinguished panel of      legal scholars and media experts with a broad range of      experience and expertise on this issue   I look forward to a meaningful      exchange
