       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Naturalization Ceremony                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Naturalization Ceremony     Vermont State House     September 11  2006 I am proud to share      this experience with you and with your families on such an important      day  and to welcome you as fellow United States citizens  This is a      marvelous tradition that Judge Sessions has started  and I am so      pleased to be a part of it again this year  I am also pleased that      Governor Douglas is with us here today to help mark this occasion       For      all of us  September 11 will bring somber memories  We remember      those we lost and those whose heroism inspired us  When I think      back to those days  I think of the Vermont National Guard patrolling      the skies over New York and neighbors helping neighbors  I think of      the police  firefighters and emergency personnel who rushed into the      burning towers in New York and the brave passengers on United flight      93 over Pennsylvania and the other hijacked planes  We will never      forget how America came together and how the world stood with us       It was not just Americans  but also an estimated 500 citizens from      more than 90 foreign countries who were the victims of terrorism on      that day   With this ceremony      today  we will also associate September 11 with the joy       accomplishment  idealism and patriotism of your becoming U S       citizens  We unite  again  as Americans dedicated to the values and      the diversity that makes America so special  I welcome  and we all      welcome you as part of our democracy  without regard to race       religion  color  national origin  first language or culture  By so      doing  we demonstrate that we have not lost sight of what is best      about America and not lost our spirit  By so doing  by reaffirming      our values  we honor those we have lost   To do otherwise      would be to concede victory to the terrorists  To succumb      to hatred is to lose our way  Today  you renew the      promise of America as we celebrate your citizenship and your      commitment to the best ideals American represents   An old friend of      mine and wonderful former Senator from Illinois  Paul Simon  long      had a family tradition of planting a tree on Election Day  Paul      used to say that the reason they started this tradition was so that       whatever the election results  something good and lasting would come      from each Election Day  That is also how I feel about this      tradition that Judge Sessions has started  of convening      naturalization ceremonies on September 11  Thank you  Judge      Sessions  For many Americans       our citizenship was an accident  Not for you  In taking the      citizenship oath  you have made a conscious choice and determined      effort to be American citizens  As you take that oath to complete      your journey to citizenship  you join us in reaffirming the      character of our country  We are a nation of immigrants  Our      openness is part of our strength and vibrancy  That has not changed      and must not change  As part of the      citizenship process  you have learned about our nations history       You know that throughout our history  immigrants have come to the      United States in search of better lives  and each succeeding      generation has made America a stronger  more prosperous  and better      place  There are naturalized citizens who serve with me in      Congress  and as Federal judges  Not so long ago  a naturalized      citizen served as Governor of Vermont  Every day  immigrants play      vital roles in creating and sustaining our culture and our economy       Citizenship in the      United States of America guarantees you many rights  including the      freedom of speech  the freedom to worship as you choose  the right      to vote  and the right to be free from discrimination based on the      country of your birth  Vermont is the 14th State in our      Union  having become a State the year the Bill of Rights was      adopted  Those rights and freedoms have always been important to      Vermonters   This is a great      nation  and it is also a good nation  As each new generation of      Americans hews to our founding ideals  we honor the vision and the      sacrifices that have built and preserved this nation and what it      stands for  One of the Founders  Ben Franklin  warned that we must      not let fear compel us to trade in our ideals and our liberty       There will always be those who would cater more to our fears than      to Americas everlasting values  But it is as clear to me today as      it has always been that liberty and security are not mutually      exclusive values  We can and must have both  All that we need is      the will to achieve it  I hope you will also      see your citizenship as a responsibility  and that you will work to      make your communities  your State and your country better places to      live  I have faith you are all up to the challenge   Your desire to      become citizens is a fresh reminder to those of us who were born      here about the promise of America  Like most Americans  I am      descended from people who  like you  started their lives in another      country and came here to seek a new beginning  I understand the      pride you and your families associate with this occasion    Americas greatness      is much more than our countrys economic wealth or our military      might  America is great  because America is good  We strive to      live up to our founding ideals  We do not always succeed  but the      striving itself is part of the American character  and the striving      helps keep our course true  And now you are part of the interwoven      fabric of America   I wish you every      good fortune in your new lives as citizens  I welcome and      congratulate you as fellow citizens of this great and good country       the United States of America
