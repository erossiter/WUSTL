As Senate Prepares To Confirm 205th Judge     Reid And Leahy Urge Bush   To Protect Checks And Balances Of Democracy  WASHINGTON  Monday      April 11   U S  Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid and Sen  Patrick     Leahy  Ranking Member on the Senate Judiciary Committee  urged President     Bush today to protect the fundamental checks and balances of democracy      The Senate leaders encouraged Bush to oppose the nuclear option and     select nominees who will generate strong  bipartisan support                   Letter and judicial fact sheet follow          April 11  2005        The Honorable George W  Bush    President    1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW    Washington  DC 20500     Dear Mr  President         There are currently 28 vacancies on the federal courts of appeals and     district courts for which you have not forwarded nominees to the Senate      We write to offer to help you obtain consultation and advice from the     Senate on these vacancies so that you may select nominees who will     generate strong  bipartisan support         This evening the Senate is scheduled to consider your nomination of Paul     Crotty to become a federal judge in New York  We expect Mr  Crotty to be     confirmed with the support of his home state Senators and an     overwhelming vote  We have each been urging you for some time to work     with the Senate to fill federal judicial vacancies with qualified      consensus nominees  It is now imperative that we do so         When you met with Russian President Putin earlier this year  you noted     that checks and balances and an independent judiciary are among the     fundamental requirements of democracy  We agree  We therefore urge you     to make clear to Senate Republican leaders that you do not favor the     so called nuclear option which would remove an important check on     executive power  Instead  let us work together to identify consensus     judicial candidates  Let us preserve our independent judiciary  which is     the envy of the world         Respectfully         Harry Reid     Patrick     Leahy    Democratic Leader     Ranking Member  George W      Bush s Judicial Nominees    Confirmed In Near Record Numbers 205 Judicial Nominees     Confirmed  The Senate will have confirmed 205 judicial nominees of     President George W  Bush with the expected confirmation of Paul Crotty     this evening  This is more than in President Reagans first term  his     fathers only term  or President Clintons second term  215 nominees     would have been brought to the full Senate for a vote  meaning 95     percent of the judges brought for a vote were confirmed  One hundred of     the 205 confirmations took place in the 17 months that Democrats were in     the Senate majority and the other 105 during the 34 months that     Republicans have controlled the Senate      35 Circuit Court Nominees Confirmed  The Senate has confirmed 35     circuit courtnominees  more than in Reagans or Clintons first term          The Federal Judiciary is Now 95 percent Full  There are now 46 vacant     seats in all of the Federal courts  the lowest level of vacancies since     the Reagan era  There are more federal judges today than in any previous     Presidential term  When Senator Leahy took over as Chairman of the     Judiciary Committee in 2001  he inherited 110 vacancies and by the end     of the 108th Congress the number had plummeted to 27      Of the 10 Nominees Filibusters  3 Have Withdrawn  4 Are Opposed by Both     Home State Senators and 3 Were Seen as Unsuitable  Extreme  And Likely     to Impose Their Personal Views  Miguel Estrada  Carolyn Kuhl and     Chalres Pickering have all asked that their nominations be withdrawn and     are no longer pending  Three Michigan nominees and Janice Rogers Brown     of California are opposed by both their home state Senators  William     Myers of Idaho  William Pryor of Alabama and Priscilla Owen of Texas are     the 3 nominees already debated by the Senate on whose nominations     cloture was denied       White House Nominating Controversial Rather Than Consensus Nominees  It     was not until February 14  2005 that President Bush sent his first 20     judicial nominees  and all but two already were known to be     controversial  President Bush Ignoring     Judicial Vacancies  President Bush has not yet made nominations for more     than half of the current vacancies on the federal bench  President Bush     has not sent nominees to fill 28 of the 46 vacancies currently on the     federal bench  President Bush has so far sent only ONE new judicial     nominee all year   Republicans Stalled on     Consensus Nominees  Two nominees to District Courts  one in Hawaii      another in New York  have been awaiting confirmation votes in the full     Senate for months  Despite bipartisan support for these nominees  the     Republican leadership has refused to grant a vote until today with the     anticipated vote on Paul Crotty  Democrats have been prepared to vote     to confirm these Bush nominees for months  It is the Senate Republican     leadership that is delaying action as part of their effort to     manufacture a crisis       President Bush Has Sent the Senate Only ONE New Judicial Nomination All     Year  Brian Sandoval of Nevada is the only new judicial nomination sent     to the Senate in the first 4 months of this year  He has bipartisan     support from his home state Senators and appears to be a consensus     nominee whose confirmation can be expedited as soon as his paper work is
