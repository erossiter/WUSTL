       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Administration s   Mercury Rules                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Opening      Statement     Senator Patrick Leahy     Hearing On Administrations Mercury Rules     Democratic Policy Committee     Tuesday  April 19  2005 We      are here today to uphold the bipartisan work that produced the Clean      Air Act and the 1990 amendments that started us down the road of      cleaning up the toxic mercury spewing out of dirty power plants      across the country   It      has fallen to this Committee to fulfill Congresss oversight role       since the Republican leadership does not want to shine any daylight      on this flawed rule  If they did they would find industry      fingerprints all over it   They      would find a process where the public was shut out  where scientific      and economic analysis was manipulated and where public health was      ignored        EPAs Inspector General and the Government Accountability Office      criticized almost every aspect of how EPA drafted this rule       Unfortunately  their recommendations to improve it were also      ignored  So      were more than 680 000 public comments  a record for any EPA rule       So were the comments of many state environment departments       attorneys general  doctors  educators  sportsmen groups and EPAs      own advisory committees   And       although it shouldnt come as a surprise after four years working      with this Administration  the comments of 45 Senate and 184 House      members were also ignored  Many      of us here today have spent the past year  working with three      different administrators  trying to make the Administration follow      the Clean Air Act and produce a rule that goes as far as public      health demands  and technology permits  They failed on both fronts       Instead they produced a rule that will do nothing for at least ten      years  According to their own Regulatory Impact Analysis  we will      be lucky if one percent of power plant capacity will have mercury      controls on it by 2015 and only three percent by 2020        Despite ten years of analysis by EPA showing the need for quick      action  the Bush Administration ruled that it was neither      necessary nor appropriate to regulate mercury from power plants       Although I am somewhat impressed that they can make this statement      with a straight face  I am completely baffled by this conclusion  All      you have to do is look at this map to see why as a Vermonter I know      it is appropriate and necessary to regulate power plants  You      cant even see my state on this map because of the mercury pollution      that is being dumped on us from upwind power plants  Vermonters      have been waiting for decades for EPA to take action so that our      lakes will get cleaned up  All      you have to do is look at this chart to see why as a father and      grandfather I know it is necessary and appropriate to act now  As      the chart shows  the Agencys own estimate of the number of newborns      at risk of elevated mercury exposure has doubled to 630 000  They      also found that one in six pregnant women has mercury levels in her      blood above EPAs safe threshold   It      is obvious to me that for all their talk of family values  the      Administration has yet again put the value of corporate      contributions   not families   first   It      is not a family value to tell a whole generation of women that their      health is not important  It is not a family value to put another      generation of young kids at risk of learning disabilities  These      gutless mercury rules do just that   The      Republican leadership may not think these concerns are worthy of the      Senates time  but we do
