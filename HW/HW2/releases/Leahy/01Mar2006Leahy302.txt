Gonzales On Delayed      Clarifications     To His Testimony On Domestic Spying         AGs Unusual Letter      Altering Testimony Raises Questions     About Administrations Legal Justification For Program      And About Possibility Of Similar Secret Surveillance Initiatives WASHINGTON       Wednesday  March 1  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   sent the      following letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales Wednesday      seeking more information on Gonzaless testimony relating to the      legal justifications for the Administrations domestic spying      program  as well as whether any other secret  warrantless      surveillance programs exist   Leahy  the      ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  was prompted      to send the letter after Gonzales wrote to Chairman Arlen Specter       R Pa   Tuesday modifying his live testimony given at the      Committees February 6 hearing on the program   In his Tuesday      letter to Specter  Gonzales wrote that the Administrations legal      analysis for the program evolved over time  Gonzaless letter      also included a strained explanation that his testimony was confined      to only the program that President had previously described  raising      the question of whether there are other secret surveillance      programs  Leahy said   Leahys letter      is below  A       is also available             March 1  2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20530 Dear Attorney General Gonzales   I write in response to your unusual letter      seeking to modify your February 6 testimony that you sent to      Chairman Specter yesterday  More than three weeks after the hearing      you send the Committee a six page letter seeking to alter your live      testimony  Your letter  in fact  does little to clarify your      testimony  Instead  it raises many questions  both factual and also      some going to the credibility of your testimony  At the outset of my questioning I asked when      the Bush Cheney Administration came to the conclusion that the      congressional resolution authorizing the use of military force      against al Qaeda also authorized warrantless wiretapping of      Americans inside the United States  You never directly answered my      question  Now  in your February 28 letter to Chairman Specter  you      admit that the Departments legal analysis has evolved over time       While not yet a direct answer to my question  you have at least      indicated that you did not rely on that legal rationalization when      the spying program began in 2001  I still wish to know when you      concluded that the Authorization for the Use of Military Force      authorized the warrantless wiretapping of Americans inside the      United States and renew our request for the documents that embody      that conclusion   Of course  you realize the significance of the      timing  It will demonstrate that your reliance on an evolving      interpretation of the Authorization for the Use of Military Force      shows it to be after the fact legal rationalization rather than the      contemporaneous intent underlying the congressional resolution  You      will still need to correct or better explain your statements on      pages 184 and 187 of the transcript  which you recognize may give       a  misimpression  Second are the disturbing suggestions in your      February 28 letter that there are other secret programs impinging on      the liberties and rights of Americans  Much of your letter is      devoted to not providing answers to the questions of a number of us      regarding legal justifications for activities beyond those narrowly      conceded by you to have already been confirmed by the President  We      need to know what other activities affecting Americans rights you      view as justified by the Authorization for the Use of Military      Force  Please provide answers to the following questions   Do other programs of warrantless electronic      surveillance exist  Do other programs of warrantless physical      searches or mail searches exist  Which agencies run these programs      and how long have they been in operation  What legal standards      apply to these other programs   Also  please clarify your clarification of the      repeated assertions you made on February 6 that the Department of      Justice had not done the legal analysis as to whether it could      intercept purely domestic communications of persons associated with      al Qaeda  Has the Department done such an analysis since September      11  2001  If so  what did the Department conclude   Your continued refusal to answer these      questions is a source of great concern  Likewise  the indication in      your letter that your Department has conducted additional legal      rationalizations and analysis beyond the January 19th      paper make your production of the legal opinions to the Senate      Judiciary Committee all the more important  At the February 6 hearing you were confronted      with your January 2001 testimony from your confirmation hearing       which appeared to many Senators to have been misleading  I expect      that your letter yesterday was an attempt to provide some defense to      a charge that you misled the Committee  again  in your testimony on      February 6  You seek to add qualifiers and to hedge already vague      answers about the shifting legal analysis for the Presidents      domestic spying program without judicial approval and about the      scope of activities undertaken secretly based on your expansive      interpretation of inherent powers of the unitary executive not based      on statutory authorities   It is no secret that the Department of Justice      has exhibited a disturbingly arrogant pattern of unresponsiveness to      questions that I and other Democratic Senators have posed on many      issues in the past  Congress has a constitutional duty to conduct      oversight of this Administration in order to ensure its      accountability to all Americans  Indeed  the Democratic members of      the Committee are still waiting for answers to questions we posed      following your February 6th hearing that were due      yesterday  I look forward to your prompt reply to this inquiry  as      well as your overdue answers to the Committee   Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     Ranking Democratic Member
