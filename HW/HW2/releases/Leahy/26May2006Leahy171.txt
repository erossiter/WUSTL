       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of A Substitute To   S  852  The Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       On The Introduction Of A Substitute To S 852       The Fairness In Asbestos Injury Resolution Act Of 2006       May 26  2006  Today I join the Chairman of the       Judiciary Committee  Senator Specter  in introducing an amended       version of S 852  the Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution Act       of 2006  The FAIR Act   This legislation enhances our       previous trust fund bill by adopting many of the amendments       filed in February by Senators on both sides of the aisle  We       have incorporated amendments to further protect against fraud       and to make sure the sickest victims are paid as soon as       possible  We specifically provided for access to the trust fund       for victims who were exposed to asbestos during the attacks on       the World Trade       Center and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita  We clarified the       language in the bill so that dormant claims that have been       inactive for years and that no one is pursuing cannot be revived       to overwhelm the trust fund   This legislation also contains a       few additional changes that we believe respond directly to       concerns raised by our colleagues during floor debate  The       floor amendments incorporated in this bill include  among       others  the Kyl funding amendment that will protect small and       medium sized businesses  We also addressed the concerns of       business that currently pay nothing or very little because they       are well insured  None of these changes undermine the existing       guarantee on overall private funding at  140 billion     Also importantly  we preserved the       ability of the existing bankruptcy trusts to continue paying       impaired victims while the trust fund becomes operational  This       will smooth the transition for victims who were exposed by       companies that are currently protected from suit by bankruptcy        And finally  we clarified the statute of limitations for our       nations war veterans so they will have better access to the       trust fund    None of the additional provisions       contained in this substitute diminishes the core principle that       the asbestos trust fund will be comprised solely of private       money  Nothing in this bill reduces the protection of victims       against insurance subrogation  I am proud to report that we       have also maintained our core medical criteria so that those who       have been impaired by asbestos exposure will receive       compensation according to their injuries    Earlier this week we all were       saddened to learn of the passing of Judge Edward R  Becker  As       many of my colleagues are keenly aware  Judge Becker worked       patiently with Senators and all of the stakeholders on this       legislation for almost three years  We have engaged in an       exhaustive process of Committee hearings  deliberations and       negotiations  Judge Becker was crucial to each step in the       process  We would not have made the bipartisan progress that       this legislation reflects without his tireless efforts  We will       ever be grateful for his tireless efforts   Unfortunately  time is running out       for this session of Congress  I know that some partisans will       claim that we should refrain from reaching across the aisle       during an election year  but this problem compels us to move       forward to try and help the thousands of victims of asbestos       exposure  I urge the Senate Majority Leader to give us       sufficient floor time to debate and vote on this important       legislation on its merits
