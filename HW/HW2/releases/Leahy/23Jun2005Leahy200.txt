                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Opening      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Executive Business Meeting     Committee On The Judiciary     June 23  2005  Today we mark the anniversary of Title      IX of our civil rights laws  This remains an extremely important      guarantee of fairness for young women in education and athletic      opportunities  I regret that the current administration has chosen      to issue rules undermining those objectives  I understand that      there will be events today commemorating the anniversary of Title IX      and wanted to note it here  as well   This week the Chairman and I will      introduce a measure that grew out of the important hearings before      this Committee earlier this year on the serious breaches of personal      data from credit cards accounts and other sources  Reports of      significant breaches seem to be occurring more regularly  including      the report last week involving 40 million credit card accounts       Recent reports have included breaches of information security from      the travel accounts of the Department of Justice itself     We have been working to protect      Americans from identity theft through leaked or lost personal data       I have worked throughout my time in the Senate to help ensure that      our laws keep pace with technology  Insecure databases have become      low hanging fruit for hackers looking to steal identities and commit      fraud during a time when we are seeing a troubling rise in organized      rings that target personal data to sell in online  virtual bazaars         Key features of our legislation      include      Increasing      criminal penalties for identity theft involving electronic personal      data by  1  increasing penalties for computer fraud when such fraud      involves personal data   2  adding fraud involving unauthorized      access to personal information as a predicate offense for RICO and       3  making it a crime to intentionally or willfully conceal a      security breach involving personal data      Allowing      individuals access to  and the opportunity to correct  any personal      information held by data brokers           Requiring entities that      maintain personal data to establish internal policies that protect      such data and vet third parties they hire to process that data      Requiring      entities that maintain personal data to give notice to individuals      and law enforcement when they experience a breach involving      sensitive personal data      Limiting the buying        selling or displaying of a Social Security number without    consent from the individual whose number it is      Prohibiting companies from       requiring individuals to use Social Security numbers    as their account numbers and limiting when companies can force       individuals to turn    over those numbers in order to obtain goods or services      Barring government agencies       from posting public records that contain Social    Security numbers on the Internet  and       Requiring      the government to establish rules protecting privacy and security      when it uses data broker information  to conduct audits of      government contracts with data brokers and impose penalties on      government contractors that fail to meet data privacy and security      requirements        I know that Senator Feinstein and others are also serious about      these problems and appreciate their outstanding leadership in these      matters  I thank the Chairman for devoting his attention to these      problems and concerns and hope we can work together to report      legislation that will be effective and helpful        Today  we hope to adopt in a bipartisan manner rules to govern our      Committee proceedings  Anyone who has observed our work over the      years is aware that this Committee is called upon to handle many of      the most contentious matters that come before the Senate  That has      not changed  But anyone who is a close observer of the Committee      has witnessed a change in tone during the last six months and has      seen us restore a good measure of civility to our proceedings  Much      of the credit goes to our Chairman         I am encouraged that we have been able to establish a good working      relationship and environment  The senior Senator from  Pennsylvania has served on the      Committee for more than 24 years  He is our friend  Now  he is      also our Chairman  While we do not always agree  we share a mutual      respect for each other  for the Senate and for this Committee             He has sought changes in the Committees rules and we in the      minority have sought to accommodate his interests in efficiency      without sacrificing our rights and responsibilities  I greatly      appreciate his restoration of our traditional Rule IV  That rule      was instituted at the behest of Republican Senators more than 25      years ago  Until recently  it had served as intended and without      interruption as a mechanism providing for consultation and      bipartisanship  It is now back in effect        We have sought to encourage greater consultation on hearings and      Committee business in these rules  I would hope that the majority      would work with the minority not to provide the least possible      notice but to provide the greatest possible opportunity to work      together         The most difficult rule change for the minority to accept is one      lowering our traditional quorum requirement of at least half of the      Committee  We have been accommodating in so doing and the Chairman      has worked with us to find a formulation that we both hope will      work         While we respect the rules  what will matter most in the days ahead      is whether we respect each other  No set of rules can protect      against overreaching or abuse  This Committee can become a model      for the Senate  Let that be one that inspires rather than inflames
