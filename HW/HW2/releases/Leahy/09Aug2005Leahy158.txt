       Leahy Asks Greater White House Cooperation On Regan Library Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy Asks Greater White House      Cooperation     On Reagan Library Documents     August 9  2005  Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt   ranking member  Senate Judiciary Committee  late Tuesday      sent a letter to President Bush requesting greater White House      cooperation in supplying documents the White House already has      agreed to provide to the panel  Leahy  writing on behalf of all      eight Democratic members of the committee  noted that White House      cooperation is essential to the Senate Judiciary Committees      preparation for the confirmation hearings that will begin Sept  6   Leahys letter      follows up a White House letter delivered last Friday night which      responds to the Judiciary Democrats request for prioritizing      documents from the Reagan Library  The Friday White House letter      reports that Reagan Library officials are prioritizing files on the      basis of highest usefulness to the Judiciary Committee before      forwarding them to the White House  but the letter does not indicate      that the White House is doing the same after its file by file      reviews are completed  The new Leahy letter asks that the White      House  like the Reagan Library  also focus on priority documents      first  Leahy further asks that documents  once White House reviews      are finished  be provided to the committee on a rolling basis to      speed the process  Leahy noted that some of these documents have      been selectively provided to the press but not yet to the Judiciary      Committee  Leahy  on behalf of the committees Democratic members       also asks the White House for a progress report and timetable on its      handling of the Reagan Library documents    The text of the      letter follows    CONTACT  David      Carle  202 224 3693                       August 9  2005  President George W  Bush     The White House     Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  President    I write on behalf of      Democratic Members of the Committee on the Judiciary to thank you      for your response last Friday to our July 26  2005  letter  Our      letter had requested that the White House prioritize and provide on      a rolling basis selected files relating to the work of John G       Roberts  Jr   in the Department of Justice and in the Office of      White House Counsel  I also write to inquire about numerous pending      questions from our earlier correspondence that were not answered in      your letter last Friday  While the information we received from      your Office of Legislative Affairs was useful  it did not address      many of our questions about the handling  processing  and delivery      of those documents to the Committee in time for Judge Robertss      confirmation hearing  Timely cooperation from the Administration is      essential to the Committees preparations for the upcoming hearings         We understand that the      process of reviewing the approximately 50 000 pages of relevant      papers housed in the Reagan Library in Simi Valley  California  is      well underway  Published reports state that the head of the Library      has estimated that such a review would take three weeks  and the      National Archives website estimates the documents will be made      public by mid August  Nonetheless  on August 5  2005  it was      reported in the Washington Post      that the White House already has possession of some of those      Reagan era documents  and that someone in the White House had      provided at least two of them to the newspaper    In our previous letter  we      asked that certain of the files relating to Judge Roberts in the      Reagan Library be processed first  because they were of the greatest      interest to us and possibly are the most relevant to the      confirmation process  While your letter of last Friday indicates      that you have requested that the Reagan Library prioritize the files      in which we are particularly interested  we would appreciate a      similar assurance that the White House itself will do the same  We      also asked that the documents be produced to us on a rolling basis       as various documents have already been reviewed as required by the      Presidential Records Act  With the  Washington Posts      disclosure that the White House is in possession of some of these      documents  it appears that this request has also been ignored or      rejected    We renew those requests      and also request a progress report on the work of reviewing the      documents in general and the priority files in particular  and a      timetable for giving us the priority documents  as well as the      remainder of the documents  We certainly believe that making the      documents available to the Senate Judiciary Committee in small      batches as they are processed will be easier for all those involved      in reviewing the documents than having to copy  read  and analyze      50 000 or more documents at once  We recognize that the White House      must complete its own review after receiving documents from the      Reagan Library or the National Archives  but it is clear from press      reports that such a review has already begun  We are especially      concerned that upon reviewing these documents someone in the White      House provided them to the press but not to the Committee  if there      are any other such documents we should receive them immediately    Senator Kennedy and      Senator Schumer separately wrote to you late last week with their      concern that the documents will not be made available to us in time      for a meaningful review before the hearing begins on September 6th       We all share that concern and hope that with your cooperation the      Senate Judiciary Committee can begin reviewing those documents that      have been processed  and any other documents that have been provided      to the press  as they become available    Respectfully   PATRICK LEAHY     Ranking Democratic Member  cc  Andrew H  Card  Jr
