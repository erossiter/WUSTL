       Leahy Unveils Bill To Foster Low Cost Drugs For World s Poorest                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Leahy Unveils Bill      To Foster Low Cost Drugs      For Worlds Poorest               Leahys Hold On The Schwab USTR Nomination       Elicits WH Views On The Issue   WASHINGTON        Thursday  May 25     Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday       introduced legislation to foster production of low cost versions       of life saving medicines for millions in the poorest nations who       now cannot afford them    Leahy said his       Life Saving Medicines Export Act would allow U S  generic drug       firms to manufacture low cost generic versions of patented       medicines for export to nations in need when a voluntary       agreement between the generic and the brand name U S  company       cannot be negotiated  Those patent holders would get royalty       payments  and the generic firms would then be required to sell       those less expensive drugs only to the poorest countries    Today 15 percent of       the worlds people consume 91 percent of the worlds       pharmaceuticals  Leahy said  The high price of many       life saving medicines  medicines that we take for granted  is       beyond reach for millions of the worlds most vulnerable       populations  Imagine if you  or a loved one  were dying and you       knew the medicine to cure the disease exists and costs only a       few dollars  but you have no way to get it or to pay for it        That is a reality for millions of people today    The need for these       medicines is clear and present  but the market to provide them       is not  Leahy continued  The incentives in this bill would       help change that    Leahys bill would       amend U S  patent law to allow implementation of the low cost       drug provisions of a 148 nation agreement reached last year        The Bush Administration itself has not proposed any implementing       legislation  even though U S  Trade Ambassador Rob Portman has       called the agreement a landmark achievement that we hope will       help developing countries devastated by HIV AIDS and other       public heath crises  and his office said this approach will       allow countries to override patent rights when necessary to       export life saving drugs  Leahy is the Democratic leader of       the Senate Judiciary Committee  which oversees patent laws  He       also is the ranking member of the Senate Subcommittee on State        Foreign Operations  And Related Programs  of the Appropriations       Committee     In a related       development  Leahy Wednesday placed a hold on the nomination of       Deputy U S  Trade Representative Susan C  Schwab    to replace       Amb  Rob  Portman as the U S  Trade       Representative    as leverage to       about whether the White House intends to       propose implementing legislation of its own  Portman on       Thursday   asserting that the Administration has no       present plans to propose implementing legislation  concluding       that the idea merits further careful consideration and       offering to discuss it further with Leahy  Having received the       Administrations answer  Leahy Thursday released his hold on the       Schwab nomination    Leahys bill       addresses the extremely low rate of treatment of a wide variety       of diseases for which there are pharmaceutical cures and       treatments  Leahy said infectious and parasitic diseases remain       the major killers of children in the developing world and       communicable diseases still account for seven out of the top ten       causes of childhood deaths  Thirty five percent of Africas       children are at higher risk of death today than they were 10       years ago  Reports by UNICEF  UNAIDS  WHO and Doctors Without       Borders clearly show that the high prices of many life saving       medicines and diagnostics are a significant barrier to their       availability in the poorest areas of the world     Leading causes of       death in the developing worlds children include perinatal       conditions  lower respiratory infections  diarrhea diseases        malaria  measles  congenital anomalies  HIV AIDS  pertussis and       tetanus  Only about 12 percent of HIV positive people worldwide       have daily antiretroviral drugs available to them  Leahy said    Leahy has worked for       months with a wide range of foundations  humanitarian       organizations  religious groups  generic drugmakers and others       in developing the bill    The Vermont senator       said he is hopeful about the prospects of his bill eventually       becoming law  The fact that deadly diseases today are just a       plane ride away    and the emergence of new threats like Avian       Flu  have finally convinced us that global health is also an       issue of national security                      Section By Section Summary      Of The Life Saving Medicines Export Act of 2006      Chief Sponsor  Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Introduced May 25  2006   Section 1  Short       Title  Sets forth the name of the Act as the Life Saving       Medicines Export Act of 2006    Section 2  Purposes       and Congressional Findings   Section 2 states that the purpose       of the Act is to promote public health under World Trade       Organization agreements by permitting the export of generic       versions of life saving patented pharmaceutical products and       other medicines  including diagnostic tools and vaccines  needed       to prevent or treat potentially life threatening diseases to       residents of impoverished countries with insufficient or no       manufacturing capacity to make the medicines  The findings set       forth determinations by the World Health Organization concerning       the millions of low income persons without regular access to       medicines in lesser developed or developing nations    Section 3        Exportation of Generic Medicines for Public Health Purposes         This section requires the Director of the United States Patent       and Trademark Office to issue a compulsory license  permission       to make and sell a patented product under this new Act  to       permit generic companies to make and export medicines under the       terms of WTO international agreements under several conditions    The recipient       country must be a least developed nation  as defined by the       United Nations  or a developing nation without the ability to       manufacture the medicine in question    The recipient       country  called an eligible country in the bill  must notify       the WTO of its interest in participating in this program    Efforts must have       been made by the generic company to buy the right to make and       sell the medicine under normal business arrangements with the       patent holders    The medical product       exported under this Act must be needed to prevent or treat       potentially life threatening health problems and can only be       used in least developed or developing nations  and is not for       re export except in identified circumstances relating to       regional trade alliances     Special labeling and       packaging must be used to make clear that the product is sold       under the authority of the WTO agreement only for use as allowed       under agreement and this bill    The permission to       make and sell the product  the license  can not exceed seven       years  except that the license may be extended once    The holder of the       compulsory license shall pay a royalty to the patent holder  as       determined by the Director of the PTO within a limited range of       possible rates set forth in the bill  taking into account such       factors as humanitarian needs  the economic value to the       importing nation  and the need for low cost pharmaceutical       products by persons in the importing nation    The maximum royalty       for any shipment shall not exceed 4 percent times the commercial       value of the pharmaceutical products to be exported under this       Act under that supply agreement     An alternative       royalty payment approach  modeled after the approach enacted       into law by Canada  would also be permitted with the same 4       percent maximum  In addition  the Director may accept combined       applications from multiple eligible countries  Note that in       emergency situations the Director may waive provisions of the       bill in a manner consistent with the WTO agreements      Section 4  Not a       patent infringement   This section makes clear that compulsory       licenses issued under this Act shall not be considered an       infringement of a patent    Section 5  National       Advisory Board on Implementation of the General Council       Decision   This section creates a diverse advisory board  of       academic  patent  trade  medical  international aid  and       industry experts  to advise the Director  and to report to the       Congress  on ways to improve implementation of the bill to       achieve its purposes  Mandatory funding for the board is       provided out of the general fund of the U S  at  1 5 million in       fiscal years 2007 and 2008  with declining amounts provided in       subsequent years through 2011
