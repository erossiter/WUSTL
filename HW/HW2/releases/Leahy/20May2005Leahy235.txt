       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy   Our Democracy At Risk                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Nuclear Option Debate Continues      Senate Floor Speech On     Our Democracy At Risk     May 20  2005       MR LEAHY  Mr  President  today we continue to debate the Republican      Leaders bid for one party rule through his insistence to trigger      the nuclear option  I have spoken during the last several days      about this misguided effort to undercut the checks and balances that      the Senate provides in our system of government  and about the need      to protect the rights of the American people  the independence and      fairness of the federal courts  and minority rights here in the      Senate         Yesterday I urged that we get on with the business of the American      people  I spoke about a number of specific items of legislation       including the bipartisan NOPEC bill  S   555  that sits idle       That bill would provide the Justice Department with clearer tools to      challenge the cartel price setting activity of OPEC and help to      lower gas prices for working Americans  I mentioned defense and law      enforcement measures  as well  The Democratic leader  Senator      Corzine and others made similar points about important legislative      priorities  Senator Carper and I talked about the effect this      extended debate is having on the bipartisan asbestos compensation      bill  On Wednesday the Chairman cancelled a markup of the bill and      on Thursday our markup was limited to two hours and many Senators      were unavailable due to this floor debate         Rather than bringing us together to make progress on matters that      could help the American people  the Republican majority insists that      the Senate debate at length a nomination that has been debated at      length over the last three years after being voted down by the      Judiciary Committee in 2002  A couple of years ago the Republican      majority staged a 40 hour talkathon on judicial nominees  It was at      the conclusion of that political exercise orchestrated by the      Republican majority that we discovered that Republican staff had      been stealing files from the Judiciary computer servers for at least      three years  That extended debate  also staged by this Republican      majority amounted to significant lost opportunities for progress on      matters including  ironically  asbestos reform  At that time the      tally was 168 4  The Senate  with Democratic cooperation  had      already confirmed 168 of President Bushs judicial nominations by      November 2003 and balked with regard to a handful  In fact  I      chaired the Judiciary Committee for the 17 months during which we      approved the first 100 of those judges  We have proceeded from      168 4 to 204 judges by the end of last year and reduced judicial      vacancies to their lowest level since President Reagan  We are now      at 208 confirmations and with the efforts of the Democratic leader       we have kept the number of most problematic nominees to a minimum       so the current working tally is 208 5             I thank the Senators who joined in the debate yesterday for their      contributions  Senator Byrd  Senator Kennedy  Senator Kerry  Senator      Baucus  Senator Bingaman  Senator Lautenberg  Senator Mikulski       Senator Harkin  Senator Carper  and Senator Nelson of  Florida          If the vote on the Republican leaders nuclear option were by secret      ballot  we all know that it would fail overwhelmingly  That is      because Senators know that it is wrongwrong in terms of protecting      the rights of the American people  wrong in terms of undercutting      our fundamental system of checks and balances  and wrong in      destroying minority protection in the Senate in favor of a one party      rule system  Democratic Senators will not be able to rescue the      Senate and our system of checks and balances from the breaking of      the Senate rules that the Republican leader is planning to demand       If the rights of the minority are to be preserved  if the Senates      unique role in our system of government is to be preserved  it will      take at least six Republicans standing up for fairness and for      checks and balances  I believe that a number of Republican Senators      know in their hearts that this nuclear option is the wrong way to      go  I have to believe that enough Republican Senators will put the      Senate first  the Constitution first  and the American people first       and withstand the momentary political pressures when they cast their      votes          The Lessons of Democracy Around the World       I have spoken to Senator Isakson regarding his comment earlier this      year about the effort to bring democracy to  Iraq  I know he sought      to clarify his comments yesterday  The Senator observed that a      Kurdish leader in the middle of Iraq said he had a secret weapon      to instill democracy  According to the Senator  He said that      secret weapon is one word  Filibuster  The Senator went on to      observe  If there were ever a reason for optimism about what this      supplemental provides for the people of Iraq and their stability and      security  it is one of their minority leaders proudly stating one of      the pillars and principles of our Government as the way they would      ensure that the majority never overran the minority  Senator      Isakson was right  I would add that protection of the minority      remains an important pillar of our democracy  as well          The recently constituted Iraqi National Assembly was elected in      January  In April it acted pursuant to its governing law to select      a presidency council by the required vote of two thirds of the      Assembly  a supermajority  More recently cabinet ministers from a      number of political parties and religious and ethnic groups were      announced  Use of the nuclear option in the Senate is akin to      Iraqis in the majority political party of the Assembly saying that      they have decided to disregard their governing law and to pick only      members of their own party for the government and to do so by a      simple majority vote  They might feel justified in acting contrary      to law because the Kurds and the Sunni were driving a hard bargain       Governing through consensus is not as easy as ruling unilaterally       It is not supposed to be  That is why our system of government is      the worlds example         If Iraqi Shiites  Sunni and Kurds can cooperate in their new      government to make democratic decisions  so can Republicans and      Democrats in the United States Senate  If the Iraqi law and      Assembly can protect minority rights and participation  so can our      rules and the United States Senate  That has been the defining      characteristic of the Senate and one of the principal ways in which      it was designed to be distinct from the House or Representatives        Recently the Senate passed an emergency supplemental appropriations      bill to fund the war efforts in  Iraq and Afghanistan  The      justification for these billions of dollars being spent each week is      that we are seeking to establish democracies  How ironic that at      the same time we are undertaking these efforts  at great cost to so      many American families  the Republican majority in the United States      Senate is seeking to undermine the protection of minority rights and      checks and balances         Let me also mention some of the recent statements by the President      as he has discussed democracy in other countries  Earlier this      month President Bush met with President Putin of  Russia  At his press      conference in Latvia  President Bush noted  The promise of      democracy is fulfilled by minority rights  and equal justice under      the rule of law  and an inclusive society in which every person      belongs  The promise of democracy in this country likewise      requires protection of minority rights         On that same recent  foreign trip the President correctly observed       A true democracy is one that says minorities are important and that      the will of the majority cant trample the minority      That      which is necessary to constitute a true democracy in Eastern Europe      is needed  as well  here in the cradle of democracy          Earlier this year in another press conference with his good friend       President Putin  President Bush said  Democracies always reflect a      countrys customs and culture  and I know that  But democracies      have certain things in common  They have a rule of law and      protection of minorities  a free press and a viable political      opposition    I      agree with his observations  I comment them to all Senators  Let      us uphold the rule of law and the rules of the Senate that protect      the minority as a viable political opposition         In addition to the President  others have spoken recently about the      fundamentals of democracy  Secretary of State Rice said recently      while overseas  It is not easy to build democracy         It means      having a strong legislative branch  It means having a strong      independent judiciary       along with freedom of speech  freedom of      worship and protection of minority rights  thats how you build a      democracy  I agree with Secretary Rice  those are the components      of a democracy  We need to maintain the Senate as a strong      legislative branch to serve as a check on the Executive  We need a      strong independent judiciary to serve as a check on the political      branches  We need to protect free speech and freedom of religion       And to maintain our democracy here in the  United States we need      to protect minority rights         On her way to Moscow recently  the Secretary of State said   T he      centralization of state power in the presidency at the expense of      countervailing institutions like the Duma or an independent      judiciary is clearly very wrong  Just as those developments      undercut democracy in  Russia  so  too  our American      democracy is undercut by the concentration of power in the      executive  removing checks and balances  and undermining the      independence of the federal judiciary         It is ironic given that President Bush and Secretary of State Rice      speak so eloquently about the fundamental requirements of a      democratic society when they meet with world leaders  but the Bush      Administration and Senate Republicans are intent on employing the      nuclear option to consolidate power in this presidency in this      country  They know  as all Americans know  that democracy relies on      the sharing of power  on checks and balances  on an independent      court system  on the protection of minority rights  and on      safeguarding human rights and human dignity  The nuclear option      is in direct contradiction to maintaining those values and those      components of our democracy  Just as Abu Ghraib and other abuses      make it more difficult for our country effectively to condemn      torture and abuse when we speak to the rest of the world  the      nuclear option used as a partisan effort to consolidate power in a      single political party and institution will make all the lectures on      democracy we give to leaders of other countries ring hollow        I have spoken of a group of Russian parliamentarians who came to see      me to talk about our federal judiciary  Like other representatives      of emerging democracies around the world  they asked  Is it true      that in the  United States the government might be      a party in a lawsuit and that the government could lose  I said       Absolutely right  They said  People would dare to sue the      government  I said  We have an independent judiciary  yes  they      could  They said  Well  if the government lost  you fire the      judges  of course  I said  No  they are an independent judiciary       This amazes people in other parts of the world  that people who      disagreed with the government could actually go to court  bring a      challenge and seek redress even if it meant the government lost       Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to refer to our independent      judiciary as the crown jewel of our democracy  It is dazzling             Judicial fairness and independent are also essential if we are to      maintain our freedoms  And we must stop the dangerous and      irresponsible rhetoric slamming the federal judiciary  We do not      have to agree with every one of their opinions  but let us respect      their independence  Let no one say things that might bring about      further threats against our judges as they endeavor to do their jobs      of serving justice  Justice OConnor was right to condemn such      virulent talk  Judge Lefkow has sacrificed too much for us not to      heed her words  We ought to be protecting them physically and      institutionally  Do not take the easy rhetorical pot shots that put      judges in real danger and that attack the very independence of our      federal judiciary         When the United States Supreme Court decided the presidential      election in 2000  I thought that the  5 4 majority engaged in an incredible      overreaching act of judicial activism  I  nonetheless  called for      Americans to respect the opinion of the Court  I attended the      argument of Bush v  Gore with my Republican counterpart  in      order to show the country that we had to get along and work      together  Democrats did not impeach Justice Scalia when we      wholeheartedly disagreed with his action         Part of upholding the Constitution is upholding the independence of      the third branch of government  One political party or the other      will control the presidency  One party or the other will control      Congress  no political party should control the judiciary  It      should be independent of all political parties  That was the genius      of the founders of this country  It is the genius that has protected      our liberties and our rights for well over 200 years  It is the      genius of this country that will continue to protect us unless we      allow some to destroy it for short term political gain  It would be      a terrible diminution of our rights if we were to remove the      independence of our federal judiciary  That would do things that no      armies that have marched against us have ever been able to do  If      you take away theindependence of our federal judiciary  then our      whole constitutional fabric unravels        That is what the minority is striving to protect  That is what we      are defending  The nuclear option is a threat to the protection of      the minority  the independence of our judiciary  the protection of      Americans rights and to our democracy  It must be rejected
