       Leahy Opposes Nomination Of Priscilla Owen  Panel Approves Nominee On   Party Line Vote                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy Opposes      Nomination Of Priscilla Owen      Panel Approves Nominee On Party Line Vote WASHINGTON       Thursday  April 21  2005   The Senate Judiciary Committee  in a      10 8 party line vote  reported out the controversial judicial      nomination of Priscilla Owen on Thursday  All eight Democratic      members of the Committee voted against the nomination  which now      moves to the full Senate  Owen is nominated to the Fifth Circuit      Court of Appeals  The Senate rejected her nomination last Congress       with Democrats opposing Owen based on her record of judicial      activism and established bias against consumers and victims  A      statement from Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic      member of the panel  opposing the nomination  follows  as well as      background material on Owens record    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of Priscilla Owen     To The U S  Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit     April 21  2005 Three years ago      I first considered the nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on      the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  After      reviewing her record  hearing her testimony and evaluating her      answers I voted against her confirmation and explained at length why      I did not support her confirmation  Nothing about her record or the      reasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed      since that time  Unlike the consideration of the nomination of      William Myers  on which this Committee held another hearing this      year before seeking reconsideration  there has been no effort to      supplement the record on this nomination  It was  in my view       inadequate to justify a favorable reporting of the nomination in      2002 and was inadequate to gain the consent of the Senate during the      last two years   I suspect that      as this controversial renomination makes its way to the Senate      floor  again  it will be used to trigger a partisan driven      scorched earth deployment by Senate Republicans of their nuclear      option   In the 107th      Congress  when I served as Chairman of the Committee  Justice Owen      was treated with extreme fairness  and given due process and      consideration by this Committee  Senator Feinstein chaired a very      evenhanded hearing  noticeable for its fairness and calm  Those who      had concerns about her record raised them and heard the nominee s      responses  in private meetings  at her public hearing and in written      follow up questions  I brought her nomination up for a vote  and      following an open debate where her opponents discussed her record      and their objections on the merits  the nomination was rejected       She was accorded courtesy and fairness and her nomination was      openly debated and rejected  That fair treatment stands in sharp      contrast to the way Republicans had treated President Clintons      nominees  including several to the Fifth Circuit   That should      have ended things right there  But looking back  we now see that      this nomination represents how the White House and Senate      Republicans will trample on precedent and do whatever is necessary      in order to get every last nominee of this Presidents confirmed  no      matter how extreme he or she may be  Priscilla Owens nomination      was the first judicial nomination ever to be resubmitted after      already being debated  voted upon and rejected by the Senate      Judiciary Committee   When the Senate      majority shifted  Republicans reconsidered this nomination and sent      it to the Senate on a straight  party line vote  When they had been      in the majority they had refused to hold hearings on President      Clintons Fifth Circuit nominees from Texas for this same vacancy         Enrique Moreno and Judge Jorge Rangel   Senators who      opposed this nomination did so because Priscilla Owens record shows      her to be an ends oriented activist judge  I have previously      explained my views of Justice Owens record  I have noted the      criticism her decisions engendered from others on the conservative      Texas Supreme Court  and how her rulings favored the interests of      big business over ordinary people   Today  I will      just highlight some of the cases that illustrate these points   Criticism By Texas Republican      Majority  The first area of concern to me is      Justice Owen s extremism even among a conservative Supreme Court of      Texas  The conservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme      Court has gone out of its way to criticize Justice Owen  and the      fact that she joined dissents in ways that are highly unusual and      that highlight her ends oriented activism  A number of Texas      Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from the language of      statute she has strayed in her attempts to push the law beyond what      the legislature intended  One example of      criticism from the majority is the courts opinion in the case of      Weiner v  Wasson  900 S W 2d 316  Tex  1995   Part of it       written by our colleague  then Justice Cornyn  reads as a lecture to      the dissent  which included Owen  on the importance of abiding by a      prior Texas Supreme Court decision  As written back then  it is      hard to read it any other way than as a painstakingly elementary      exegesis on why adherence to precedent is important   In      Montgomery Independent School District v  Davis  34 S W  3d 559       Tex  2000   Justice Owen wrote another dissent which drew fire from      a conservative Republican majority    this time for her disregard      for legislative language  The majority  which included Alberto      Gonzales and two other appointees of then Governor Bush  was quite      explicit about its view that Justice Owen s position disregarded the      law  In Collins      v  Ison Newsome  73 S W 3d 178    another dissent  this time      joined by Justice Owen    was roundly criticized by the Republican      majority of the Texas Supreme Court  The Court cogently stated the      legal basis for its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to decide      the matter before it  and  as in other opinions where Justice Owen      was in dissent  took time to explicitly criticize the dissent s      positions as contrary to the clear letter of the law  Again       Justice Owen joined a dissent that the Republican majority described      as defiant of legislative intent and in disregard of legislatively      drawn limits  Some of the      most striking examples of criticism of Justice Owen s writings  or      the dissents and concurrences she joins  come in a series of      parental notification cases heard in 2000  They include    In re       Jane Doe 1  where the majority included an unusual section       explaining its view of the proper role of judges  admonishing       the dissent joined by Justice Owen for going beyond its duty to       interpret the law in an attempt to fashion policy      Giving a pointed critique of the       dissenters  the majority explained that  AIn reaching the       decision to grant Jane Doe s application  we have put aside our       personal viewpoints and endeavored to do our job as judges          that is  to interpret and apply the Legislature s will as it has       been expressed in the statute  19 S W 3d 346       In a separate concurrence        Justice Alberto Gonzales wrote that to the construe law as the       dissent did  Awould be an unconscionable act of judicial       activism    In In re       Jane Doe 3  Justice Enoch wrote specifically to rebuke       Justice Owen and her follow dissenters for misconstruing the       legislature s definition of the sort of abuse that may occur       when parents are notified of a minor s intent to have an       abortion  saying  Aabuse is abuse  it is neither to be trifled       with nor its severity to be second guessed   In one case      that is perhaps the exception that proves the rule  Justice Owen      wrote a majority opinion that was bitterly criticized by the dissent      for its activism  In In re City of Georgetown  53 S W  3d      328   Tex  2001   Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion finding that      the city did not have to give The Austin American Statesman a      report prepared by a consulting expert in connection with pending      and anticipated litigation because such information was expressly      made confidential under other law  namely the Texas Rules of Civil      Procedure  The dissent is extremely critical of Justice Owen s      opinion  citing Texas law s strong preference for disclosure and      liberal construction   These examples       together with the unusually harsh language directed at Justice      Owen s position by the majority in the Doe cases  show a judge out      of step with the conservative Republican majority of the Texas      Supreme Court  a majority not afraid to explain the danger of her      activist views   Judicial Activism Showing Bias      Against Consumers  Victims  Individuals I am also      greatly concerned about Justice Owen s record of ends oriented      decisionmaking as a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court  As one      reads case after case  particularly those in which she was the sole      dissenter or dissented with the extreme right wing of the Court  her      pattern of activism becomes clear  Her legal views in so many cases      involving statutory interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with      the plain meaning of the statute  the legislative intent  or the      majority s interpretation  leading to the conclusion that she sets      out to justify some pre conceived idea of what the law ought to      mean  This is not an appropriate way for a judge to make      decisions  This is a judge whose record reflects that she is      willing and sometimes eager to make law from the bench   A few examples      include  FM      Properties v  City of Austin       where Justice Owen showed her willingness to rule in favor of large      private landowners against the clear public interest in maintaining      a fair regulatory process and clean water  Her dissent  which the      majority characterized as  Anothing more than inflammatory      rhetoric   was an attempt to favor big landowners  At her first      hearing  and since  Justice Owen and her supporters on the Committee      have tried to recast this case as something more innocent  but at      the time she wrote her dissent  Justice Owen was certainly clear      about the meaning of this case    property rights for big      corporations  GTE      Southwest  Inc  v  Bruce       is another example where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a      lawsuit by employees for intentional infliction of emotional      distress  Despite the majoritys recitation of an exhaustive list      of sickening behavior by the supervisor  and its clear application      of Texas law to those facts  Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion      to explain that the conduct was not  as the standard requires  Aso      outrageous in character  and so extreme in degree  as to go beyond      all possible bounds of decencyY  Id  at 621  The majority opinion      shows Justice Owen s concurrence advocating an inexplicable point of      view that ignores the facts in evidence in order to reach a      predetermined outcome in the corporation s favor  In City of      Garland v  Dallas Morning News  22 S W  3d 351  Tex  2000        Justice Owen dissented from a majority opinion and  again  it is      difficult to justify her views other than as based on a desire to      reach a particular outcome  this time shielding government      decision making from public view   Quantum      Chemical v  Toennies  47      S W  3d 473  Tex  2001   is another troubling case where Justice      Owen joined a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a      clearly written statute  this time in the context of employment      discrimination  The Texas majority concluded that they must rely on      the plain language of the statute as amended  which could not be any      clearer that under Title VII discrimination can be shown to be Aa       motivating factor  contrary to Justice Owens more activist view   Notification Cases Justice Owen      has also demonstrated her tendency toward ends oriented decision      making quite clearly in a series of dissents and concurrences in      cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of      parental notification requirements for minors seeking abortions  I      know recently distributed materials attempt to paint Justice Owens      parental notification cases in a more favorable light  but I think      we all see those attempts for the revisionism they are   Any fair      reading of her opinions in these cases shows that in 11 of 12      decisions involving judicial bypass  which affected 10 different      young women  Owen voted either to deny or to create greater      obstacles to a bypass  Any fair reading of her language shows a      jurist uncomfortable with the legislatures choices  trying mightily      to impose her own  And any reading of Alberto Gonzaless separate      concurrence in one of the cases shows that at least one of her      Republican colleagues considered her views to represent      unconscionable judicial activism  This is not the sort of judge      who deserves a lifetime appointment to the federal bench   Conclusion  When he nominated Priscilla Owen       President Bush said that his standard for judging judicial nominees      would be that they Ashare a commitment to follow and apply the law       not to make law from the bench   Priscilla Owen s record of      ends oriented judicial activism does not qualify her under that      standard for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench   The President      has often spoken of judicial activism without acknowledging that      ends oriented decision making can come easily to ideological      conservative nominees  In the case of Priscilla Owen  we see a      perfect example of such an approach to the law  and I cannot support      it  The oath taken by federal judges affirms their commitment to      Aadminister justice without respect to persons  and do equal right      to the poor and to the rich   No one who enters a federal courtroom      should have to wonder whether he or she will be fairly heard by the      judge  Justice Priscilla Owen s record of judicial activism and      ends oriented decision making leaves me with grave doubt about her      ability to be a fair judge  The President says he opposes putting      judicial activists on the federal bench  yet Justice Priscilla Owen      unquestionably is a judicial activist  I cannot vote to confirm her      for this appointment to one of the highest courts in the land                            Background material on Justice Owens Record   PRISCILLA OWEN  NOMINEE TO THE U S       COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT FROM TEXAS  PRISCILLA OWEN IS AN ENDS ORIENTED      JUDICIAL ACTIVIST SHOWING BIAS AGAINST CONSUMERS  VICTIMS       INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS In      case after case involving a variety of legal issues  the judicial      record of Justice Priscilla Owen shows her to be a judicial      activist  willing to make law from the bench rather than follow the      language and intent of the legislature        She has demonstrated this tendency most clearly in a series of      dissents in cases involving a Texas law providing for a judicial      bypass of parental notification requirements for minors seeking      abortions  She sought to erect barriers that did not exist in the      statute  In      addition to cases dealing with parental notification  Justice Owens      activism and extremism is noteworthy in a variety of cases       including those dealing with business interests  malpractice  access      to public information  employment discrimination and Texas Supreme      Court jurisdiction  in which she rules against individual plaintiffs      time and time again   THE CONSERVATIVE MAJORITYS      CRITICISM OF JUSTICE OWEN IS DISTURBING AND HIGHLIGHTS HER ACTIVISM      Priscilla Owens position as a frequent dissenter on the Texas      Supreme Court filled with Republican appointees highlights her      activist bent  showing how far from the language of the statute she      strays in her attempts to push the law beyond what the legislature      intended       Criticisms of her dissents by the majority include the following       unusual in legal writing for their harsh tone    In FM       Properties v  City of Austin  the majority calls her       dissent  nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric      In Montgomery Independent       School District v  Davis  the majority  which included       Alberto Gonzales and two other Bush appointees  is quite       explicit about its view that Owens position disregards the law        saying that nothing in the statute requires what she says it       does  and that  the dissenting opinions misconception             stems from its disregard of the procedural elements the       Legislature established  and that the  dissenting opinion not       only disregards the procedural limitations in the statute but       takes a position even more extreme than that argued for by the       board           In In re Jane Doe  the       majority includes an extremely unusual section explaining its       view of the proper role of judges  admonishing the dissent       joined by Justice Owen for going beyond its duty to interpret       the law in an attempt to fashion policy  and in a separate       concurrence  Justice Alberto Gonzales says that to the construe       law as the dissent did  would be an unconscionable act of       judicial activism       In Weiner v  Wasson  in       what reads as a lecture to the dissent  then Justice John Cornyn        now Senator Cornyn  explains stare decisis on behalf of the       majority  in language that would be used with a beginning law       student       In In re Jane Doe 3        Justice Enoch writes specifically to rebuke Owen and her follow       dissenters for misconstruing the legislatures definition of the       sort of abuse that may occur when parents are notified of a       minors intent to have an abortion  saying  abuse is abuse  it       is neither to be trifled with nor its severity to be second       guessed       PRISCILLA OWEN SHOWS INSUFFICIENT      CONCERN OVER ETHICAL ISSUES       Priscilla Owens record on money related ethical issues is more      troubling than her colleagues  who also receive campaign      contributions  because her money comes from a small group of special      business interests  who advance clear anti consumer and anti choice      agendas  and her record has shows that her donors enjoy greater      success before her than before the majority of the Court         She has repeatedly presided over cases involving law firms or      litigants who contributed substantially to her election campaigns       failing to either disclose such contributions to the parties before      her or disqualify herself  Although disclosure or recusal is not      required under controlling Texas law  Owens failure to disclose      indicates that she lacks the moral and ethical commitment to act in      a manner that promotes public confidence in the integrity and      impartiality of the judiciary        She made dismissive comments on an important ethical issue  the      clerk perk scandal  again indicating a lack of concern for ethical      issues and the independence of the judiciary  She dismissed the      important ethical and criminal misconduct issues raised by the fact      that the Courts law clerks were receiving bonuses from their future      law firm employers  who regularly argue cases before the Court  as      merely a political issue that is being dressed up as a good      government issue and urged the legislature to make these unethical      bonuses legal
