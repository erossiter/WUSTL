       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Cantwell Amendment Protecting   The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge From Oil Exploration                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT    Statement Of Senator         Patrick Leahy        On The Cantwell Amendment         Protecting The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge From Oil Exploration        March 16  2005 Mr  President  I rise today to express my        strong support for Senator Cantwells amendment to the Budget Resolution        protecting the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge         Senator Cantwells amendment aims to strike a controversial provision that        effectively paves the way to allowing oil and gas exploration in one of our        nations most pristine and unique wild places  This is a common sense        amendment  which upholds the will of the American people in preserving this        remote area  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting it  There is a strong consensus among all of us here  on        both sides of the aisle that decisive steps need to be taken by this        Congress to secure our nations future energy needs  We know that energy        demand is rising not only in our own country but around the world         especially in nations such as India and China  We also know that there are        grave national security implications for remaining reliant on foreign oil         And we know first hand from our constituents  many of whom are struggling        to heat their homes this winter  that the price of oil remains disturbingly        high   Drilling proponents want us to believe that resource        exploration in the Arctic Refuge will be a one stop solution to these        critical energy challenges and that by doing so we will be closer to        securing our future energy needs  This insinuation is flat wrong   Even drilling proponents concede that any recoverable        oil that the coastal plain would yield would not reach world markets for at        least another 7 12 years  This will do absolutely nothing to help my        constituents who have sticker shock at the gas pump or are seeing record        home heating prices today  Even during peak production  expected around        2025  the amount of oil from the Arctic Refuge would reduce American        imports by only around three percent according to the Energy Information        Agency   On numerous occasions I have come to the Senate floor        urging my colleagues to adopt real solutions to our nations pressing        energy challenges  We should be increasing the nations fuel economy        standards  which have remained unchanged for over ten years  We should        also be making a stronger commitment to the development of renewable energy        and energy conservation technologies by offering tax incentives to both        producers and consumers  It is mind boggling to me that drilling        proponents have provided so little leadership in forwarding these policy        solutions  Instead they continue to offer the American people a false        choice between environmental protection and energy security   In another bold move  the Administration has tried to        sugarcoat oil development in the Arctic Refuge by massively inflating the        projected revenues from anticipated lease sales there  The Administration        claims that lease sales will generate  2 5 billion in revenue in 2007  To        get to that amount  leases would have to sell for between  4 000 and  6 000        per acre  In comparison  leases on the North Slope of Alaska have averaged        only  50 per acre over the last twenty years  When I questioned Interior        Secretary Norton about this discrepancy she could not explain how the        Administration got to its  2 5 billion estimate  What Secretary Norton and        the Administration dont want to acknowledge is that these revenues are        disturbingly inflated  They also dont want to acknowledge that oil        companies have lost interest in drilling in the Refuge  Only one company        is still a member of the lobbying group pushing for this provision in the        Budget Resolution  The fact is that there are other places the oil        companies prefer  places where it is cheaper to drill and where the        environmental impacts are far less  So why are we here today  Opening the Refuge will do        nothing to help reduce gas prices  It will do nothing to make us less        dependent on foreign oil  Most oil companies are not asking for it  I can        certainly tell you that Vermonters do not want to see this special place        developed  In Vermont  we cherish the natural resources of our state  We        cherish the special resources of this country  Yellowstone  Acadia  the        Grand Canyon  I would put the Arctic Refuge on the same level as these        national treasures   Let me make clear though  I do not oppose energy        development in this country  But not here  not in the Arctic Refuge  Its        time to put this issue behind us and devote our time to working together on        a sustainable  reliable energy supply for the future
