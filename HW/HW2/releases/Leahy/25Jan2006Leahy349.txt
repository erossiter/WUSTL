       Leahy Queries Justice Department On Subpoena Of Customer Records From   Google And Other Internet Search Engines                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy Queries Justice Department     On Subpoena Of Customer Records     From Google And Other Internet Search Engines        Asks Bush Administration To      Explain Reasons     For Seeking Data on Search Habits of Millions of Americans   WASHINGTON       Wednesday  Jan  25     Senator Patrick Leahy sent the following      letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales this week requesting      information about the Department of Justices subpoenas to four      major Internet companies seeking data on what millions of Americans      search for on the Internet   In his letter       Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  is      asking for the types of information the Justice Department was      seeking  how the Department intends to use thatinformation while      protecting Americans privacy interests and civil liberties  and      whether the Department will issue to Internet firms any additional      subpoenas that seek personally identifiable information    According to      public reports  the Justice Department issued the subpoenas in      August 2005 to leading Internet search engine firms  including      Google  America Online  Microsoft Network  and Yahoo  Leahys inquiry      comes at a time when public concern over the governments monitoring      of communications on Americans is on the rise in the wake of news      that the Bush Administration has been conducting warrantless spying      on Americans for the last four years   The text of the      letter follows                   January 24  2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington  D C  20530     Dear Attorney General Gonzales   Fridays Washington Post reported that       in August 2005  the Department of Justice issued subpoenas for      records to four major Internet companies    Google  Inc   America      Online  Inc   Microsoft Network  and Yahoo  Inc     seeking data      about what millions of Americans search for on the Internets      leading search engines  According to this and other recent press      reports  the Justice Department issued these subpoenas as part of an      ongoing effort to measure the effectiveness of the protections      provided for under the Child Online Protection Act  COPA   as      compared with existing technologies such as filtering software  The COPA passed Congress in 1998  when it was      included  without debate  in an omnibus appropriations bill  I      opposed this effort to regulate Internet speech  noting that there      are better ways to protect children that have less impact on      constitutionally protected speech  including the use of blocking and      filtering tools  I predicted that the COPA would fail in the courts      because these less restrictive means exist  and because Congress had      not shown otherwise  My concerns were echoed at that time by the      Justice Department  which also cautioned that enforcing the COPAs      criminal prohibitions could require an undesirable diversion of      critical investigative and prosecutorial resources that the      Department currently invests in combating traffickers in hard core      child pornography  in thwarting child predators  and in prosecuting      large scale and multidistrict commercial distributors of obscene      materials   I inquire about the Departments efforts to      obtain and use commercial web browsing data against the backdrop of      strong public concern over the governments monitoring of Internet      communications and warrantless eavesdropping on the telephone      conversations of American citizens  The collection and use by      government law enforcement agencies of such commercial transactional      data on law abiding Americans poses unique concerns  including the      specter of excessive government surveillance that may intrude upon      important privacy interests and chill the exercise of First      Amendment protected speech and associational rights  Accordingly  I      am interested in learning more about the extent to which the      Department of Justice is relying upon data mining of the Internet      search queries made by law abiding American citizens to support its      efforts under the COPA and how the Department is addressing the      privacy and civil liberties concerns raised by the collection       storage and use of such data   Specifically  I ask for and would appreciate      your responses to the following questions  1  According to press reports  the      Department of Justice issued subpoenas for records to Google  Inc       America Online  Inc   Microsoft Network  and Yahoo  Inc        collective  the Internet Companies  in connection with ongoing      civil litigation involving the legality of the COPA  Please state      whether any  or all  of the Departments subpoenas to the Internet      companies were issued in connection with this  or any other  civil      or criminal litigation or investigation  2  Please identify the type s  of      information and or data that the Department requested in its      subpoenas for records issued to the Internet companies    including      whether the Department requested  or obtained  any personal      identifying information and or data in connection with the subpoenas         and state how the Department intends to use this commercial      information and or data  3  Please state what  if any       safeguards are in place within the Department of Justice to protect      the privacy of the millions of American people who conduct searches      on the Internet in light of the Departments requests for this      commercial information and or data  4  Please state whether the Department      will issue any additional subpoenas to the Internet Companies and       if so  state whether any such subpoenas will seek personally      identifiable information  5  Please provide any documentation      that relates to  or supports  the answers to these questions  Thank you in advance for your consideration  I      look forward to your prompt response to this letter  Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     Ranking Member
