       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The Arrest Of Kelbessa Negewo    Intel Reform Act                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt           Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         On The Presidents Medical Malpractice Proposal        Wednesday  January 5  2005  Thoughtful        solutions for reducing medical malpractice insurance premiums will require        creative thinking  a genuine effort to rectify the problem and bipartisan        consensus to achieve real reform  Unfortunately  these are not the        characteristics of the President s proposal  By ignoring the central truth        of this crisis    that it is a problem within the insurance industry  not        the tort system    the Administration has proposed a plan that punishes        victims by capping non economic damages  The notion that such a        one size fits all scheme imposed on every state is the answer runs counter        to the factual experience of the states   Most        importantly  the President s proposal does nothing to protect true victims        of medical malpractice  A cap of  250 000 would arbitrarily limit        compensation to the most vulnerable victims  the women  children and        seniors who do not have wage income and therefore must rely on non economic        damages for justice   We already        knew the ways the Presidents plan helps the insurance companies  but this        week we learned that it also sides with the drug companies over consumers        by letting drug makers off the hook when patients are injured by drugs          If        Congress is serious about controlling rising medical malpractice insurance        premiums  then we must enact tough insurance reforms to promote real        competition in the insurance industry   For        example  insurers for too many years have enjoyed a benefit that is novel        in our marketplace  a broad exemption to federal antitrust law  The        McCarran Ferguson Act permits insurance companies to operate without being        subject to most of the federal antitrust laws  and our nation s physicians        and their patients have been the worse off for it  Using their exemption         insurers can collude to set rates  resulting in higher premiums than true        competition would achieve in the marketplace  Because of this exemption         enforcement officials cannot investigate any such collusion    I plan        to introduce legislation to modify the insurance industrys exemption to        federal anti trust laws to reduce medical malpractice insurance rates  I        hope the President will embrace this real reform
