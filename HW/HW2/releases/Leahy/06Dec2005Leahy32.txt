       Senate As A Full Partner  Not A Rubber Stamp                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Senate As A Full Partner  Not A       Rubber Stamp  The Hill      Published December 6  2005  By Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt    The stakes for the       American people could not be higher with the pending nomination       to the Supreme Court   When Justice Sandra       Day OConnor leaves the court  she ends an era that began a       quarter of a century ago on the day she was sworn in as the       first female justice  More than being the first womans voice on       the nations highest court  Justice OConnor brought an open       mind to the cases she reviewed and served as a moderating and       decisive influence on the bench   The person who       succeeds her replaces a pivotal vote and will affect many       fundamental freedoms and protections on which Americans have       come to rely  Her successor has the potential to tilt       dramatically the balance of the court and will play a crucial a       role in shaping its next era  Will it be an era that strengthens       or weakens the rights and freedoms and fair shake that ordinary       Americans count on the court to defend  Will it be an era of       dramatic expansion of executive branch authority at the expense       of the legislative branch  or an era of appropriate checks on       abuses of presidential power   I supported the       nomination of Chief Justice Roberts  after meeting with him       several times  reviewing his record and carefully listening to       his testimony during the hearings before the Judiciary       Committee  It was not an easy decision  but it was one I made in       the hope that Chief Justice Roberts would be his own man on the       high court   Unfortunately  the       Senate did not get the same opportunity to consider President       Bushs next nomination to the court  The president  yielding to       intense pressure from right wing political factions  abruptly       withdrew his nomination of Harriet Miers before the Senate had       an opportunity to hold hearings or schedule a vote  It was an       eye opening experience for the country  exposing for all to see       the litmus tests and motives of a vocal and virulent wing of the       presidents political base  This ideological segment and its       operatives do not really want an independent federal judiciary        They want judges who will guarantee the political results they       want   They got their way        and then we watched these same right wing factions rush and gush       to support Judge Alitos nomination  Without any hearings or       public scrutiny of this nominee  why would they so fervently       embrace Judge Alito  What did they know about Judge Alito that       the rest of the American people and the Senate did not yet know        What did they know about Judge Alito that they did not know       about Harriet Miers   I have not formed a       final judgment on the merits of Judge Alitos nomination  As I       did with Chief Justice Roberts and as I would have done with Ms        Miers  I will make up my mind after the committee hearings  The       hearings are the best setting for comprehensive evaluation and       the only opportunity for the Senate and the American people to       hear directly from and to reflect on the suitability of a person       who will become a final arbiter on laws that affect us all  It       is the moment for democratic participation in the staffing of       the ultimate check and balance in our system  the independent       federal judiciary  and it is why it is so important   An initial review of       Judge Alitos record has raised some areas of concern that I       expect to explore during the committees hearings  Judge Alitos       opinions from the federal bench show that he would go to great       lengths to restrict the authority of Congress to enact       legislation to make real the rights and interests of ordinary       Americans on issues ranging from civil rights to environmental       quality  and the rights of workers  consumers and women   Also disturbing has       been a 1985 job application to the Meese Justice Department in       which Judge Alito claimed to have been inspired to pursue law       because of strong opposition to landmark cases by the Warren       Court that upheld fundamental rights of all Americans  including       one that ensured that citizens would have an equal voice in       choosing their public officials  These rulings demonstrate the       importance of the judiciary as an independent check on other       branches of government and in ensuring that state legislatures       redrew voting districts that had been grossly unfair to minority       voters  in violation of the Equal Protection Clause  Another       memo that has surfaced shows Judge Alitos role as a Justice       Department lawyer in crafting a strategy to convince the Supreme       Court to limit and eventually to overturn the courts landmark       Roe v  Wade decision   As we prepare for       the January hearings on Judge Alitos nomination  we prepare to       fulfill our constitutional duty as a vital check and balance in       our system of government  The president and the Senate both have       somber constitutional duties in filling judicial vacancies  The       process begins with the president but does not and should not       end there  The Founders did not intend the Senate to be a rubber       stamp to the president but his full partner in this process        This is more than just how our government works  it is why it       works   Leahy is the ranking       member of
