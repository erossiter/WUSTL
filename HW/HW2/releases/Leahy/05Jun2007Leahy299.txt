       Panel Hears From Department Of Justice Official Schlozman  Fired U S    Attorney Graves                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Panel Hears From Department     Of Justice Official Schlozman     Fired U S  Attorney Graves  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  June 5       The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing  Preserving     Prosecutorial Independence  Is The Department Of Justice Politicizing     The Hiring And Firing Of U S  Attorneys    Part V on Tuesday with     Bradley Schlozman  former interim U S  Attorney for the Western District     of Missouri  and former Acting Assistant Attorney General for the Civil     Rights Division in the Department of Justice  and Todd Graves  former     U S  Attorney Western District of Missouri    The American people deserve     a strong and independent Department of Justice with leaders who enforce     the law without fear or favor  Every week seems to bring new     revelations about the erosion of independence at the Justice     Department  said Leahy  This Administration was willing  in the U S      Attorney firings and in the vetting of career hires for political     allegiance  to sacrifice the independence of law enforcement and the     rule of law for loyalty to the White House  The obligations of the     Justice Department are to the Constitution  the rule of law  and to the     American people  not to the political considerations of this White     House     Opening Statement Of     Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is The     Department Of Justice Politicizing The Hiring And Firing Of U S      Attorneys   Part V    June 5  2007    Today  the Committee continues its     investigation into political influences affecting the Justice     Department  Stonewalling by this Administration  conflicts in testimony     and failures of memory by the Attorney General and others have greatly     hampered our efforts to get to the bottom of these matters  When the     President complains that these matters are being drug out  he need     look no farther than his own White House and the Justice Department     leadership he appointed for the reasons this continues to fester  The     Administration should come clean  quit hiding the truth and own up to     its misdeeds  The functions of the Department of Justice should be     above politics  Law enforcement  civil rights enforcement  and voting     rights are all too important to be enmeshed in Karl Roves partisan     political operations    Despite the testimony of officials from     this Administration  we are learning through press accounts that many     more than seven U S  Attorneys were replaced and that perhaps a dozen or     two dozen or three dozen were considered for firing  It was only     through press accounts    not the testimony of Department employees or     the selective documents the Department has so far produced    that the     public learned that one of our witnesses today  Todd Graves  the former     U S  Attorney for the Western District of Missouri  was on those lists     and asked to resign  He is from an earlier wave of replacements in     2006    We have also learned in recent weeks about     apparently extensive efforts by operatives of this Administration to     screen the political allegiances of applicants for career law     enforcement positions  Former Deputy Attorney General Jim Comey has     said such efforts to apply a partisan litmus test strike at the core of     what the department is  We know from her guarded admissions before the     House Judiciary Committee that Monica Goodling crossed the line in     engaging in this conduct  Who else at the Department was involved  who     knew this was going on  who acquiesced or approved it  who directed it      These are all questions that the Department of Justice has refused to     answer or explain    We have been notified that the Inspector     General has expanded his investigation to include some of these     matters  I am writing him asking whether he is also expanding his     investigation to include the meeting in which Attorney General Gonzales     made Ms  Goodling uncomfortable by inappropriately communicating with     her about matters under investigation in what appears to be an effort to     influence her testimony    Our first witness today is Bradley     Schlozman  the first interim U S  Attorney appointed by Attorney General     Gonzales pursuant to the authority granted in the Patriot Act     reauthorization that has since been repealed by this Congress  We hope     to learn the unvarnished facts from Mr  Scholzman about these     unprecedented U S  attorney replacements and use of partisan     considerations in career hiring  We also have questions about Mr      Schlozmans role as the interim U S  Attorney and while at the Civil     Rights Divisions in pressing certain cases in connection with recent     elections   I am deeply troubled by what appears to be     an effort by the White House to manipulate the Department into its own     political arm  The White House cannot have it both ways    it cannot     withhold documents and witnesses and thereby stonewall the investigation     and  at the same time  claim that the facts about White House influence     over federal law enforcement have not been revealed in detail  Because     the White House has continued its refusal to provide information to the     Senate Judiciary Committee on a voluntary basis  I will soon have no     choice but to issue subpoenas  If the White House continues to     stonewall  the obvious conclusion is that they are hiding the truth     because they have something to hide    Today  I hope we can begin to better     understand the role that efforts to influence elections in the name of     pursuing voter fraud may have played a role in these dismissals of     federal prosecutors  The American people deserve a strong and     independent Department of Justice with leaders who enforce the law     without fear or favor  Every week seems to bring new revelations about     the erosion of independence at the Justice Department  This     Administration was willing  in the U S  Attorney firings and in the     vetting of career hires for political allegiance  to sacrifice the     independence of law enforcement and the rule of law for loyalty to the     White House  The obligations of the Justice Department are to the     Constitution  the rule of law  and to the American people  not to the     political considerations of this White House
