     corrects a problem that has been experienced in recent years        as foreign students seek to participate in distance learning        programs  such as those offered at colleges such as Goddard        College and Champlain College  Distance learners enter the        United States to study on a temporary basis  but current        immigration law does not presently provide for a visa for        this purpose    The Leahy amendment solves        this problem by creating a new subcategory under the F visa        program  All other student visa requirements would apply to        these applicants  For example  students who apply for F        visas are screened by DHS and the State Department through        the Student and Exchange Visitor Information System  SEVIS           The amendment would allow such        visa holders to make brief trips of 30 days or less to the        United States to meet with advisors and professors at their        academic institutions            VERMONT RELATED AMENDMENTS APPROVED EARLIER     Key Vermont related provisions        of the package that Leahy earlier successfully worked to add        to  or  in one case  subtract from  the bill include   Leahys provision establishing        special visas for foreign dairy workers   H2B visa improvements         important especially to Vermonts ski and tourism        industries   Leahys removal of the        provision  in the House passed version  that lays the        groundwork for a barrier fence wall across the Northern        Border with Canada  This is no longer in the Senate bill   Inclusion of the Leahy        Amendment  with Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska  for a 17 month        delay in implementation of the controversial Western        Hemisphere Travel Initiative requirements for a new PASS        Card system  Leahy has called the plan a train wreck on        the horizon that has been poorly planned  and with        inadequate coordination among federal agencies and with the        Government of Canada  Leahy warns that WHTI  as now        conceived by the Bush Administration  would mean major        disruptions in commerce  tourism and social interaction        across the Northern Border
