       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Public Research In The Public Interest   Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement     Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Public Research In The Public Interest Act Of 2006    September 29  2006 MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  today I am pleased to     introduce the Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006  If     enacted  this bill will save lives and improve the quality of health for     millions of families living in impoverished nations  Recently  I have     introduced or cosponsored six bills to address the increasingly     important issues that relate to global health and the need for earlier     access to generic medicines in the United States       Each year  millions of people needlessly suffer from disease in     impoverished countries worldwide because they lack access to life saving     medicines  And each year  Americas world renowned research universities     develop innovative treatments to combat these diseases  However  under     our current system  these treatments do not get to far too many of the     families in impoverished nations who so desperately need them       Today  15 percent of the worlds people consume about 91 percent of the     worlds pharmaceuticals  The high price of life saving medicines        medicines we take for granted    puts them far beyond the reach for     millions of the most vulnerable populations       While the concept of my bill is simple  the implications are profound      If passed  my bill would greatly lessen the cost burden of generic drugs     in the developing world  It would achieve this by requiring federally     funded research institutions to permit their inventions  such as drugs      vaccines  and innovative medical devises  to be provided inexpensively     by generic companies distributing medical supplies to the developing     world       Federally funded labs and research institutions have a vital role to     play in meeting this goal  For example  Yale University has an agreement     with Doctors Without Boarders to permit their generic version of its     life saving AIDS drug to be used for a pilot treatment program in South     Africa  To date  Yales humanitarian endeavor  which in no way reduced     their licensing revenues  continues to save thousands of life      It is time to ensure that public funds truly serve public purposes    in     this instance  delivering essential health care needs at minimal costs     to American taxpayers  universities  and pharmaceutical companies      Unfortunately  this Congress has been tied up in knots recently and has     been unable to pass even critical appropriations bills  The measures     before us are crucial  This comprehensive approach toward providing     better global health aid and better access to generic drugs should     become law  and I am committed to trying to make it so  I look forward     to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to enact this     important legislation      I have recently introduced or sponsored six bills to address the need     for better access to low cost generic medicines  Two of these bills     relate to global health  and four of them address the need for earlier     access to generic medicines in the United States      Federally funded laboratories and other research institutions have a     critical role to play in delivering affordable medicines to these sick     and suffering worldwide  In 2000  a Senate Joint Economic Committee     Report found that public research was instrumental in developing 15 of     the 21 drugs considered by experts to have had the highest therapeutic     impact on society       Between 1970 and 2001  there was a ten fold increase in the number of     U S  patents issued annually to U S  academic institutions  The World     Health Organizations 2006 Commission on Intellectual Property Rights      Innovation  and Public Health has also recently recognized the crucial     role of universities  The WHO recommended that universities adopt     licensing practices designed to increase access to medicines in     developing countries       The report also tells the story of one way in which the crucial role of     university innovations and other publicly funded research in promoting     global public health first came into the public eye  It is an     interesting story      In 2001  the international organization M  decins Sans Fronti  res  or MSF      requested Yale Universitys permission to use its generic life saving     AIDS drug  stavudine  for a pilot treatment project outside Cape Town          This was at a time when HIV drugs were first being introduced in the     developing world  The costs were prohibitive  Scientists at Yale     University had discovered stavudines value in the fight against AIDS      and Yale University was the key patent holder       In response to MSFs request  Yale and Bristol Myers Squibb jointly     announced that they would permit the sale of generics in South Africa     and that Bristol Myers Squibb would lower the price of its brand name     stavudine by 96 percent throughout sub Saharan Africa       The Yale Bristol Myers Squibb announcement was highly significant in the     campaign for access to affordable first line AIDS treatments  Yale and     Bristol Myers Squibbs humanitarian action did not reduce licensing     revenues with respect to Yale  Meanwhile  Yales invention to this day     continues to save thousands of lives  According to a recent report by     the WHOs AIDS Medicines and Diagnostics Service  stavudine is one of     the three first line HIV medicines that together constituted almost 90     percent of total procurement in 2005      Unfortunately  this has been an isolated success story rather the road     to greater access for the many important inventions that come out of     publicly funded research institutions      With respect to HIV AIDS treatment alone  at least two major drugs based     on university inventions have come to market since the 2001 stavudine     announcement  emtricitabine  developed in large part at Emory University     and sold by Gilead Sciences as Emtriva  and T 20 developed in large part     at Duke university and marketed as Fuzeon by Hoffmann La Roche and     Trimeris  Just this summer  Yale University announced the license of a     new candidate for an AIDS drug based on stavudine  Called     4 ethynyl stavudine  or abbreviated more simply as Ed4T   Early     testing suggests that it may be both more effective and less toxic than     its famous predecessor       But the question is  Will these lifesaving drugs ultimately be available     in places like sub Saharan Africa  where HIV infection rates range as     high as a third of the adult population      This bill  the Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006      would focus on this problem  By allowing licensing by generic companies     of inventions coming out of publicly funded research institutions  and     other associated inventions required to produce marketable medicines      it would drive down the price of new  innovative drugs in areas where     they would otherwise be effectively unavailable       Because the licensing regime this bill proposes is self enforcing  it     minimizes both administrative overhead and eliminates the need for     case by case decisions  while preserving important intellectual property     protections  Because the Act allows the introduction of generic or     reduced price drugs only into markets too poor to otherwise afford them      its terms do not threaten corporate investments or profits in wealthier     nations  All generic drugs manufactured under the bill must be clearly     differentiated from the versions sold in developed nations  where the     brand name companies make their profits      Moreover  publicly funded research institutions would receive royalties     from the sale of inventions covered by this bill in developing markets      While the initial payment of the royalties will typically go the     research institution itself  the bill leaves complete freedom to these     institutions and their licensees to decide how such royalties will     ultimately be shared  This freedom is especially important because the     inventions from universities and other research institutions often form     only one part of the collection of intellectual property necessary to     manufacture a finished  marketable drug  The appropriate division of the     royalties paid by generics for this package of rights in the developing     world will be different for different drugs and medical devices      depending on whether the universitys contribution is more or less     central to the finished product  This Act would allow all the various     parties the flexibility to divide these royalties appropriately      I should be clear  however  that the bill I introduce today is an     initial proposal  I look forward to working with research universities     in the United States on this important matter  I also intend to work     with the companies involved in creating  licensing  and bringing to     market the fruits of Americas unparalleled research institutions as we     continue to shape this solution       Indeed  the best answer may not be legislative at all  if the groups     involved can come together around a different approach  But however it     is achieved  I believe that increasing the availability of the many     medical inventions that come from publicly funded research centers is a     good solution to pressing global health concerns       Universities  in particular  are unique institutions with unique public     commitments  They are  before anything else  institutions dedicated to     the creation and dissemination of knowledge in the public interest  The     Public Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006 is designed in the     spirit of that commitment       This bill completes a package of six bills that I have recently     introduced to increase access to medicines in the United States and to     address the global public health crisis  While it is the magnitude of     this problem that demands that we  as a Nation  take action  it is the     small things  the individual stories that often speak to us most clearly     at a personal level      In my office hangs a photograph I took of three young boys on the side     of a mountain in Turkey  I found them flying a kite off the edge of a     cliff that overlooks a vast slum  They had made the toy out of scraps of     paper  patched together with tape and string  and were flying it on the     currents rushing up the face of the rock       I recalled fearing for their safety as they played so precariously close     to the edge  But these children faced much greater risks  When my     grandchildren get sick  we can always be sure they will get the     medicines they need  For these boys  there is no such guarantee      These boys  and the millions of children and others like them around the     world are the reason behind each of the six bills I have introduced      Earlier this summer  I introduced a bill which can be the catalyst for     empowering U S  generic companies to save the lives or improve the     health of millions of families in impoverished nations  Under the     Life Saving Medicines Export Act  U S  companies can make low cost     generic versions of any medicine for export to impoverished nations that     face public health crises when those impoverished nations cannot produce     those life saving medicines for themselves      This bill is based on World Trade Organization agreements permitting     nations with pharmaceutical industries to help nations in need  The     World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization have adopted     resolutions urging all WTO member nations with a generic capability to     adopt laws that implement that agreement  On December 6  2005  the     Office of the U S  Trade Representative announced that it welcomes     efforts to allow countries to override patent rights when necessary to     export life saving drugs to developing countries that face public health     crises but cannot produce drugs for themselves       This bill addresses the urgent needs of millions of low income families     in impoverished nations while protecting the interests of the patent     owners of these life saving medicines  As in the Public Research in the     Public Interest Act  introduced today  generic companies are only     permitted to use the compulsory license in the bill in developing     nations  where low income families are simply too poor to purchase the     brand name versions  and the generic versions must be clearly marked     as not for resale in developed nations  Thus  both bills pose the risk     of minimal losses for patent holders while generating new revenue for     the brand name companies from the royalties on generic sales      The four additional bills that complete this Access to Medicines     package seek to preserve incentives for U S  generic companies to enter     and compete in the market  Increased competition leads to lower prices     and saved lives       First  in the wake of the Supreme Court refusal to hear the drug patent     case called Federal Trade Commission  FTC  v  Schering Plough  I joined     fellow Judiciary Committee members    Senators Kohl  Grassley and     Schumer    in introducing legislation to explicitly prohibit brand name     drug manufacturers from using pay off agreements to keep cheaper generic     equivalents off the market  Such payments are a distortion in the market     that harms patients  I was stunned that the U S  Supreme Court refused     to hear a case so important to our senior citizens  The Federal Trade     Commission asked the Supreme Court to hear the arguments but the Court     refused at the request of the Justice Department  It seems there may be     no justice    until that bill is passed    for our seniors needing     costly patented medicines but live where the brand name company has paid     generic companies not to compete       Then  in July  I joined Senators Rockefeller and Schumer in introducing     legislation to ban authorized generics that can stifle true generic     competition  I said at the time that the giant drug companies keep     coming up with ways to avoid real competition and consumers need to be     able to count on Congress to close each new anticompetitive loophole     they come up with  If enacted  that bill will close this     anti competitive loophole in the Hatch Waxman Act and will preserve the     incentives Congress created for generic companies to enter the market to     supply American citizens and seniors with lower cost drugs      The fifth bill introduced was with Senator Kohl  That bill is intended     to stop frivolous Citizen Petitions designed to delay introduction of     generic drugs into the market place  Recently  large pharmaceutical     companies have exploited that petition process to keep their profits     high  In addition  I joined with Senators Schumer  Clinton and Stabenow     on the Access to Life Savings Medicine Act which related to developing     a fast track process for approving generic versions of biologic     medicines       I believe that these six bills  together  can save millions of lives      Recognizing the great need  there have been significant voluntary     efforts made by brand name pharmaceutical companies  foundations  and     non profits who have already donated life saving medicines  time      personnel and money to help in the fight against deadly diseases both in     America and abroad  I commend and greatly appreciate those efforts      Nonetheless  much remains to be done  My bills will both add to and     complement existing efforts  by making sure even cutting edge treatments     are available in developing countries  and by ensuring that Americas     aid dollars and the contributions of private philanthropists are used as     efficiently as they can possibly be used       The Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Report to Congress     reported that  i n every case generics prices present an opportunity     for cost savings  in some cases  the branded price per pack of a drug is     up to 11 times the cost of the approved generic version      The current global public health crisis is one of the great callings of     our time  As a nation  we cannot afford to ignore this threat  Our own     health and aspects of our national security depend on it      We have become far more aware today of how much our own health depends     on what takes place half a world away  Whether it is AIDS  SARS  West     Nile Virus  the Avian Flu  or the encroaching menace of multi drug     resistant bacteria  we are all at risk  We are only an airplane flight     away from wherever an outbreak may occur    a place where the medical     innovations developed in this country to combat these devastating     diseases may not be available keep the outbreak under control       In a post 9 11 world  our well being is intimately connected with that     of other nations  Health is an essential building block for a strong     economy  and vital to maintain a thriving democracy  Through increasing     access to essential medicines throughout the world  the United States     can help to give developing nations a chance to flourish  while     improving U S  relations with large segments of the worlds population          President Franklin Roosevelt once said  The test of our progress is not     whether we add more to the abundance of those who have much  it is     whether we provide enough for those who have little       We are fortunate  at some times and on some issues  to be able to do     both  Now is one of those times  and this is one of those issues  I hope     my colleagues will join me in supporting my efforts this year on the     global public health crisis  including todays addition  the Public     Research in the Public Interest Act of 2006
