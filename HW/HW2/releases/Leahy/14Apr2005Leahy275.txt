                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Mikulski Amendment to H R  1268    April 14  2005 I am a cosponsor of this amendment  which would     make additional visas available for aliens who wish to perform seasonal     work in the United States  For the second year in a row  the statutory     cap on such H 2B visas was met before businesses that need additional     summer employees were even eligible to apply for visas  This has hurt     businesses across the country  and this amendment will provide needed     relief  In Vermont  the main users of these visas are     hotels  inns and resorts that have a busy summer season  I have heard     from dozens of businesses in Vermont over the past year who have     struggled mightily to manage without temporary foreign labor  A wide range of industries use these visas in other     States  Indeed  I imagine that nearly all Senators have heard from a     constituent who has been harmed by the sudden shortage of H 2B visas      and fear that they will go out of business if Congress does not act to     make more visas available   The amendment would not raise the cap on the     program  but would rather allow those who had entered the U S  in     previous years through the H 2B program to return  These are  by     definition  people who came to the US legally and returned to their own     countries as the law requires  The amendment also addresses the     concerns some members have expressed about fraud   I have been working to solve this crisis for more     than a year  I joined last year with a substantial bipartisan coalition     in introducing S 2252  the Save Summer Act of 2004  Senator Kennedy was     the lead sponsor of the bill  which had 18 cosponsors  including eight     Republicans  The bill would have added 40 000 visas for the current     fiscal year  providing relief to those summer oriented businesses that     had never even had the opportunity to apply for visas  Unfortunately      that bill was opposed by a number of Republican Senators  and never     received a vote  I am pleased we will finally get a vote on H 2B relief     today  The bill on which this amendment is     based is extraordinarily bipartisan  Providing relief for businesses     that depend on H 2B workers is a common sense measure that deserves to     win a broad majority of this body  I urge all of my colleagues to     support this amendment                Audio available at
