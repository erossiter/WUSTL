       Comment of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Receipt Of Response To Letter On   Waterboarding From Attorney General Nominee Michael Mukasey                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate      Judiciary Committee    On Receipt Of      Response To Letter On Waterboarding   From Attorney      General Nominee Michael Mukasey   October 30  2007         Based on an initial review of his      response to the letter  I remain very concerned that Judge Mukasey      finds himself unable to state unequivocally that waterboarding is      illegal and below the standards and values of the United States  I      await his response to other written questions and letters from      Republican and Democratic Senators that were sent to him last week       and I will consult with Senator Specter and other Members of the      Judiciary Committee before scheduling Committee consideration of      this nomination
