       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The White House Plan To Dip Into USDA    Student Loan And Food Stam Accounts To Pay For VA Data Breach Credit Monitoring                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy      On The White House Plan To Dip Into USDA       Student Loan And Food Stamp Accounts      To Pay For VA Data Breach Credit Monitoring      News Conference        U S  Capitol      Wednesday  June 28  2006  If you trust your money to a bank        you get compounded interest  Unfortunately these days  veterans       are finding that if you trust your health care or your personal       information to the Bush Cheney Administration  you get       compounded incompetence   Last year Secretary Nicholson       repeatedly and vigorously denied a billion dollar shortfall for       veterans health care  while Senator Murray and others were       trying to blow the whistle and fix the problem  Then he       discovered she was right    In the aftermath of the disclosure       of the VA data breach I called on Secretary Nicholson to offer       free credit checks for the millions of veterans and soldiers       whose data was lost and whose lives could be turned upside down       by his departments incompetence    Weeks later  he agreed to do       that  But he wanted to take the funds from veterans health       programs  And now today  trying to recover once again from this       pattern of incompetence  the White House announces that        instead  they want to send the bill to farmers  students and       Americans struggling to get by on Food Stamps     It hadnt occurred to me at the       time that I should have qualified my message to Secretary       Nicholson and the White House by adding  By the way  dont       punish students  farmers and those needing Food Stamps for your       mistakes   We spend at least  200 million a       day in Iraq  Just days ago Congress gave President Bush the       tens of billions of additional dollars he asked for in emergency       appropriations to rebuild Iraq  The Bush Cheney Administration       has no qualms about twisting arms for funding for Iraq  But       when it comes to needs here at home felt by veterans and other       ordinary Americans  their solution is to steal from Peter to pay       Paul   They have fought the efforts by       Senator Murray and Senator Byrd and Senator Salazar and others       to provide the resources needed for credit monitoring  without       taking from other national needs  They are wrong  And it adds       up to a heckuva bad job for veterans and for ordinary Americans       everywhere
