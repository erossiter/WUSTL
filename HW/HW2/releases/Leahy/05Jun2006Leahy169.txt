       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy on S  J  Res  1  The Marriage Protection  Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member Of The Judiciary Committee     On S J  Res  1  The Marriage Protection Amendment    June 5  2006   It should come as no surprise to any observer     of partisan politics that the Republican Leader has decided that     today our Nation s most pressing priority is concern over committed     relationships between same sex couples  That we are devoting the     precious few Floor days we have left in this session to this issue      when so many of us are trying to focus on solutions to high gas     prices  the rising costs of healthcare  the ongoing situation in     Iraq  and strengthening our national security  is a testament to the     misplaced priorities of the Senate Republican leadership  News     reports have clearly revealed how this proposed constitutional     amendment is being used to satisfy the most extreme right wing     supporters of Republican politicians  I do not believe that     Americans are well served by this strategy      Election Year Strategy The Constitution is too important to be used     for such a partisan political purpose  I agreed with First Lady     Laura Bush when she recently told Fox News that this proposed     amendment should not be used as a campaign tool  obviously  Even     so    obviously    that is exactly what Karl Rove and others are     doing  That is why we only vote on such partisan measures in the     run up to an election  and apparently high campaign season has     arrived on Republican leaders  calendar  And right on the heels of     this campaign season bid to amend the Constitution  they are     readying yet another constitutional amendment for the Floor   Many people have aptly noted that this     amendment would write discrimination into our nations     Constitution  I agree  That is exactly what we are being asked to     spend our time doing this week   The Republican leadership s strenuous efforts     to move this proposed amendment to the Senate floor for debate shows     how important it is to the Republican leadership of the Senate to     cater to the extreme right wing and special interest groups     agitating for a fight over this issue  They intend to stir up an     election year fight and use it as a campaign tool and a political     strategy       Displacing Americans Real Priorities Right now the Senate should be addressing     Americans  top priorities  including ways to make America safer  the     war in Iraq  rising gas prices  health care and health insurance     costs  stem cell research  fixing FEMA  assisting our veterans whose     privacy has been compromised by the Veterans Administration  and the     reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  Instead  the President s     political strategists and his Senate allies are doing their best to     divide and distract the American people and the Senate from the work     of fixing real problems  by pressing forward with this controversial     proposed constitutional amendment   As a nation we are currently facing many     pressing issues   the continuing sectarian violence in Iraq      stunning investigations  indictments and convictions for government     corruption  a complicated drug program that now penalizes our     seniors  a burgeoning national debt  historically high gas prices      the largest theft of private information maintained by the     Government in history  and on and on  The Judiciary Committee has     been conducting hearings but has yet to get to the bottom of the     Bush Cheney Administration s warrantless wiretapping and other     programs that have been gathering information on Americans  We also     need to make reauthorizing the expiring provisions of the Voting     Rights Act a priority in the remaining months of this session   But on the Senate Floor  we are being made to     turn  again  to a divisive measure that will do nothing to correct     the weaknesses in our homeland security  will do nothing to enact a     budget that is now overdue  will do nothing to stem the rise in gas     prices and will do nothing to respond to the most pressing issues     facing hardworking Americans       What Has Changed Since 2004  As some may remember  proponents of a Federal     Marriage Amendment in 2004  the last election year  could not     assemble a majority of Senators to even move to consider the     proposed amendment  Remember that in 2004 we were warned that     immediate action was required to protect the fragile institution of     marriage  which was said to be under immediate threat  Of course     the real threats to marriage include adultery and unfaithfulness      The pressures on marriages come from economic stresses and     unhappiness   By contrast  in the past two years  no     States have been forced to recognize same sex marriages  Rather      several States voted to amend their State constitutions to define     marriage  The Defense of Marriage Act which defines marriage as a     union between a man and a woman for federal purposes and prevents     any State from being forced to recognize another States approval of     same sex marriage remains the law of the land  This bipartisan law     has been upheld three times in federal court and is under no threat     of being overturned  There never was then  nor is there now an     imminent crisis that demands the diversion of Congress s attention     from all these other urgent problems or that justifies an alteration     of our founding document to federalize marriage  Unlike the     Republican leadership and the Bush Cheney Administration  I trust     the 50 States to define marriage and the rules of marriage as they     always have  I am sure we will continue to hear a lot of     rhetoric about judicial activism as a reason why we need to     dramatically alter the United States Constitution  Even the     President in his weekly radio address invoked the notion of rogue     judges that flaunt the law as a justification for this drastic     measure  This politically convenient criticism is surprising     considering the fact that the majority of federal judges have been     appointed by Republican presidents  Any judicial decision that was     a dramatic departure from the status quo on this issue would     certainly be appealed to the United States Supreme Court where seven     out of nine justices have been appointed by Republican presidents      Does anyone really believe that Chief Justice Roberts is going to     preside over a United States Supreme Court that will override the     law in this regard  Moreover  any State can define marriage in     their Constitution  Ironically  the proposed federal marriage     amendment  now renamed the Marriage Protection Amendment  would     itself produce a wide range of litigation that judges  the     very boogeymen that proponents of the proposed amendment demonize      would be required to resolve  It will be judges who will be forced     to resolve the acknowledged ambiguities and meaning of these words     if they are added to our Constitution       Ambiguous Language The proposed language we are being required to     consider is exceedingly confusing and subject to interpretation      Its sweeping language will inevitably create uncertainty  For     example  who would be bound by the provisions of the Marriage     Protection Amendment   State actors  private citizens  or religious     organizations  What would constitute the legal incidents of     marriage  Can a legislature pass a civil unions law that mirrors     its marriage law  so long as it does not use the word marriage      Can the people of a State put protections for civil unions in their     State constitution  What State actors are forbidden from construing     their own constitutions   the judiciary only  or State executive     branch officials as well  Committee hearings on these precise     language issues did not resolve these questions   I am particularly concerned about the fate of     the Vermont civil unions that have been formed under the color of     State law  Despite an initially wrenching debate  our State law     remains on the books after five years  There has been no ensuing     crisis in the lives of Vermont families  It is not clear to me      however  whether the proposed amendment would make the Vermont law     unconstitutional  In short  while the language of the amendment     before us has changed slightly from the original version  it raises     the same concerns       Presidential Inconsistencies I started this afternoon by alluding to my     agreement with the recent statements of the First Lady that the     Constitution should not be used for political purposes  I agree     with her statement  Just as I agreed with her sense that the     Presidents bring it on language from the early days of the Iraq     occupation was not helpful   Starting this last weekend we have seen that     suddenly the President is  nonetheless  involving himself in this     effort and is now prepared to endorse a specific constitutional     amendment on this divisive topic  I have written President Bush on     more than one occasion to ask precisely what language he and his     Administration endorse  My most recent letter was last month  I     ask that a copy be included in the Record  My letters have gone     unanswered  The Administration did not send a representative to any     of the Committee hearings on this amendment  nor did the     Administration comment on the specifics of the current proposal or     respond to questions about its language  His general endorsement     during the last couple of days is in the nature of a political     campaign    more in the nature of a signal than of substance  The     President s recent statements on Saturday and at the rally today at     the Old Executive Office Building adjacent to the White House remain     general and vague  After the last campaign and his re election  the     President indicated that he had no intention of including such an     amendment among his Administration s top priorities  and he had no     intention of pressing Congress to approve it  What has changed     since that day and today  Only his standing in the public opinion     polls  The right wing elements of his base are agitating  and he     has responded to them as he always does      Undermining States Prerogatives I remember a time when leaving States in     control of issues of family law was an easy decision for Members on     both sides of the aisle  It is disappointing that Senators would     endorse this broadly drafted amendment when it so clearly violates     the traditions of Federalism and local control that many in this     body have claimed to respect and cherish   As prominent conservative and former     congressman Bob Barr put it  Marriage is a quintessential state     issue  The Defense of Marriage Act goes as far as is necessary in     codifying the federal legal status and parameters of marriage  A     constitutional amendment is both unnecessary and needlessly     intrusive and punitive   It reminds me of last year when we were called     into emergency session to try to overturn highly competent state     courts that had thoroughly reviewed the medical decisions in the     Terri Schiavo case  What has happened to conservatives who would     oppose the Federal Government s intrusion on the prerogatives of the     States  The States have traditionally set the laws on marriage      That has been a foundational principle in laws pertaining to our     families  The States determine what age you must be in order to     marry  whether you have to have your parents  permission  and so     on  The States have done that and do it well  And what we ought to     do is to continue to allow the States to do that   Most States are going to say marriage is     between a man and a woman  My own State of Vermont  because of our     Constitution  was given a question  Would we support gay marriage      My State said no  Instead  we have civil unions  which give gay     couples legal rights of inheritance and hospital visitation and     other prerogatives  In Judiciary Committee hearings  experts     disagreed about whether this proposed amendment would likely     invalidate Vermonts civil unions  In addition to my concerns that this effort     will trample on State authority and responsibility  I am deeply     concerned that this proposal is writing discrimination into the     Constitution  For the first time in our nations history  we would     be amending the Constitution to narrow individual rights and to     federalize an issue of family law  I am a conservative when it     comes to the Constitution and to conserving the Constitution   How will this measure affect American families     that currently exist in this country whose members seek the     protection of civil unions and the acknowledgment of their committed     relationships  How will it affect child support enforcement      inheritance and insurance benefits  I hope that those who claim to     care about families will turn away from wedge politics and     scapegoating and diminishing others  Instead  we should join     together to work on the many pressing issues already piling up on     Congress s agenda that affect the American family  like healthcare      like gas prices  like pensions  like paying for college educations     and like raising the minimum wage       Divisiveness and Demonization Last month  President Bush spoke eloquently     about this country and our values  He emphasized something I wish     that this White House and the Republican leadership of the Congress     would keep in mind in connection with their efforts to demonize gay     and lesbian Americans  The President said  We cannot build a     unified country by inciting people to anger  or playing on anyone s     fears  or exploiting the issue of   and here I insert marriage     for immigration  for political gain  We must always remember      he continued  that real lives will be affected by our debates and     decisions  and that every human being has dignity and value             Mean spirited rhetoric does not serve this Nation or its diverse     population  Our Nation would be better served if we refrained from     divisiveness that is wielded like a weapon in order to score     political and emotional points before an election   As an American who has been married for more     than 40 years  I am a great fan of the institution of marriage  I     also believe it is important to encourage and to sanction committed     relationships  I respect the people of my State for the careful     manner in which they resolved this matter by recognizing civil     unions  And let us be real    this state action did nothing to     diminish or to threaten the marriages in Vermont or in any other     State  For all these reasons  I continue to oppose measures such as     this proposed constitutional amendment
