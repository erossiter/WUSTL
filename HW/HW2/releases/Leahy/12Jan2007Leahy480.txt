       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy In Recognition Of The Dr  Martin Luther   King  Jr  Holiday                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    In Recognition Of The Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   Holiday    January 12  2007 On     Monday  our nation honors the life and legacy of the late Dr  Martin     Luther King  Jr    a national hero and man whose words     and deeds brought hope and healing to America       We commemorate the timeless values he taught us through his examplethe     values of courage  truth  justice  compassion  dignity  humility and     service that so radiantly defined Dr  King s character and revolutionary     spirit  Dr  Kings belief in the strength of nonviolence was not merely     aspirationalthough surely it spoke to our aspirations as a nationbut     it gave his leadership a unique power that resonates to this day     I     am grateful for this holiday because it is a reminder to listen again to     Dr  King s inspiring words and to let the children and grandchildren of     those who remember Dr  King hear his voice that filled a great void in     our nation  and answered our collective longing to become a country that     truly lived by its noblest principles   A few months ago  we broke ground on a memorial to     honor Dr  King  At first glance  it may seem a bit out of place     that Dr  King s memorial will be located on our National Mall   a place     adorned with memorials to Americas greatest presidents and war time     heroes  Dr  King was neither a president of the United States nor a     hero in a foreign war  He never even held public office   And yet he deserves his     place in the pantheon of great American leaders because lead a nation he     did  Through words he gave voice to the voiceless  Through deeds he     gave courage to the faint of heart  Through his bravery and courage  he     endured tremendous hardships  he was beaten and jailed 29 times  his     family was threatened  his home was fire bombed  and he was placed under     surveillance by the FBI yet he overcame these hurdles and ignited a     movement that would lead to historic reforms   In his famous I Have a     Dream speech  Dr  King noted that  w hen the architects of our     republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the     Declaration of Independence  they were signing a promissory note to     which every American was to fall heir  And it was thanks to the     work of great civil rights leaders like Dr  King and his wife Coretta     Scott King  who we lost a year ago and whom we honored in reauthorizing     the Voting Rights Act  that Jim Crow segregation was uprooted  and legal     barriers to the full participation of racial minorities in the political     life of the nation were removed   Yet  as I was reminded last year during our many     hearings on the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  and again by     accounts of voter suppression during the recent midterm elections  the     work of the Voting Rights Act is not yet complete and the dream of Dr      King has not yet been fully realized  And so we must not only honor Dr      Kings vision by remembering him this week  but we must also continue     our work to make his dream a reality  Dr  Kings own words remind us that this holiday is     not merely a celebration of a particular time in American history  but     also a living legacy to the value of service  Dr  King once said that     we all have to decide whether we will walk in the light of creative     altruism or the darkness of destructive selfishness  Life s most     persistent and nagging question  he said  is  what are you doing for     others   On this day  we must urge     our children and grandchildren to abide by Dr  Kings message that if     they serve our country and strive for what is just  they can remake a     nation and transform a world
