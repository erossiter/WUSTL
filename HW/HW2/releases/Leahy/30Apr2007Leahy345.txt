       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Reports Of Confidential Memo Granting   Sweeping Hiring Firing Authority To DOJ Political Officials                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt          Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Reports Of A Confidential Memo Granting Sweeping Hiring Firing     Authority     To DOJ Political Officials    April 30  2007  It is disturbing to learn that the     Attorney General was granting extraordinary and sweeping authority to     the same political operatives who were plotting with the White House to     dilute our system of checks and balances in the confirmation of U S      Attorneys    This development is highly troubling in     what it seems to reveal about White House politicization of key     appointees in the Department of Justice  The mass firing of U S      attorneys appeared to be part of a systematic scheme to inject political     influence into the hiring and firing decisions of key justice employees      This secret order would seem to be evidence of an effort to hardwire     control over law enforcement by White House political operatives   This memorandum should have been turned     over to Senate and House committees as part of requests made in ongoing     investigations  I expect the Department of Justice to immediately     provide Congress with full information about this troubling decision as     well as any other related documents they have failed to turn over to     date
