       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Legislation On Domestic Eavesdropping                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting      September 7  2006      Legislation On Domestic Eavesdropping  Nine months have passed since we       first learned that the Bush Cheney Administration has been       secretly eavesdropping on Americans without warrants for years        Yet most of us are no further along in our understanding of that       controversial program    We do not know what the       Administrations secret program  or is it programs           involves  We do not know whether the information it has       generated has been useful  or whether it has generated a mass of       useless information that squanders the scarce and valuable time       of the Nations intelligence analysts  We do not know how       seriously it has compromised the privacy of law abiding American       citizens  or what if any safeguards against abuse have been       employed  We do not know whether the Administration could       obtain warrants for the information it believes it needs under       the law as it stands    if they ever decided to take the trouble       to do so  Nor do we know what other domestic spying activities       are being conducted outside of the law and behind the backs of       Congress  the courts and the American people     We all believe that monitoring the       communications of suspected terrorists is vitally important  but       especially when the monitoring involves Americans  it needs to       be done lawfully and with adequate checks and balances to       prevent abuses of Americans rights and Americans privacy  The       need for safeguards is more than a hypothetical exercise        Concern about earlier abuses is one of the reasons we have FISA       in the first place  Now we are being asked to make sweeping and       fundamental changes in the law for reasons that we do not know       and in order to legalize secret  unlawful actions that the       Bush Cheney Administration refuses to fully divulge  We do not       know what we need to know to assess the proposals before us and       to legislate responsibly   That was true in March  when       S 2453 was first introduced and placed on the Committees markup       agenda  and it remains true today  In the interim  S 2453 has       been fundamentally rewritten at least a half a dozen times  so       that the bill that emerged after weeks of secret negotiations       with the White House is almost unrecognizable as the successor       of the bill that was introduced back in March  What began as a       well intentioned effort to enhance the accountability of the       Government to the American people is now a deeply flawed muddle       that seems calculated to do precisely the opposite of its       original objective    Many of the bills key departures       from current law appear in Section 9  which proposes to       fundamentally rewrite the FISA statute  Section 9 is a       one sided set of changes to FISA that would essentially gut the       judicial accountability the statute imposes on the Executive       branch  Of course  it originated with the Bush Cheney       Administration  Apparently  Section 9 is the  quid pro quo for the       Presidents promise to do something that he should have done       five years ago    that is  submit his domestic spying activities       to the FISA court for review  It is a lot of  quid for very little      quo   We have held five hearings on the       Presidents program  but only one    the last one  on July 26          touched on the new changes proposed in Section 9  We barely       scratched the surface of Section 9 at the July hearing  and we       are still waiting for answers to our written follow up       questions    At the end of that hearing   the Chairman offered to hold       additional hearings    as many as we need  I believe were his       words  I think we do need more hearings  especially on Section       9  Several other Senators  including three Republican Senators        have also requested more hearings on these matters  We need       answers from the Administration to our questions  We need to       know what we are legislating about before we legislate        not after   To the extent that I have been       able to figure out the complex and muddled language of Section       9  it would appear to permit vast new amounts of warrantless       surveillance of telephone calls involving American citizens  It       would allow limitless delegation of the Attorney Generals       authority  down to the lowest level government employee  It       would also immunize from prosecution anyone who breaks into a       home or office in the United States to search for foreign       intelligence information  if he is acting at the behest of the       President    Why are these changes needed        What exactly is it that cannot be done on the basis that       surveillance has always been conducted in this country  with a       warrant  How would the changes affect the rights and liberties       of Americans  What Government abuses would they enable  and how       much further would they degrade the accountability of the       Government to the American people  These changes go far beyond       anything we did either in the PATRIOT Act or in this years       reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act  Before we vote on them  we       need to know how the Administration interprets and would apply       them  and why it believes it needs them   Section 8 of the bill  which I       understand to be another Bush Cheney Administration demand  is       simpler but perhaps even more troubling  This section would       repeal FISA s exclusivity provision and affirmatively       acknowledge the Presidents purported authority to conduct       surveillance outside of FISA  transforming FISA from a check on       Executive power to a blank check for the Executive  Compliance       with FISA would become purely optional    the President could       use it or not  at his discretion    Presumably  the Bush Cheney       Administration did not ask for the outright repeal of FISA       because it knew that it would be politically unacceptable  But       Section 8 amounts to the same thing  The point of FISA is to       set requirements and create procedures for the Government to       obtain warrants  in peacetime and in wartime  sometimes before       and sometimes after the fact  for foreign intelligence       surveillance activities in the United States  If you say  as       Section 8 does  that the President can engage in those       activities without obtaining a warrant at all  then you render       FISA meaningless and mock the whole idea of the rule of law         If we want to have a debate about       repealing FISA  lets have that debate  I know where I stand        Always ready to fine tune the law  but firmly opposed to       repealing a law that has been understood as an essential defense       of Americans liberties and an essential check on Government       abuse for decades  If we want to resolve the validity of the       Presidents claim that FISA is unconstitutional  because that       is what his inflated conception of inherent powers amounts to        lets go ahead with the judicial review proceedings that the       President should have allowed to proceed five years ago and get       the Supreme Court to address the issue  But lets not repeal       FISA under the guise of a supposedly technical amendment without       a candid and open discussion   Sections 4 through 6 of the bill       raise yet more serious concerns  They would abandon the       traditional  case by case review contemplated by FISA and       introduce the notion of program warrants  A single FISA court       judge could approve whole programs of electronic surveillance        if the government bothered to seek the Courts approval  which       is not mandatory under this version of the bill     I know of no judicial authority       for program warrants and have grave doubts about the       constitutionality of these provisions  In effect  the bill       would punt fundamental policy questions about the appropriate       scope and limits of electronic surveillance to an unelected and       secret court  Sections 4 through 6 say  in effect  that       anything thats okay with the FISA court is okay with us         That impression is reinforced by a       further  troubling proposed change in the standard that the FISA       court judge is to apply in issuing warrants  The traditional       standard that is written into the FISA statute is the same as       the constitutional standard under the Fourth Amendment        probable cause  And that is the standard the Administration       purports to apply now  Why  then  would the bill change the       standard  Under the bill  the court need only find that a       program is reasonably designed to ensure that the       communications to be intercepted involve someone who is       reasonably believed to have communication with or be associated       with a suspected terrorist  That standard could allow for       expansive surveillance of innocent Americans who have been in       inadvertent contact with legitimate targets of surveillance         Combined  these provisions would       replace the traditional model for issuance of warrants  a judge       making a fact based determination as to probable cause in an       individual case    with a fundamentally different model  under       which judges would make what are essentially policy decisions       about the reasonableness of entire government programs  This       would  perhaps  make a fitting ending for the 109th       Congress  This Republican Congress has consistently been supine       in all matters of Government accountability  With these       provisions  it could formally abdicate its democratic       responsibilities to a single  unelected judge  But that       abdication would be wrong  Congress should be setting the rules       here  not a single district judge on the secret FISA court         There is another problem with the       program warrant provisions in the current bill  The bill would       allow the FISA court to issue program warrants for purely       domestic communications  But the Administration has stated that       such communications are not part of its program  And the       Attorney General has said that FISA works fine for       domestic to domestic wiretaps  If it works fine  there is no       reason to change it  unless the Administration has some hidden       agenda that it is keeping from Congress and the American people   As for the purported upside of the       bill for Government accountability  I fear it is illusory  The       President has promised Chairman Specter that  if we pass the       bill without changes  he will seek the Courts approval for the       one secret spying program he has publicly acknowledged  I       suppose that any concession to accountability from this       Administration is something  so I congratulate Senator Specter        But handshakes or side agreements between the President and a       single Member of Congress are no substitute for the rule of       law    The accountability of the       Government to the American people is far too important to trust       to a handshake  The Framers did not give us a Constitution       built on handshakes  they gave us a Constitution built on checks       and balances  I for one am not prepared to surrender that       legacy to the Just Trust Us Bush Cheney Administration  Just       trusting this Administration proved its failure as a policy       long  long ago    The original version of the       Chairmans bill did the right thing in this regard  by       requiring the President to submit his program to the FISA       Court  The Chairman has said that he would have preferred to       retain that mandate  but the President would not agree to it       because he was unwilling to bind future Presidents and make an       institutional change in the powers the President has  That       objection presupposes the Presidents preferred view of his       existing powers  which I  along with the vast majority of       constitutional scholars  believe to be grossly inflated  But       anyway  if that is really the stumbling block  it is easily       addressed  We could restore the mandate as Chairman Specter       originally drafted it  but have it expire in January 2009  when       this President leaves office  In other words  we could require       this President to do what he has already said he would do        without addressing the duties of future Presidents in any way        There would be no need for messy and unenforceable       side agreements   Instead  notwithstanding the       Chairmans well intentioned goal of enhancing judicial review        the only provisions in the bill that directly address judicial       review actually restrict it  The bill would consolidate all       cases relating to the Administrations surveillance programs       before the FISA Court of Review  Consolidation may make sense        but we do not need the bill to do that  In fact  at the       Administrations request  the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict       Litigation has already consolidated 17 lawsuits throughout the       United States filed against telephone companies accused of       helping the Bush Cheney Administration monitor Americans       communications without warrants  The bills provision for       channeling all litigation to the FISA Court of Review amounts to       yet one more constitutionally questionable device to increase       secrecy and limit Government accountability   There is much more to say  but let       me end with a small but troubling point  I was surprised to       read the finding in Section 2 of the bill  relating to Zacarias       Moussaoui  It says that the FBI could not meet the       requirements to obtain a warrant to search his laptop computer        Based on the information known to this Committee  that finding       is false    When I was Chairman of this       Committee  Senator Specter and Senator Grassley and I released a       37 page report entitled FISA Implementation Failures in which       we concluded that the Bureau could have gotten a warrant       for Moussaouis computer  It failed to do so because key FBI       officials misunderstood the probable cause standard  and because       of a deep rooted culture that stifled aggressive and creative       investigative initiatives from agents in the field   In other words  we found  FISA was       not the problem  Rather  the problem was the flawed       implementation system for FISA that had developed at DOJ and the       FBI over the years    I am reciting this history because       it is instructive  Thorough oversight by this Committee during       the 107th Congress uncovered problems in the administration of       FISA  but reaffirmed the basic workability of the FISA process        I suspect that thorough oversight by this Committee in the 109th       Congress might well lead us to the same conclusion    that FISA       is not fatally flawed  as some defenders of the Presidents       program now claim  And I am confident that a proper       investigation by this Committee would lead to a bipartisan       conclusion that scrapping FISA is not the answer  and nor is the       comprehensive gutting of FISA that S 2453 would effect
