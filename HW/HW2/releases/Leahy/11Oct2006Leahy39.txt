       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Study Of Iraqi Deaths                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comment Of Sen  Patrick     Leahy    On The Study Of Iraqi      Deaths     By The Johns Hopkins Bloomberg     School Of Public Health     As Published In The Medical Journal  The Lancet    Wednesday  October 11  2006  These numbers are shocking and illuminate     a tragic reality in Iraq that has been consistently and callously     ignored or downplayed by the Bush Administration to conceal facts about     the war from the American people and from the world    While some of these deaths are     undoubtedly insurgents who have engaged in violence against our troops      the overwhelming majority are Iraqi civilians who have never been our     enemy   Without a clear picture of the situation     on the ground  policymakers are flying blind in making decisions about     Iraq  and so is the public  The lack of oversight of the war by a     compliant and complicit Republican Congress has helped the White House     hide the truth from the American people  In the meantime studies like     this have tried to fill the information vacuum  Despite the Presidents     efforts today to discount these findings  these researchers have earned     credibility over the years for their demographic studies  But whether     this estimate is high  low or the same as the actual numbers of deaths     of Iraqi civilians  the fact is that chaos  misery and insecurity in     Iraq are compounding the effects of the poor planning and bad decisions     that the Bush Administration continues to make in Iraq  Stay the     course long ago became untenable as a strategy for success there       At what point will the White House and     Republican leaders in Congress recognize that their incompetent  myopic     policy in Iraq has unleashed a human catastrophe with more misery each     passing day  The Administration is trying to discredit and deflect     attention from this report  It would be far better if they would     recognize the need to change course in Iraq and begin bringing our     troops home from this deadly quagmire                    Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt   has long led in Congress on issues concerning civilian victims     of war  Leahy is the ranking member of the Senate Appropriations     Committees Subcommittee on State  Foreign Operations And Related     Programs
