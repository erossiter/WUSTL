Chairmen Leahy  Conyers    Issue Subpoenas   For White House Officials  Documents      Senate  House Judiciary Panels Compel Former White House Officials   To Provide Testimony  Information      In Connection With Investigations Of U S  Attorney   Firings And Politicization Within Dept  Of Justice  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  June 13   Senate    Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and House Judiciary    Committee Chairman John Conyers  D Mich   today issued subpoenas to two    former White House officials compelling them to provide testimony and    related information as part of ongoing congressional investigations into    the mass firings of well performing federal prosecutors and the    politicization of hiring and firing within the Department of Justice    The Senate Judiciary Committee issued    three subpoenas  two seeking the documents and testimony of Sara M     Taylor  former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of    Political Affairs  and another seeking White House documents relevant to    the panels ongoing investigation    The House Judiciary Committee issued two    subpoenas  one seeking the documents and testimony of Harriet Miers     former White House Counsel  and another seeking White House documents    relevant to the panels ongoing investigation    By refusing to cooperate with    congressional committees  the White House continues its pattern of    confrontation over cooperation  and those who suffer most in this case    are the public and the hard working people at the Department of    Justice  said Chairman Leahy   The White House cannot have it both    ways    it cannot stonewall congressional investigations by refusing to    provide documents and witnesses  while claiming nothing improper    occurred  The involvement of the White Houses political operation in    this project  including former Political Director Sara Taylor and her    boss Karl Rove  has been confirmed by information gathered by    congressional committees  Some at the White House may hope to thwart our    constitutional oversight efforts by locking the doors and closing the    curtains  but we will keep asking until we get to the truth     Let me be clear     this subpoena is not a request  it is a demand on behalf of the American    people for the White House to make available the documents    andindividualsweare requesting tohelp us answer the questions that    remain said Chairman Conyers  The breadcrumbs in this investigation    have always led to 1600 Pennsylvania  This investigation will not end    until the White House complies with the demands of this subpoena in a    timely and reasonable manner so that we may get to the bottom of this   Supplemental material    Text of the cover letters sent to               as well as relevant attachments     on key     evidence of White House involvement in project to fire and replace     prosecutors         refusing to cooperate with Committees

Neil Eggleston   Debevoise  Plimtpon LLP   555 13th Street  N W    Washington  D C  20004    Dear Ms  Taylor    I received no response from you to my    April 11 letter seeking your voluntary cooperation with the Senate    Judiciary Committees ongoing investigation of the firings and    replacements of a number of United States Attorneys  Similar letters to    the White House Counsel from the Committee have also failed to elicit    cooperation   It is now clear from the evidence gathered    by the investigating Committees of the Senate and House that  at the    time you were White House Director of Political Affairs  you and other    White House officials played a significant role in originating     developing  coordinating and implementing the plan and the Justice    Departments response to congressional inquiries about it     In particular  according to documents and    testimony we have heard so far  you were involved in the discussions and    planning that led to the removal of Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate    confirmation process to install Tim Griffin  another former aide to Mr     Karl Rove  as U S  Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas  You    were also were part of a group that discussed using the Attorney    Generals expanded authority under the Patriot Act reauthorization to    avoid the opposition of the Arkansas Senators by appointing Mr  Griffin    as interim indefinitely  In addition  documents and testimony show that    you played a role in approving the plan for firing multiple U S     Attorneys on December 7  2006  and were involved in subsequent    discussions regarding congressional testimony of Department officials    and the Administrations response to the growing scandal surrounding the    firings   Yet  to date the White House has not    produced a single document or allowed you or any other White House    official involved to be interviewed  apart from an unacceptable take it    or leave offer to do so off the record without a transcript or    opportunity to follow up  As a result  I am issuing the enclosed    subpoenas compelling your production of documents in your possession     custody  or control related to the Committees investigation by June 28     2007 and your appearance to testify under oath before the Committee on    July 11  2007   I look forward to your compliance with the    June 28 return date for the Judiciary Committees subpoena for documents    and to your appearance before the Committee on July 11 so we can take a    step towards learning the truth about these firings and    the erosion of independence at the Justice Department    Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY   Chairman               Taylor    Testimony Subpoena       UNITED STATES OF AMERICA      Congress of

House Documents   June 13  2007  Fred Fielding  Esq    Counsel to the President   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  Fielding   I have sent you a half dozen letters in    the past three months seeking voluntary cooperation from the White House    with the Judiciary Committees investigation into the mass firings and    replacements of U S  Attorneys and politicization at the Department of    Justice  It is now clear from the evidence gathered by the    investigating Committees of the Senate and House that White House    officials played a significant role in originating  developing     coordinating and implementing the plan and the Justice Departments    response to Congressional inquiries about it  Yet  to date the White    House has not produced a single document or allowed even one White House    official involved in these matters to be interviews    In the two and half months since    Democratic and Republican members of the Committee rejected your take    it or leave it offer of off the record  backroom interviews as    unacceptable  you have not made any effort to work with us on a    voluntary business  In response to our efforts to narrow our dispute by    gaining access to documents you agreed to produce as part of your offer    for off the record interviews or to information that forms the basis of    the Presidents conclusion that no wrongdoing has occurred  you have    merely restated your initial  unacceptable offer   The White House cannot have it both ways       it cannot withhold documents and witnesses and thereby stonewall the    investigation and  at the same time  claim that the facts about the    White Houses improper influence over federal law enforcement have not    been revealed in detail  The White Houses continued stonewalling leads    to the obvious conclusion that the White House is hiding the truth    because there is something to hide  Because the White House has    continued its refusal to provide the requested information to the Senate    Judiciary Committee on a voluntary basis  I am issuing subpoenas      Enclosed please find a subpoena for all    documents in the possession  custody or control of the White House    related to the Committees investigation into the preservation of    prosecutorial independence and the Department of Justices    politicization of the hiring and firing of United States Attorneys  The    documents compelled by the subpoena include documents related to the    Administrations evaluation of and decision to dismiss former U S     Attorneys David Iglesias  H E  Bud Cummins  John McKay  Carol Lam     Daniel Bogden  Paul Charlton  Kevin Ryan  Margaret Chiara  Todd Graves     or any other U S  Attorney dismissed or considered for dismissal since    President Bushs re election  the implementation of the dismissal and    replacement of the dismissed U S  Attorneys  and the selection     discussion and evaluation ofpossible replacements  Among these    documents are documents related to the involvement of Karl Rove  Harriet    E  Miers  William Kelley  J  Scott Jennings  Sara M  Taylor  or any    other current or former White House employees or officials in the    firings and replacements as well as documents related to the testimony    of Justice Department officials to Congress regarding this matter      The subpoenaed documents include those    related to communications between the White House and the Department or    any third parties  These are documents that you previously agreed to    produce in conjunction with the unacceptable off the record interviews    in your March 20  2007  letter to me  Chairman Conyers  Ranking Member    Specter  Ranking Member Smith  and Congresswoman Sanchez of March 20     2007  The subpoena also includes documents related to the reviews by    White House staff that led the President to publicly conclude as of    March 20  2007  that there was no wrongdoing in the mass firings and    replacements of U S  Attorneys  including any information that has led    the President to discount evidence gathered by the investigating    Committees    I am disappointed that I have to turn to    this subpoena in order to obtain information needed by the Committee to    learn the truth about these firings and the erosion of    independence at the Justice Department  However  the evidence    that White House officials were deeply involved leaves me know choice in    light of your lack of voluntary cooperation  I look forward to your    compliance with the Judiciary Committees subpoena by the June 28 return    date     Sincerely      PATRICK    LEAHY    Chairman             White    House Document Subpoena        UNITED STATES OF AMERICA      Congress

political advisors Karl Rove and then White House Counsel Alberto     Gonzales were involved from the beginning in plans to remove U S      Attorneys  According to documents obtained from     the Department of Justice and Mr  Sampsons testimony  Mr  Sampson     discussed the plan with then White House Counsel Gonzales not long     after President Bushs re election in late 2004  A January 9  2005     e mail released by the Department shows that Karl Rove initiated     inquires as to how we planned to proceed regarding U S  Attorneys      whether we were going to allow all to stay  request resignations     from all and accept only some of them  or selectively replace them      etc  In his response to queries from David Leitch  a White House     official  Mr  Sampson expressly deferred to the political judgment     of Mr  Rove as to whether to proceed with plans for the replacement     of U S  Attorneys  writing  I f Karl thinks there would be     political will to do it  then so do I    Mr  Sampson  who has testified that he     aggregated the list of U S  Attorneys to be fired  was in frequent     contact with White House officials about multiple versions of     proposed lists of possible U S  Attorneys for dismissal and     potential replacements over the course of nearly two years   sending draft lists for review in     March 2005  January 2006  April 2006  and several drafts in     September 2006 through the firings on December 7  2006    According to documents and testimony      Sara Taylor  the head of the White House political operation and     deputy of Karl Rove  and Scott Jennings  another aide to Mr  Rove      were involved in the discussions and planning that led to the     removal of Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate confirmation process     to install Tim Griffin  another former aide to Mr  Rove  as U S      Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas  They were part of a     group that discussed using the Attorney Generals expanded authority     under the Patriot Act Reauthorization to avoid the opposition of the     Arkansas Senators by appointing Mr  Griffin as interim     indefinitely  In one e mail  Mr  Sampson described Mr  Griffins     appointment as important to Harriet  Karl  etc   After the firing  writing from her     RNC email account  Ms  Taylor writes that Bud is lazy  which is     why we got rid of him in the first place    Mr  Sampson testified that Ms  Taylor     was upset when the Attorney General finally rejected this use of     the interim authority    a month after telling Senator Pryor he was     committed to finding a Senate confirmed U S  Attorney     The evidence gathered so far also     shows significant White House     involvement    including by Mr  Rove    in the decision to dismiss     David Iglesias as U S  Attorney for the District of New Mexico      We have learned from the testimony of the Attorney General and Mr      Sampson that Mr  Rove directly complained to the Attorney General     about concerns that prosecutors were not aggressively pursuing voter     fraud cases in districts in Pennsylvania  Wisconsin  and New     Mexico  One of these districts was that of Mr  Iglesias  who was     added after that complaint to the list of U S  Attorneys to be     replaced  We have also learned that Mr  Roves aide  Mr  Jennings      set up a meeting between White House Liaison Monica Goodling and New     Mexico Republican officials in June 2006 to talk about the U S      Attorney situation in New Mexico  describing it as sensitive     Those officials also met with     another aide to the Attorney General  Matthew Friedrich  told him     that they were seeking Iglesias ouster and that they had spoken to     Karl Rove about the subject  according to Friedrichs testimony to     congressional investigators    Media reports and     the White House Press Office have confirmed that Mr  Rove relayed     complaints about Mr  Iglesias to the White House Counsels office     and to the Justice Department    Press accounts and congressional     testimony have also revealed that after the midterm election  Mr      Rove discussed the performance of Mr  Iglesias with Senator     Domenici  who himself had called Mr  Igelisias before the election     to ask whether he was bringing indictments against a Democratic     official in the lead up to the election   According to Allen Weh  Chairman of     New Mexico s Republican party chairman  when he asked Mr  Rove     during a holiday party in 2006 is anything ever going to happen to     that guy     referring to Mr  Iglesias    Mr  Rove responded  Hes     gone    The concern by White House officials     with purported voter fraud extends beyond New Mexico  We have     learned that Mr  Rove sent Mr  Sampson a packet of information     related to Wisconsin  According to his testimony  Mr  Sampson gave     this packet to another Department official  Matthew Friedrich  and     also asked him to look into the voter concerns in districts relayed     by Mr  Rove to the Attorney General  The packet sent by Mr  Rove     contains a 30 page report concerning voting in Wisconsin in 2004 and     also handwritten notes suggesting a concern with prosecution in     numerous districts  Some of     these Wisconsin materials appear to have been viewed and printed by     Mr  Rove in February 2005  just a month before the US Attorney in     the Eastern District of Wisconsin was place on the termination list       John McKay  former U S  Attorney for     the Western District of Washington  testified that when he met with     Ms  Miers and her deputy William Kelley in August 2006 to interview     for a federal judgeship  he was asked to explain criticism that I     mishandled the 2004 governor s election  in which Republicans were     upset with him for not intervening in that closely contested     election    Since the firings     of these U S  Attorneys for political reasons became public  there     has been an effort to minimize  and in some instances  cover up  the     role of White House officials  According to     documents and the testimony of Mr  Sampson  the Attorney General was     upset after the February 6  2007      testimony of Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty because Mr      McNultys testimony put the White House involvement in the firings     into the public domain  Former     Justice Department White House Liaison Monica Goodling recently told     the House Judiciary Committee that she was told not to attend a     briefing by Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty on the firings to     the Senate Judiciary Committee in February  2007  because of the     concern that her presence might prompt Senators to ask questions     about White House involvement    The Administrations February 23      2007  response to a letter from Senators Reid  Schumer  Durbin and     Murray regarding the firings stated  I am not aware of Karl Rove     playing any role in the AGs decision to appoint Griffin  Earlier     e mails indicate that the appointment of Mr  Griffin  another former     deputy to Mr  Rove  was important to Mr  Rove  The White House   Associate White House Counsel Chris     Oprison  signed off on this letter   Before Griffin was installed  Mr      Oprison  who signed off on the letter  had written that the Griffin     issue was front center on  his  radar screen and that he had had     several conversations with  Rove aide  Scott Jennings about the     controversy  Many parts of this letter have since been     retracted by the Department     According to the testimony of     Department officials  Mr  Rove and other White House officials     attended a meeting at the White House on March 5  2007    the day     before Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General William Moschella     testified before the House Judiciary Committee    to go over the     admin position on all aspects of the US attorney issue Rove     is reported to have spoken at this meeting and directed the     Department to provide reasons to explain the firings in the next     days testimony
