Provision In     Mil  Comm  Bill Is Un American and Unconstitutional    Leahy Offers     Bipartisan Amendment    To Protect Against Erroneous Detentions   Now     is not the time to abandon American values  to shiver and quake  to rely     on secrecy and torture     Those are ways of repression and     oppression  not the American way   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Specter Leahy Dodd Amendment     To Protect Against Erroneous Detentions    Senate Floor     September 27  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr      President  I join Senator Specter in offering this amendment to strike     section 7 of the military commissions bill  As currently drafted  this     section would wrongfully  and in my view  unconstitutionally eliminate     the writ of habeas corpus for anyone detained by this Administration on     suspicion of being what they call an enemy combatant  which is a     dangerous concept that is being expanded by a vague and ever expanding     definition   Important as the rules for     military commissions are  they will apply to only a few cases  The     Administration has charged a total of 10 people in the nearly five years     since the President declared his intention to use military commissions      and it recently announced plans to charge 14 additional men  But for     the vast majority of the almost 500 prisoners at Guantanamo  and the     thousands it has detained over the last five years  the Administrations     position remains as stated by Secretary Donald Rumsfeld three years     ago  It has no interest in trying them     Perhaps the single most     consequential provision of the so called military commissions bill can     now be found buried nearly 100 pages in to curtail judicial review and     any meaningful accountability  This provision would perpetuate the     indefinite detention of hundreds of individuals against whom the     Government has brought no charges and presented no evidence  without any     recourse to justice whatsoever  That is un American  it is     unconstitutional  and it is contrary to American interests     Going forward  the bill     departs even more radically from our most fundamental values  And     provisions that were profoundly troubling a week ago when the Armed     Services Committee marked up the bill have gotten much worse in the     course of closed door revisions over the past five days  including the     last round of revisions  which were sent around late yesterday  and that     the majority now demands we immediately pass  For example  the bill has     been amended to eliminate habeas corpus review even for persons inside     the United States  and even for persons who have not been determined to     be enemy combatants      As the bill now stands  it     would permit the President to detain indefinitely  even for life  any     alien  whether in the United States or abroad  whether a foreign     resident or a lawful permanent resident  without any meaningful     opportunity for the alien to challenge his detention  The     Administration would not even need to assert  much less prove  that the     alien was an enemy combatant  it would suffice that the alien was     awaiting a determination on that issue  In other words  the bill     would send a message to the millions of legal immigrants living in     America  participating in American families  working for American     businesses  and paying American taxes  Its message would be that our     Government may at any minute pick them up and detain them indefinitely     without charge  and without any access to the courts or even to military     tribunals  unless and until the Government determines that they are  not enemy combatants    a     term that the bill now defines in a tortured and unprecedentedly broad     manner   Detained indefinitely      and unaccountably  until proven innocent  Like Canadian citizen Maher     Arar  shipped off to a torture cell in Syria by the Bush Cheney     Administration  despite what the Canadian Government recently concluded     to be no evidence that Mr  Arar ever committed a crime or posed a threat     to U S  or Canadian security  The Canadian Government has now     documented that the wrong thing was done to the wrong man  But the     Bush Cheney Administration has  as usual  evaded all accountability by     hiding behind a purported state secrets privilege   The Administrations     defenders would like to believe that Mr  Arars case is an isolated     blunder  but it is not  Numerous press accounts have quoted     Administration officials who believe that a significant percentage of     those detained at Guantanamo have no connection to terrorism  In other     words  the Bush Cheney Administration has been holding for several     years  and intends to hold indefinitely without trial or any recourse to     justice  a substantial number of innocent people who were turned in by     anonymous bounty hunters or picked up by mistake in the fog of war     The most important purpose of     habeas corpus is to correct errors like that  to protect the innocent      It is precisely to prevent such abuses that the Constitution prohibits     the suspension of the writ of habeas corpus unless when in Cases of     Rebellion or Invasion the public Safety may require it  I have no     doubt that this bill  which would permanently eliminate the writ of     habeas for all aliens within and outside the United States whenever the     Government says they might be enemy combatants  violates that     prohibition  and that the present Supreme Court  including President     Bushs own appointees  would hold it unconstitutional      When former Secretary of     State Colin Powell wrote of his concerns with the Administrations bill      he wrote about doubts concerning our moral authority in the war against     terrorism  This General and former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff     was right  Now we have heard from a number of current and former     diplomats  military lawyers  federal judges  law professor and law     school deans  and even the first President Bushs Solicitor General  Ken     Starr  that they have grave concerns with the habeas corpus stripping     provisions of this bill     Monday we rushed to hold a     hearing before the Judiciary Committee on this important issue  The     surrogate for the Administration and former White House associate     counsel Brad Berenson defended the habeas corpus stripping provisions by     arguing that the United States has been and is still suffering from an     invasion that requires the suspension of habeas corpus  That is     outrageous  That is running scared  That is wrong  To quote Ken     Starr  The United States is neither in a state of rebellion nor     invasion  Consequently  it would  be  problematic for Congress to     modify the constitutionally protected writ of habeas corpus under     current events  Of course  this latest version of the bill would not     merely modify habeas  it would eliminate it for all aliens     I agree with Mr  Starr that     we should not suspend  and we should certainly not eliminate    the     great writ  I also agree with more than 300 law professors  who     described an earlier  less extreme version of the habeas provisions of     this bill as unwise and contrary to the most fundamental precepts of     American constitutional traditions  And I agree with more than 30     former U S  Ambassadors and other senior diplomats  who say that     eliminating habeas corpus for aliens detained by the United States will     harm our interests abroad  and put our own military  diplomatic  and     other personnel stationed abroad at risk  We cannot spread a message of     freedom abroad if our message to those who come to America is that they     may be detained indefinitely without any recourse to justice       In the wake of the attack of     9 11  and in the fact of the continuing terrorist threat  now is not the     time for the United States to abandon its principles  Admiral Hutson     was right to point out that when we do there would be little to     distinguish America from a banana republic or the repressive regimes     against which we are trying to rally the world and the human spirit      Now is not the time to abandon American values  to shiver and quake  to     rely on secrecy and torture  Those are ways of repression and     oppression  not the American way     The habeas provisions of this     bill are wrong headed and flagrantly unconstitutional  Tinkering with     them would not make them less wrong headed  but might make them less     flagrantly unconstitutional  and I see no reason to save the     Administration from itself and from the inevitable defeat when the     Supreme Court strikes them down  Why should those of us who take our     oath to uphold the Constitution seriously  and who understand the     fundamental importance of habeas to freedom  compromise with the     drafters of this irresponsible bill     That is why I am offering     just one amendment  together with Senator Specter  to remove the habeas     provisions from the bill in their entirety  That is right thing to do      We would still be left with the disgraceful but less extreme     habeas stripping provisions that we enacted earlier this year in the     Detainee Treatment Act  but we would at least not make those bad     provisions far worse  By not totally eliminating habeas for all aliens      we can reduce the damage to Americas credibility as a champion of     freedom  and show the American people and the courts that Congress is     not entirely cavalier when it comes to its constitutional obligations     This amendment would reduce     the grave harm that will be done if the bill before us passes  It was     not too late last night for the Republican majority to make yet more     revisions to this unconstitutional bill  It is not too late today for     us to make the bill a little less bad  and a little less offensive to     the values of freedom for which America stands  So I urge members on     both sides of the aisle to vote for this amendment
