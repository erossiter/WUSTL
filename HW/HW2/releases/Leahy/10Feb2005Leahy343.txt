       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Hearing On Bankruptcy Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Opening         Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee        Hearing On Bankruptcy Reform        February 10  2005  I am pleased that the         Committee is holding this hearing on bankruptcy reform  the first in four         years   Our nation wears a        different face today than it did that last time we held a hearing on        bankruptcy reform four years ago  We endured the terrorist attacks of        September 11  2001  which only deepened the financial woes of an already        struggling economy   We have been witness to a        parade of financial misdeeds by major U S  corporations  The names Enron         WorldCom  among others  have left a bitter taste in the mouths of average        Americans  damaging investor confidence and shaking our capital markets         Financially troubled companies have shortchanged their pension promises by        nearly  100 billion  putting workers  responsible companies and taxpayers        at risk  Since we last held a        hearing on bankruptcy reform  782 000 private sector jobs have been lost         Unfortunately  far too many Americans who are working are barely making        ends meet  even when holding down two or three different jobs at the same        time   And we are immersed in        wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  with no exit in sight   We must discuss        bankruptcy reform in the context of these real life developments since        2001  In order for bankruptcy reform legislation to be appropriate and        fair  its key provisions must be carefully examined and updated where        necessary         This week Majority Leader Frist said the following about bankruptcy reform        legislation  It has been several Congresses since people have really        looked at the bill very carefully So we felt it was important to have        hearings as well as to have the opportunity to mark it up  modernize it         before taking it to the floor  I agree with Majority        Leader Frist  We should modernize this legislation to take into account the        changes that have occurred in our economy since 2001   For example  we should        strengthen the financial safety nets for middle class American families        confronting illness or injury  Medical problems contribute to about half        of all bankruptcies  even though most of those who file had health        insurance when they first became sick  Many lose their jobs  and their        insurance  because their conditions worsen  while others face thousands of        dollars in co payments and deductibles and for services not covered by        their insurance  Today we will hear from        Professor Elizabeth Warren of Harvard Law School on this matter  I am        pleased that Professor Warren could join us to discuss her recent research        and analysis of illness and injury as they contribute to bankruptcy  We should also provide        for more disclosure of information so that consumers may better manage        their debts and avoid bankruptcy altogether  U S  consumer debt has        reached staggering levels after more than doubling over the past 10 years         According to the most recent figures from the Federal Reserve Board         consumer debt hit  1 98 trillion in October 2003  up from  1 5 trillion        three years ago  The total credit card debt alone stands at  735 billion         with the household card debt of those who carry balances estimated to        average  12 000  I know that Senator        Grassley  Senator Durbin  Senator Schumer and others share a commitment to        include credit industry reforms in a fair and balanced bankruptcy bill         The millions of credit card solicitations made to American consumers over        the past years have contributed to the rise in consumer debt and        bankruptcies  It is relatively easy to obtain credit  but not nearly        enough is done to ensure that credit is properly managed  Additional        disclosure is needed to ensure that consumers completely understand the        implications of their credit card use   We must also be careful that our efforts to        ensure accountability in the bankruptcy process do not inadvertently create        problems for privacy and security  We are in an age where personal        information can be easily digitized and shared  and when it falls into the        wrong hands  easily abused  Identity theft is one danger  as is tracking        and harassing a battered spouse  We should consider ways to minimize these        possibilities while we seek accountability  The economic hardships        faced by service members families are other developing matters that        warrant our attention  Calls to serve their country in Iraq  Afghanistan        or elsewhere can cause loss of family income  the closing of a family        business or additional expenses  Unfortunately  it is not uncommon for        service members and their families to be forced into filing for bankruptcy        relief  Senators Durbin  Graham and others have taken an interest in this        issue  and I look forward to working with them on how we can remedy the        situation faced by the brave men and women who serve our nation and their        families  While many things have        changed since our last bankruptcy hearing four years ago  there remains one        thing that has not changed  The campaign of violence  vandalism and        intimidation continues to curtail the availability of family services and        endanger providers and patients  and the perpetrators of such violence        continue to escape judgment through bankruptcy abuse  Since the last time this        Committee closely examined bankruptcy reform legislation  there have been        reported a total 1 245 acts or threats of violence against clinics         providers and patients  including one bombing  eight arson cases  26 death        threats  577 anthrax threats  10 assault and batteries  17 burglaries and        26 stalking cases  For example  in 2002 six        defendants in the Nuremberg Files web site case have filed for        bankruptcy  Five filed for bankruptcy in the days or even hours        immediately before scheduled depositions in which they would have had to        reveal information regarding their assets  The other defendant filed just        before garnishment could be executed   Senators Schumer and        Hatch worked diligently during the 107th Congress to include        carefully crafted bipartisan language in the bankruptcy legislation to        ensure that perpetrators of clinic violence can not declare bankruptcy in        order to avoid paying fines and debts associated with their illegal acts         We then reached a compromise with Congressman Henry Hyde and House        Judiciary Chairman James Sensenbrenner  and we included the provision in        the final conference report   The 501 page bankruptcy        reform bill introduced a few days ago has been stripped of the consensus        clinic violence language and fails to address the discharge of penalties        for violence against family planning clinics  As a result  perpetrators of        clinic violence can continue to seek shelter in the nation s        bankruptcy courts  That is simply wrong  Today  Maria Vullo  a        top rate attorney  will testify about the need to amend the Bankruptcy Code        to stop wasteful litigation and end abusive bankruptcy filings used to        avoid the legal consequences of violence  vandalism and harassment to deny        access to legal health services  Ms  Vullo  welcome  As we move forward with        reforms that are appropriate to eliminate abuses in the system  we need to        remember the people who use the system  both the debtor and the creditor         We need to balance the interests of creditors with those of middle class        Americans who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming financial        burdens  As recent Congresses proved  there are many competing interests        in the bankruptcy reform debate that make it difficult to enact a balanced        and bipartisan bill into law  I look forward to working        with Chairman Specter on a schedule that would allow our Committee likewise        to do its work and serve the Senate by fully and fairly considering        legislation on bankruptcy related issues  These are important subjects        that can have a real impact on the lives of many people who have already        suffered from illnesses or divorce or job loss  We ought to utilize the        expertise of the Members of our Committee to ensure that what we report to        the Senate is fair and balanced and that it will not exact an unintended        toll on our neighbors  We need to work in a        bipartisan fashion from the beginning to the end of the legislative process        to enact reforms that ensure our bankruptcy laws better serve their        intended goals
