       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Energy Bill s Inclusion Of S    555  The NOPEC Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Energy Bills Inclusion Of S  555  The NOPEC Bill     June 28  2005   The Leahy Backed NOPEC Bill Passed      The Senate Tuesday Morning As Part Of The Senate Energy Bill  Which      Passed The Senate In A Vote Of 85 to 12  Senator Leahy Voted      Aye    Today we are      voting on the Energy bill  which provides Congress with an historic      opportunity  We should seize this opportunity and ensure that as      this legislation goes to conference  the NOPEC bill  S  555  remains      an essential part of the underlying legislation   Americas fuel      crisis continues to take hard earned money from our families       farmers  and businesses  When President Bush took office the price      of one gallon of regular gasoline was about  1 45  Today  that same      gallon will cost an American at the pump more than  2 20  And      yesterday  our financial markets closed with the ominous and      unprecedented news that a barrel of crude oil now sells for more      than  60 per barrel  We know that these prices have a real impact       a major shipping carrier announced disappointing earnings last week      in part due to the high price of fuel  and yet the Administration      has done nothing to address the situation   In the face of      continued inaction from the White House  it is time for Congress to      substitute action for talk  It is time for us to finally pass NOPEC      as part of the larger Energy bill   We should have      considered and passed this bill  S  555  on its own  This bill      passed out of the Judiciary Committee for a second time with      overwhelming support earlier this year  I have repeatedly called      for its consideration by the Senate over the last several months       It is long past time for the Congress to hold OPEC accountable for      its anti competitive behavior  This amendment will release the U S       from being at the mercy of the OPEC cartel by making them subject to      our antitrust laws  It will allow the Federal Government to take      legal action against any foreign state  including members of OPEC       for price fixing and other anticompetitive activities in this      regard  The Presidents      solution to high gasoline prices this summer is to open the Arctic      National Wildlife Refuge  pristine wilderness area  to oil      drilling  But drilling in ANWR will not provide any new oil for at      least seven to 12 years  and will take an environmental toll  ANWR      drilling will do absolutely nothing to help working Americans who      have sticker shock at the gas pump or who will be facing record high      home heating prices in a few months  The Bush Administration admits      that its energy policies include no immediate help for gas prices      and no short term solutions   The NOPEC bill      is a unique element of this legislation  It can do something      immediately to help relieve the situation we face every time we      fill up at the pump  We should insist that it be retained  enacted      and implemented  I hope that Republican leadership does not demand      this provision be removed but that if it does  the Senate stands      firm on behalf of the American people  We should not squander this      opportunity to address the real concerns of the American public
