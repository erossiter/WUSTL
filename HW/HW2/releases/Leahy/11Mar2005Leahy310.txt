       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Final Passage By The Senate Of The   Bankruptcy Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Floor Statement Of Senator Patrick         Leahy        On Final Passage By The Senate        Of S  256  The Bankruptcy Bill        March 10  2005  I am sorely disappointed that the Senate did        not accept the opportunity to adopt more amendments to update and improve        this legislation and to make it more balanced  as far as ordinary Americans        are concerned  The Senate had the chance to produce a fairer bill and a        more balanced bill  but the Republican leadership did everything it could        to thwart the amendments that would have made this bill fairer and more        balanced for ordinary Americans    Our nation wears a different face today than        it did in March 2001  the last time the Senate considered bankruptcy reform        legislation  We have endured the terrorist attacks of 9 11  fought wars in       Afghanistan and Iraq  witnessed a parade of financial        misdeeds by major corporations  and watched as pension promises to        Americans were shortchanged by nearly  100 billion  Yet the Senate failed        to modernize this bankruptcy legislation to take into account these many        changes in our economy   Over the past two weeks  we have had roll        call votes on 34 amendments  All but three were needlessly rejected  on        the orders of the Republican leadership  on virtually party line votes         Senator Sarbanes and I offered an amendment to maintain the        conflict of interest standards that keep investment banks accountable         Senator Kennedy offered an amendment to help those debtors who are dealing        with financial problems caused by serious medical problems  Senator Durbin        offered amendments to ease the economic hardships faced by soldiers and        their families when they are called to duty to serve our country  Senator        Schumer offered an amendment to address the discharge of penalties for        violence and other illegal acts against health and family planning        clinics  Senator Akaka offered an amendment to better inform consumers        about the costs involved when making the minimum monthly payments on their        credit cards  The Senate rejected all of these amendments to improve the        bill    The concerns and interests of consumers  poor        and middle class families  our uniformed service members and their        families  and veterans were cast callously aside  because the credit card        companies and investment banks wanted no changes to a bill that was cast in        stone and is simply behind the times   With passage of this bill  we will fall well        short of balancing the interests of creditors with those of hard working        American families who need the opportunity to resolve overwhelming        financial burdens  The priorities of ordinary Americans have been        overridden to accommodate the priorities of powerful special interests         This bill will have a harsh and real impact on the lives of many people who        have already suffered from illnesses or divorce or job loss  I cannot in        good conscience vote for a special interest driven measure that ignores the        real hardships faced by ordinary hard working Americans
