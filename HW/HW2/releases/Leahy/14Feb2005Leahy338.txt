       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The White House s Official   Re Nominations Of Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Comment Of Senator Patrick         Leahy  D Vt          Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         On The White Houses Official Re Nominations Of Judicial Nominees        February 14  2005  In        renominating some of their most controversial nominees  the Bush        Administration has again chosen confrontation over cooperation and ideology        over moderation           The Presidents words about wanting to reach across the aisle to work with        Democrats are ringing a little hollow at this point  Democratic senators        cooperated in confirming 204 of President Bushs judicial nominees in his        first term  and we were able to reach the lowest judicial vacancy rates in        16 years  Yet many of these controversial nominees are certain to continue        to divide the country and to divide the Senate          The Senate should not be a rubber stamp for this or any White House  The        independent federal judiciary should not be made into an arm of either        political party  and when any president tries to do that  it threatens the        publics trust in our courts          The President and his partisans might consider toning down their rhetoric        as they reflect on the fact that only ten of his nominations were blocked        in the 108th Congress  while more than 60 of President Clintons        judicial nominees were blocked by Republicans
