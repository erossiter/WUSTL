       Vermont Congressional Delegation s Reply To Governor Douglas s Letter                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Vermont Congressional Delegation s Reply    To Governor Douglas s Letter     Which Asks GOP Leaders To Derail The New England Wilderness Act    Below is the text of     a letter that Vermonts Congressional Delegation  Sen  Patrick Leahy      Sen  Jim Jeffords  and Rep  Bernie Sanders    sent Thursday to Governor     James Douglas  responding to the Governors letter to House Republican     leaders  asking them to derail the bipartisan New England Wilderness     Act  which would designate additional wilderness acreage in Vermont and     New Hampshire  The bill passed the Senate without objection on     Tuesday  The Governors letter was sent to Rep  Richard Pombo  Chairman     of the House Resources Committee  and to Rep  Bob Goodlatte  Chairman of     House Agriculture Committee  The Governors letter was sent only to the     Republican leaders of those two committees  not also to the Democratic     leaders of the two panels  The text of the letter follows   Letter is available as a  September 21  2006 The Honorable James H  Douglas    Governor    State of Vermont    109 State Street     Montpelier  VT 05609 Dear Governor Douglas  We are writing in response to your letter to     Representatives Pombo and Goodlatte regarding the New England Wilderness     Act of 2006  This legislation passed the United States Senate     unanimously on Tuesday  September 19  with bipartisan support  We are quite puzzled by your implication that there     has not been sufficient public process for Vermonters views about the     designation of additional wilderness in the Green Mountain National     Forest  Since 2001  there have been more than 70 public meetings  five     local planning groups  four educational forums and four open houses on     the Green Mountain National Forest plan  In addition  throughout the     planning process the Delegation staff has met with a diverse group of     stakeholders  State officials and Forest Service staff in regular     meetings facilitated by the University of Vermont Extension Service      Throughout the planning process the Forest Service received more than     10 000 official public comments on the future management of the Green     Mountain National Forest  the vast majority of which supported more     wilderness  In 2003 you asked  and we agreed  to delay moving     forward with wilderness legislation prior to the completion of the Green     Mountain National Forest plan revision process  At that time you     recognized the important role this Forest Plan revision process played      when you wrote to us stating that the Forest Plan Revision process will      allow all interested and affected citizens to become informed and     offer opinions  In response to your concern  we delayed introduction     of any legislation in order to best utilize the tremendous public     process undertaken by the Forest Service   At the conclusion of the Forest Service process  it     was clear by the abundant public record in support of additional     wilderness that the Delegation should move forward with its     Congressional responsibility for wilderness designations  We believe     our legislation represents a fair and thoughtful outcome representing     the wishes of a strong majority of Vermonters  whose views and wishes     were represented and considered during the Forest Planning process you     had endorsed  As you know  the list of locales in which the     Forest Service has proposed wilderness areas is nearly identical to the     settings in which wilderness is proposed by our legislation  We     therefore note the inconsistency of your letters suggestion of local     government veto power over Federal land     management decisions  especially as surveys indicate a robust majority     of Vermonters in communities within the Green Mountain National Forest     support additional wilderness   We were disappointed at your recent refusal to     entertain our good faith efforts to address some of the concerns you     raised in your letter earlier this month  Our offices have spent years     attending public meetings and working with a diverse set of stakeholders     to formulate our balanced legislation and have always remained open to     your input  The public record supports our balanced Federal legislation     to carry out our Congressional responsibility to designate national     wilderness lands in Vermont  Finally  we are disappointed that after such an     extensive public record in Vermont and after our efforts to communicate     directly with you  you now have chosen to call on the Republican House     leadership to thwart a Vermont wilderness bill that many Vermonters have     worked toward crafting and enacting  over many years  Vermonters of     today  and Vermonters of generations to come  deserve our best efforts     to carry this legislation forward   Sincerely  PATRICK LEAHY JAMES     JEFFORDS BERNARD SANDERS    United States Senator United States Senator     United States Representative
