       The Feingold Boxer Leahy Legislation To End U S  Military Involvement In   Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             The Feingold Boxer Leahy      Legislation     To End U S  Military Involvement In Iraq     February 1  2007  The Feingold Boxer Leahy legislation       introduced in the Senate this week  would effectively end the United      States military mission to Iraq in its current form and would lead      to substantial redeployments of American forces back to the United      States within six months after enactment    The Feingold Boxer Leahy language      would prohibit the use of funds for the deployment of the U S       military in Iraq six months after that date of enactment  requiring      the Administration to submit a formal strategy within two months of      enactment to redeploy American forces safely   The Feingold Boxer Leahy legislation      allows exceptions for the presence of limited U S  military forces      in the country to conduct counter terrorism operations against      possible Al Qaeda cells  to conduct training for Iraqi security      forces  and to provide security for U S  infrastructure and U S       personnel         Comment of Senator Leahy   With President Bushs strategy of      escalation and his inflexible rhetoric  the Bush Administrations      policies have led us into a corner  and the President has ignored      sound  bipartisan advice to extricate us from this fiasco  The      so called surge will do little to bring lasting stability out of a      civil war that has already cost the lives of more than 3000 American      troops and countless tens of thousands of innocent Iraqis  I cannot      justify the continued  open ended deployment of our troops in Iraq       As we begin to withdraw our forces  the Iraqis will have to make a      choice between more sectarian violence  or the political compromises      necessary to save their country
