       Leahy On Friday Introduces Resolution Underscoring That Congress Did Not   Authorize Illegal Spying On Americans                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy On Friday Introduces Resolution     Underscoring That Congress Did Not Authorize     Illegal Spying On Americans   WASHINGTON  Friday  Jan  20        Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   on Friday introduced a resolution      setting the record straight that Congress did not authorize      President Bushs illegal spying program when it passed a 2001      resolution governing the use of military force in the war on      terror    Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee and a co author of the original USA      PATRIOT Act  offered the resolution to clarify recent misleading      claims by the Bush Administration that the Authorization for Use of      Military Force resolution approved shortly after the Sept  11  2001       terror attacks provided the President with the necessary      authorization to conduct warrantless eavesdropping on Americans        Now that the illegal spying of      Americans has become public and the President has acknowledged the      four year old program  the Bush Administrations lawyers are      contending that Congress authorized it  The September 2001      Authorization to Use Military Force did no such thing  Leahy said        Below is Leahys statement on the      resolution                   Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Introduction Of Resolution     Regarding The Authorization For Use Of Military Force     January 20  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today I am      introducing this resolution expressing the sense of the Senate that      the Authorization for Use of Military Force  which Congress passed      to authorize military action against those responsible for the      attacks on September 11  2001  did not authorize warrantless      eavesdropping on American citizens   As Justice OConnor underscored      recently  even war is not a blank check for the President when it      comes to the rights of the Nations citizens   Now that the illegal spying of      Americans has become public and the President has acknowledged the      four year old program  the Bush Administrations lawyers are      contending that Congress authorized it  The September 2001      Authorization to Use Military Force did no such thing  Republican      Senators also know it and a few have said so publicly  We all know      it  The liberties and rights that define us as Americans and the      system of checks and balances that serve to preserve them should not      be sacrificed to threats of terrorism or to the expanding power of      the Government  In the days immediately following those attacks  I      said  and I continue to believe  that the terrorists win if they      frighten us into sacrificing our freedoms and what defines us as      Americans    I well remember the days immediately      after the 9 11 attacks  I helped open the Senate to business the      next day  I said then  on September 12  2001   If we abandon our democracy to battle      them  they win        We will maintain our democracy  and with      justice  we will use our strength  We will not lose our commitment      to the rule of law  no matter how much the provocation  because that      rule of law has protected us throughout the centuries  It has      created our democracy  It has made us what we are in history  We      are a just and good Nation   I joined with others  Republican and      Democrats  and we engaged in round the clock efforts over the next      months in connection with what came to be the USA PATRIOT Act       During those days the Bush Administration never asked us for this      surveillance authority or to amend the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act to accommodate such a program    Just as we cannot allow ourselves to      be lulled into a sense of false comfort when it comes to our      national security  we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into a      blind trust regarding our freedoms and rights  The Framers built      checks and balances into our system specifically to counter such      abuses and undue assertions of power  We must remain vigilant on      all fronts or we stand to lose these rights forever  Once lost or      eroded  liberty is difficult if not impossible to restore  The Bush      Administrations after the fact claims about the breadth of the      Authorization to Use Military Force    as recently as this week  in      a document prepared at the White Houses behest by the Department of      Justice    are the latest in a long line of manipulations of the      law  We have also seen this type of overreaching in that same      Justice Department offices twisted interpretation of the torture      statute  an analysis that had to be withdrawn  with the detention of      suspects without charges and denial of access to counsel  and with      the misapplication of the material witness statute as a sort of      general preventive detention law  Such abuses serve to harm our      national security as well as our civil liberties    In addition  the press reports that      the Pentagon maintains secret databases containing information on a      wide cross section of ordinary Americans  and that the FBI is      monitoring law abiding citizens in the exercise of their First      Amendment freedoms  When I worked with Senator Wyden and others in      2003 to stop Admiral Poindexters Total Information Awareness      program  an effort designed to datamine information on Americans       and we meant it  And when I added a reporting requirement on      Carnivore  the FBIs email monitoring program  to the Department of      Justice Authorizations law in 2002  we meant it  We demanded that      Congress be kept informed and that any such program not proceed      without congressional authorization    The New York Times reported      that after September 11  2001  when former Attorney General John      Ashcroft loosened restrictions on the FBI to permit it to monitor      Web sites  mosques  and other public entities  the FBI has used      that authority to investigate not only groups with suspected ties to      foreign terrorists  but also protest groups suspected of having      links to violent or disruptive activities  When I learned of such      efforts and that they reportedly included monitoring Quakers in      Florida and possibly Vermont  I wrote to the Secretary of Defense      demanding an answer  That was a month ago  So far he has refused      to provide that answer    Now we have learned that President      Bush has  for more than four years  secretly allowed the warrantless      wiretapping of Americans inside the United States  And we read in      the press that sources at the FBI say that much of what was      forwarded to them to investigate was worthless and led to dead      ends  That is a dangerous diversion of our investigative resources      away from those who pose real threats  while precious time and      effort is devoted to looking into the lives of law abiding      Americans    The United States Supreme Court has      consistently held for nearly 40 years  since its landmark decision      in Katz v  United States  that the monitoring and recording      of private conversations constitutes a search and seizure within      the meaning of the Fourth Amendment  Congress enacted the      Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978  FISA  to provide a      legal mechanism for the government to engage in electronic      surveillance of Americans in connection with intelligence      gathering  The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  along with      the criminal wiretap authority in title 18 of the United States      Code  together provide the exclusive means by which the Government      may intercept domestic electronic communications pursuant to the      rule of law    The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act has been amended over time  and it has been adjusted several      times since the 9 11 attacks  Indeed  much of the PATRIOT Act was      devoted to modifying FISA to make it easier to obtain FISA warrants       But the PATRIOT Act did not amend FISA to give the      Government the authority to conduct warrantless surveillance of      American citizens    If the Bush Administration believed      that the law was inadequate to deal with the threat of terrorism      within our boundaries  it should have come to Congress and sought to      change the law  It did not  Indeed  Attorney General Gonzales      admitted at a press conference onDecember 19  2005  that the      Administration did not seek to amend FISA to authorize the NSA      spying program because it was advised that it was not something we      could likely get    I chaired the Senate Judiciary      Committee in 2001 and 2002  when the Presidents secret      eavesdropping program apparently began  I was not informed of the      program  I learned about it for the first time in the press last      month  I thank heaven and the Constitution that we still have a      free press    The Bush Administration is now arguing      that when Congress authorized the use of force in September 2001 to      attack al Qaeda in Afghanistan  it authorized warrantless searches      and eavesdropping on American citizens  I voted for that      authorization  and I know that Congress did not sign a blank check       The notion that Congress authorized warrantless surveillance in      the AUMF is utterly inconsistent with the Attorney Generals      admission that Congress was not asked for such authorization because      it was assumed that Congress would say no    Former Senate Majority Leader Tom      Daschle  who helped negotiate the use of force resolution with the      White House  has confirmed that the subject of warrantless wiretaps      of American citizens never came up  that he did not and never would      have supported giving authority to the President for such wiretaps       and that he is confident that the 98 senators who voted in favor of      authorization of force against al Qaeda did not believe that they      were also voting for warrantless domestic surveillance     Senator Daschle also noted that the      Bush Administration sought to add language to the resolution that      would have explicitly authorized the use of force in the United      States  but Congress refused to grant the President such sweeping      power  Maybe that was this Administrations covert way to seek the      authority to spy on Americans  but Congress did not grant any such      authority   Spying on Americans without first      obtaining the requisite warrants is illegal  unnecessary and wrong       No President can simply declare when he wishes to follow the law and      when he chooses not to  especially when it comes to the hard won      rights of the American people    The resolution I introduce today is      intended to help set the record straight  It is an important first      step toward restoring checks and balances between the co equal      branches of Government  I urge all Senators to support it  I ask      consent that the Resolution be included in the Record following my      statement
