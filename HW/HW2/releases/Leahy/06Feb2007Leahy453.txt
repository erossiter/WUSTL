       Leahy  Sanders Introduce Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy  Sanders Introduce       Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2007  S 495   Bipartisan Bill Would Help       Vermonters Better Protect Personal Information       WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Feb  6           Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman of the Senate Judiciary       Committee  and Senator Bernie Sanders  I Vt   Tuesday introduced       comprehensive legislation that would better protect the privacy       of Vermonters personal information in the face of data security       breaches in Vermont and across the country   Leahy introduced a similar bill       last Congress with fellow Judiciary Committee member Arlen       Specter  R Pa    following serious data breaches at ChoicePoint       and LexisNexis  Senator Specter  who is the Ranking Member on       the panel  is co sponsoring the bill again this Congress  Since       then breaches at several other firms and within state and       federal governments have exposed millions of Americans to       identity theft by leaking or losing their personal data  which       included names  addresses  and sometimes Social Security       numbers    Just last week in Vermont there       was a serious data breach of a computer system used by the       Vermont Agency of Human Services  The breach jeopardized the       financial data of at least 69 000 Vermonters whose personal       financial information was stored on the server  In other recent       cases  Designer Shoes Warehouse and TJ Maxx Stores both had the       personal information of their customers stolen from their       computers   According to the Privacy Rights       Clearing House  since February 2005  more than 100 million       records containing personal information have been subject to       some sort of security breach    Today  Americans live in a world       where their most sensitive personal information can be accessed       and sold to the highest bidder  with just a few keystrokes on a       computer  yet our privacy laws havent kept pace  said Leahy        who has championed privacy protections in his more than three       decades in the United States Senate  This comprehensive bill       not only deals with the need to provide Americans with notice       when they have been victims of a data breach  but also deals       with the underlying problem of lax security and lack of       accountability to help prevent data breaches from occurring in       the first place  Reforms like these are long overdue  He said       the bill also can serve as a model for states in enacting laws       covering state kept data   Leahy  who has testified before       congressional Committees on this bill and the need for stronger       privacy protections  has marked privacy issues as a high       priority agenda item for the Judiciary Committee in the 110th       Congress  The Committees first hearing this session was on the       use of government databanks and data mining and the need for       stronger congressional oversight of that technology in order to       strike a proper balance between Americans privacy and their       security    This legislation is a critically       important tool to protect the privacy of Americans personal       information  Companies who collect personal information have a       serious responsibility to safeguard it and this bill would make       sure they do that  said Sanders  In addition  we need to       treat the theft of personal information as the serious crime       that it is  This bill sends the message loud and clear that       those who engage in identity theft are going to face increased       criminal penalties  I look forward to working with Senator       Leahy  who has been at the forefront of the effort to protect       Americans privacy rights    to advance this important       legislation    Key features of the bipartisan       legislation include                  Increasing criminal penalties for identity theft involving       electronic personal data and making it a crime to intentionally       or willfully conceal a security breach involving personal       data                  Giving individuals access to  and the opportunity to correct        any personal information held by commercial data brokers                  Requiring entities that maintain personal data to establish       internal policies that protect the personal data of Americans                  Requiring entities that maintain personal data to give notice to       individuals and law enforcement when they experience a breach       involving sensitive personal data   and                 Requiring the government to establish rules protecting privacy       and security when it uses information from commercial data       brokers  to conduct audits of government contracts with data       brokers and impose penalties on government contractors that fail       to meet data privacy and security requirements                  Below is Senator Leahys      Statement on Introduction of the Bill    Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary      On The Introduction Of The Leahy Specter Personal Data Privacy And      Security Act Of 2007     February 6  2007  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today  I am      pleased to join Senator Specter in reintroducing the Leahy Specter      Personal Data Privacy and Security Act  a comprehensive data privacy package aimed at better      protecting Americans privacy   Senator Specter has been a valuable      partner in addressing the growing problem of data breaches and how      to best protect Americans sensitive personal data  I appreciate      his willingness to work with me on this important legislation again      this year and I look forward to our close partnership yielding      results in this new Congress    I also thank Majority Leader Reid for      his leadership and commitment to enacting meaningful data privacy      legislation this year  We have also worked closely with other      members of the Judiciary Committee to address this issue and I look      forward to continuing that effort as we move this legislation      forward   When Senator Specter and I first      introduced this bill in 2005  we had high hopes of bringing urgently      needed data privacy reforms to the American people  The Judiciary      Committee favorably reported this bill in November 2005  But       unfortunately  our bill languished on the Senate calendar for more      than a year without any action and the Congress adjourned without      passing comprehensive data privacy legislation last year     While the Congress waited to act on      passing data privacy legislation  the problems with data breaches      remained a persistent and pernicious threat to Americans privacy       Yesterday  we learned that the Department of Veterans Affairs has      lost a portable hard drive containing the sensitive personal      information on as many as 48 000 veterans     Just last week  there was a major data      breach involving a state computer server in my home state of      Vermont  which jeopardized the financial data of at least 69 000      Vermonters whose personal financial information had been stored on a      computer server used by the Vermont Agency of Human Services  Of      course  this situation is not unique to Vermont  There have also      been similar kinds of data breaches across the country   Last month  mega retailer TJX      disclosed that it suffered a major computer breach involving credit      and debit card purchases involving possibly hundreds of thousands of      American consumers  Even more disturbing are reports that  although      TJX knew about this breach in mid December  the company did not tell      its customers about the breach until a month after it occurred   And of course  all of these      unfortunate data breaches come on the heels of the theft of the      personal data of 26 5 million of our veterans and active duty      personnel at the Veterans Administration that occurred last year       According to the Privacy Rights Clearing House  more than 100      million records containing sensitive personal information have been      involved in data security breaches since 2005    These data security breaches are      compelling examples of why we need strong federal data privacy and      security laws to protect Americans personal data and to address the      ills of lax data security  Our bill provides this much needed      tonic    Our bill requires that data brokers      let consumers know what sensitive personal information they have      about them  and to allow individuals to correct inaccurate      information  This is a simple matter of fairness  with clear      precedent in the credit report context   Our bill also requires that companies      that have databases with sensitive personal information on Americans      establish and implement data privacy and security programs  In the      Information Age  any company that wants to be trusted by the public      must earn that trust by vigilantly protecting the databases they use      and maintain    In addition  the bill requires notice      when sensitive personal information has been compromised  The      American people have a right to know when they are at risk because      of corporate failures to protect their data  or when a criminal has      infiltrated data systems  This bill also provides for tough      criminal penalties for anyone who would intentionally and willfully      conceal the fact that a data breach has occurred when the breach      causes economic damage to consumers    Finally  our bill addresses the      important issue of the governments use of personal data  This bill      would require federal agencies to notify affected individuals when      government data breaches occur  Because we are living in a world in      which our government increasingly is turning to the private sector      to get personal data the government could not legally collect on its      own  our bill also places privacy and security front and center in      evaluating whether data brokers can be trusted with government      contracts that involve sensitive information about the American      people   This is a comprehensive bill that not      only deals with the need to provide Americans with notice when they      have been victims of a data breach  but that also deals with the      underlying problem of lax security and lack of accountability to      help prevent data breaches from occurring in the first place       Reforms like these are long overdue  And  as we start a new      Congress  these reforms should be at the top of our domestic      agenda  Data security and privacy issues will be a high priority on      the Judiciary Committees agenda in this new Congress   Today  Americans live in a world where      their most sensitive personal information can be accessed and sold      to the highest bidder  with just a few keystrokes on a computer       Our privacy laws greatly lag behind both the capabilities of our      technology and the cunning of identity thieves  This legislation      takes an important and meaningful step to help close this gap  For      the sake of all Americans  I urge all Senators to support this      legislation and to act now to pass comprehensive data privacy and      security legislation  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the      bill be printed in the Record                    Summary Of The      LeahySpecter Personal Data Privacy And Security Act Of 2007   Provides new measures to protect       the privacy and security of personal data  Provides Americans       with notice when they have been harmed  and also addresses the       underlying problem of lax security and lack of accountability in       dealing with personal data      Adds unauthorized access to       sensitive personally identifiable information to the criminal       prohibition against computer fraud under 18 U S C     1030 a         2       Requires data brokers to let       individuals know what information they have about them  and       where appropriate  allow individuals to correct demonstrated       inaccuracies  There are exemptions for products and services       already subject to access and correction rules under the Fair       Credit Reporting Act  as well as companies subject to Gramm Leach Bliley       and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act        In addition  there are also exemptions for proprietary  fraud       prevention tools and marketing data      Requires companies that have       databases with personal information on more than 10 000       Americans to establish and implement data privacy and security       programs  and vet third party contractors hired to process       data  There are exemptions for companies already subject to       data security requirements under Gramm Leach Bliley and the       Health Information Portability and Accountability Act      Requires notice to law       enforcement  consumers and credit reporting agencies when       digitized sensitive personal information has been compromised        The trigger for notice is tied to significant risk of harm with       appropriate checks and balances to prevent over notification as       well as underreporting  There are exemptions for national       security and law enforcement needs  credit card companies using       fraud prevention techniques or where a breach does not result in       a significant risk of harm      Addresses the governments use of       personal data by   1  requiring the General Services       Administration to evaluate the privacy and security practices of       potential government contractors handling personal data  and       include penalties in government contracts for failure to protect       data privacy and security   2  requiring Federal departments and       agencies to audit the information security practices of       commercial data brokers hired for projects involving personal       data and include protections and penalties in contracts with       data brokers to protect data privacy and security  and  3        requiring Federal departments and agencies to conduct privacy       impact assessments on their use of commercial databases to       access personal data on U S  persons  and to adopt regulations       to ensure the security and privacy of data obtained through       commercial data brokers      Provides tough monetary penalties       for failing to provide privacy and security protections and       notices of security breaches  and toughens criminal penalties       for those who infiltrate systems to compromise personal data        Also imposes a criminal penalty in the cases were there is       intentional and willful concealment of a security breach known       to require notice
