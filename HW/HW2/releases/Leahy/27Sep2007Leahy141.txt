       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Consideration Of S  980  The   Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On The Consideration Of S 980      The Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act Of 2007    September 27  2007 Today  the Committee considers the Online Pharmacy     Consumer Protection Act  S 980  introduced by Senators Feinstein      Sessions and Biden  We held a hearing into these matters back on May   The Internet has enabled all Americans better     access to convenient and more affordable medicine  Unfortunately  the     prevalence of rogue online pharmacies has also made the Internet an     increasing source for the illegal supply of controlled substances      Online drug traffickers have used evolving tactics to evade detection by     law enforcement and circumvent the proper constraints of doctors and     pharmacists  As a result  dangerous and addictive prescription drugs     are too often only a click away   At our hearing in May  the Committee heard the     compelling testimony of Francine Haight  a mother whose teenage son died     from an overdose of painkillers he purchased online from a rogue     pharmacy  We also heard from Joseph Califano  the former Secretary of     the Department of Health  Education and Welfare  Both strongly     supported legislation to fill a gap in existing law and help protect     young people from illicit drugs online   I thank Senator Feinstein  Senator Sessions and     Senator Biden  the Chair of our Crime and Drugs Subcommittee  for their     hard work  I understand that Senator Feinstein will be offering an     amendment in the form of a substitute which includes several     recommendations I have made to improve the bill and make it more     effective  I am glad that the substitute includes my     suggestion that the Drug Enforcement Administration report to Congress     on recommendations to combat the online sale of controlled substances     from foreign countries via the Internet and on ways that the private     sector can assist in this effort  A key ingredient in diminishing the     impact of rogue websites on American citizens is combating the     international aspect of this problem  and strengthening the     public private sector collaboration can help provide a solution  The     substitute also narrows the Sentencing Commission directive to ensure     that the most dangerous prescription drugs abused online are treated     more severely than less harmful prescription drugs
