       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Leslie Southwick to   The Fifth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of Leslie Southwick To The Fifth Circuit     August 1  2007       Today I have put back on      the agenda the nomination of Leslie Southwick to the United States      Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  As I      have said previously  I took the Southwick nomination off the      Committee agenda at the request of Republican Senators  I refused      to ambush Judge Southwick the way Republicans ambushed Justice      Ronnie White in 1999 when they voted him down  Instead  I alerted      the White House and Senate Republicans of the opposition to the      Southwick nomination and have tried to be constructive in consulting      with the White House    I have been waiting patiently to hear      back from the Republican senators who sought a delay in the      consideration of Mr  Southwicks nomination  yet there has been no      request from any Republican senator that the Committee move forward      in its consideration  Instead  I have heard several Republican      senators complain publicly about the delay that they themselves      caused  and so I have returned this nomination to the Committees      agenda this week   If Republicans follow through on their      threats to shut down the Senate over a single judicial nomination      they would be continuing their pattern of obstructionism and it      would the American people and our troops who suffer the most  Like      their President  Republicans priorities are misguided and      dangerous  Instead of funding vital defense initiatives       Republicans are talking about shutting down the Senate over a single      judicial nominee    I guess those making these threats and      demands have a short memory  I do not intend to pocket filibuster      more than 60 of this Presidents judicial nominees  as the      Republican majority did with President Clintons judicial nominees        I do not intend to pocket filibuster      17 of this Presidents circuit nominees  the way the Republican      majority did at the end of the Clinton Administration  For those      with short memories  I will call the roll  Barry Goode  Helene      White  Alston Johnson  James Duffy  Elena Kagan  James Wynn       Kathleen McCree Lewis  Enrique Moreno  Allen Snyder  Kent Markus       Robert Cindrich  Bonnie Campbell  Stephen Orlofsky  Roger Gregory       Christine Arguello  Andre Davis  and Elizabeth Gibson  Now a couple      arrived late  some may have been held up by blue slips of home state      Senators  but this is quite a list     This year we have      already confirmed three circuit court nominees  That is more that      were confirmed by this time in 1999 with a Republican led Senate and      three more than the Republican led Senate confirmed in the entire      1996 session  Last week  Senator Cardin chaired a      nominations hearing that included another circuit nominee  Jennifer      Elrod  who has been nominated to the same circuit as Judge      Southwick    The Senate has confirmed 20 Circuit      Court nominations and 125 total federal judicial nominees while I      have presided as Judiciary Chairman  in less than two full years       It is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency  more      circuit judges  more district judges and more total judges have been      confirmed  in less time  while I served as Judiciary Chairman than      during the longer tenures of either of the two Republican Chairmen      working with Republican Senate majorities   The Senate has confirmed 25      nominations for lifetime appointments this year  more than were      confirmed in 2005 with a Republican Chairman and Republican      majority  The Judiciary Committee has reported out another five      nominations and has two district court nominations on our agenda      this week in addition to Judge Southwicks  If we are able to      report these two district court nominees  we will have reported 32      lifetime appointments to the federal courts since January of this      year  If we are able to report and the Senate has an opportunity to      consider and confirm just the five nominees currently on the      executive calendar  I will have presided over the most productive      2 year period for judicial confirmations in the last 20 years with      130 confirmations in two years    For all our efforts  for my efforts to      treat Judge Southwick fairly  all we hear from the other side is      complaining  And we read that some are itching to pick a fight over      the nomination  Last week the press was full of stories of meetings      with right wing groups and the partisan benefits to be gained by      Republicans picking such a fight    Congressional Republicans seem to love      to shut down the Government and seem intent on manufacturing excuses      to do so  In 1995 it was Newt Gingrich  who did not like his      treatment on Air Force One  When they were in the Senate majority a      few years ago    and while surreptitiously stealing our computer      files   it was Senate Republicans who insisted on a 40 hour debate      on this Presidents court packing schemes  Now  despite our      progress and our efforts to work to fill judicial vacancies  some in      the Senate Republican leadership seem to be at it  again     It is Republicans who held up this      Presidents nomination of Judge Neff since last year and stalled      Senate action on a dozen judicial nominations  Indeed  it was      Republicans who were the ones who voted against confirming President      Bushs judicial nominees last month  Already this year we have      proceeded to confirm more judges than were confirmed in all of 2005      when Republicans ran the Senate  and more than were confirmed for      the entire 1996 session when a Republican led Senate confirmed 17      district court nominees and not a single circuit nominee     As it is  we have helped cut the      circuit vacancies from a high water mark of 32 in the early days of      this Administration  to as few as 13  Contrast that with the      Republican led Senates lack of action on President Clintons      moderate and qualified nominees that resulted in increasing circuit      vacancies during the Clinton years from 17 to 26  During those      years  the Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous and successful      efforts under the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in      anticipation of a Republican President  More than 60 percent of      current circuit court judges were appointed by Republican      Presidents  with the current President having appointed more than 30      percent of the active circuit judges already    Senate Republicans know the      difficulties with four of the Presidents current circuit nominees       If they were candid they would concede that they are having      difficulties themselves trying to work with this White House on      filling judicial vacancies with acceptable nominees     I continue to try to work with this      White House and to make progress  Next year the Thurmond rule will      kick in until after a new president is inaugurated  That is why I      have urged the White House to work with Senators of both parties and      to fill the 5th Circuit vacancy from Mississippi with the      nomination of the Honorable Henry Wingate  Judge Wingate would be      the first African American from Mississippi to serve on the 5th      Circuit  He is the Chief Judge of the District Court for the      Southern District of Mississippi  He was appointed to the federal      bench in Mississippi by President Ronald Reagan  He has served with      honor and distinction for more than 20 years  since we helped      confirm him in 1985  He has served as the Chief Judge of the      District Court since 2003  He was a naval officer and is a member      of the Naval Reserve  He was an assistant attorney general  an      assistant district attorney  an assistant U S  attorney  a professor      and trial lawyer    I cannot imagine why an experienced      judge appointed by Ronald Reagan would be unacceptable to this White      House  But if for some reason he is  I will work with the White      House  the Senators from Mississippi  the Senates Majority and      Republican leader and our Ranking Member  the senior Senator from      Pennsylvania to identify another worthy candidate  This is not a      partisan fight that needs to be waged  We can work together to fill      this 5th Circuit vacancy  I hope the President will work      with us
