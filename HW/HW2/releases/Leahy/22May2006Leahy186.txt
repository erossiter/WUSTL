       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Chambliss Amendment To Modify H 2A   Wage Requirements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On Chambliss Amendment  SA 4009       To Modify H 2AWage Requirements To S 2611      The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act     May 22  2006  The Comprehensive Immigration      Reform Act includes a subtitle known as Ag JOBS  a bill that has      long been championed by Senator Craig  Senator Kennedy  and a broad      bipartisan group of Senators  I strongly support this bill because      it will help both farmers and farm workers in Vermont and around the      nation   Ag JOBS contains a package of      reforms that are badly needed in the seasonal agricultural worker      program  called H 2A visas  Ag JOBS was negotiated with the full      participation of agribusiness and farmworkers unions  and it      reflects a fair and thoughtful balance of the needs of both farmers      and workers   The version of Ag JOBS contained in      S 2611 protects business by ensuring a steady flow of legal workers       It assists agricultural workers by preventing wage stagnation in a      growing economy and by providing labor protections  It helps both      business and labor by giving trained and trusted foreign      agricultural workers a path to permanent immigration status if they      meet the requirements in the bill  such as paying fines and taxes       keeping a clean criminal record  and working the requisite number of      hours   The Chambliss amendment is an      attack on wages for agricultural workers who are among the lowest      paid laborers in America  By unfairly favoring the growers over      foreign workers  the Chambliss amendment would upset the careful      balance on wages and labor protections that were negotiated with the      participation of agribusiness and unions in the Ag JOBS bill    The Chambliss amendment requires      employers to pay workers the highest of two wage rates  the      prevailing wage in the area of employment  which may be determined      by an employer who conducts his own local survey  or the applicable      State minimum wage  Basing wages on the higher of these two rates      could result in deep cuts to wages  Some state minimum wages are      very low  such as Kansas  which requires only  2 65 per hour       Senator Chambliss previously acknowledged that farm wages could fall      by roughly  3 per hour under his proposal  His proposal almost      guarantees that no U S  workers could afford to accept agricultural      jobs and that foreign agricultural workers  who are already among      the most poorly paid workers in America  would be paid miserly wages      for their labor   The Chambliss formulation does not      include the well balanced provisions of Ag JOBS  Under Ag JOBS  an      employer must pay the highest of three wage rates   1  the      prevailing wage   2  the Federal or state minimum wage   3  or the      adverse effect wage rate  or AEWR  a regional weighted average      hourly wage rate for agricultural workers  The AEWR was established      under the Bracero guest worker program for Mexican workers that      ended in the 1960s  It was created to ensure that guest workers      would not adversely affect American workers by depressing wages       Removing AEWR from the wage equation drives wages downward  which      hurts all workers    American and foreign  It is no secret that our      agricultural industries depend on cheap labor  and some estimate      that 70 percent of agricultural workers presently working in the      U S  are undocumented  For all the of national security reasons I      have cited throughout this debate  we need to bring agricultural      workers out of the shadows  But we must also recognize that      vulnerable populations deserve our support and protection  Farm      workers are among the most vulnerable laborers in the Nation and I      cannot support an amendment that would slash their wages further
