       Senate Judiciary Committee Approves Contempt Citations For Rove  Bolten   In Bipartisan Vote                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Senate Judiciary Committee       Approves Contempt Citations   For Rove  Bolten In       Bipartisan Vote                    WASHINGTON  Thursday  Dec  13        2007   In a bipartisan vote  the Senate Judiciary Committee       Thursday found former White House Deputy Chief of Staff Karl       Rove and White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten to be in       contempt of Congress for failing to comply with subpoenas issued       in connection with the Committees investigation into the mass       firings of U S  Attorneys  Todays action follows bipartisan       votes by the panel earlier this year to authorize subpoenas for       documents and testimony from Bolten and Rove  which were later       issued after the White House  Bolten and Rove failed to comply       with extensive efforts by Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   to       encourage voluntary cooperation       The approval of the resolutions       comes two weeks after Leahy ruled that the Presidents claims of       executive privilege were overbroad and not legally valid to       block Bolten and Rove from providing Congress with subpoenaed       documents and testimony  Bolten was scheduled to appear and       provide documents to the Committee by June 28  and Rove was       summoned to appear to testify before the Judiciary Committee on       August 2  but both failed to meet the deadlines       In a vote of 12 7  the Judiciary       Committee Thursday reported resolutions of contempt to the full       Senate  The Committee has been investigating the mass firings       of U S  Attorneys and the politicization of the Department of       Justice under the Bush Administration  Congressional       investigations into the firings led to the resignations of the       entire senior leadership at the Department of Justice  including       former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales  and of several senior       White House aides  including Rove  both of whom tendered their       resignations in August       This is not a step I have wanted       to take  said Leahy of the Committees vote  I have tried for       many months to find ways to work with the White House and avoid       a legal confrontation  Congressional oversight is an essential       part of our system of checks and balances  Getting answers and       information helps identify and prevent abuses that hurt the       American people and that corrode our system  White House       stonewalling is unilateralism at its worst  and it thwarts       accountability  Executive privilege should not be invoked to       prevent investigations into wrongdoing  and abusing it should       have remedies and consequences  These resolutions are a remedy       and a consequence  We should act to protect Congress ability       to conduct oversight and the right of the American people to       know the whole truth about the U S  Attorney firings         The contempt resolutions now will       be reported to the full Senate for consideration  Below is       Leahys statement from Thursdays Judiciary Committee voting       session  The text of the resolutions of contempt follow                                                         Opening Statement of Sen        Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  Executive Business Meeting      December 13  2007    This week we have held three more       important hearings before the Committee  I have noticed two       more hearings next week to consider several of the Presidents       Executive Branch nominees  Regrettably  many of those announced       for top Justice Department positions were not  in fact        nominated when announced  and even after those nominations were       finally received  many still lack the necessary background       checks and materials necessary to be considered  We are       proceeding expeditiously with the nomination of Mark Filip to be       the Deputy Attorney General and will hear from him next       Wednesday  I noticed that hearing immediately upon receiving       the nomination and background materials       This weeks agenda includes a       number of items I had hoped the Committee would have considered       last week but that were carried over  We begin with the       resolutions arising from the failures of Karl Rove and the       Presidents chief of staff to honor this Committees subpoenas        As the Ranking Member has said  when we issue subpoenas  we need       to follow up  We have worked together during the last week to       modify the language in the resolutions and I believe we can       proceed efficiently this morning to consider and approve those       items  The White Houses blanket claims of executive privilege       and immunity are insufficient to excuse current and former White       House employees from appearing  testifying and producing       documents related to this Committees investigation  Having       been directed to comply with the Committees subpoenas  they       have not done so and now we must take the next steps to enforce       the Committees subpoenas  This is not a step I have wanted to       take  in fact  I have tried for many months to find ways to       work with the White House and avoid a confrontation       The President has not accepted       responsibility for the firings or given any indication that he       was involved in White House efforts to politicize federal law       enforcement  Instead  the White House line is that mistakes       were made  Apparently no one  least of all the President  is       responsible  yet somehow executive privilege supposedly applies       to cloak all White House activities and communication in regards       to these firings affecting the independence and integrity of       federal law enforcement from oversight     The White House counsel asserts       that executive privilege covers all documents and information in       the possession of the White House  They have gone further and       claimed absolute immunity even to have to appear and respond to       this Committees subpoenas for Mr  Rove and Mr  Bolten  And       they contend that their blanket claim of privilege cannot be       tested but must be accepted by the Congress as the last word        Their views of the unitary and all powerful Executive know no       bounds      The position taken by this White       House in refusing to turn over documents or allow White House       officials and former officials to testify is a dramatic break       from the practices of every administration since World War II in       responding to congressional oversight  In that time        presidential advisers have testified before congressional       committees 74 times  either voluntarily or compelled by       subpoenas     Executive privilege should not be       invoked to prevent investigations into wrongdoing  and certainly       should not prevail  These resolutions are an effort to provide       a fuller account and accountability  We should act to protect       Congress ability to conduct oversight and the right of the       American people to learn the whole truth about the U S  Attorney       firings      During the past week we have       learned that the CIA destroyed videotapes of detainee       interrogations  That revelation is leading to another       investigation  As the Ranking Member on this Committee from       2001 through 2005  I was not informed of the existence of the       videotapes or of their destruction  I do not believe the       Republican Chairmen were either  I have repeatedly sought       information about the Administrations interrogations of       detainees  including in connection with the consideration of the       Mukasey nomination and my October 25  2007  letter to the White       House counsel  We continue doing so  This week Senator Specter       and I jointly wrote the Attorney General seeking information       relevant to the tapes  their destruction and the preliminary       inquiry now underway within the Executive Branch  Surely        Congress must retain the authority to investigate and even       subpoena relevant information without being foreclosed by       blanket claims of executive privilege  I ask unanimous consent       that an editorial from the Vermonts Rutland Herald about the       destruction of these tapes be included in the record       We will next turn to Senator       Specters bill to use the legal concept of substitution as an       alternative to retroactive immunity in connection with the       warrantless wiretapping of Americans contrary to law from 2001        I commend his constructive effort and look forward to that       discussion      Also on our agenda is our       bipartisan bill to adjust judicial pay  I introduced this       bipartisan legislation with Senators Hatch  Feinstein  Graham        Reid  and McConnell almost six months ago  It was the first       bill introduced on this matter following the plea from the Chief       Justice at the beginning of the year  This bill would authorize       an increase in federal judicial salaries to recognize the       important constitutional role judges play in administering       justice  interpreting our laws  and providing the ultimate check       and balance in our system of government  Since 1969  the       salaries of federal judges have significantly declined when       adjusted for inflation      Eight years ago  Congress saw fit       to double the Presidents salary to  400 000 a year  We are not       proposing to increase judges salaries by 100 percent  but by       half that  Our democracy and the rights we enjoy depend on a       strong and independent Judiciary  Surely we can do half as much       for the judicial branch of government as we did for the       Executive eight years ago  This was a key subject in the Chief       Justices annual report for this year and I would like this       Committee to act on it today     I trust that the Republican       holdover of the bill for the reauthorization of the National       Center for Missing and Exploited Children will not portend       further delay and that we can consider and report that measure       without complications     I urge all Members who have not       yet arrived to come and participate with us in the work of the       Committee                    RESOLUTION      Authorizing       the President of the Senate to certify the facts of the failure       of Joshua Bolten  as the Custodian of
