       Leahy Among Senators Saying  NOPEC  To OPEC And Joins In Calling On Bush   To Deploy Reserve To Lower Oil Prices                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Leahy Among Senators Saying NOPEC  To OPEC        And Joins In Calling On Bush To Deploy Reserve To Lower Oil Prices  Bipartisan Plan Would Permit Legal Action Against Oil        Cartel                                                                                         WASHINGTON  Wednesday  March 9     Sen  Patrick Leahy         has introduced bipartisan legislation to allow the U S  Department of         Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to file antitrust lawsuits         against foreign states  such as members of the Oil Producing and         Exporting Countries  OPEC   for price fixing and other anticompetitive         activities  High oil import costs this year have driven up gasoline prices         and home heating oil costs for Vermonters and others this winter  Leahy  D Vt    along with Sens  Mike DeWine  R Ohio         and Herb Kohl  D Wisc    the chairman and the ranking Democratic member of        the Judiciary Committee s Subcommittee on Antitrust  Business Rights and        Competition  introduced a bill Tuesday in response to skyrocketing gas        prices across the nation  which can be partially attributed to price fixing        activities of the OPEC countries  Leahy is the ranking Democratic member        of the Judiciary Committee and has sponsored similar bills in previous        years   I wish this bill was on the books today and available        for use against the oil cartel  OPEC nations openly conspire to violate        the norms of our antitrust laws  said Leahy  who also is a senior member        of the antitrust panel  And yet they expect to do business with the        United States and to continue to reap the benefits of this relationship         On Wednesday  Leahy was also one of more than a dozen        senators  including Sen  Charles Schumer  D N Y    who sent a letter to        President Bush urging him to tap the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  as a        way to combat record high gas prices  Releasing oil from the reserve has        brought costs down in the past  most recently in 2000 when President        Clinton deployed from the SPR and the price of home heating oil fell 10        cents in one week  Leahy said  The bipartisan group of senators sent the        letter Wednesday   Text of the letter below   The new bill  The No Oil Producing and Exporting        Cartels Act  NOPEC   drops OPEC and other nations from the protections of        Foreign Services Immunity Act   FSIA   to the extent that those governments        are engaged in price fixing or other anticompetitive activities with regard        to pricing  production and distribution of petroleum products  NOPEC would        make OPEC s activities actionable under antitrust laws  The bill also        authorizes lawsuits in U S  federal court against oil cartel members by the        Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission         Leahy has raised concerns that oil companies are profiting at the expense        of American consumers  On average  gas prices have reached  2 00 per        gallon and could climb higher  according to experts  A spike in crude oil prices has led to sharp increases        in the price of home heating oil and diesel fuel throughout the Northeast        and across the country  Last month  heating oil customers in Vermont were        paying almost  2 per gallon  25 percent higher than last year  according to        the Vermont Department of Public Service         This price gouging by overseas oil cartels will put a strain on Vermonters        who need to be able to afford the oil that heats their homes  said Leahy         Our economy  our farmers  and our families need relief now  Under current law  antitrust actions may be filed        against private companies  but OPEC nations are currently protected by the        FSIA  which allows for the prosecution of foreign governments who are        engaged in commercial activity   but prohibits prosecution in those states        are engaged in governmental activity   A federal court has ruled that the        actions of OPEC are governmental actions and thus not commercial activity  Leahy has also pushed for tighter regulation of oil         natural gas  and other futures transactions on the Commodity Futures        Trading Commission  CFTC   It is critical to protect the integrity of oil        and natural gas markets in addressing Americas energy needs  said Leahy         who has encouraged stronger congressional oversight of anti fraud and        anti manipulation of these sometimes volatile markets              March 9  2005    The        Honorable George W  Bush   The        White House  1600        Pennsylvania Avenue         Washington  DC 20500    Dear        Mr  President      With        the price of crude oil having recently surged to near record levels and        possibly reaching even higher in the near future  we urge you to act now to        reduce skyrocketing prices at the gasoline pump by deferring oil deliveries        and releasing a portion of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve  SPR  through an        oil swap  The rising price of gasoline is already beginning to place a        financial strain on consumers that could threaten the nations economic        security  These increases are made even more troubling by the fact that        the summer driving season  which is when demand and prices traditionally        rise  has yet to arrive  If left unchecked this summer  these high        gasoline prices will continue to burden our economy by taking desperately        needed money out of the hands of working families and placing it into the        pockets of OPEC      On        Friday  the price of crude oil on the New York Mercantile Exchange  NYMEX         closed at the nearly record setting level of  53 78  and crude oil has been        trading at above  50 per barrel since February 22nd  This        sustained and extremely high price of oil has already burdened families        this winter by increasing the national retail price of heating oil by over        27 percent this winter  In addition  national average retail gasoline        prices have increased by almost  0 07 per gallon to reach  2 00 and some        analysts predict that prices could increase by  0 24 per gallon before        gasoline prices fully reflect the recent spike in crude oil prices  It has        been projected that such an increase could cost our nations consumers as        much as  90 million per day      These        recent  astronomical price increases have in large part been precipitated        by OPECs decisions to reduce oil production to 27 million barrels per day        and to formally abandon its  22 28 price target  These actions represent an        attempt by OPEC to enhance profits by institutionalizing drastic oil price        spikes  As a result of these higher prices  OPECs members increased their        profits last year by over  86 billion         Recent reports indicate that some OPEC members  such as        Venezuela  may be willing to support a new target price of between  40  50        per barrel      In        spite of the economic threat created by OPECs market manipulation  the        Administration has continued to adhere to its policy of taking oil off of        the market and placing it in the SPR  This policy  which further tightens        oil markets by taking much needed supplies out of commerce  is slated to        take over 7 million barrels of oil off of the market in March and an        average of 92 000 barrels per day off of the market during the height of        the driving season between April and the end of August  despite the fact        that the SPR is currently over 97 percent full  Instead of exacerbating        the economic burdens OPEC has created for working Americans  we urge you to        counteract the cartels supply cuts and calm the markets by deferring        deliveries of oil to the SPR and releasing oil from the SPR through a swap            Initiating a swap of oil from the SPR to increase the supply of oil is a        proven way to reduce the price of gasoline and heating oil  In the fall of        2000  the Clinton Administration announced a swap of 30 million barrels        over 30 days  causing crude oil prices to quickly fall by over  6 per        barrel and wholesale gasoline prices to fall  0 14 per gallon  Under a        swap  the federal government could decide on a set quantity of oil to        release from the SPR  and accepts bids from private companies for the        rights to that oil  The companies would then bid on how much oil they are        willing to return  in addition to the oil they would receive under the        swap  to the SPR at a later date     An oil        swap would result in a win win situation where gasoline prices are lowered        and long term contributions to the SPR are augmented at no additional cost        to the taxpayer  The SPR is intended to provide relief at times when        working families are struggling to make ends meet  That time is now  The        summer driving months are just around the corner  We ask that you use the        SPR and safeguard Americas economic recovery             Sincerely        Charles        Schumer   Susan        Collins  Barbara        Boxer  Carl        Levin   Barbara        Mikulski
