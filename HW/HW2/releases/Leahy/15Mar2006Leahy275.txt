       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Sunshine Week 2006 And The Assault On   The Public s Right To Know                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy           On Sunshine Week 2006           And The Assault On The Public s Right To            Know            March 15  2006   As we take            stock during the second annual Sunshine            Week  we confront the disturbing reality            that the foundations of our open government            are under direct assault from the first            White House in modern times that is openly            hostile to the publics right to know    The right to            know is a cornerstone of our democracy             Without it  citizens are kept in the dark            about key policy decisions that directly            affect their lives  Without open            government  citizens cannot make informed            choices at the ballot box  Without access            to public documents and a vibrant free            press  officials can make decisions in the            shadows  often in collusion with special            interests  escaping accountability for their            actions  And once eroded  these rights are            hard to win back    The right to            know is nourished by openness and vigorous            congressional oversight of federal agencies             but both are sorely lacking  and government            effectiveness and accountability have been            among the casualties  The disastrous            failure to prepare for and respond to            Hurricane Katrina is only the most recent            example  but a glaring one  Despite            misleading assertions in the storms            horrific aftermath  we now know that the            White House was warned in advance that the            levees could fail in a hurricane  We have            belatedly seen videotapes in which President            Bush was cautioned by FEMA officials of this            great danger     The Freedom of            Information Act  FOIA  empowers the American            people to pry information from their            government that agencies would prefer to            keep locked away  Americans learned more            about Abu Ghraib and conditions at            Guantanamo from FOIA requests than from            oversight by Congress     As we            celebrate FOIAs fourth decade as law  we            also watch its erosion as a target of            attacks such as when the Administration            pushed an overly broad FOIA waiver for the            Department of Homeland Securitys charter             the single biggest rollback of FOIA in its            40 year history     It has been            nearly a decade since Congress has approved            major reforms to the Freedom of Information            Act  Last year during Sunshine Week             Senator Cornyn and I introduced bipartisan            legislation  S 394  to curtail the assault            on FOIA  The Open Government Act contains            more than a dozen substantive provisions             designed to strengthen FOIA and close            loopholes  to help FOIA requestors obtain            timely responses to their requests  to            ensure that agencies have strong incentives            to act on FOIA requests  and to provide FOIA            officials with all of the tools they need to            make sure that our government remains open            and accessible    A second bill            that I introduced with Senator Cornyn last            year  the Faster FOIA Act  S 589  would            specifically address the issue of agency            delay in processing FOIA requests  We            propose to establish a commission to review            the persistent issue of delay and to make            recommendations for reducing impediments to            the efficient processing of requests  This            bill was reported by the Judiciary Committee            and awaits floor action     Our free press            and the consciences of whistleblowers also            serve the publics right to know  We would            not know of the domestic spying program            conducted in secret by the National Security            Agency  with the full approval of the White            House  unless the press had revealed it last            December  The Department of Justice is            stonewalling Congresss efforts to obtain            facts on this program while threatening to            prosecute reporters who disclosed the            illegal program to the public      The Bush            Administration has kept vital facts secret            by silencing scientists and experts  We saw            it with the gagging of NASA scientist James            Hansen  whose conclusions about the dangers            of greenhouse gas emissions and global            warming differed with Administration            policy  This Administration also secretly            let lobbyists from polluting industries            write rules on mercury emissions  overriding            the advice of the EPAs scientists and even            drawing a harsh rebuke from EPAs inspector            general  This tacit war on science             trumping scientific evidence with ideology             has also victimized womens access to the            Plan B pill and cut international family            planning funds which help the poorest of the            poor  even though the evidence is clear that            these funds reduce the numbers of abortions    This kind of            secrecy produces bad policies  as we saw            when the Bush Administration tried to hide            the true cost of its Medicare prescription            drug plan from Congress and the American            people  While they were twisting            congressional arms for votes on the program             political leaders at Medicare told Congress            the price tag was  400 billion  Medicares            own accountants projected the cost to be             500 billion to  600 billion  but one of            those career staff  Richard Foster  was            threatened with being fired if he told            Congress the truth    We saw it            again when the political leadership of the            Justice Department overruled career lawyers            who found that Congressman Tom DeLays Texas            redistricting plan illegally diluted black            and Hispanic voting power  Career attorneys            also found that a Georgia            voter identification law would discriminate            against black voters  The Departments            political leaders dismissed these findings            and quietly approved both plans  We only            learned of these politically motivated            decisions later when the press obtained            documents and made them public    In a situation            that borders on the absurd  the intelligence            agencies have been quietly reclassifying            documents that were open for years  This            program began in 1999 but has exploded under            this Administration  which has reclassified            more than 55 000 pages  Even the Archivist            of the United States said he knew precious            little of the program until it was revealed            by the press     The examples            go on and on  The Bush Administration has            displayed a near total disdain for the free            press and the publics right to know    Sunshine Week            invites an inventory check on tools like the            Freedom of Information Act that make real            the publics right to know  Attacks on            these tools only erode that right  A free             open and accountable democracy is what our            forefathers fought and died for  and it is            the duty of each new generation to protect            this vital heritage and inheritance
