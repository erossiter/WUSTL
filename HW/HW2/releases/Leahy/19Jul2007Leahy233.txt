       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The Higher Education Access Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    The Higher Education Access Act Of 2007    July 19  2007 Mr  President  I wish to express my support for the     Higher Education Access Act of 2007  I applaud Chairman Kennedy and     Ranking Member Enzi for their work on crafting this bill that will widen     access to higher education by providing for increased funding assistance     available to American students for their higher education studies   The need for these improvements by now should be as     clear to the Senate as it is to Americas families  In recent years     average college tuition rates have been rising faster than inflation and     outpacing student financial aid  Skyrocketing tuitions are pricing our     families out of their ability to afford higher education  This trend     not only closes doors to opportunity in the lives of the Nations young     people  it also poses harsh consequences on our country and our     communities  in ways that are evident across our economy  I am pleased     that  in this new Congress  this bill has been brought forward to     reverse the direction of recent budgets that have continued to erode the     Federal Governments support of higher education with deep cuts in the     funding support for colleges and universities   The Federal Government must rise to the challenge     and improve our financial aid programs to ensure that college is an     affordable option for all qualified students  No student should be     thwarted from enrolling and graduating from college because of financial     concerns  This bill accomplishes this goal through need based grant aid     to students by raising the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 next year  and     up to  5 400 by 2011  Because tuition has increased well beyond the rate     of student assistance  students today are graduating with staggering     debt burdens  With the weight of this debt on their backs  recent     college graduates understandably gravitate toward higher paying jobs     that allow them to pay back their loans  Unfortunately  all too often     these jobs are not in the arena of public service or areas that serve     the vital public interests of our communities and of our country  We     need to be doing more to support graduates who want to enter public     service  be it as a child care provider  a doctor or nurse in the public     health field  or a police officer or other type of first responder   I appreciate that the chairman has included strong     provisions in this bill that will forgive the debt of borrowers who     continue in public service careers such as nursing  teaching  or law     enforcement for 10 years  Under this bill  a starting teacher in     Vermont earning less than  30 000  and with debt of  20 000  could have     his or her loan payments capped at fifteen percent  reducing monthly     payments by almost forty percent   The increases for student aid in this bill are paid     for by reducing the subsidies the government provides to lenders  I     believe that increasing student assistance should be our highest     priority in this bill and that this offset is a worthy and sensible     exchange  However  while this bill reduces the subsidies for lenders  I     am pleased that it recognizes the importance of not for profit lenders      by differentiating between the size of cuts intended for for profit and     for non profit lenders  Several states have established not for profit     state agencies to administer financial aid and to provide their     residents and students attending their schools with quality counseling     services and low cost loans  Vermont pioneered this movement by     creating the Vermont Student Assistance Corporation more than 40 years     ago  I do have concerns with the auction proposal     contained within this bill  I am worried that it could potentially     prevent Vermonters from exercising their right to choose where to borrow     money by requiring the Secretary of Education to conduct an auction to     select two lenders that will be permitted to make Parent loans  Bids     will be sealed  invisible to the public and to Congress  and awards will     be made solely on the Secretarys determination of who offers the lowest     cost to the government   We do not want to crowd out the not for profit     agencies from providing PLUS loans to families in their state  I am     hopeful that the chairman and ranking member will be willing to work on     this portion of the bill in order to continue to recognize the important     role of not for profit lenders
