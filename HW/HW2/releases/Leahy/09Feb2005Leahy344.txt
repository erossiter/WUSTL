       Leahy Continues Fight To Expand Guard Healthcare And Retirment Benefits                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Continues Fight             To Expand Guard Healthcare             And Retirement Benefits WASHINGTON  Wednesday              Feb  9   Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and a bipartisan coalition of             lawmakers Wednesday introduced legislation to build on the health care             insurance breakthroughs they have won for the 800 000 men and women of             the National Guard and Reserves in the last two years  and also to             reform Guard retirement benefits so they are more on par with those of             the active duty forces  At a Capitol Hill news             conference  Leahy and his allies unveiled the Guard and Reserve             Readiness and Retention Act of 2005  building on reforms they             successfully advanced and enacted last year that have made more             citizen soldiers eligible for TRICARE  the militarys healthcare             plan  With Leahy were Sens  Lindsey Graham  R S C    Hillary Clinton              D N Y    Mike DeWine  R Ohio   George Allen  R Va    and Reps  Tom             Latham  R Iowa  and Joe Wilson  R S C     We owe these             citizen soldiers and airmen more than just our gratitude  said Leahy              the co chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus  Since 9 11 we are             relying more and more on our Guard and Reserves  Our plan is about             readiness and fairness  It will vastly increase the likelihood that             members of the Guard will be healthy when they report for duty  It is             about fairness for them and for their families  It is time that we             make the investment in the men and women in the reserves on par with             the sacrifice they are making for us  Our Guard has never been more             important to our national security  They are doing the job we are             asking them to do  and then some  We cannot afford to let our Guard             down  In 2003 and 2004  in a             major breakthrough for the Guard  Leahy and a similar coalition of             lawmakers successfully worked to make uninsured members of the Guard             and Reserves eligible for TRICARE and to offer the program to the             Guardsmen  Reservists and their families during and after activation              The new bill would further expand this program to make TRICARE             available to all members of the National Guard and Reserves at a             reasonable monthly premium   The legislation also             continues their previous years efforts to make Reservists and             Guardsmen eligible for retirement benefits before the age of 60 based             on length of service  As the Guard has continued to struggle with low             retention and recruitment rates  Leahy said changes to the retirement             system may encourage soldiers to decide to stay in the Guard and             Reserves   _________________________________________             Remarks Of U S  Senator Patrick Leahy            Introduction Of The Guard And Reserve Readiness Act Of 2005            February 9  2005 Two weeks ago I             attended another send off ceremony in Vermont for more than 300 more             brave members of the Vermont National Guard  who are headed for             service in Iraq  Many of you may have read about that ceremony on the             front page of todays Washington Post  and about the inordinate             contributions and sacrifices that our small state of Vermont has made             in reservist call ups since 9 11  That was not the             first such ceremony I have attended in the last two years  and it will             not be the last  and each one of us on this platform knows the             emotional punch that these send offs pack  These ceremonies are             steeped in feelings of admiration for our soldiers and compassion for             their families  and hovering in the air is the profound sense of duty             and honor and the impending sacrifices of long separation  We look             into the eyes of our departing troops  and into the eyes of their             loved ones  and we tell them that we will do all we can to fully             provide for their needs              That is why we are here  And that is why we have been working so long             and hard  nonstop  to give our National Guard troops and their             families a health insurance system that they deserve   Since 9 11 we             have been relying more and more on our National Guard and Reserves              Just from my own small state of Vermont  we have almost 1200 men and             women in various stages of deployment in the Middle East  Hundreds             are about to embark on a yearlong deployment in Iraq  Members of the             National Guard and Reserve have left their families  their civilian             professions  and their chosen communities to face uncertain dangers  We owe these             citizen soldiers and airmen more than just our gratitude  We owe them             new authorities and new benefits to help them remain as ready as             possible  This strong bipartisan coalition will keep at it until we             achieve our goal for them  Our plan will             vastly increase the likelihood that our service members will be             healthier before they report to duty  A healthier force is a readier             force   The second part             of the bill allows members of the Guard and Reserve to access their             well earned retirement benefits earlier than the current age of 60              which is five years after the age when active duty forces can receive             their retirement pay  There is no justification to deny someone the             benefits they have accrued  Our announcement             today signals a breakthrough in our effort  We have made progress in             the past two years enacting TRICARE reforms based on our Senate             legislation  Now it will be very helpful to a have a companion piece             of legislation in the House of Representatives  It sometimes feels             like we are starting about 50 yards behind the starting line because             we have not had a similar effort on the other side of the Capitol              The work with the House will put us that much closer to our final             goal  As the co chair             of the Senate National Guard Caucus  it is easy to tally the reasons             for this bill  and for the steps we have already achieved  Improved             readiness  Fairness for our National Guard and for their families              It is time that we make the investment in the men and women in the             reserves on par with the sacrifice they are making for us  Our Guard has             never been more important to our national security  They are doing             the job we are asking them to do  and then some  We cannot afford to             let our Guard down
