       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Department Of Justice   Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       Hearing On Department Of Justice Oversight      Witness  Attorney General Gonzales      July 18  2006  Three weeks ago  in  Hamdan  the Supreme       Court held that the President is bound to comply with the rule       of law  Three years ago  in  Hamdi  the Supreme       Court held that war is not a blank check for the President when       it comes to the rights of the Nations citizens  Those are two       remarkable statements coming from the Nations highest court        They are not remarkable for the propositions they state  The       Rule of Law was the basic premise upon which this Republic was       founded 230 years ago  They are remarkable  instead  for the       fact that this Administrations unprecedented record of complete       disregard for the rule of law    coupled with its arrogance and       secrecy    made it necessary to say them at all          Needed Doses Of Constitutional Tonic  The witness before us today has       held two uniquely important roles with respect to the rule of       law  As White House Counsel  it was his sworn duty to advise       the President how to comply with the rule of law  As Attorney       General  he has the further responsibility to lead the Nations       enforcement of the rule of law  On his watch  the Bush Cheney       Administration has repeatedly flouted the laws that limit the       power of the Executive    During the past few years  the       Supreme Court has rendered three landmark constitutional       decisions regarding Executive power  In all three  it ruled       against the President    In  Hamdi  the Court       rejected the Administrations unprecedented claim that an       American citizen can be stripped of the constitutional right to       due process simply on the say so of the President  The Court       held that Mr  Hamdi was entitled to a fair hearing on the       legality of his detention    In  Rasul  the Court       rejected the legal premise upon which the       Guantanamo detention center was built  The Bush Cheney       Administration chose to hold prisoners captured in Afghanistan       on the island of Cuba as a means of avoiding the jurisdiction of       United States courts  The Court held that the writ of habeas       corpus cannot be suspended by housing prisoners off shore   That brings us to last months       decision in Hamdan        The path to that latest setback to the Administration begins       with a memorandum written by todays witness  In January 2002        then White House Counsel Gonzales advised President Bush that he       need not and should not comply with the Geneva Conventions        contrary to the advice of Secretary of State Colin Powell  The       President chose to take Mr  Gonzales advice rather than listen       to General Powell  In       Hamdan  the Court held that the President is bound by       the Geneva Conventions  and that the Presidents military       commissions are illegal  In sum  the Administration is batting       0 for 3 in the Supreme Court    But the result of this series of       blunders is not merely a strike out  With respect to Mr  Hamdi        after nearly three years of incarceration  during which the       Administration insisted that American security would be       seriously prejudiced by even affording him a lawyer  the       Administration set him free in the Middle East   Four years after the       Administration began transporting prisoners to       Guantanamo  that detention center has become an international       embarrassment which everyone from Tony Blair to Colin Powell has       said should be closed immediately   And more than four years after       initiating a military commissions program which Attorney General       Gonzales told us was designed to ensure  swift justice       close to the battlefield  the Administration has charged a total       of 10 people  convicted zero  and is now back at square one   Perhaps the only lesson that this       Administration learns from its mistakes is not to get caught       next time  This Administration is allergic to accountability        whether in the form of judicial review or in the form of       congressional oversight   The attempt to evade habeas review       by holding detainees at Guantanamo is just one of       a series of measures the Administration has taken to shield its       actions from the courts  The Hamdan case addresses       another  In one of his notorious signing statements  issued       after Congress passed the Detainee Treatment Act in 2005  the       President asserted that the Act retroactively stripped the       courts of jurisdiction over pending cases  The Court rejected       this claim and instead followed the plain language of the Act        informed by the legislative history that was actually available       to members of Congress before they voted on the Act   The case of Jose Padilla presents       another example  Three and a half years after detaining Padilla       as an unlawful combatant  and on the eve of Supreme Court       review  the Administration moved to have his case dismissed by       transferring him from military to civilian custody  In a       unanimous opinion  the conservative Fourth Circuit rejected the       Administrations motion  Judge Luttig pointedly noted that the       motion appeared to be an attempt to evade Supreme Court review       and that it had damaged the governments credibility    Warantless       Wiretapping  Meanwhile  with respect to its       secret domestic wiretapping program  the Administration has for       nearly five years evaded even the limited judicial review       afforded by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act       In fact  in just the few months since the public and       Congress first learned of the NSAs warrantless wiretapping       program  the Justice Department has asserted the state secrets       privilege in at least 19 different court cases       challenging that program       Last week we learned that in closed door negotiations       with Senator Specter  the Administration made a conditional       offer to submit one of its domestic spying programs to secret       review by a single FISA court judge  As I understand the       Administrations offer  Congress must first agree to completely       gut FISA and to deprive American citizens of the right to       challenge domestic wiretapping in open court   B       nothing more than ratification of the Administrations actions       after the fact   So when the President tells the       Chairman of this Committee that he is agreeable to judicial       review of that program and his other actions  I hope that you       understand why some of us are a bit wary    We should reject the       Administrations so called  compromise       and instead demand that it submit to the judicial review that       FISA already requires  But more than that  we in Congress have       a responsibility not just to punt to the courts  but to do our       job of holding the Administration accountable  Congressional       oversight is the ultimate democratic antidote to Executive       over reaching  Oversight makes government more accountable and       more effective     Congresss       Oversight Duty  It is time for Congress to fulfill       its constitutional duty by acting as a real check on the       Executive branch  A Congress that defers to the President and       ratifies his continuing illegal actions is no better than a       President who seeks to immunize or ignore illegal conduct of his       subordinates  Congress needs to act and truly be an independent       branch of the Government  A start is real oversight   For too many months the       Department of Justice has shown blatant disregard for this       Committee and its oversight role by dispatching junior deputies        unauthorized or unable to answer our questions  Instead of       providing us with information  these subordinates were sent to       parrot the Administrations talking points  This is not an       Administration that recognizes or learns from its mistakes  The       Bush Cheney Administration does not engage in soul searching        Instead  it blithely maintains  as its witness told us last       week  that the       President is always right   Recently  the Republican chair of       the House Intelligence Committee complained that the       Administration has breached its responsibility to keep his       Committee informed of ongoing intelligence operations  Just       last week  the New York       Times reported that the Republican chair of a House       Financial services subcommittee on oversight accused the       Administration of being too secretive and failing to adequately       inform Congress about the Treasury Departments questionable       bank records program  The Republican chair of the House       Judiciary Committee described the Attorney Generals testimony       as stonewalling        If only Congress had insisted all along on truly effective       oversight  all Americans would be better off    The cost to American liberty  our       standing in the world  and to the security of our soldiers and       citizens is staggering   C       even more than the half a trillion dollar cost of the war in       Iraq  Instead of coming to this Committee to get authority       under the law to gather intelligence to advance the war on       terror  the Administration chose to simply snub Congress        Instead of coming to Congress to create a credible and effective       justice system for the war on terror  this Administration chose       to disregard congressional power under the Constitution to      make Rules concerning       Captures on Land and Water       and to cobble together an illegal system for military       tribunals    The result has been the dangerous       specter of illegal Government surveillance at home and a       military tribunal system which has undermined our standing in       the world  jeopardized our troops abroad and compromised our       moral values  The Supreme Courts repudiation of the Presidents       military tribunals has given our system of checks and balances a       constitutional tonic that was sorely needed     Decline In       Anti Crime Support  Further  turning to our domestic       situation  despite great gains in the war on crime during the       1990s  this President  Attorney General and the       Republican controlled Congress have cut more than  2 billion in       funding for state and local law enforcement since 2001  It may       not be coincidental that we are now witnesses a dramatic rise in       violent crime  Last year alone  violent crime increased at the       fastest rate in 15 years  Just as we see a world made less safe       by a flawed foreign policy  when we look at our domestic       situation we see a nation with rising crime  more at risk and       more divided  Last week  for example  following a dramatic wave       of homicides  D C  Police Chief Charles Ramsey declared a crime       emergency in the Nations Capital  There have even been       expressions of deep concern about crime on the National Mall       B       just a short walk from where we are today    after serious crime       incidents in recent weeks  directed at tourists  Many of us       recall the Bush Administrations firing of former Park Service       Chief of Police Teresa C  Chambers three years ago  when she       dared to publicly warn Congress and the American people that        quote  Theres not       enough of us to go around to protect those green spaces anymore        a reference to the Bush Administrations cuts in the anti crime       budget for the Park Police  Her warnings seem particularly       prescient today  and her firing by the White House seems all the       shabbier    Todays oversight hearing provides       another new start for Congress to stop rubber stamping the       questionable policies of this Administration and to finally say       enough is enough  By acting unilaterally  in secret  and in       violation of the laws passed by Congress  this Administration       has acted as if it were above the law for far too long  I hope       all Members of this Committee  Republican and Democrats alike        will join me to restore the constitutional checks and balances       that have been systematically eroded by this Administration  and       I hope that we can begin that process today    At the beginning of my remarks  I       quoted the words of President Reagans first Supreme Court       appointee  Justice Sandra Day OConnor  who wrote in  Hamdi that war is       not a blank check for the executive  Last month in  Hamdan  President       Reagans last Supreme Court appointee  Justice Anthony Kennedy        wrote that concentration of power in the Executive  puts personal       liberty in peril of arbitrary action by officials  an incursion       the Constitutions three part system is designed to avoid       Congressional oversight is essential to that three part       system  Its restoration is long overdue     The Peoples       Attorney  Not The Presidents  During the confirmation hearings       on his nomination to be Attorney General  several members of the       Committee emphasized that in his new position  Judge Gonzales       would no longer be the Presidents attorney  but the peoples       attorney  The importance of the person who serves as our top       law enforcement officer to be able to act and advise       independently has come into even sharper relief over the last       year  and especially with these Supreme Court decisions     The last time the Attorney General       appeared before this Committee  he was not very responsive  I       hope he will not repeat that performance today  I hope that he       will answer our questions  I hope he will admit mistakes and we       can join together in meaningful oversight and genuine       accountability  I hope today is the beginning of real oversight       activity for this Committee and an open exchange of information       from the Administration  The American people  expect    and       deserve    no less
