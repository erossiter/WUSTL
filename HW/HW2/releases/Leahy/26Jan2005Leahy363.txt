       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Alberto Gonzales   To Be AG Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee        Executive Business Meeting On The Nomination        Of Alberto R  Gonzales        To Be Attorney General Of The United States        January 26  2005   An Accountability        Deficit  When this nomination was first announced  I        was hopeful  I noted at the time that I like and respect Judge Gonzales         I met with him soon after his designation and wrote to him in advance of        the hearing regarding fundamental concerns  I listened carefully to him        during our confirmation hearing   The road he has traveled from being a        12 year old boy selling soft drinks at football games  all the way to the        State House in   Texas and to the White House  is a tribute to        him and to his family  In spite of our disagreements on issues  I have        sought to maintain a cordial personal working relationship with Judge        Gonzales during his years as President Bushs counsel     It saddened me to tell Judge Gonzales         yesterday that I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm his         nomination    My reasons for voting against this nomination        arise from the need for accountability and derive from the nominees        involvement in the formulation of a number of policies that have tarnished        our countrys moral leadership in the world and put our soldiers and        citizens at greater risk  Anyone who has served in the military  or who        has a son or daughter who served  knows that these actions violate        everything that our soldiers are taught and everything they stand for         When President Bush announced this nomination he said that he chose Judge        Gonzales because of his sound judgment and role in shaping the        Administrations policies in the war on terrorism  Based on the glimpses        of secret policy formulations and legal rationales that have come to light         I believe his judgments not to have been sound  Several of this        Administrations legal policies have been exceedingly harmful to our        national interests    As Attorney General  the nominees judgment        about our laws would be of enormous consequence  Judge Gonzales has        championed policies that are in fundamental conflict with decades of our        laws  sound military practice  international law and human rights  He        remained silent for almost two years about a deeply flawed legalistic        interpretation of our nations torture statute  He also accepted a        patently erroneous interpretation of the torture convention and apparently        believes that the President  when acting as Commander in Chief  is above        the law   When I asked Judge Gonzales if he agreed with        the Bybee        memos very narrow reading of the law  he replied  I dont recall today        whether or not I was in agreement with all of the analysis  but I don t        have a disagreement with the conclusions then reached by the Department         This is the memo which concludes that physical pain amounting to torture        must be equivalent in intensity to the pain accompanying serious physical        injury  such as organ failure  impairment of bodily function  or even        death  Even the Justice Department repudiated this legal memorandum  once        it became public    Under his restrictive redefinition such        practices as threatening a prisoner with a firearm in a mock execution         waterboarding a person to make him experience the suffocating effects of        drowning  and  as Senator Kennedy noted  perhaps even cutting off a        persons fingers one joint at a time would not amount to torture        But surely we consider these practices torture when done to        a member of the   U S  military or to an American citizen    Perhaps most disturbing of all as a legal         matter is the nominees positing of the President as above the law          Nothing is more fundamental about our constitutional democracy than our         basic notion that no one is above the law  Yet at his June 2004 press         conference and again in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee he         indicated that he views the President to have the power to override our         law and  apparently  to immunize others to perform what would otherwise be unlawful acts  This is         about as extreme a view of Executive power as I have ever heard  I         believe it is not only dead wrong as a constitutional matter but extremely         dangerous  The rule of law applies to the President  even this         President    Ironically  it was the Administration of this        Presidents father that urged the Senate to ratify the torture convention         It did so to make clear that the   United States condemns torture and to protect        Americans from this barbaric practice  But if the U S  President does not        feel bound by the torture convention  then neither will other foreign        leaders    I had hoped that Judge Gonzales would see         these confirmation hearings as an opportunity to demonstrate a new openness  to provide a         fuller examination of Administration policies and to back away from the         Administrations extreme views of virtually limitless Executive power  I         had hoped that during the course of the hearing he would demonstrate the         ability to distinguish between his loyalties as President Bushs counsel         and the responsibility of the Attorney General of the   United States to represent the American         people  I had even hoped that he would make a credible commitment to work         with us to ensure that meaningful oversight and accountability  which have         been thwarted for years  would resume their proper role in our system of         checks and balances  I was greatly disappointed    Ultimately  the Attorney Generals duty is         to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law  not to work to circumvent         it  Both the President and the nation are best served by an Attorney         General who gives sound legal advice and takes responsible action  without         regard to political considerations  not one who develops legalistic         loopholes to serve the ends of a particular Administration  The Attorney         General appointed by the Presidents father remarked  Nothing would be         so destructive to the rule of law as to permit purely political         considerations to overrun sound legal judgment  Judge Gonzales         demonstrates a lack of independence from the President  something that we         cannot have in the chief law enforcement officer in the nation  He cannot         interpret our laws to mean whatever the President wants them to mean  To         do so would deny us the constitutional protections upon which this nation         was founded  The Attorney General is supposed to represent all of the         American people  not just one of them   At a time when the Republican Party has taken        control of all branches of the Federal Government and Republican majorities        in the House and Senate have chosen not to provide the kind of oversight        needed to balance assertions of Government authority  the Attorney        Generals role is all the more critical   We have seen what happens when the rule of        law plays second fiddle to the Presidents political agenda  This        Administration has taken one untenable legal position after another        regarding the rule of law in the war against terror  It will not admit to        making mistakes  It takes action only after mistakes are made public and        become politically indefensible  Given the Republican leadership in        Congress  the Federal courts have provided what little check there has been        on this Presidents claims of unfettered Executive power     Judge Gonzales nomination initially seemed        like a breath of fresh air  I have said how much I personally like Judge        Gonzales  But as I told the nominee when we met within days of the        announcement of his nomination  these confirmation proceedings matter          They matter because it is the responsibility        of this Committee to explore for the Senate and the American people his        judgment and actions in connection with the tragic legal and policy changes        formulated in secret by this Administration and still cloaked from        congressional oversight and public scrutiny    Americas troops and citizens are at greater        risk because of those actions and the terrible repercussions throughout so        much of the world  Americas moral standing and leadership have been        undercut  The searing photographs from Abu Ghraib have made it harder to        create and maintain the alliances we need to prevail against the vicious        terrorists who threaten us  including those who struck America nine months        into this Presidents first term  Those abuses serve as recruiting posters        for the terrorists    The Army Field Manual reflects our nations         long held policies toward prisoners  It says  The goal of any         interrogation is to obtain reliable information in a lawful manner           U S  policy expressly prohibit s  acts of         violence or intimidation  including physical or mental torture  threats          insults  or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or to aid         interrogation           The Field Manual continues  The use of torture is a poor technique that         yields unreliable results  may damage subsequent collection efforts  and         can induce the source to say what he thinks the interrogator wants to         hear        It also may place U S  and allied personnel in enemy hands at         greater risk    This is with good reason and in the finest         tradition of our Armed Forces  That tradition began when General George         Washington ordered the Continental Army to treat British and Hessian         prisoners decently after the bloody battle of   Trenton  That is the tradition to which         Senators John McCain and Lindsay Graham have spoken so forcefully    Yet senior officials in the Bush White         House  Ashcroft Justice Department and Rumsfeld Pentagon set in motion a         systematic effort to circumvent  distort and even ignore our laws          policies and agreements on torture and the treatment of prisoners     What does this all mean in the real world         Why should we be concerned about this  Yesterdays Washington Post        provided a vivid  sickening and depressing account of why this matters  We        need to look no further than to the Iraqi security forces we are trying to        train    Let me quote  Twenty months after Saddam        Husseins government was toppled and its torture chambers unlocked  Iraqis        are being routinely beaten  hung by their wrists and shocked with electric        wires   This morning  a column by Anne Applebaum gave        another account from an Iraqi prisoner  We were blindfolded and our hands        were tied behind our backs       they poured cold water over me and applied        electric shocks to my genitals  I was beaten by several people with cables        on my arms and backs   I ask my colleagues  what do American        officials say with a straight face to Iraqi security forces who are        responsible for these acts  Use more humane handcuffs when hanging someone        from the ceiling  Please make sure organ failure doesnt result from any        of these practices   The fact is we can say anything  and we can        say nothing  and the result is the same  Say anything  and we now will be        mocked as hypocrites  But to say nothing is to concede the heart and the        soul of what we stand for as a nation  We need to climb our way back to        the moral high ground that has distinguished and dignified our great        country   That is why this matters    At his recent inaugural address President        Bush spoke eloquent words about the   United States historic support for freedom         To be true to that vision  we need a Government that leads the way in        upholding human rights not one secretly developing legalistic        rationalizations for circumventing them  To reclaim our moral leadership        in the world  to become a true messenger of hope instead of a source of        resentment  we need to acknowledge wrongdoing and show accountability for        mistakes that this Administration has made       We have seen departures from our countrys        honorable traditions  practices and established law in the use of torture         originating at the top ranks of authority  and emerging at the bottom  At        the bottom of the chain of command  we have seen a few courts martial         At the top  we have seen medal ceremonies  pats on the back and        promotions    Between these two dissonant images there is a        growing accountability gap  and the Administrations handling of this        confirmation hearing  which could have helped to narrow the gap  has served        to widen it   I believe in redemption in public life  as in        spiritual life  But to get to redemption  first there has to be        accountability  This Administration has a large and growing accountability        deficit  and as this confirmation process draws to a close  I must conclude        that the stonewalling continues  and that Judge Gonzales  who could have        become a part of the solution  remains a part of the problem  I am        saddened by the choices that he and others have made in refusing to choose        candor    Now more than ever  the country needs a        person to be Attorney General who will serve all Americans  There is much        that has gone wrong that this Administration has stubbornly refused to        admit or correct  For this democratic republic to work  we need greater        openness and accountability  It is with those critical considerations in        mind that I must vote against this confirmation
