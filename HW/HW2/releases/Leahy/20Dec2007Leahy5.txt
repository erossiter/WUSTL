       Leahy  Passport Requirement At The Northern Border Will Be Nixed Until   2009 At The Earliest                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Passport Requirement At The     Northern Border    Will Be Nixed Until 2009 At The Earliest        Final Budget Bill Includes Leahy     Mandate    Delaying WHTI Rules Until June 2009  Leahy Also Secures  33 M  For Border     Improvements At Derby Line WASHINGTON  Thursday  Dec  20   Legislation     authored by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   to prevent the Bush     Administration from requiring passports at the Northern Border and other     U S  checkpoints next year now has cleared Congress as part of a     multi agency budget bill  The President is expected to sign the bill      despite the Bush Administrations continuing opposition to the Leahy     provisions   Leahy also secured  33 million in the budget bill     for border crossing improvements at Derby Line  Vt   one of New     Englands busiest cargo points of entry  Leahy two years ago was the first in Congress to     blow the whistle on problems in the Administrations plans to implement     the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  and has led efforts to     fix them  A senior member of the Appropriations Committee  Leahy      joined by Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska   this summer added his latest     legislation to the Senates version of the annual budget bill for the     Department of Homeland Security  A day later the House also passed it     in a strong bipartisan vote  The Leahy Stevens amendment  which will     become law when the President signs the budget bill  delays     implementation of the land crossing phase of WHTI until June 2009 and     lays down seven conditions addressing the programs most serious     problems  Im glad that Vermonters now will have one less     thing to worry about for awhile  Leahy said  This buys breathing room     to try to find better and more sensible answers for Northern Border     security  The passport requirement is the wrong answer to the wrong     question  It creates major hassles for law abiding citizens and     communities all across the longest peaceful border in the world  It     adds nothing to our security while costing Vermont and our national     economy billions in lost commerce  Instead  for only a fraction of that     expense  we could and should be beefing up our intelligence and working     with Canada to seek out potential terrorists long before they even get     near our borders  He continued  Muddled thinking  poor planning and     administrative hubris have plagued this program from the beginning      They have rushed to implement passport checks before the necessary     technology  infrastructure and training are in place at our border     stations  Thats a guarantee for     long lines and lengthy delays  We saw what happened earlier this year     when they started requiring passports for airline flights  touching off     massive passport processing backlogs    and that involved only about a     tenth of the population that will be affected by the next phase  at our     land borders  Leahy noted that instead of accepting this delay     and using it to get kinks out of the WHTI program  the Administration     now wants to start requiring birth certificates at the border next     month  Im challenging them on that  too  Leahy on Wednesday wrote     to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff  criticizing the birth certificate     requirement and asking Chertoff to cite his authority for imposing it       Leahy Thursday also announced success in securing      33 million to build a new I 91 port of entry in Derby Line  Vt   to     replace that checkpoints undersized and insufficient facilities  Those     funds will be combined with  6 5 million that Leahy and former Senator     Jim Jeffords  I Vt   secured earlier  which the State of Vermont will     use in upgrading I 91 leading to the improved port of entry  This will     give us better facilities to speed things up at the Derby Line     crossing  he said  Leahy in October held a Senate Judiciary Committee     hearing on Northern Border issues  including WHTIs implications for     Vermont  in Newport  Vt             Leahys     Congressional Record statement on the WHTI provisions follows    Statement Of Sen  Patrick     Leahy  D Vt      On The Leahy Stevens WHTI Provision In The Omnibus    December 18  2007 MR  LEAHY  Mr      President  one important issue I wish to highlight today is an     international border issue with our friendly neighbors in Canada      Mexico  and the Caribbean that could have severe implications for the     social and economic ways of life for communities all across our country       In the wake of the     September 11 terrorist attacks  Congress has enacted a number of new     border security measures  all with the expressed goal of preventing     another terrorist incident  In this bill  we have worked hard to     provide the needed resources for these programs in a fair and balanced     manner  Post 9 11  everyone recognizes that there are potential threats     and security needs  but we must implement them sensibly and     intelligently   Over the past few years      I have heard from many Vermonters about problems they have encountered     at U S  border crossings  from long traffic backups to invasive     searches and questioning to inadequate communication from federal     authorities about new facilities and procedures  Such a top down     approach does not work well in interwoven communities along the border      where people cross daily from one side to the other for jobs  shopping      and cultural events  We have hardened security around this Capitol and     the White House and built fences near San Diego  But those procedures     do not work on Canusa Avenue in Beebe Plain  a two lane road where one     side of the street is the Vermont and the other side is Quebec  or at     the Haskell Free Library and Opera House  which straddles the     international border in Derby Line  Vermont  and Stanstead  Quebec   That is why I am pleased     that this bill includes a much needed delay for full implementation of     the so called Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  which will require     individuals from the United States  Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean to     present passports or other documents proving citizenship before entering     the United States  I was pleased to join with Senator Stevens and many     other colleagues from both bodies in pushing for inclusion of this     important provision because it is clear that the Department of Homeland     Security and the Department of State are not ready for a full rollout of     the new passport checks next summer   Muddled thinking  poor     planning  and administrative hubris have plagued implementation of the     Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  The Department of Homeland     Security has rushed to implement the new passport checks before the     necessary technology  infrastructure and training are in place at our     border stations  If these critical features of the deployment are not     in place when the new program starts  we will see severe delays at our     border and law abiding citizens from the United States  Canada  Mexico      and the Caribbean will have great difficulty moving between our     countries  Most importantly  a hasty implementation will undermine the     intended goals of the program  The massive backlogs in     processing passport applications we saw earlier this year when the     Departments of Homeland Security and State started to require passports     for air travel is just a taste of the chaos that is likely when they     start enforcing citizenship checks at our nations land and sea borders     in January  There is another train wreck on the horizon if these     federal agencies continue pushing forward with full implementation of     the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative before the necessary policies     and procedures are in place to handle the surge in applications and the     lengthy border crossing delays that are sure to come   I appreciate the     recognition by this Congress that premature implementation will     recklessly risk the travel plans of millions of Americans and the     economies of scores of U S  states and communities  The Departments of     Homeland Security and State have shown that they need more time to     establish a set of rules and procedures that will do more than just shut     our borders down to legitimate travel and trade
