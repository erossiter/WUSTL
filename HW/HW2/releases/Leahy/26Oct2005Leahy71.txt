       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Elections In Haiti                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Elections In Haiti     October 26  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  over a year and a half has passed since President      Aristides departure from Haiti  Since then  the country has been      run by a weak and largely ineffectual interim government of      technocrats with little if any political experience  The results      have been disappointing  characterized by widespread political      violence  human rights violations and economic stagnation  It is in this      context of insecurity and desperation that Haiti is preparing for      national elections  and the question must be asked if it is possible      to hold free and fair elections in this climate      Or  alternatively  should they be      postponed until more favorable conditions exist  The      interim government of Prime Minister Gerard Latortue has failed to      deliver stability and economic progress and  for the fourth time      this year  has postponed the elections  Presently  they are planned      for December 15  but there is widespread concern that if held they      will be anything but inclusive or fair   To begin with       the Haitian people are largely ignorant about the electoral process      and have no faith that it will make any difference in their lives       Out of a total of 4 5 million eligible voters only an estimated      870 000 have registered  with many supporters of the Lavalas Party       a large portion of the electorate  threatening to boycott  I am      told that voter registration stations have been placed in less than      500 locations  a fraction of what was done in previous years   Haitians are      despairing over the lack of jobs and government services  and       conversely  the prevalence of crime  As the poorest country in the      Western Hemisphere  four out of five Haitians live on less than  2 a      day and nearly half of the children are malnourished  In the last      year  there have been almost 800 killings  and kidnappings by armed      gangs have become endemic  Only recently  after a shaky start  the      United Nations Stabilization Mission  MINUSTAH  has been making      progress in preventing even greater violence  But the security      situation remains precarious       Equally troubling is our own governments seeming indifference to      the deteriorating situation in Haiti  Several weeks ago  Secretary      of State Rice flew into Port au Prince for a five hour visit that      amounted to little more than a photo op  If anything  it only      served to remind the few Haitians who were aware of her visit of how      little attention we have paid to Haiti since the overthrow of      President Aristide  The      Haitian Constitution states that a new government is to take office      by February 7  2006  Obviously  that would be desirable  But the      stakes are too great for Haiti and for this hemisphere to be bound      by an arbitrary date if there is a significant risk that the      elections will be seen as divisive or unfair  I can not assess that      risk myself  but I am concerned as I know many people are including      Vermonters who have followed this situation closely   The      Haitian government  the United Nations  the United States  France      and other countries in the region need to seriously consider the      pros and cons of going forward in December  versus taking a few more      months to try to improve the security situation and complete the      registration process and other preparations  Elections that are not      seen as legitimate by a large portion of the electorate  or that are      conducted in a climate of fear and intimidation  could unleash a      violent backlash with far reaching consequences  The      next few weeks are critical  Significant logistical  political  and      security obstacles need to be overcome if Haiti is to have elections      with any semblance of credibility  There are few options left for a      country that is already teetering on the brink of failure and cannot      afford to lose much more  We must keep the best interests of the      Haitian people in mind and do everything possible to help create the      conditions necessary for Haiti to take the next step toward      democratic stability
