       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On S J  Res  12                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On S J  Res  12      Executive Business Meeting  June 15  2006      Today we have before us the second      proposed constitutional amendment to be considered by this      Committee in the last two months  As the Republican      leadership continues to schedule political events as a run up to      the November election  they continue to mistreat our      Constitution as if it were a bulletin board on which to hang      political posters or bumper stickers   The Constitution is too important to      be used for partisan political purposes  and so is the American      flag     Our Constitution guarantees our      rights and freedoms  The Bill of Rights  the first 10      amendments to the Constitution  were adopted to ensure limits on      the Government and to protect the liberties of Americans  The      First Amendment was expressly designed to protect our freedom of      religion and speech  One of the defining characteristics of      Americans is our freedom to think independently and to express      ourselves freely  It is fundamental to who we are as      individuals and as a nation  Vermont did not and      would not become a State until 1791  the year the Bill of Rights      was ratified  The proposed amendment would be the first time in      American history that we would cut back on our First Amendment      constitutional freedoms     To propose a constitutional      amendment two thirds of each House of Congress must deem it      necessary  As congressional Republicans have returned time and      again to use constitutional amendments as election year rallying      cries to excite the passions of voters  those of us who honor      our oath of office to support and defend the Constitution of      the United States are cast in the unpopular role of seeking to      conserve the Constitution and constitutional principles in the      face of demagogic proposals     Several years ago a bipartisan      group was formed to inject some reason into these debates  The      Constitution Project has worked long and hard to develop      guidelines for when constitutional amendments are appropriate       They have noted  The founders created a constitution that is      difficult to amend  thus insuring a stable constitutional      structure  In The Federalist No  47  James Madison highlighted      this very point  He argued that the Constitution should only be      altered on great and extraordinary occasions      How  given this constitutional      standard for an amendment  that it be necessary  and given      Madisons guidance that the Constitution only be altered on      great and extraordinary occasions  can any Senator who values      individual liberty  vote to amend the Constitution and the First      Amendment for the first time in our history to lessen our      individual freedoms  Proponents have not shown that this      proposal meets those sensible guidelines  nor could they  There      is no constitutional crisis or emergency that requires this      constitutional amendment  There is not even a real problem       Rather  this is regrettably about stirring up political      passions     This raises  again  the question      why this is the Republican leaderships priority in the face of      an unfinished agenda of legislative matters that do concern      Americans ranging from rising gas prices and health care costs      to the ongoing violence in Iraq to homeland      security  While the news articles and editorials characterizing      this effort as crassly political are too numerous to include in      the record  I do ask consent to include Norman Ornsteins column      from the June 7 Roll Call      in the record  Among the matters on which the Senate could be      making progress  as Mr  Ornstein points out  is ensuring fair      and effective voting in the upcoming election     The amendment we consider today      would artificially create division among the American people       and the timing of this debate    squarely in the middle of an      election year  with a markup between Flag Day and the fourth of      July  demonstrates  again  that the Constitution is being      misused for partisan purposes  The Constitution deserves our      respect  vigilant protection and in the words or our Senate oath      our support  We on this Committee have a special duty to      defend it  The Constitution is not a blog for venting political      opinions  curry favoring with voters or trying to bump up      sagging poll numbers     Cynicism and Symbolic Patriotism        The flag is an important symbol of      all that makes America great  But the cynical use      of symbolic politics in an election year will not address the      very real needs of veterans and other Americans that are being      left unmet by this Administration and the Republican Congress    We just witnessed a similar      escapade when the Republican leadership of the Senate devoted      most of a recent week to another divisive constitutional      amendment intended not to pass but to inflame  We saw the same      kind of manipulation in the 2004 election cycle when the      Presidents reelection campaign ran television ads exploiting      the September 11 attacks for political advantage  There was an      immediate outcry of disgust from victims families and  New York City firefighters who had believed the President      when he said that he had no ambition whatsoever to use 9 11 or      national security as a political issue  An organization of      victims and firefighters called for the campaign to stop running      the ads  but the President refused to do so     Combat Veterans Reminder Of      Flags Meaning    I know that many veterans support      the flag desecration amendment and I respect their views  We      must not forget though that there also are many veterans who      oppose it  I appeared with a number of distinguished veterans      on Flag Day who spoke about their dedication to the principles      that make this country great and for which they fought and      sacrificed  Those principles include our precious freedoms      under the First Amendment  These veterans of      World War II  Vietnam  Korea  the First Gulf War and Iraq made      clear that they fought for what the flag stands for  not just      the symbol itself     Former Senator John Glenn  a      combat veteran  wrote  The flag is the Nations most powerful      and emotional symbol  It is our most sacred symbol  And it is      our most revered symbol  But it is a symbol  It symbolizes the      freedoms that we have in this country  but it is not the      freedoms themselves     Former Senator Bob Kerrey wrote      today in a piece in The      Washington Post  Real patriotism cannot be      coerced  I ask that a copy of his column be included in the      record  He is known to some as a member of the 9 11 Commission       to others as a former Senator  to others as the President of the     New School  But before all that he was a      decorated combat veteran and a recipient of the Congressional      Medal of Honor  our highest award for bravery     A few years ago we heard from      another outstanding American in opposition to this proposed      amendment  He was a General who had headed the Joint Chiefs of      Staff and later served as President Bushs first Secretary of      State  Colin Powell wrote this to me in May 1999    We are rightfully outraged when      anyone attacks or desecrates our flag  Few Americans do such      things and when they do they are subject to the rightful      condemnation of their fellow citizens  They may be destroying a      piece of cloth  but they do no damage to our system of freedom      which tolerates such desecration     I understand how strongly so many      of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag  I feel      the same sense of outrage  But I step back from amending the      Constitution to relieve that outrage  The First Amendment      exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies      not just to that with which we agree or disagree  but also that      which we find outrageous     I would not amend that great      shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants  The flag will      still be flying proudly long after they have slunk away    Like General Powell  I am deeply      offended when anyone desecrates our flag but I recognize that      any protest or statement these individuals are trying to make is      protected by the First Amendment     In every hamlet and city and on      every rural route in America  you can see our flag      being flown with pride  Americans in overwhelming numbers are      honoring our flag  not defacing it     There are times individuals deface      the flag or violate the rules for its care without intending to      offend  For example  President Bush was captured on film      signing a hand held flag at a campaign rally in the summer of      2004  Appropriate or not  these acts are protected by our      Constitution and they are not punishable by Congress    A Change That Limits Rights   Flag desecration is a despicable      and reprehensible act  But the true question before us is not      whether we agree with that    all of us on this Committee agree      that it is contemptible  Instead  the issue before us is      whether we should amend the Constitution of the      United States with all the risks that entails and whether  for      the first time in our history  we should narrow the precious      freedoms ensured by the First Amendment  Should we amend the      First Amendment so that the government can prosecute the handful      of individuals who show contempt for the flag  Such a      monumental step is unwarranted and unwise     Justice Brennan wrote  We can      imagine no more appropriate response to burning a flag than      waving one s own  That is exactly how the American people      respond  a point demonstrated by the innate patriotism of      Americans in response to events of the past years      Patriotism Does Not Come By Decree   Immediately after September 11th       Americans everywhere began to fly flags outside their homes and      businesses  to wear flag pins on their lapels  and to put flag      stickers on their cars  This surge in patriotism made American      flags such a hot commodity that several major flag manufacturers      could not keep flags stocked on store shelves  Within one week      of those attacks demand for American flags was 20 times higher      than was typical for that time of year  according to the      National Flag Foundation in Pittsburgh  During      that same week Wal Mart sold 450 000 flags  Within days of the      terrorist attacks K Mart sold 200 000 flags     This outpouring of patriotism was      spontaneous and it was the sum total of millions of individual      Americans acting on their own not under Government decree  The      Government did not order Americans to buy and fly the American      flag     Following the very      real attacks on 9 11  Americans embraced the flag like never      before  proudly displaying flags and flag symbols as a sign of      unity and strength in the wake of those horrible acts against      our nation  People around the world grieved for us  cared for      us  and joined with us to fight terrorism  Over time  missteps      and arrogance by the Bush Cheney Administration have alienated      much of the world  Still  Americans of all political      persuasions have not needed a law to tell them how precious our      freedoms are or how to honor the Stars and Stripes      Supporters of this constitutional      amendment seem to believe that Americans need a lesson in how to      respect the flag and that they need rules punishable by law to      enforce that lesson  I strongly disagree and the American      people have already proven them wrong  The American people do      not need a lesson in cherishing and honoring our flag and the      Republic for which it stands  That may be necessary in Saddam      Husseins Iraq or in Stalins Soviet Union or in      Castros Cuba  but not in America     As Senator Kerrey has said       patriotismmust be a voluntary  unselfish  brave act to      sacrifice for others  Speaking specifically of the act of      flag burning  he added  Patriotism calls upon us to be brave      enough to endure and withstand such acts     Some may find it more comfortable      to silence dissenting voices  but coerced silence can only      create resentment  disrespect  and disunity  In      America  you do not stamp out a bad idea by repressing it  You      stamp it out with a better idea     My better idea is to fly the flag       not because the law tells me to  not because there is something      that says this is what I have to do to show respect  I proudly      fly the flag at my farm in Vermont because  as an      American  it is what I choose to do  The extraordinary display      of patriotism we have witnessed in recent years is evidence that      the American people do not need laws and penalties to cherish      the flag that we all love    The Freedom For Which It Stands   Our flag is a cherished symbol       Even more important than the flag itself are the freedoms for      which it stands  including the freedom to express unpopular      speech or ideas    even extremely unpopular ideas      Freedom of speech and of the press      is one of the magnificent bequests of earlier Americans to all      the generations that follow  These rights are a fragile thing       needing nurturing and protection by each new generation  The      erosion of freedom can easily come when lawmakers succumb to the      temptation to pander to shifting public passions at the expense      of the publics everlasting interest in preserving freedom  In      any session of Congress you do not have to look far to see this      dynamic at work  It may not be politically popular to defend      against erosive efforts like this but generations of Americans      to come will thank us if we leave for them the same First      Amendment that we ourselves inherited and so dearly treasure    Veterans Priorities Ignored   Now some are seeking      to turn the flag into a partisan political weapon and the      Constitution into a billboard for political slogans  for      partisan gain  That is wrong  I wish the Senate would       instead  use its time to discuss and solve the real problems      that real Americans are facing right now  instead of trying to      stir public passions for political ends     This is another transparent effort      to seek partisan advantage in the run up to the November      elections  I know that in election years some Republicans love      to wrap themselves in the flag amendment  I remember when the      Presidents father was running for President in 1988 by visiting      a flag factory  If I recall correctly  the last time the      Committee voted on this proposal to amend the Constitution was      the last election year  and the Senate last voted on it in the      fateful presidential election year of 2000  This sudden flurry      of constitutional amendments in the Senate is enough to make a      cynic ask whether gay marriage and flag burning only reach the      level of national crisis in even numbered years    I respectfully suggest that in the      time left to us in the Senate this year  our time would be      better spent working to improve veterans health care services      and protecting veterans privacy  We have just witnessed the      largest theft of private information from the Government ever       the loss of information on more than 26 5 million American      veterans  including more than 2 million who are in active      service  nearly 80 percent of our active duty force and a large      percentage of our National Guard and the Reserve      Let me quote what a spokeswoman      for the American Legion said recently  Our armed forces      personnel have enough on their plates with fighting the global      war on terror  let alone having to worry about theft identity      while deployed overseas  A spokesman for the VFW said  This      confirms the VFW s worst fear from day one The loss of data      encompasses every single person who did wear the uniform and      does wear the uniform today    What is the Administration going      to say to these active duty troops Those of you on the      battlefield in Iraq  when you get back in about a year  if you      get back alive  we have an 800 number you can call to find out      if somebody has stolen your identity    Because of the recklessness of the      Bush Cheney Administrations Department of Veterans Affairs  our      veterans and our active duty service members are now worried      whether their personal information is being sold on the black      market or available to foreign intelligence services or      terrorists  That adds up to a heckuva bad job for  Americas veterans and our men and women in uniform       This is just the latest example of how a culture of cronyism and      incompetence dominates an Administration that has not been the      subject of effective congressional oversight  Compounding the      incompetence was the misguided impulse of the Administration to      keep everything secret for as long as they could      Earlier  I called on the President      to at least take his friend Secretary Nicholson   to the      woodshed  Instead  he gets a pat on the back It sort of      reminds me of Brownie  you re doing a heck of a job  and      nothing happens    Such incompetence at the      Bush Cheney Veterans Administration is worse than anything I      have seen in six presidential administrations  At some point       this Administration has got to stop appointing and hiring      cronies  and at some point they might really take responsibility      and we might have some real accountability for their      incompetence  The American people suffer  the veterans are at      risk  but those in responsibility get medals and promotions and      the Republican Congress never gets to the bottom of what      happened to make sure it will not happen again    Unfortunately  the Congress is      more interested in election year politics than in making life      better for hardworking Americans who are sacrificing so much      right now  Rather than work on our privacy and identity theft      legislation  rather than proceed on a bill such as Senator      Kerrys to provide credit checks and monitoring to those whose      private information was compromised  we are being directed to      another divisive debate on a proposed constitutional amendment    We need to take real action to      prevent this kind of data losses  Last year  Senator Specter      and I introduced the Personal Data Privacy and Security Act       which requires federal agencies and private data brokers to give      prompt notice when sensitive personal information has been      breached or stolen  The Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly      approved this bill last fall  but almost a year later  the      Senate has still not acted on this legislation Had this bill      been in enacted  it would have required the VA to promptly      notify the millions of Veterans now at risk of identity theft      about the theft of their personal data  Our bill also addresses      the Governments use of personal data by putting privacy and      security front and center in evaluating whether data brokers can      be trusted with Government contracts that involve sensitive      information about the American people    The nations veterans  who have      been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country       deserve to have the best tools available to protect themselves      and their families from identity theft  Congress must act now      to pass comprehensive data privacy and security legislation         Another continuing priority that      has been neglected is veterans health care  As a senior member      of the Appropriations Committee  I know that where you direct      your resources tells a lot about your priorities  And what the      Bush Administrations budget tells us is that honoring veterans      is not a priority  especially when it comes to medical care    The Presidents budget requests      consistently fall short of the levels needed to provide      necessary services and care  Secretary Nicholson had to admit a      billion dollar shortfall last year after first issuing      inaccurate and unfounded denials of his mismanagement  When      Congress was telling the Administration  Please just let us      know what you need and we will make sure you get it  the      Administration replied with a curt  thanks  were fine  Well       they were not really fine  Secretary Principi before him had      testified that the Veterans Department asked the White House for      an additional  1 2 billion but that it was denied      Veterans groups and families know      that even these budget requests are inadequatenearly  3 billion      less than what veterans groups like the American Legion  the      Veterans of Foreign Wars  and the Paralyzed Veterans of America      recommend in the Independent Budget  These organizations know      what it will take to meet veterans health care needs      And when Democratic Senators  like      Senators Murray  Akaka  or Nelson  offer amendments to fund      veterans programs Republicans refuse to support those amendments      to bring funding up to the levels recommended by the Independent      Budget and just plain common sense    We heard in March 2004 from the      Chairman of the Citizens Flag Alliance  Major General Patrick      Brady  that we have never fully met the needs of our      veterans  This echoed General Bradys frank admission      following our April 1999 hearing that the most pressing issues      facing our veterans were not flag burnings  but rather broken      promises  especially health care  Sadly  it appears playing      politics with veterans care is nothing new  Tragically  it      continues     During the past 5 years  Congress      has had to add billions of dollars more to the Presidents      budget request just to fill gaps in basic services  If we had      done as the President asked year after year  veterans medical      care would be in even worse shape  Unfortunately  this year the      Congress is not off to an encouraging start  The most recent      supplemental spending bill excluded almost  400 million in      additional spending for the veterans health care  Again  the      Administration said it did not need the additional funding       Also  the Administration is again making an attempt to impose      onerous fees and co payments on our nations veterans      I could go on and on describing      the claims backlog  the longer waits  and the cuts in service       The bottom line is that the Administrations rhetoric toward      veterans simply does not match its real priorities     Instead of debating polarizing      issues that we have talked about again and again  we should be      acting to provide real resources for our men and women who      served this country with honor and sacrifice  I hope that      Republicans and Democrats will join together this year to make      helping our veterans the priority that it needs to be
