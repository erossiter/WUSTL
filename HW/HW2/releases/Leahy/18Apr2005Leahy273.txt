       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Death Of Marla Ruzicka                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Death Of Marla Ruzicka    April 18  2005 Mr  President  I want to join my friend from California in paying     tribute to a remarkable young woman from Lakeport  California  Marla     Ruzicka   Marla was the founder of a humanitarian organization called Campaign     for Innocent Victims in Conflict  which is devoted to helping the     families of Afghan and Iraqi civilians who have been killed or suffered     other losses as a result of U S  military operations  Marla died in     Baghdad on Saturday from a car bomb  while she was doing the work she     loved and which so many people around the world admired her for  I met Marla three years ago  which she first came to Washington at     the young age of 26  She had been in Afghanistan  where she had seen the     effects of U S  bombing mistakes that had destroyed the homes and lives     of innocent Afghan civilians   In one or two incidents  wedding parties had been bombed  In others      bombs had missed their targets and destroyed homes and neighborhoods  I     remember one incident where every member of a family of 16 people was     killed  except a young child and her grandfather   These were the cases Marla spoke about  and she felt passionately     that the United States should help those families piece their lives back     together  It didnt take long to convince me because she was so obviously     right  We not only had a moral responsibility to those people who had     suffered because of our mistakes  we also had an interest in mitigating     the hatred and resentment towards Americans that those incidents had     caused  And it was Marlas initiative  going to Afghanistan  meeting those     families  getting the medias attention  coming back here and meeting     with me and my staff  that led to the creation of a program that has     contributed more than  8 million for medical assistance  to rebuild     homes  to provide loans to start businesses  and for other aid to     innocent Afghan victims of the military operations   From Afghanistan Marla went to Iraq  where she arrived a day or two     after Saddams statue fell  She and an Iraqi colleague  Faiez Ali Salem      who died at the same time as Marla  organized dozens of Iraqi volunteers     to conduct surveys around the country of civilian casualties   She returned to Washington  and again  her efforts led to the     creation of a program  now known as the Civilian Assistance Program      which has provided  10 million to the families and communities of Iraqi     civilians killed by U S  and other Coalition forces  Another  10 million     was allocated for this program just last     week   To my knowledge  this is the first time we have ever provided this     type of assistance to civilian victims of U S  military operations  and     it would never have happened without the initiative  the courage  and     the incomparable force of character of Marla Ruzicka   Mr  President  in my 31 years as a United States Senator I have met     lots of interesting and accomplished people from all over the world  We     all have  Nobel prize winners  heads of State  people who have achieved     remarkable and even heroic things in their lives   I have never met anyone like Marla Ruzicka  There are many stories     about Marla  and some of them are being recounted in the hundreds of     press articles that have appeared in just the past 48 hours   One story I remember happened the day after Marla arrived in     Washington from Kabul  She had heard there was a hearing in the Senate     where Secretary Rumsfeld and General Franks were going to testify   Thinking  perhaps a bit naively  that they might talk about the     problem of civilian casualties  she decided to go  After the hearing was     over and disappointed that the issue she cared so deeply about had not     been mentioned  Marla walked straight up to Secretary Rumsfeld  and from     the witness table  down the hallway and outside to his car  she did not     stop talking to him about the families of civilians she had met who had     been killed or injured and the need to do something to help them   As anyone who knew Marla discovered  she was not someone who it was     easy to say no to  In fact it was almost impossible  and that was not     simply because she was insistent  It was because she had been there  she     knew what war was about  she had seen the tragic results  and she was     not about blaming anyone  She was about helping  in whatever ways she     could   Marla saw her work as part of the best of what this country is about      It was the face of a compassionate America that she believed in  and     that she wanted the people of Afghanistan and Iraq to see   It took time to realize that Marla wasnt just a blond  bundle of     energy and charisma  she was in fact a person of great intellect and     courage who realized that if she wanted to help war victims it wasnt     enough to protest  She needed to work with people who could help her do     it  And that meant the Congress  the U S  military  the U S  Embassy  and     the press  She quickly understood that  and she made the choice to put     politics aside and focus on the victims   It did not take long before the U S  military saw the importance of     what she was doing  and started to help her  There were several Civil     Affairs officers with whom Marla worked like a team  she finding the     cases  and they arranging for the plane to airlift a wounded child to a     hospital  or some other type of assistance   Marla became one of our most beloved Ambassadors   I think one of the reasons so many people around the world feel     Marla s loss so deeply is because we saw how important her work was and     that it meant taking risks that the rest of us are unwilling to take  In     a way she was not only helping the families of Iraqi war victims  she     was also helping us   Until she finally became an innocent victim of war herself  Marla has been called many things  An angel of mercy  A ray of     sunshine in an often dangerous and dark world  One person who knew her     well described Marla as being as close to a living saint as they come      and I suspect thats how many of us feel   Speaking for myself  I have never met  nor do I ever expect to meet     again  someone so young who gave so much of herself to so many people      and who made such a difference doing it  Our hearts go out to her parents  Cliff and Nancy Ruzicka  who had     the courage to let Marla be the person she wanted to be  Not that there     would have been any stopping her  Our job now is to carry on the work that Marla started  because it is     so important  That is what I am committed to  and I look forward to     working with my friend from California to honor Marla in that way
