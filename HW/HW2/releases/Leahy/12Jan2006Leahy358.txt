       Leahy Protests Unprecedented Move Of Sitting Judges Testifying                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leahy       Protests Unprecedented Move Of Sitting Judges Testifying         Judges Testimony       On Behalf Of Nominee      Sows Possible Future Conflicts Of Interest        WASHINGTON  Thursday  Jan  12     Below are comments of Senator      Patrick Leahy from the hearing Thursday on the Supreme Court      nomination of Samuel A  Alito to be an Associate Justice  Leahy       the ranking Democratic member of the panel  protested the      unprecedented move of calling sitting judges as character      witnesses  The panel  which included both current and retired      judges  was invited to testify on behalf of Judge Alito by the      Republican controlled Committee    Mr  Chairman  I realize      we have some retired and very distinguished retired judges with us      today  but also some current judges  Insofar as the current judges       their cases are appealed to the Supreme Court  and if Judge Alito      becomes a member of the Supreme Court hell have to rule on their      appeals    appeals from their decisions  And so I think rather than      create a difficultly for them  or for Judge Alito  if he is      confirmed  I think I will not avail myself of a chance to ask      questions of this unprecedented panel
