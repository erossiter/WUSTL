       Leahy  New Bush Budget Abandons Local Police  Crime Victims And   Community Youth Programs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy  New Bush Budget     Abandons Local Police  Crime Victims     And Community Youth Programs       Irresponsible Budget Gouges      Help To Police  Weakens Anti Drug Efforts      And Robs Crime Victims Trust Fund Reserves  Leahy Charges   THURSDAY  Feb  9   Senator Patrick      Leahy  D Vt   Thursday released an analysis of the anti crime and      drug abuse prevention cuts in President Bushs 2007 budget plan that      he says would  if ratified by Congress  deliver a series of blows      to police departments and communities in Vermont and across the      nation   The Bush Administrations proposed      budget for Fiscal Year 2007  released this week  calls for deep cuts      in crime prevention programs that state and local police and      sheriffs departments have long relied upon  including key Justice      Department efforts such as Byrne Grants  the Crime Victims Fund  the      Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act  and the Violence Against Women Act      Programs  Leahy said the cuts total a 52 percent reduction in      funding for federal help to local law enforcement agencies  Leahy      is the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  which has      jurisdiction over the Justice Department and federal anti crime      programs  He also is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations      Committee  which handles the Senates work in writing the annual      budget bills for all federal agencies and departments  including the      Justice Department    This budget would undermine proven      anti crime  anti drug and community safety efforts that are making a      difference in Vermont and in communities across the nation  said      Leahy  These budget priorities are out of whack  This budget puts      more tax cuts for the rich at the front of the line  while leaving      behind crime victims  local police and Boys and Girls Clubs       Slashing help to state and local police by more than half is      irresponsible and wrong  and I will work to build a bipartisan      coalition to do what we can to put it right   Leahys report on the Bush budgets      impact on Justice Department programs is his second overview      analysis of the new budget plans impact on Vermont   The first         released Monday and focusing on the budgets impact on Vermonts      agricultural  environmental  health care  education  first responder      and National Guard priorities        Bush Budget Abandons Anti Crime      Programs That Help Local Police      Eliminates All Funding For The      Edward Byrne Memorial State Grant Program  The Bush budget would cut all      funding for this program  The Byrne Grant program has long been a      mainstay of Vermont law enforcement agencies  making possible      investments in a variety of local crime prevention initiatives      targeting gang violence  drug abuse and violent crime and other      community law enforcement problems      Cuts  20 Million From The      Bulletproof Vest Partnership Program  BVP   The Administrations budget proposes      to cut  20 million from the BVP Program  which represents a 63      percent reduction in funding to this program that helps protect      Vermonts rank and file police officers who are on the front lines      in fighting crime  Chartered under legislation authored by Leahy       the program provides matching fund up to 50 percent for state       county and local police agencies to purchase life saving bulletproof      vests  In recent years  Leahy has worked to secure additional      funding to not only purchase additional vests for jurisdictions  but      also to help police agencies replace hundreds of vests that have      been found to be defective  Since the Leahy program began in 1999       Vermont has received more than  475 000 for more than 2 600 vests      Cuts  23 3 Million From Community      Oriented Policing Services  COPS   The COPS program has provided vital      funding for Vermonts Drug Task Force  which combats the growing      problem of heroin use and trafficking in Vermont  as well as keeps      the production and use of highly addictive methamphetamine from      infiltrating Vermonts borders  The Administration proposes a  23 3      million cut from the COPS Methamphetamine Hotspots program     Bush Budget Abandons Crime Victims           Underfunds Violence Against      Women Act Programs by  454 Million  Under Leahys leadership  Congress      last year passed and the President signed into law the Violence      Against Women Reauthorization Act  providing  1 billion in important      resources and services to victims of domestic violence  The      Administration has proposed  454 million below what the President      recognized as appropriate funding for the Office of Violence Against      Women  which administers programs at work in Vermont such as the      Transitional Housing Assistance Grants and the Rural Domestic      Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program  both      authored by Leahy      DNA Testing  Technology Proposal      Misses The Mark  The Bush budget proposes no      investments in the DNA technology provisions of the recently enacted      Justice For All Act  co authored by Leahy  that helps solve crimes      and prevents innocent people from falling through the cracks of      justice system  DNA testing helps assure that only individuals      guilty of crimes are imprisoned and focuses law enforcement efforts      on finding and convicting them  The Justice For All Act created      many of these DNA testing programs that would prevent tragic      mistakes by eliminating backlogs of DNA samples  improving testing      capacities of state and local agencies  and helping with technical      training  Vermont has had a particular need for help in upgrading      the states DNA lab and testing capabilities      Drains Crime Victims Trust Fund  The Bush budget plan would drain      funds from the Crime Victims Trust Fund by eliminating the programs      balance    approximately  1 3 billion  In Vermont and across the      country  the Victims Fund plays an essential role in helping crime      victims and their families in the aftermath of the crimes they have      suffered and with rebuilding their lives  The balance that remains      in the Fund at the end of each fiscal year ensures that this help is      always available for victims in need  and for emergencies such as      9 11 andHurricanes Katrina and Rita    Bush Budget Abandons Youths      Cuts Almost  25 Million for Boys      and Girls Clubs of America   The Bush budget proposes an almost       25 million cut in funding for the Boys and Girls Clubs of America       Leahy has long led efforts to increase support for this program       which helps communities fight the influence of gangs and drugs among      youths by providing safe havens for them  In Vermont  Boys  Girls      Clubs have succeeded in preventing crime and supporting children       The first Club was established in Burlington 63 years ago  and now      there are 20 club sites operating throughout the State in Addison       Chittenden  Orange  Rutland  Washington  Windham and Windsor      Counties  Four new Boys  Girls Clubs are planned for Winooski       Brattleboro  Barre and Vergennes  Collectively  these clubs serve      well over 10 000 kids statewide
