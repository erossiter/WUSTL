       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Presidential Signing Statements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen        Patrick  Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee        On Presidential Signing Statements      July 25  2006   Yesterday we were       reminded  again  of the lawlessness of the Bush Cheney       Administration as it continues its abuse of signing statements       as part of a systematic pursuit of power without the checks and       balances inherent in our constitutional democracy  A most       distinguished Task Force of the American Bar Association has now       released a unanimous report highly critical of this Presidents       practice as contrary to the rule of law and our constitutional       system of separation of powers  I thank the distinguish panel       of conservatives and moderates    Republicans and Democrats          for their thoughtful report    This is not some       academic debate without consequences  I have been seeking to       draw attention to this surreptitious power grab for at least       four years  since this Presidents unusual signing statement       following enactment of the Sarbanes Oxley bill in 2002 to reign       in corporate abuses that cost so many Americans their       livelihoods and their retirement savings through Enron and other       scandals  The President signed the bill but had secret       reservations  That is when I first realized the Presidents       unorthodox  unwise and unsound practice of signing a bill while       crossing his fingers behind his back  We have seen it over and       over again as this President insists on the equivalent of an       unwritten line item veto that would undermine the checks and       balances of our constitutional separation of powers and that the       Supreme Court correctly determined was unconstitutional      Later this week  the       President will be signing the reauthorization and revitalization       of the Voting Rights Act  passed by the House with 390 votes and       unanimously last week by the Senate  In the past I could have       gone to the White House to witness the bill signing knowing that       our three branches of government were all operating within their       proper authority  That is the way we have operated for more       than 200 years  But this year  with this President  that is not       the way any longer  After the bill signing  after the       celebration  after the bipartisan plaudits and after the       President takes credit for the civil rights advances that our       bill is intended to represent    after all this    we will have       to wait to see whether there is a belated presidential document        a so called signing statement  Only then will we see if the       President will seek to create a gloss that Congress did not       intend  or modify a provision of law more to his liking  or       declare some provision of law something he and his       Administration will not enforce  That is wrong  That is the       opposite of the Rule of Law  And no one  not even the       President  is above the law     The Constitution       places the law making power  All legislative Powers in the       Congress  That is an Article I power  A check on the       congressional power is the requirement that before  a bill        becomes a Law it must be presented to the President  Section 7       of Article I of the Constitution provides  If he approve he       shall sign it  but if not he shall return it  with his       Objections to that House in which it shall have originated  Of       course the Constitution then contemplates congressional power to       override a presidential objection or veto  That is our system        that is our law  The President has the option to veto  in fact       after five years in office  he finally exercised that power last       week when he vetoed the stem cell research legislation  I       disagreed with his decision to veto that bill  but it was within       his constitutional power to do it  He does not have the power       to issue a decree that he will pick and choose which provisions       of laws to follow in statements issued after Congress passes a       law  What this President is doing is wrong     Last month  the       Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing on the use of these       signing statements by the Bush Cheney Administration  I noted       that we are at a pivotal moment in our Nations history  where       Americans are faced with a President who makes sweeping claims       for almost unchecked Executive power  This Presidents use of       signing statements is unprecedented  although presaged by the       work of Samuel Alito at the Meese Justice Department during the       Reagan presidency  now Justice Alito on the Supreme Court        This Administration is now routinely using signing statements to       proclaim which parts of the law the President will follow  which       parts he will ignore  and which he will reinterpret  This is       what I have called cherry picking and it is wrong    This Presidents       broad use of signing statements to try to rewrite the laws       passed by the Congress poses a grave threat to our       constitutional system of checks and balances  During his five       years in office  President Bush has abused his bill signing       statements to assign his own interpretations to laws passed by       Congress    According to a       review of these statements conducted by  The Boston Globe        President Bush has employed signing statements to ignore or       disobey more than 750       provisions enacted by the Congress since 2001 more than all       previous presidents in the history of our Nation combined        According to scholarly research that number now tops 800       provisions of law     I have alluded to       the Presidents signing statement in 2002 in connection with the       Sarbanes Oxley law designed to combat corporate fraud  The       President used his signing statement to attempt to narrow a       provision protecting corporate whistle blowers in a way that       would have afforded them very little protection  Senator       Grassley and I wrote a letter to the President stating that his       narrow interpretation was at odds with the plain language of the       statute  and the Administration reluctantly relented on this       view but only after much protest     We also witnessed       the Presidents fondness for signing statements earlier this       year  when after months of debate and negotiations in Congress        the President issued a signing statement for the USA PATRIOT ACT       Reauthorization language in which he stated his intentions not       to follow the reporting and oversight provisions contained in       that bill  I noted this abuse at the time  When I voted       against that reauthorization  I explained it was because I did       not have confidence that the oversight provisions we succeeded       in incorporating into the law would be respected  What little       doubt was left by the self serving signing statement was erased       last week when the Attorney General of the  United States       refused to commit to following the law    This President has       also used signing statements to challenge laws banning torture        on affirmative action and prohibiting the censorship of       scientific data  In fact  time and again  this President has       stood before the American people  signed laws enacted by their       representatives in Congress  while all along crossing his       fingers behind his back  And  while this President used to       boast  until his veto of stem cell research legislation          that he was the first modern President to have never vetoed a       bill  he has cleverly used his signing statements as a  de facto line item       veto to cherry pick which laws he will enforce in a manner not       consistent with our Constitution     Under our       constitutional system of government  when Congress passes a bill       and the President signs it into law  that should be the end of       the story  At that moment the Presidents constitutional duty       is to take Care that the Laws be faithfully executed  That is       the Article II power  the executive Power  to execute the       laws  it is not a legislative Power  So when the President        including this President  takes the oath of office and swears on       the Bible  he does so  in the words of the Constitution  Before       he enter on the Execution of his Office  and swears that he       will faithfully execute the office of President and preserve        protect and defend the Constitution of the United States  I       remind this President and this Administration that the       Constitution has more than one Article and that All legislative       Power is vested in Congress  not some unitary executive          When the President       uses signing statements to unilaterally rewrite the laws enacted       by the peoples representatives in Congress  he undermines the       Rule of Law and our constitutional checks and balances designed       to protect the rights of the American people    This Presidents       abuse of signing statements is all the more dangerous because he       has packed the courts with judges willing to defer to him and       presidential authority  I have noted that Justice Alito helped       develop this device  I could not help but note that Justice       Scalia  who is famous for not consulting legislative history        reached out in his dissent in the recent  Hamdan decision to       reference a recent presidential signing statement    These signing       statements are a diabolical device but this President will       continue to use and abuse them  if the Republican Congress lets       him  So far  this Congress has done exactly that  Whether it       is torture  warrantless eavesdropping on American citizens  or       the unlawful detention of military prisoners  this       Republican led Congress has been willing to turn a blind eye and       rubber stamp the questionable actions of this Administration        regardless of the consequences to our Constitution or civil       liberties
