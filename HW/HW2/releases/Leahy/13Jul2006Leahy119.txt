       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Passage Of The Voting Rights Act By The   House Of Representatives                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On Passage Of The Voting Rights Act      By The House Of Representatives     July 13  2006 I am encouraged      that a strong  bipartisan majority voted to reauthorize and      revitalize the Voting Rights Act  Chairman Sensenbrenner and      Ranking Member Conyers deserve great credit for guiding this bill to      a final vote   The bipartisan      efforts in the House today have received the strong endorsement of      the White House  A Statement of Administration Policy was released      today strongly supporting the Voting Rights Act and the provisions      which correct legislative intent wrongly interpreted by the Supreme      Court   Georgia v  Ashcroft and Reno v  Bossier Parish       On several      occasions there were attempts by a few to derail this bipartisan      bill  In the end  they could not thwart the widespread support for      renewal of this historic civil rights legislation  Now that the      House completed its extensive work  the pressure is on our      leadership in the Senate to make this bill a priority   The Senate      Judiciary Committee plans to report the Voting Rights Act out within      a week  Next  we will need the Senate Majority Leader to make this      historic legislation a priority so the full Senate can debate and      vote on it before the August recess  This legislation      has broad  bipartisan support and has the votes to pass the Senate       The only thing that threatens its passage is partisan delay to serve      a narrow ideological base   The VRA is a      keystone in the body of civil rights laws that changed our country       Congresses since then have come together in bipartisanship to renew      VRA  recognizing its continuing vitality and importance   It would be a      travesty for the 109th Congress to break that historic solidarity      with American values and with the importance of protecting the      foundational right to vote  Wouldnt it be      refreshing for the Senate to turn to an issue that unites instead of      divides the American people
