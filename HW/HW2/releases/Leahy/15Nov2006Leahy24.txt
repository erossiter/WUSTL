       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To President Bush s Re Nomination Of   Controversial Judicial Nominees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     To President Bushs RenominationOf Controversial Judicial Nominees     November 15  2006    Barely a week after the President       promised to change course by working in a bipartisan and       cooperative way with Congress  it is disappointing that he has       decided to stay the course on judicial nominees by       renominating a slate of his most controversial past choices        These are nominees who failed to win confirmation under a       Republican controlled Senate and they were returned to the       President    With these renominations  the       President is choosing partisanship over progress and division       over unity  at the expense of a fair and independent judiciary        This is exactly the kind of political game playing that prompted       Americans to demand change and a new direction in Washington        The signal the President is sending by renominating these       controversial candidates is regrettable  But I hope the       President will work with us in charting a new direction in the       next congressional session  by choosing consensus nominees who       unite instead of divide America    The       American peopleexpect the federal courts to be a place where       justice is dispensed without favor to the right or the left        These are the only lifetime appointments in our entire       government  and I will continue to work with both Democratic and       Republican Senators to advance consensus nominees to ensure the       independence of our federal judiciary
