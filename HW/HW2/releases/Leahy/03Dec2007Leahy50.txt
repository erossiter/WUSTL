       Leahy Tallies Judiciary Panel s Legislative Output As 1st Session Of New   Congress Heads Into Home Stretch                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Tallies Judiciary       Panels Legislative Output  As 1st Session       Of New Congress Heads Into Home Stretch     Chairman Lauds Bipartisan       Progress      And Spotlights Anonymous Stalling Of Key Legislation On Senate       Floor     WASHINGTON  Monday  Dec  3  2007         As the Senate began its final work period of the First Session       of the 110th Congress on Monday  Chairman Patrick       Leahy  D Vt   praised the bipartisan legislative achievements of       the Judiciary Committee  while calling for an end to anonymous        unexplained holds that are delaying or preventing action on many       of the panels bills that address issues of particular interest       and importance to the public        Late last year  Leahy       for the Judiciary Committee        including protecting Americans privacy and stepping up       oversight of federal databanks  reforming the patent system        reducing judicial vacancies  defending the publics right to       know  and reinvigorating the broken oversight process  In the       intervening months  the Judiciary Committee has investigated the       mass firing of U S  Attorneys and the politicization of the       Department of Justice    an inquiry that led to the resignation       of former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the senior       leadership at the Department  In October  the Committee       methodically convened confirmation proceedings for Michael       Mukasey to become the next Attorney General  and his nomination       was confirmed by the Senate last month       Since January  the Judiciary       Committee has reported 40 judicial nominations to the Senate       Floor and reduced the number of judicial vacancies at the start       of the 110th Congress from 56 to 46       The Judiciary Committee has       worked diligently this year to pass legislation to preserve the       publics right to know  to create a federal shield law for       reporters  and to bring our patent system into the 21st       Century  said Leahy  Unfortunately  many of our efforts have       been stalled in the Senate by anonymous holds  The Judiciary       Committee has been one of the busiest and most productive in the       Senate  But there is still time in this session  and we can do       more if we can end the anonymous obstruction that is blocking       action on several issues of importance to the American people     Judiciary Committee passed       legislation that has not yet been considered by the Senate       includes       S  119  War Profiteering        Prevention Act  S  378  Legislation to help        protect the Federal judiciary from threats and attacks          S  453  Deceptive Practices        and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act   S  495  Leahy Specter Data        Privacy and Security Act   S  535  Emmett Till Unsolved        Civil Rights Crime Act   S  1145  Leahy Hatch Patent        Reform Act   S  1327  Legislation to        extend temporary judgeships around the country   S  1946  Leahy Cornyn Public        Corruption Prosecution Improvements Act   S  2084  School Safety and        Law Enforcement Improvements Act         Leahys statement from Monday       follows       Statement of       Senator Patrick Leahy   Chairman        Senate Judiciary Committee   December 3        2007      As the Senate begins its final       work period of the year  I want to thank those Members of the       Judiciary Committee who have been cooperative and who have       worked so hard throughout this year  Much has been       accomplished  But much can still be done  We reported and the       Senate passed an important privacy measure  The Identity Theft       Enforcement and Restitution Act  S 2168  just before the       Thanksgiving recess  I urge the House to adopt it without       delay  In addition  the Senate again passed our copyright bill       to protect vessel hull designs  S 1640  which I hope will also       be adopted by the House        Months ago we reported and passed       an important court security bill  S 378  and Freedom of       Information Act reform legislation  S 849  I believe that we       have resolved differences raised by the House and should be able       in the short time remaining to us this year to have the Senate       reconsider these measures in slightly modified form  pass them       by unanimous consent and have the House endorse them  as well             I would like to see us consider       and pass important matters the House has passed and sent to us        The Free Flow of Information Act  H R  2102  is on the Senate       calendar  It would provide protection to First Amendment values       by establishing a federal privilege and procedure for       considering claims of press protection  For the first time        this year the Judiciary Committee reported a similar bill        S 2035  and we did so on a bipartisan basis  We should proceed       to enact this legislation into law        Another important matter sent to       us from the House that I would hope we could enact before       adjourning this year is one on which we have worked for some       time  the Employment Non Discrimination Act  H R  3685  We also       have before us a House passed version of the Second Chance Act        H R  1593  While it does not include every provision I would       have liked to incorporate  we should nonetheless proceed to       enact this legislation        I urge the Republican Senator who       has a hold on the bill to extend temporary judgeships around the       country  S 1327  to remove this hold so that we can provide the       relief needed in our federal judiciary in Kansas  Ohio        Nebraska  California  and Hawaii  Enacting court security       legislation will likewise require the relinquishing of a       Republican hold  Another matter stalled since this summer by a       Republican hold has been the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights       Crime Act  S 535  I have made statements to the Senate about       these consensus measures before  I hope that with the year       rapidly ending  the Republican Senator holding up these       worthwhile matters will reconsider the opposition and allow       bills supported by an overwhelming  bipartisan majority of the       Senate to pass       A number of other measures       reported by the Judiciary Committee have been delayed by       Republican holds  too  If it is not possible to move these       measures this month  I urge the Senate to take up and pass these       bills when it begins its second session in January  One such       bill is the War Profiteering Prevention Act  S 119  which was       reported by the Committee in April  It would provide a       significant new tool for federal law enforcement to combat the       scourge of war profiteering  and it is needed now more than       ever  given the ongoing reports of rampant fraud  waste and       abuse in Iraq  Another is the School Safety and Law Enforcement       Improvements Act  S 2084  which we developed in response to the       tragedy at Virginia Tech        When we return next year  we will       have the opportunity to consider and enact patent reform       legislation  the Leahy Hatch Patent Reform Act of 2007  S 1145        I hope that we will also make time to consider our comprehensive       bipartisan data privacy bill  the Leahy Specter Data Privacy and       Security Act  S 495  which we reported in May       Next spring I hope we can turn to       the Deceptive Practices and Voter Intimidation Prevention Act        S 453  which the Committee reported this fall  and our       bipartisan Leahy Cornyn Public Corruption Prosecution       Improvements Act  S 1946  that adds teeth to our ethics reforms             These are just some of the matters       on which the Judiciary Committee has been hard at work this       year  We could not have accomplished what we have without the       contributions of our Members  I want  in particular  to commend       our newest Members  Senators Cardin and Whitehouse  for their       exceptional work  They have initiated legislative efforts        chaired important hearings and been full partners in the work of       the Committee        I would also like to thank and       commend Senator Durbin for chairing our newest subcommittee  the       Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  and for making it one       of the most active and productive subcommittee we have  Senator       Durbin has originated genocide accountability and child soldier       accountability legislation  trafficking in persons legislation        and war crimes legislation  all in rapid succession  He has       made the Human Rights Subcommittee into what we hoped it would       be  a vehicle to focus our attention on fundamental aspects of       what makes us all Americans  We all owe him a debt of       gratitude        Of course  we would not be nearly       as far along in our work without the help of our Republican       Members  led by Senator Specter  We have proceeded with       significant bipartisan legislation on privacy  press shield        patents  FOIA  public corruption  and crime  Currently we are       working together to improve the FISA legislation about to be       considered by the Senate by exploring whether we can adopt an       amendment that will increase accountability through the       procedural device of substitution  rather than a blanket grant       of retroactive immunity for the warrantless wiretapping of       Americans that took place from 2001 through 2007  Senator       Specter and I joined to seek to restore the great writ of habeas       corpus but  despite support by a majority of the Senate  we were       stymied by a Republican filibuster  Likewise  we have joined to       achieve majority support for voting rights for the District of       Columbia only to be blocked this year by another Republican       filibuster        I hope that as we enter these last       few weeks of the year  we are allowed to make progress on the       matters I have outlined here today and that the obstruction that       has stalled our further progress will not be continued  Let us       move forward together in the best interest of the American       people  Any Senator can prevent action on an item in these       waning days of the session  There is no secret or magic about       that  The question for Senators this month is whether they are       willing to put aside minor differences and partisan agendas to       join with us in making progress and moving forward
