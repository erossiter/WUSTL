       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Nepal s Future                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    Senate Floor     On Nepal s Future    September 18  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Mr      President  there are times in virtually every countrys history when     years of under development and conflict give rise to opportunities to     change course  Such times are rare  and such opportunities are too     often missed   I think of our     Civil War  which caused so much loss of life and devastation  It     preserved the Union and it led to the emancipation of some 3 million     African slaves  Nothing can diminish those achievements or the     sacrifice of those who gave their lives  But instead of providing the     former slaves with the equal rights to which they were entitled  until     passage of the Civil Rights Act a century later African Americans     suffered from racially discriminatory laws that kept them in an inferior     status  The country remained bitterly divided because of it  Nepal today faces     its own historic choice  As one of many Americans who care deeply about     Nepals future and who want Nepal and its people to thrive and prosper      today I offer some constructive observations as Nepal approaches this     crossroads   For more than a     decade  Nepal has been plagued by an internal armed conflict in which     savage brutality was inflicted on impoverished civilians by Maoist     insurgents and the Royal Nepal Army  Over 13 000 people died  mostly     noncombatants  and virtually no one has been held accountable for those     crimes   For more than two     centuries  Nepal has been a monarchy whose kings  with rare exception      denied the rights and ignored the needs of their people who remain among     the worlds poorest  In February 2005  King Gyanendra  a narcissistic      arrogant autocrat  seized absolute power  jailed his opponents and     muzzled the press  only to relent in April 2006 in the face of mounting     international pressure and the protests of thousands of courageous     Nepali citizens   Nepals previous     experiment with multi party democracy during the 1990s had been     disappointing  The leaders of the countrys political parties     distinguished themselves by amassing personal fortunes and doing little     for the people   But since the     restoration of civilian government in April last year there has been     impressive progress  A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed  Maoist     combatants have gone into cantonments  the army has been confined to     barracks  and the Maoists  until today  were part of the interim     government  The King has been stripped of all political power  although     the ultimate fate of the monarchy has yet to be decided  The word     Royal has been eliminated from government institutions  including the     army  Elections for a Constituent Assembly to be held in June were     postponed  but they have been rescheduled for November 22  The Assembly     is to draft a new constitution   Also during this     period  Nepals ethnic minorities  women and other groups who have long     been persecuted and denied a voice have demanded equal rights and     representation  This poses both challenges and opportunities for the     government   The international     community  including the United States  has supported the peace process     directly and through our financial contributions to the United Nations     which has performed key monitoring functions  Recently  the United     States provided  3 million to purchase the ballots for the     elections   Much has transpired     since April 2006  when I last spoke in this chamber about political     developments in Nepal  Today  just 65 days before Nepals elections  I     would like to address my brief remarks to the people of Nepal and to     Nepals political parties  including the Maoists   On November 22  the     people of Nepal will be presented with one of two options  They will     either have an historic opportunity to create a legitimate      representative government which can only be achieved through a popular     vote  or they will be denied that opportunity  If the elections are     held  Nepal will continue on a path that can bring its governmental     institutions and its society into the modern age  and begin to finally     address the poverty and injustices that gave rise to the conflict  If     they are denied  the Nepali people will likely see their country become     more fragmented and ungovernable  and more vulnerable to external     influences over which they have little control   Recent developments     have been both encouraging and troubling  Perhaps that is to be     expected in a country of multiple ethnic groups speaking some 93     languages that is struggling to transform itself   The bombings in     Kathmandu three weeks ago  other violent acts perpetrated by newly     formed armed groups in the Terai and members of the Maoist young wing      the Young Communist League  and the Maoists decision to withdraw from     the government all illustrate the fragility of the process   Moreover  the     leaders of the Congress parties and the Maoists have done little to     prepare for the elections  At times  party members have seemed more     interested in furthering their own personal ambitions and in derailing     the electoral process altogether  The leading party of the left  the     UML  has done more to prepare  But all parties will need to promptly     step up their election activities if voters are to have the informed     choice they deserve   On the positive     side  the Election Commission deserves credit for a voter registration     process that has reached Nepals remotest villages  There is no doubt     that the people are eager to go to the polls  just as they were     determined to put an end to the Kings abuse of power   Over the past three     years  I have observed the fortitude of the Nepali peoples desire for     peace  for justice  and for a meaningful voice in government  Their     desire is shared and admired by the American people   To the Maoists I     would say that it was you who called for a Constituent Assembly  Saying     you are committed to the democratic process at the same time that you     withdraw from the government  make new demands that contradict previous     commitments  support disruptive economic strikes  and threaten to return     to confrontation  is not the way to earn the peoples trust and support     that are necessary to become an effective force for change  Nor is it     the way to earn the trust of the United States  I have campaigned     for elective office five times over more than 30 years  and I know     something about earning the peoples trust and support  It does not     come from dogmatic speeches or lofty party platforms or manifestos  It     does not come from saying one thing and then doing the opposite  It     certainly does not come through the use of violence  threats and     extortion  It comes by showing that you deserve the peoples trust and     support  There is no better way to begin that process than to seize     this opportunity and show the people that you can make the government     work for them   History is replete     with examples of armed groups that achieved popular legitimacy through     the democratic process  If the Maoists win seats through free and fair     elections  uphold the commitments they have made in the Comprehensive     Peace agreement and other agreements  and devote themselves to working     for change peacefully  I am confident the United States will treat them     as rightful members of the elected Constituent Assembly or of the     government  We may disagree with their positions on some issues  but not     about their right to serve in government and to advocate for those     positions  I know the Maoists     are looking to the United States to lift our restrictions on their party     and its leaders  and to remove them from our list of terrorist     organizations  In order for that to happen  the Maoists need to take     unequivocal  positive steps  The cases of the murdered Nepali security     guards need to be satisfactorily resolved  The partys resumption of     land seizures and the reopening of so called peoples courts  are     steps in the wrong direction  To the other     political parties in government I would say that it is time to make good     on your commitments  Not only the Maoists  but traditionally     marginalized groups as well  are increasingly skeptical that the     government is serious about delivering on its key commitments to the     peace process  whether downsizing and reforming the army  supporting     land reform  or creating jobs and opportunities for minority groups that     have long been disadvantaged and ignored  While those groups should     pursue their grievances through a vigorous election campaign  not     through obstruction of the democratic process  the failure of the     parties to govern and match rhetoric with action threatens the     elections  as does the Maoists saber rattling   The leaders of     Nepals political parties know that the power of holding office comes     with responsibilities  and the spotlight is on them  Lasting legitimacy     comes not only through the ballot box but in the day to day ability to     honor commitments and improve the lives of all citizens  This is their     chance to put the Nepali people and their country first  by showing that     they believe in effective  accountable government  If they do not  the     United States  and I suspect many other countries  will no longer accord     them the legitimacy they will need for our continued support  Mr  President      Nepals path to the future may be decided in the waning months of this     year  Although a small country wedged between two emerging giants      Nepal is unique in more ways  more beautiful ways  than most other     countries its size  Today  the United States  Congress and the     Executive Branch  are united in our desire to help Nepal become a     democracy whose government is representative of Nepals remarkably     diverse population  and where the fundamental rights of all people are     respected   I yield the floor
