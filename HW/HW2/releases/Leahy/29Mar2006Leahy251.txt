       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Comprehensive Immigration Reform  Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT           Statement Of     Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill    Reported Monday By The Senate Committee On The Judiciary    Senate Floor    March 29  2006     Over the last several weeks  the     Senate  through the work of the Judiciary Committee  took difficult      complex and constructive steps toward a framework for immigration     reform that is inclusive and balanced  instead of piecemeal and     punitive  Under the leadership of Chairman Specter and Senator    Kennedy  and with hard     work from Senators on both sides of the aisle  the Committee has     completed its work on a Senate a bill that provides a realistic and     reasonable system for immigration  We voted in a bipartisan     majority by a vote of 12 to 6  with two thirds of the Members of the     Committee voting in favor  to report a bill that protects Americas     borders  strengthens enforcement and remains true to American     values    The Judiciary Committee has confronted     the challenging problem of how to fix our broken immigration system     head on and has sent the Senate a good product  The Committee met     six times to debate a proposal offered by the Chairman  meeting for     long hours  and considering dozens of amendments  The debate was     substantive and civil  It was bipartisan  It was effective and     productive    The Committee was given a deadline of     March 27 by the Senates Republican leadership  I understood that     the Majority Leader had committed to turn to the Committee bill if     we were able to meet his deadline and report a bill by Monday     night  It was difficult  At times that Herculean task seemed     undoable and the deadline impossible  But under the steady     leadership of the Chairman and with the hard work and dedication of     so many Members of the Committee  we worked through the long hours     and numerous amendments and accomplished what had seemed the     impossible    The Judiciary Committee sent a     resounding message  approving a bill by a bipartisan vote of 12 6      with strong bipartisan support of every key amendment  It is a bill     that is strong on enforcement  In some ways it is stronger than the     bill passed by the House  It includes a provision added by Senator    Feinstein  for example      to make tunneling under our borders a federal crime  It is tough on     employer enforcement and tough on traffickers    It is also comprehensive and     balanced  It confronts the problem of 12 million undocumented     immigrants who live in the shadows  It values work  It respects     human dignity  It includes guest worker provisions supported by     business and labor  It includes a way to pay fines and earned     citizenship that has the support of religious and leading Hispanic     organizations    These provisions are not amnesty      Undocumented immigrants already in the country would not get to cut     to the front of the line  but  in accordance with the Committees     bipartisan plan  will need to pay fines  pay back taxes  work hard      and wait in line for green cards  They must pass background checks     and play by the rules  With fines and hard work and going to the     back of the line  after 11 years  by following a regularized path to     legal status  the currently undocumented will join as full     participants in American society  Following this plan  we can     create an orderly system for immigration that is consistent with     traditional American values and our history    Opponents of a fair  comprehensive     approach are quick to claim that anything but the most punitive     provisions are amnesty  They are wrong  President Reagan signed     an amnesty bill in 1986  This is not an amnesty bill  An editorial     in the The New York Times  entitled It Isnt Amnesty makes the point that painting the     word deer on a cow and taking it into the woods does not make the     cow a deer  Our Committee bill should not be falsely labeled  Our     bill is more properly called what it is  a smart  tough bill       The Committee also voted to add     several constructive and practical measures to the Chairmans mark      We added a new version of the Agricultural Job Opportunities      Benefits  and Security Act  or Ag Jobs  a bill that I have long     supported and that has been championed by Senator Craig  Ag Jobs     will reform the H2A visa program for temporary agricultural labor      This new version will  help dairy farmers in   Vermont and other states to legally hire     foreign workers  The bipartisan provision approved by the panel     would make dairy workers able to work  on visas  for up to 3 years      with the opportunity to adjust to permanent residence achieve their     full potential and become eligible for higher paying occupations        The American people are     engaging with us in this debate  and the Nations newspapers are     reflecting the publics growing interest in how these decisions will     be settled  In my home state      The Burlington Free Press and  The Rutland Daily Herald     have offered thoughtful editorial observations about these issues      and I commend these editorials to the attention of my colleagues       The Committee also adopted an     amendment to include the bipartisan Development  Relief  and     Education for Alien Minors Act  called the DREAM Act  This     provision will allow immigrant students to attend college and to     become permanent residents if they follow the rules established in     the Act  It will free eligible students from the constant fear of     deportation  while allowing them to work so they can afford to pay     for college  By our bipartisan Committee vote  we hope to extend to    Hispanic young people     greater educational opportunities so that they may realize the     American dream and achieve their potential   The Committee wisely agreed to drop     several controversial provisions  Early in the process  I led an     effort to remove a provision directing the Department of Homeland     Security to study building a barrier  fence or wall along the     Northern Border with     Canada    The Committee bill wisely dropped     controversial provisions that would have exposed those who provide     humanitarian relief  medical care  shelter  counseling and other     basic services to undocumented aliens to possible prosecution under     felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal law  I thank so     many in the relief and religious communities for speaking out on     this matter  Those criminal provisions should be focused on the     smugglers and under the Committee bill that is what we did  The     Committee also voted down a measure that would have criminalized     mere presence in an undocumented status in the  United States  Illegal status is     currently a civil offense with very serious consequences  including     deportation  but criminalizing that status was punitive and wrong      It would have led to further harsh consequences and trapped people     in permanent underclass status  These policies  which were included     in the House passed bill and supported by congressional Republicans      understandable sparked nationwide protests and were viewed as     anti immigrant and inconsistent with American values and history      The Committee bill  while tough on enforcement and on the smugglers      is smarter and fairer   Finally  I thank the Chairman for     setting aside provisions in the mark that would have consolidated     all immigration appeals from around the Nation into the jurisdiction     of the Federal Circuit  That is a court of specialized jurisdiction     created to hear patent appeals and cases involving technical     intellectual property issues  The Judicial Conference and Federal     judges from across the country expressed serious concerns with these     proposals  The Chairman did the right thing when he agreed to hold     a hearing and further consider what provisions will best correct the     problems created by Attorney General Ashcrofts ill conceived     actions with respect to these matters    The peaceful demonstrations around the     country over the last weeks call on the Congress to recognize the     human dignity of all and to do the right thing  in keeping with     longstanding American values  We need a comprehensive solution to a     national problem  We need a fair  realistic and reasonable system     that includes both tough enforcement and immigration reform     provisions  The bill reported by the Judiciary Committee is that     bill  This can be a pivotal moment in helping to achieve that     goal  The Judiciary Committees debate has produced a bill that  I     believe  would make my immigrant grandparents proud and is worthy of     our support    I thank the many individuals and     organizations who were so helpful to us during Committee     consideration of the bill  Included among those supporting this     measure are many labor unions  the U S  Chamber of Commerce and     other business groups  leading Hispanic organizations such as the     Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund and National     Council of La Raza and many religious organizations  including the     United States Conference of Catholic Bishops    I ask unanimous consent that     editorials from The      Rutland Daily Herald   The Burlington Free Press  and The New York Times     be printed in the Record
