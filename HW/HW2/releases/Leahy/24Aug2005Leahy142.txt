       MERCURY RULE  Leahy Snowe  Dear Colleague  On Upcoming Senate Vote On   Resolution Of Disapproval                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           MERCURY RULE      Leahy Snowe  Dear Colleague      On Upcoming Senate Vote On Resolution Of Disapproval     August 24  2005   Below is the      dear colleague letter sent Wednesday  Aug  24  by Sens  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt   and Olympia Snowe  R Maine  to all senators  urging      support for the resolution of disapproval on the Administrations      controversial rule on mercury pollution  The resolution  which      invokes the Congressional Review Act  CRA   will be brought to the      Senate Floor for a debate and vote during the first two weeks after      the Senate reconvenes in September  following the August recess       This will be only the third time since its enactment that CRA will      have been used to attempt to override an agency rule  Contact       David Carle  202 224 3693  The text of the Leahy Snowe letter      follows         August 24  2005  Dear Colleague        We are writing to urge you to support Senate Joint Resolution 20      when it comes to the floor soon after Labor Day when the Senate      session resumes         Filed under the authority of the Congressional Review Act  S  J       Res  20 is a privileged resolution that would halt implementation of      the Environmental Protection Agencys controversial mercury rule  a      rule which would delay and weaken mercury emission standards      required by the Clean Air Act  This resolution would give EPA the      chance to fix these flaws and come back with a rule that would      better protect the American people and the nations streams  rivers       lakes  air and wildlife         Earlier this year EPA issued two new mercury emissions rules  The      first rule reverses a December 2000 finding by EPA which concluded      that mercury emissions from electric utility steam generating units      are     a threat to public health and the environment and that it      therefore is necessary and appropriate to require that each power      plant apply technology to reduce toxic mercury emissions  That      reversal has the effect of exempting all coal  and oil fired power      plants from the requirement to use maximum achievable control      technology  MACT  to reduce emissions of toxic air pollutants       including mercury  not later than 2008  Such an exemption is      permissible only if the Administrator follows the delisting process      established in the Clean Air Act  which EPA did not          In lieu of the specific statutory directive to control toxic mercury      emissions using MACT  EPAs second rule creates a toxics pollution      trading program that would not require any mercury specific      pollution reductions until 2018  at the earliest  This is despite a      recent GAO report which found that there are cost effective controls      that would make it possible to achieve 90 percent mercury emission      reductions  Such a rule leaves hundreds of plants using antiquated      control technology for two or more decades and significantly      increases the risk of toxic hotspots downwind of such plants         The toxicity of mercury has been proven time and again by scientists      here and around the world  EPAs own scientists found that some      630 000 infants were born in the United States in a 12 month period      in 1999 2000 with blood mercury levels higher than what is      considered safe  This is a doubling of previous      estimates  The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed      scientific research showing that maternal consumption of unsafe      levels of mercury in fish can cause neuro developmental harm in      children  resulting in learning disabilities  poor motor function       mental retardation  seizures and cerebral palsy         A recent study by Mt  Sinai Center for Children s Health and the      Environment added further evidence that EPAs plan to delay mercury      emissions reductions is woefully inadequate to address the real      threats that mercury poses in the daily lives of ordinary      Americans  The report calculated that the United States loses  1 3      billion annually in productivity from mercury emissions from U S       power plants  And an EPA funded  peer reviewed Harvard University      study recently found that more stringent limits on power plant      mercury pollution are both cost effective and necessary to protect      public health         Mercury emissions have also contaminated ten million acres of lakes      and 400 000 miles of streams  and they have triggered advisories      warning Americas 41 million recreational fishermen that the fish      they catch may not be safe to eat  Furthermore  evidence continues      to mount that mercury causes reproductive problems in wildfowl      populations  such as loon and mallard ducks  Other fish eating      wildlife populations are at risk as well         Regrettably  EPA has ignored this large and growing body of      scientific evidence that controlling toxic mercury is achievable and      warranted now  not a decade from now  The simple truth is that this      rule will allow more mercury into our environment longer than does      the current law  S  J  Res  20 will ensure that the health and      safety of the American people are fully considered  before EPA      rescinds its commitment to protect public health from the dangers of      mercury pollution  To leave EPAs mercury pollution rule in place      is a risk to the publics health that we need not  and should not       accept         We urge you to support S  J  Res  20  The Senate must send the      message that the Clean Air Act is to be interpreted and enforced in      a manner to expedite  not delay  protection of public health and the      environment         Sincerely   Patrick J       Leahy      Olympia J  Snowe United
