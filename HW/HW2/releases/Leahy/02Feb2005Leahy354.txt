       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To President Bush s State Of The Union  Address                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          State Of The Union        Comments       Senator Patrick Leahy       February 2  2005     The President is         setting a course that jettisons sound stewardship of         fiscal policy and of programs ranging from Social         Security to Amtrak     In record time the         Administrations policies already have converted         record surpluses into record deficits  and if these         new policies are enacted  the worst is yet to come          The Presidents policies will mean more and more         unprecedented new borrowing  and it simply has to         stop    These are policies         that go against our  New England grain The plan does nothing to address the shortfall         Social Security will face in 50 years  In fact it         will add  2 trillion to our national debt    much of         which will be held by foreign countries like China          It will slash future benefits in the name of         establishing private accounts  which would be capped         to limit individual earnings  This is a travesty         foisted upon those who now  and in the future          depend upon the most successful retirement security         program ever devised  We need to strengthen Social         Security  not privatize it     Iraqs         needs fare well in the Presidents priorities  but         Americas needs deserve to fare better  It is one         thing to be using our dollars to build schools and         hospitals in Iraq  but the President seems to have         forgotten that we need to build schools and         hospitals in America  We need to begin setting an         effective exit strategy to bring our troops home  so         that we can turn the keys of Iraq over to the Iraqi         people       The President has         earned the right to make his case for these         policies  but he was elected to represent all of the         people  and Congress and all of the American people         also deserve a voice in these decisions  I hope         that he will listen to other points of view during         the upcoming legislative process  and that  in the         end  common sense and the national interest will         prevail
