       Leahy Supports Sununu PATRIOT Improvement Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Supports Sununu PATRIOT      Improvement Bill        As Chief Senate Negotiator Of      2001 PATRIOT Law      Leahy Will Continue To Push To Make PATRIOT Better       WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Feb  15   Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt         the ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  announced      Wednesday that he will support a bill introduced by Senator John      Sununu   R N H    amending the USA PATRIOT Act        Leahy  the chief Senate negotiator of the original PATRIOT Act of      2001  partnered with Sununu and a bipartisan group of senators over      the last several months to improve a proposed House Senate      conference agreement on a bill to renew and rewrite parts of the      2001 law        In the end  the White House locked Leahy and other Democratic      conferees out of the final negotiations with Republican senators       but some of Leahys suggested improvements survived that partisan      hijacking and are reflected in Sununus bill  Those improvements      include stripping out a requirement compelling Americans to tell the      FBI when they seek legal counsel and adding a provision clarifying      that libraries engaged in traditional activities will not be subject      to secret search orders by the government        Leahy voted for the bipartisan Senate version of the PATRIOT Act      reauthorization bill but opposed the House Senate conference      agreement  Leahy indicated Wednesday that while he will vote for the      Sununu bill  he will continue to vote against the conference report      because it falls short of protecting both the security and liberty      of the American people        Leahys statement on the Sununu bill follows    Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee on the Judiciary  On PATRIOT Act Reauthorization     February 15  2006 Mr  LEAHY  Mr       President  as one of the authors of the original USA PATRIOT Act  as      someone who voted to reauthorize an improved version of the Act back      in July 2005  and as an American concerned with our security  I am      glad that we are making progress  but I have some misgivings about      the bill being considered today  I will vote to proceed and hope      there is an opportunity to improve the bill and the PATRIOT Act      reauthorization even further   I believe that      the PATRIOT Act provides important and valuable tools for the      protection of Americans from terrorism  These matters should be      governed by law and not by whim  Legislative action should be the      clear and unambiguous legal footing for Government powers    I am glad that      the sunsets that Congressman Armey and I insisted be included in the      2001 Act brought about reconsideration and some refinement of the      powers authorized in that measure  Those      sunsets contributed to congressional oversight  Without them I      expect the Bush Administration would have stonewalled our requests      for information and for review of the way they were implementing the      statute  The sunsets were the reason we have been going through a      review and renewal process over the last few months  Now the      challenge to Congress is to provide the effective oversight that      will be needed in the days ahead and to ensure that there is      effective court review of actions that affect the rights of      Americans  Several specific      provisions of this bill reflect modest improvement over both the      original PATRIOT Act and the reauthorization proposal initially      produced by the House Senate conference  It is with these      improvements in mind that I will support Senator Sununus bill   These      improvements  like those contained in the conference report  were      hard won  The Bush Administration pursued its usual strategy of      demanding sweeping Executive powers and resisting checks and      balances  As usual  it was short on bipartisan dialogue and long on      partisan rhetoric  And as usual  the Republican majorities in the      House and Senate did their utmost to follow the White Houses      directives and prevent any breakout of bipartisanship  But a ray of      bipartisanship did break out  and this reauthorization package is      the better for it  Senator Sununus      bill modifies a provision I objected to that would have required      American citizens to tell the FBI before they exercise their right      as Americans to seek the advice of counsel  Chairman Specter and I      worked together to correct this provision and Senator Sununu has      improved it further  I commend his efforts in this regard    Another important      change provided by the Sununu bill builds upon another objection I      had and an idea I shared with him to ensure that libraries engaged      in their customary and traditional activities not be subject to      national security letters as Internet service providers  This is a      matter I first raised and feel very strongly about  I commend      Senator Sununu for the progress he has been able to make in this      regard  The bill is intended to clarify that libraries as they      traditionally and currently function are not electronic service      providers  and may not be served with NSLs for business records      simply because they provide Internet access to their patrons  Under      this clarification  a library may be served with an NSL only if it      functions as a true Internet Service Provider  as by providing      services to persons located outside the premises of the library  but      this is an unlikely scenario  In most if not all cases  if the      Government wants to review library records for foreign intelligence      purposes  it will need a court order to do so  The language I      proposed to Senator Sununu in this regard was less ambiguous than      that to which the Bush Administration would agree  Still  my      intent  Senator Sununus intent and the intent of Congress is this      regard should be clear  It is to strengthen the meaning and ensure      proper implementation of this provision that I will support this      bill  As a supporter I trust my intent will inform those charged      with implementing the bill and reviewing its proper implementation  It is regrettable      that the Bush Administration would not engage all of us in a      bipartisan conversation on ways we could improve the bill  The      White House Counsel only spoke to the Republican Senators  In that      setting  they negotiated to achieve what they viewed as      improvements  It is less than we would have liked  I know that the      Republican Senators who worked on this bill were well intentioned      and I commend their efforts  Regrettably  I note that one set of      changes included in this bill I strongly oppose   The Bush      Administration has used the last round of discussions with      Republican Senators to make the gag order provisions worse in my      view by forbidding any challenge for one year  The Bush      Administration has simply refused to listen to reason on this and      insists on this thumb on the scale of justice  In addition  the      bill continues and cements into law procedures that in my view      unfairly determine challenges to gag orders  The bill allows the      Government to ensure itself of victory by declaring that  in its      view  disclosure may endanger national security or may interfere      with diplomatic relations  This is the type of provision to which I      have never agreed in connection with national security letters or      Section 215 orders  It will serve to prevent meaningful judicial      review of gag orders and  in my view  is wrong   I will continue      to work to improve the PATRIOT Act  I will work to provide better      oversight of the use of national security letters and to remove the      un American restraints on meaningful judicial review  I will seek      to monitor how sensitive personal information from medical files       gun stores and libraries are obtained  used  and retained  While we      have made some progress  much is left to be done   In 2001  I fought      for time to provide some balance to Attorney General Ashcrofts      demands that the Bush Administrations anti terrorism bill be      enacted in a week  We worked hard for six weeks to make that bill      better and were able to include the sunset provisions that      contributed to reconsideration of several provisions over the last      several months  Last year I worked with Chairman Specter and all      the Members of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate to pass a      reauthorization bill in July  As we proceeded into the House Senate      conference on the measure  the Bush Administration and congressional      Republicans locked Democratic conferees out of their deliberations      and wrote the final bill  That was wrong  In December  working      with a bipartisan group of Senators  we were able to urge      reconsideration of that final bill  Senators Sununu and Craig were      able to use that opportunity to make some improvements  I commend      them for what they were able to achieve and hope that my support for      their efforts has been helpful  I wish that along the way the Bush      Administration had shown a similar interest in working together to      get to the best law we could for the American people  When the      publics security and liberty interests are at stake  it seems      especially prudent and compelling to me that every effort should be      made to proceed on a bipartisan basis toward constructive      solutions  Instead  the White House has chosen once again to try to      politicize the situation  Since the      conference was hijacked  I have tried to get this measure back on      the right track  We have been able to achieve some improvements       and that is no small feat given the resistance by this White House      to bipartisan suggestions  I regret that this bill is not better      and that the intransigence of the Bush Administration has prevented      a better balance and better protections for the American people  I      will continue to work to provide the tools that we need to protect      the American people  I will continue to work to provide the      oversight and checks needed on the use of Government power and will      seek to improve this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act
