       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On President Bush s First Judicial   Nominees Of The 110th Congress                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comments Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt        On President Bushs First Judicial Nominees Of The 110th      Congress     January 9  2007   The White House Counsels office      notified me today that the President will not be renominating some      of his more controversial judicial nominees    President Bush has made the right      decision in not resubmitting these controversial and problematic      nominees who failed to win confirmation from a Republican controlled      Senate   It is unfortunate that we have lost      many months of valuable time on these earlier false starts  time the      Senate could have spent making progress on filling vacancies with      qualified consensus nominees  There are several outstanding      judicial emergencies that I and other Democratic senators have been      working with Republicans to fill since last year  Regrettably  we      have been unable to make progress because of opposition from some on      the other side of the aisle  I hope to expeditiously address some      of these emergency vacancies in the Judiciary Committee    This new Congress presents an      opportunity for a fresh start on judicial nominations  one that      emphasizes qualifications and bipartisan consensus over political      game playing  The Presidents decision not to push ahead with these      controversial nominees  as he has done in the past  is a welcome      beginning  I look forward to the President working with both      Democratic and Republican Senators on filling judicial vacancies by      consensus with qualified nominees
