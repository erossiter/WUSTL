       Leahy Leads Bipartisan Coalition To Protect Genuine Refugees From The   Unintended Effects Of  Material Support Law                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Leahy Leads Bipartisan Coalition To Protect Genuine Refugees      From The Unintended Effects Of Material Support Law         Bipartisan Amendment To Immigration Bill      Would Close Loophole That Prevents Victims of Threats And       Coercion       From Seeking U S  Asylum  Statement of Senator       Patrick Leahy      On The       Leahy Coleman Kennedy Sununu Lieberman Chafee Harkin Bingaman       Amendment   4117      To S 2611  The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Bill      U S  Senate      May 23  2006  The bipartisan       amendment I offer today with Senators Coleman  Kennedy  Sununu        Lieberman  Chafee  Harkin  and Bingaman will help to alleviate       the harsh  illogical and unintended consequences of changes made       to our immigration laws after September 11  The laws were       modified in the interest of protecting national security  but       the Congress cast such a wide net that we are now preventing our       government from granting asylum to legitimate refugees who have       been the victims of persecution    The PATRIOT Act       and the subsequent REAL ID Act modified definitions of       terrorist activity and material support in order to block       entry into the United States of individuals who assist terrorist       organizations  On its face  that made sense  No one wants       terrorists or their supporters to come here as refugees   But the new law       failed to recognize that many foreigners  including children        are forced against their will to give food  shelter or other       assistance to terrorist groups    It also defined       terrorist organization so broadly that groups that are NOT       engaged in activities against civilians  freedom fighters that       the U S  Government once provided training and other material       support to  like the Montagnards in Vietnam  are also caught       in this broad definition    Our amendment       would bring American laws once again into line with American       values  It would give U S  officials the ability to separate       the victims from the aggressors  and it will bring our       immigration laws into harmony with our governments foreign       policy  We can prevent the entry of those who would do America       harm without closing our borders to genuine refugees who       urgently need our help   Let me give a few       examples  for anyone who might question whether this amendment       is necessary  A 13 year old girl is kidnapped  forced to become       a member of the Lords Resistance Army in Uganda  and to become       a soldier and the wife of one of the commanders  Obviously        she is a victim  but she is ineligible for admission as a       refugee under current law  That is wrong  In fact  its       immoral    The same goes for       people who have been forced to provide material support to the       FARC  a terrorist group in Colombia  The support they gave was       digging graves for other victims of the terrorists or giving       them food  all of which was done under threat of torture and       death  Or a Liberian woman who was kidnapped by a rebel group       and forced to serve as a sex slave  Because she was also forced       to cook and do laundry for the rebels  under current law she       provided material support  That makes absolutely no sense  We       are punishing her for being a victim when what she needs is       asylum    People who are       barred for supporting a terrorist organization  which is       broadly defined as any group of two or more people fighting a       government  includes refugees who our own government has long       supported  Vietnamese Montagnards  who supported the United       States 35 years ago  are barred  Members of the Karen tribe       fighting against the Burmese junta  are barred  Some       anti Castro Cubans are barred  Afghans who fought with the       Northern Alliance and even the NATO soldiers who trained them        are barred  We never intended this   After eight months       of inter agency inertia  the Secretary of State recently issued       a waiver for one group of Burmese refugees who live in a refugee       camp in Thailand  The use of the waiver authority was long       overdue and I welcomed the Secretarys action  But the waiver       was too limited  and will help only a minority of those       deserving help  who are waiting to be resettled here  When the       waiver was issued  the State Department asserted that it did NOT       plan to extend it to other groups in the near future        Infighting between Executive Branch agencies is preventing       people who have been victimized in the most brutal ways from       obtaining asylum    The bipartisan       amendment that we offer today modifies the law so that before       the overly broad definition of a terrorist organization is       applied to a group of two or more individuals  the Secretary of       State must determine that that group engages in terrorist       activity which poses a threat to U S  nationals or the national       security of the United States  That is the right balance  It       protects our security  and it provides sanctuary for victims of       repression   The amendment       ensures that the waiver in current law is available to asylum       seekers who were forced to join terrorist groups or to provide       material support against their will  Completely innocent       victims of ethnic and other forms of violence and repression are       being denied asylum for engaging in the very activity that they       were forced to engage in  even though they pose no threat to our       national security  They deserve our compassion  Let us bring       our laws back in line with our values                    Summary Of       Leahy Coleman Amendment   4117      To Protect Genuine Refugees From Unintended Consequences      Of The Material Support Law  The Leahy Coleman       amendment gives greater discretion to the Administration to       permit the admission of genuine refugees  while making clear       that no refugee is admissible who poses a threat to national       security   The Leahy Coleman       amendment does two things      Gives        discretion to the Secretary of State  in consultation with        the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security  to        admit members of such groups as the Burmese Karen or the        Montagnards  if they do not pose a threat to the security of        U S  nationals or the national security of the United        States      Gives        discretion to the Secretary of State  in consultation with        the Attorney General and Secretary of Homeland Security  to        admit individuals who have been the victims of coercion and        threats  provided they also pose no threat to the security        of U S  nationals or the national security of the U S             Current law bars       admission to the U S  of any member of a terrorist       organization  which is defined broadly in the REAL ID act to       include two or more individuals who engage in any terrorist       activity or provide material support to such an organization        The law provides a waiver for the Secretary of State  but not       for membership in such an organization    The result is that       groups that fall within the broad definition of a terrorist       organization include the Vietnamese Montagnards  who the U S        trained and supported  the Karen National Front who are fighting       the Burmese junta and who the U S  also supports  certain Cuban       democracy activists  and even members of the Afghan Northern       Alliance who the U S  supported    The effect of       current law has also been to deny admission to genuine refugees       who have been forced against their will to join or support       terrorist organizations  for example  to provide food  shelter       or other support under threat of death
