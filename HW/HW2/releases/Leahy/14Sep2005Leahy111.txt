       Leahy And Specter Team Up To Introduce Anti Counterfeiting Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT             Leahy And      Specter Team Up To Introduce Anti Counterfeiting Bill    Bipartisan      Bill Closes Loophole     That Lets Some Counterfeiters Escape Liabilities  Stiffens      Penalties  WASHINGTON  Wed   Sept  14   Sens       Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Arlen Specter  R Pa   Wednesday joined      together to introduce a bill  with Senators Bayh  D Ind         Brownback  R Kan    Cornyn  R Texas   DeWine  R Ohio   Feingold       D Wis    Hatch  R Utah   Levin  D Mich    Reed  D R I         Stabenow  D Mich    and Voinovich  R Ohio   that will strengthen      current laws to combat counterfeiting  It is the second piece      of bipartisan anti counterfeiting legislation Leahy has      introduced this year    The Stop Counterfeiting in      Manufactured Goods Act will make it a crime to traffic in      counterfeit labels or packaging  even when shipped separately      from the products to which they are later attached     This bill takes aim at the savvy      counterfeiters who have exploited a key loophole to escape      liability for their crimes  Leahy said  The bill also directs      courts to confiscate counterfeit goods and other property used      to facilitate counterfeiting when a person is convicted using      the law  Leahy has led efforts in Congress to crack down on      different forms of intellectual property theft  including      counterfeiting  These crimes have a significant impact on the     Vermont and U S       economies  According to some estimates  between 5 and 7 percent      of worldwide trade is in counterfeit goods  and because the      United States is the world leader in intellectual property  a      disproportionate share falls on the shoulders of U S       industries   Leahy and Cornyn earlier this year      introduced another anti counterfeiting measure  S  1095       the Protecting American Goods and Services Act                 Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy     Introduction Of The Stop Counterfeiting In Manufactured Goods      Act     September 14  2005  MR  LEAHY  Counterfeiting is a      threat to America  It wreaks real harm on our      economy  our workers  and our consumers  Today  Senator Specter      and I introduce the Stop Counterfeiting in Manufactured Goods      Act  a tough bill that will give law enforcement improved tools      to fight this form of theft  The bill is short and      straight forward  but its impact should be profound and      far reaching    It is all too easy to think of      counterfeiting as a victimless crime  a means of buying      sunglasses or a purse that would otherwise strain a monthly      budget  The reality  however  is far different  According to      the Federal Bureau of Investigation  counterfeiting costs the     U S  between  200 billion and  250 billion      annually  In Vermont  companies like Burton Snowboards  Vermont      Tubbs  SB Electronics  and Hubbardton Forge  all of which have      cultivated their good names through pure hard work and      creativity  have felt keenly the damage of intellectual      property theft on their businesses  This is wrong  It is      simply not fair to the businesses who innovate and to the people      whose economic livelihoods depend on these companies    The threat posed by counterfeiting      is more than a matter of economics  Inferior products can      threaten the safety of those who use them  When a driver taps a      cars brake pedals there should be no uncertainty about whether      the brake linings are made of compressed grass  sawdust  or      cardboard  Sick patients should not have to that they will      ingest counterfeit prescription drugs and  at best  have no      effect  The World Health Organization estimates that the market      for counterfeit drugs is about  32 billion each year  Knock off      parts have even been found in NATO helicopters  Whats more       according to Interpol  there is an identifiable link between      counterfeit goods and the financing of terrorist operations    This is a global problem  and it      demands global solutions  Earlier this year at a Judiciary      Committee hearing on international piracy  the General Counsel      for the United States Trade Representative reported that  China continues to see piracy rates of about ninety      percent in nearly all industries  Russia is a growing concern      too  even as that country seeks membership in the World Trade      Organization  Both countries were added to USTRs Priority      Watch List this year  Such lists are useful  but they are      meaningless without concrete steps by the countries singled out      by USTR  We know that counterfeiting can be fought when a      country treats it as a priority  China  for example  flexed its      intellectual property enforcement muscle recently in protecting      logos related to Beijings 2008 Summer Olympic Games  In a      Newsweek International article last January  one vendor who was      fined for selling Olympic t shirts noted that the crackdown was      concerted  They are  she says  very serious    I am very serious as well  Even      as we work toward better international enforcement  there is      much we can do  and much that we have done  to improve domestic      law  In 1996  I worked with Senator Hatch to pass the      Anticounterfeiting Consumer Protection Act  which strengthened      our criminal and tariff codes and applied federal racketeering      laws to counterfeiting  And earlier this year  Senator Cornyn      and I introduced S  1095  the Protecting American      Goods and Services Act  That bill would criminalize possession      of counterfeit goods with intent to traffic  expand the      definition of traffic  and criminalize the importing and      exporting of counterfeit goods    The bill that Senator Specter and      I are introducing today also makes several improvements to the      U S  Code  The bill strengthens 18 U S C  2318  the part of the      criminal code that deals with counterfeit goods and services  to      make it a crime to traffic in counterfeit labels or packaging       even when counterfeit labels or packaging are shipped separately      from the goods to which they will ultimately be attached  Savvy      counterfeiters have exploited this loophole to escape      liability  This bill closes that loophole    The bill will also make      counterfeit labels and goods  and any equipment used in      facilitating a crime under this part of the code  subject to      forfeiture upon conviction  Any forfeited goods or machinery      would then be destroyed  and the convicted infringer would have      to pay restitution to the lawful owner of the trademark       Finally  although the bill is tough  it is also fair  It states      that nothing shall entitle the United States to      bring a cause of action under this section for the repackaging      of genuine goods or services  not intended to      deceive or confuse  It is truly just the bad actors we want to      punish    Those who profit from anothers      innovation have proved their creativity only at escaping      responsibility for their actions  As legislators it is      important that we provide law enforcement with the tools needed      to capture these thieves  It is a task to which Senator Specter      and I are both committed  I would like to thank Senator Bayh       Senator Brownback  Senator Cornyn  Senator DeWine  Senator      Feingold  Senator Hatch  Senator Levin  Senator Reed  Senator      Stabenow  and Senator Stabenow for cosponsoring this important      legislation
