       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Samuel Alito To   Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee        On The Nomination Of Samuel Alito       To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court      Monday  October 31  2005  This is a needlessly provocative       nomination  Instead of uniting the country through his choice        the President has chosen to reward one faction of his party  at       the risk of dividing the country  Instead he should have       rewarded the American people  America could have done better       through consultation to select one of the many consensus       conservative Republican candidates who could have been       overwhelmingly approved by the Senate   Last week  the President succumbed       to the partisan pressure from the extreme right wing by       withdrawing the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme       Court  In doing that  the President allowed his choice to be       vetoed by an extreme faction within his party  before hearings       or a vote  With turmoil engulfing the White House  with no way       out of the disastrous and deadly occupation of Iraq  with a       worsening federal debt  and with obscenely high profits that       continue to pile up for the Administrations Big Oil friends        catering to an extreme wing of one political party risks       removing checks and balances for the majority of Americans  It       is unfortunate that the President felt he was in such a weak       position that he had to bend to a narrow but vocal faction of       his political base  The Supreme Court is the ultimate check and       balance in our system that protects the fundamental rights of       all Americans    The Miers nomination was an       eye opening experience for the country to see what a vocal       faction of the Republican Party really wants  This experience       exposed the right wing litmus test that they insist be used        rather than selecting judges and justices who will be fair and       impartial in applying the law  They  in fact  demand judges who       will guarantee the results that they want    With the announcement of Judge       Samuel Alito to fill the position being vacated by Justice       OConnor  the White House failed to follow through with initial       discussions and engage in meaningful consultation  The       Democratic Leader of the Senate and I wrote to the President       last week  urging him to pick one of the many qualified       mainstream women and minority candidates who can win widespread       bipartisan support in the Senate and among the American people        I regret that the President has not chosen the clear path of a       consensus candidate to unite the American people and the       Senate  The nation and the Senate would have overwhelmingly       welcomed his choice if he had    I have not formed a final judgment       as to the merits of this nomination  although a review of Judge       Alitos record suggests areas of significant concern  Judge       Alitos record on the bench demonstrates that he would go to       great lengths to restrict the authority of Congress to enact       legislation to protect civil rights and the rights of workers        consumers and women  Judge Alito has also set unreasonably high       standards that ordinary Americans who are the victims of       discrimination must meet before being allowed to proceed with       their cases    The stakes for the American people       could not be higher with this new nomination to the Supreme       Court  Justice OConnor brought an open mind to the cases she       reviewed and served as a moderating influence on the Court  The       person who replaces her replaces a pivotal vote on our nations       most powerful court  The person who replaces her has the       potential to dramatically tilt the courts balance  Maintaining       the stability of the court is crucial for the nation and will be       an important factor for me as I consider this nomination         At this critical moment  and in       light of the circumstances that led to the withdrawal of the       Miers nomination  Senate Democrats will perform our       constitutional Advice and Consent responsibility with heightened       vigilance  The Supreme Court is the guarantor of the rights of       all Americans  The appointment must be made in the nations       interest  not to serve the special interests of any partisan       faction
