       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The President s Call For A Troop Surge  In Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT            Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   On The Presidents Call For A Troop Surge In Iraq   Wednesday  January 10  2007 Escalating the use    of U S  troops in a widening civil war in Iraq would take us further in    the wrong direction  It would put even more Americans in danger  it    goes against the advice of our key military commanders on the ground in    Iraq  and it would make it more difficult to begin bringing our troops    home  The President has    ignored the advice of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group as well as of our    military commanders who have counseled against further escalation of    this civil war  The Iraqi government needs to assume more    responsibility for their countrys security  and other countries in the    region should be directly asked to help stabilize Iraq  Expanding our    presence in Iraq sends exactly the wrong message    The President    still does not seem to realize that the history of the mess in Iraq is a    litany of bad choices  We should not compound those mistakes with yet    another wrong turn  Our armed    services  including the National Guard and Reserves  are already    stretched to the breaking point  Beginning to bring them home would    begin relieving those pressures on our force structure  as well as on    our troops and their families  The American    people expect the Congress to help end our involvement in the Iraq civil    war  not to partner with the White House in prolonging the war  We    should not consent to postponing the tough decisions that need to be    faced sooner  rather than later
