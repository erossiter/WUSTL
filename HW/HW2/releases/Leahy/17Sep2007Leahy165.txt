Improving Student Testing Act Moves Away     From High Stakes Testing As The Primary Measure of Achievement   WASHINGTON  Monday  Sept  17   U S  Senators     Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Russ Feingold  D Wis   introduced the     Improving Student Testing Act today to amend the No Child Left Behind  NCLB      Act  Feingold and Leahys legislation focuses on improving the quality     of assessments used to measure student achievement in our nations     schools  The legislation also encourages states to move away from     high stakes testing in reading and math as the primary measure of     student achievement  Feingold and Leahy  who were among the ten     Senators who opposed NCLB when it was passed in 2001  plan to push for     changes during the reauthorization of NCLB   Time and again I have heard from Vermonters that     No Child Left Behinds cookie cutter approach is not working for the     students in our state  said Leahy  To raise the bar the right way for     schools and students  states need the flexibility to design     accountability measures that accurately reflect actual conditions and     unique characteristics in real communities  A model that works for an     urban school might be completely different than one that works for     Vermonts smaller  rural schools  We need to move away from a focus on     penalties and failure  and toward a focus on the quality instruction     that our children truly need to succeed   The federal governments one size fits all     education policy under No Child Left Behind is the wrong approach  said     Feingold  Five years after the passage of NCLB  it is clear much work     remains to be done to close the achievement gap that exists in our     schools  Our legislation will ensure that the federal government leaves     decisions that affect our childrens day to day classroom experiences up     to the classroom educators  local districts  and the states   Feingold and Leahys Improving Student Testing Act     of 2007 implements the following reforms to NCLB    o    Provides grants to help promote stronger assessments of     student learning  This funding will help encourage states to move away     from accountability systems based primarily on standardized test scores     in order to better take into account the diverse academic needs of all     students    o    Reforms the annual federal testing mandate to allow annual     assessments at least once in grades 3 5  6 9  and 10 12 for federal     accountability purposes  instead of the current requirement for annual     testing in grades 3 8 and once in high school    o    Waives the 2014 deadline for 100 percent student     proficiency if Congress doesnt fully fund Title I formula grants  the     largest source of NCLB funding    o    Provides grants to states and local districts to help them     develop better accountability systems  including developing increased     infrastructure to use growth models and multiple measures of assessment     in state accountability systems as well as implement school improvement     programs in local schools    o    Reforms the federal peer review process of state testing     and accountability systems    o    Requires states to report graduation rates by NCLBs     student subgroups to provide more information about schools to parents     and educators    o    Protects the privacy of students personal information     within state data systems   Feingold and Leahys bill is supported by the     American Association of School Administrators  the National Association     of
