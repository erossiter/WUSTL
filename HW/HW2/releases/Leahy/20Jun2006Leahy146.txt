       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The McCarran Ferguson Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       Hearing On The McCarran Ferguson Act       Implications Of Repealing The Insurers  Antitrust Exemption      June 20  2006  As far back as 1945        the insurance industry has operated largely beyond the reach of       federal antitrust laws  The McCarran Ferguson Act created this       exemption  and so long as the insurance business is regulated by       the states  there is no room for federal oversight  Perhaps       this was well advised legislation at the time  and perhaps it       served worthwhile policy  But times changed   A common refrain of tort reform       proponents is that out of control juries and large malpractice       awards drive insurance costs higher  Medical professionals  we       are told  are being crushed by the excessive costs of       insurance  Just recently  the Senate considered legislation to       cap punitive damage awards in medical malpractice cases  Yet        among the 15 best rated medical malpractice       insurance providers  premiums rose dramatically between 2000 and       2005 while the cost of claims paid out remained flat  If claims       are not driving premiums  but insurance costs among competing       companies are rising in lockstep with each other  it is time to       admit that there are other causes of this problem   I have introduced a bill  S  1525        The Medical Malpractice Insurance Antitrust Act of 2005  along       with Senators Kennedy  Durbin  Rockefeller  Boxer  Feingold        Salazar  Obama  and Mikulski  This bill would repeal the       antitrust exemption for medical malpractice insurance  and only       for the most egregious cases of price fixing  bid rigging  and       market allocation  It is a narrow bill that targets a       particularly troublesome aspect of the problem  but I believe       that we should consider all of the effects of the exemption as       we consider legislation   If insurers around the country are       operating in an honest and appropriate way  they should not       object to being answerable under the same federal antitrust laws       as virtually all other businesses  American consumers  from       sophisticated multi national businesses to individuals shopping       for personal insurance  have the right to be confident that the       cost of their insurance reflects competitive market conditions        not collusive behavior    I recognize that the insurance       industry has unique characteristics  including the dependence on       collective claim and loss data  but I am confident that we can       accommodate those legitimate needs while still providing Federal       regulators with the tools to investigate and prevent collusion       and other anticompetitive behavior  Individuals and businesses       are compelled  sometimes by the law and sometimes by prudence        to purchase many kinds of insurance  We must ensure that those       citizens are being treated fairly  and that the providers of the       product are not stifling competition in the marketplace     I thank our panel for their       testimony today  and I also thank Chairman Specter for his       efforts in convening this hearing
