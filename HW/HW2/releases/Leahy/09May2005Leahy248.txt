       Floor Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy Marking Four Years Since   President Bush s Announcement Of First Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Floor Remarks Of Senator      Patrick Leahy     Marking Four Years Since     President Bushs Announcement Of First Judicial Nominees     United States Senate May 9  2005  Four years ago a lot of things were      different in this country    Gas prices  unemployment  the number      of uninsured  the nations budget and trade deficits were all lower       and judicial vacancies were higher  In four short years  there has      been quite a turnaround  Unemployment has increased by 26 percent       The price of gas has skyrocketed by 57 percent  The trade deficit      has grown from  36 billion to  61 billion  and the number of      uninsured Americans has increased by 10 percentage points  One of      the few indicators that gets talked about around here that has gone      down is the number of vacancies on our federal judiciary  Four      years ago the vacancy rate on our federal courts was nearly 10      percent  but today it is half that at only 5 percent  Ninety five      percent of the federal judiciary is filled  And 95 percent of this      Presidents nominees have been confirmed  208 out of 218   Most observers would have to say that      95 percent is pretty good record  The President himself admitted to      me hed be pretty happy if he had that record as the owner of a      baseball team  and I think objectively anyone would concede that      getting 95 percent of his judicial nominees is not a bad record for      any President  I have come here to talk about judges today  and to      look at how things have changed over the past four years because it      was four years ago today that we began this difficult process of      considering President Bushs judicial nominees    Four years ago today  on  May 9  2001  I went to the White House in a gesture of      cooperation to hear the President announce his first judicial      nominations  Some criticized me for going  but I wanted to indicate      my willingness to work with the new President  After all  during      the campaign he had told the American people he wanted to be a      uniter  not a divider  He had lost the popular vote in a      much disputed 2000 election  and the country was deeply divided  I      hoped that he would be a President who would understand the need to      work across the aisle and to bring people together and to consult      with both Democratic and Republican Senators  I thought that      judicial nominations  particularly those to the important circuit      courts where Republicans had prevented almost two dozen of President      Clintons qualified and moderate nominees from being considered       would be a good place to start    Unfortunately  that was not what      President Bush had in mind  The nominations that President Bush      announced that spring day  four years ago  were largely      controversial  confrontational choices  Although I was then the      Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and was      soon to become the Committees Chair  the White House had not      reached out to discuss any of these controversial nominees      beforehand  By and large  home state Senators had not been      consulted about the nominees  nor had any sort of bipartisan       independent group of attorneys or legal scholars  That was the      Presidents choice and has  unfortunately  remained his way of      identifying and selecting nominees to be lifetime judicial      appointments to the federal bench  This White House appears to rely      on a tight circle of Federalist Society members  Republican Party      activists and law professors steeped in ideology  This President      has nominated what may be the most ideological driven group of      nominees ever presented to the Senate at one time   Typically  when a President selects      nominations to the circuit courts  he consults at length with      home state Senators and the Senate leadership to ensure that those      selected will be considered favorably by the Senate and confirmed       That has not been the true with this Administration  By way of      example  I cannot recall a single occasion during which this      President picked up the phone to discuss these judicial nominations      during the entire four and a half years that he has been President         not at the beginning of his Administration  not during the 17      months that I chaired the Senate Judiciary Committee  and not      since    That stands in sharp contrast to      traditional practice dating back to George Washington and  in      particular  to the manner in which President Clinton had worked with      Senator Hatch when he was the Ranking Minority Member of the Senate      Judiciary Committee or its Chair  Not only were President Clinton       his White House Counsel and his staff in regular contact with      Senator Hatch and his staff  with respect to the most important      nominations  the President and he had direct  meaningful      consultation  In his book  Square Peg  for example  Senator Hatch      wrote that he had several opportunities to talk privately with      President Clinton about a variety of issues  especially judicial      nominations    He described how  when the first      Supreme Court vacancy arose during the Clinton      presidency in 1993  it was not a surprise when the President called      to talk about the appointment and what he was thinking of doing       Senator Hatch went on to describe that the President was thinking of      nominating someone who would require a tough  political battle but      that he advised President Clinton to consider other candidates       According to his book  Senator Hatch suggested then D C  Circuit      Judge Ruth Bader Ginsburg  as well as then First Circuit Judge      Stephen Breyer  They were nominated to fill the vacancies that      arose on the Supreme Court in 1993 and 1994  Both were approved by      the Senate with strong  bipartisan support  Justice Ginsburg was      confirmed by a vote on 96 3  Justice Breyer was confirmed by a vote      of 87 9    That sort of consultation did not      occur before this Presidents initial nominations were made four      years ago  and I am sorry it did not  If he had asked my opinion on      the 11 names sent to the Senate four years ago  I would have offered      candid advice about what going ahead with their nominations could      entail  Whether or not my views would have made a difference  I      cannot say  Having never inquired or had them to consider  neither      can the President   Sadly  this lack of consultation was      not just the situation for these first nominations  it has continued      to this day  Senate Democrats have not stopped trying to offer the      advice called for by the Constitution and have never stopped being      available to help in the selection process  Just a few weeks ago       on April 11  the Democratic Leader and I wrote to the President      offering to help with the more than two dozen current judicial      vacancies for which the President has not yet sent a nomination to      the Senate  We urged him to disavow the nuclear option in favor      of working with us to identify consensus judicial candidates who      could be confirmed easily and who would be fair  impartial judges      that would preserve the independence of the judiciary  The number      of current judicial vacancies without a nominee has since risen to      29  It is now May  we are more than a third of the way through the      year  and the President has still sent only one new judicial      nomination to the Senate all year  Meanwhile almost a month has      passed and Senator Reid and I have yet to receive the courtesy of a      reply to our offer to help and to work together  Unilateralism has      become their standard operating practice  and abuse of power has      become increasingly common  Indeed  to this day I have yet to meet       talk to or even receive a telephone call from the Presidents new      White House Counsel  The go it alone conduct of this Administration      makes clear that this President has little use of the Senates role      in the constitutional process of selecting federal judges     Under pressure from the White House       over the last two years  the former Republican Chairman of the      Judiciary Committee led Senate Republicans in breaking with      longstanding precedent and Senate tradition  With the Senate and      the White House under control of the same political party we have      witnessed Committee rule after Committee rule broken or      misinterpreted away  The Framers of the Constitution warned against      the dangers of such factionalism  undermining the structural      separation of powers  Republicans in the Senate have utterly failed      to defend this institutions role as a check on the President in the      area of nominations  It surely weakens our constitutional design of      checks and balances    As I have detailed elsewhere  the list      of broken rules and precedents is long    from the way that      home state Senators were treated  to the way hearings were      scheduled  to the way the Committee questionnaire was unilaterally      altered  to the way the Judiciary Committees historic protection of      the minority by Committee Rule IV was repeatedly violated  In the      last Congress  the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee      destroyed virtually every custom and courtesy that had been used      throughout Senate history to help create and enforce cooperation and      civility in the confirmation process    We suffered through three years during      which Republican staff stole Democratic files off the Judiciary      computers during what has been a by any means necessary approach       Their approach to our rules and precedents follows their own      partisan version of the Golden Rule  which is that he with the      gold  rules  That has not been helpful to the process  the Senate      or the country  It is as if those currently in power believe that      that they are above our constitutional checks and balances and that      they can reinterpret any treaty  law  rule  custom or practice they      do not like or they find inconvenient    Some of these interpretations are so      contrary to well established understandings that it is like we have      fallen down the rabbit hole in Alice in Wonderland       I am reminded that the imperious Queen of Hearts rebuked Alice for      having insufficient imagination to believe contradictory things       saying that some days she had believed six impossible things before      breakfast  I have seen things I thought impossible on the Judiciary      Committee during the last few years  things impossible to square      with the past practices of Committee and the history of the Senate       Our Committee is entrusted by the Senate to help determine whether      judicial nominees will follow the law  It is unfortunate that the      Committee that judges the judges has not followed its own rules but      has bent or broken them to achieve a predetermined result    Under our Constitution  the Senate has      an important role in the selection of our judiciary  The brilliant      design of our Founders established that the first two branches of      government would work together to equip the third branch to serve as      an independent arbiter of justice  As columnist George Will once      wrote  A proper constitution distributes power among legislative       executive and judicial institutions so that the will of the majority      can be measured  expressed in policy and  for the protection of      minorities  somewhat limited  The structure of our Constitution      and our own Senate rules of self governance are designed to protect      minority rights and to encourage consensus  Despite the razor thin      margin of recent elections  the majority party is not acting in a      measured way but in complete disregard for the traditions of      bipartisanship that are the hallmark of the Senate  It has acted to      ignore precedents and reinterpret longstanding rules to its      advantage  This practice of might makes right is wrong     Now the White Houses hand picked      Majority Leader seems intent on removing the one Senate protection      left for the minority  the protection of debate in accordance with      the longstanding tradition of the Senate and its Standing Rules  In      order to remove the last remaining vestige of protection for the      minority  the Republican majority is poised to break the Senate      Rules and end the filibuster with the votes of the barest of      majorities  They seem intent on doing this to force through the      Senate this Presidents most controversial and divisive judicial      nominees    As the Reverend Martin Luther King      wrote in his famous Letter from a Birmingham Jail  Let us consider      a more concrete example of just and unjust laws  An unjust law is a      code that a numerical or power majority group compels a minority      group to obey but does not make binding on itself  This is      difference made legal  By the same token  a just law is a code that      a majority compels a minority to follow and that it is willing to      follow itself  This is sameness made legal  Fair process is a      fundamental component of the American system of law  If we cannot      have a fair process in these halls or in our courts  how will the      resulting decisions be viewed  If the rule of law is to mean      anything it must mean that it applies to all equally     In the last Congress  I am sorry to      report that the rule of law was broken  spindled and mutilated to      serve the interests of President George W  Bush and his party  No      man and no party should be above the law  That has been one of the      strengths of our democracy  Our country was born in reaction to the      autocracy and corruption of King George  and we must not forget our      roots as a nation of both law and liberty  The best guarantee of      liberty is the  rule of law  meaning that the      decisions of government are not arbitrary and that rules are not      discretionary or enforced to help one side and then ignored to aid      another  James Madison  one of the Framers of our Constitution       warned in Federalist Number 47 of the very danger that is      threatening our great nation  a threat to our freedoms from within        The  accumulation of all powers legislative  executive and      judiciary in the same hands       may justly be pronounced the very      definition of tyranny   Our freedoms as      Americans are the fruit of too much sacrifice to have the rules      broken in the United States Senate by a party colluding with the      White House to try to appoint loyalists to courts who have been      chosen with the hope that they will re interpret precedents and      overturn the very laws that have protected our most fundamental      rights as Americans  The American people deserve better than we      have seen with the destruction of rule after rule by a majority      willing to sacrifice the role of the Senate as a check and balance      in order to aid a President determined to pack the federal courts        The American people have gotten better      treatment from the Senate Democrats  In the summer of 2001       Democrats resumed majority status in the Senate  and I became the      Chair of the Judiciary Committee for 17 months  responsible for      shepherding through the judicial nominations of a Republican      President  It was already June  but to that time not a single      judicial nominations hearing had been held all year  I inherited      the impossibly large number of 110 vacancies  a number that had      grown so large because the Republican controlled Senate had      purposely refused to confirm so many of President Clintons      nominees  hoping to keep them open for a Republican President  By      working hard and making steady progress  in just 17 months  I was      able to whittle that number down and oversee the confirmation of 100      judges   I held hearings for judicial nominees      during recess periods  I held hearings for judicial nominees I did      not support  I held hearings for nominees when our Senate hearing      room and offices were closed because of the anthrax attacks on      Senator Daschle and me  I held hearings in the aftermath of the      9 11 attacks while airline service was unavailable  We even had one      nominee volunteer to drive from Mississippi to      Washington to be included in a hearing  During those 17 difficult      months  despite the challenges of 9 11  despite our extensive      involvement in the USA PATRIOT Act legislation and despite the      anthrax attacks  the Judiciary Committee worked diligently and      productively to make our way through the backlog of vacancies    By the end of the 107th      Congress  the Senate had confirmed 100 judges  It would take the      Republican controlled 108th Congress nearly twice as long      to reach that number of confirmations  By the end of the last year       with significant Democratic cooperation  judicial vacancies had been      reduced to the lowest level  rate and number in decades  since the      Reagan Administration  When Congress adjourned last December there      were only 27 vacancies out of 875 federal judgeships  Whatever      disagreement we may have about a few individual nominees  each of us      can be proud of that accomplishment   How does that record of judicial      confirmations for President George W  Bush compare to      administrations before his  Very well  In President Bushs first      term  the 204 judges confirmed were more than were confirmed in      either of President Clinton two terms  more than during the term of      this Presidents father  and more than in Ronald Reagans first term      when he was being assisted by a Republican majority in the Senate       With the four judges confirmed so far this year  the total number of      confirmations of this Presidents judicial nominees has risen to      208  It would rise further and faster yet  if the White House would      only work with us to identify qualified  consensus nominees for the      29 current vacancies without a nominee  The President has sent only      one new nominee to the Senate so far this year  and it is already      May  If the President wanted to pick judges instead of fights  he      could work with us rather than divide us   And what happened to those eleven      nominees the President started us off with four years ago       Considering the strong ideological bent of this group  the President      has been quite successful  One has been withdrawn from      consideration and eight of the remaining 10 have been confirmed  80      percent  The confirmations of Clinton circuit court      nominees during his second term  from 1997 2000  while a Republican      Senate majority was in control  were nowhere near as successful       Over those four years 35 of 51 Circuit Court nominees were      confirmed  69 percent    If we looked at 1999 and 2000  the 106th      Congress  the numbers are even worse  Fewer than half of the      Presidents circuit court nominees were confirmed  15 of 34       Outstanding and qualified nominees were never allowed a hearing  a      Committee vote or Senate consideration of any kind  These nominees      include the current Dean of the Harvard Law School  a former      Attorney General from Iowa  a former clerk to Chief Justice      Rehnquist and many others  women  men  Hispanics  African      Americans  a wide variety of qualified nominees    So on this anniversary  let us      understand that 8 of the 10 nominees we will hear complaints about      have been confirmed   With respect to the remaining two  I      should note that in the years that Republicans held the Senate      majority and Senator Hatch was the Committee Chair  Judge Terry      Boyle was one of the very few nominees he chose not to consider       Thus  Judge Boyle is still before the Judiciary Committee  Senator      Specter held a hearing on that controversial nomination and the      Committee is still receiving copies of Judge Boyles unpublished      opinions for its review    The remaining nominee is one whose      opinions were criticized by Alberto Gonzales when he served on the      Texas Supreme Court with her  Indeed  many of her positions were      too conservative and activist for her conservative Republican      colleagues on the Texas Supreme Court  When I chaired the Committee      in 2002  in another gesture of good will  I proceeded on a number of      controversial nominations in spite of the recent mistreatment of      President Clintons nominees  One of those hearings was for      Priscilla Owen    I was not required to schedule that      hearing  I could have followed the example of my immediate      predecessor and denied her consideration before the Committee  It      would have been a much easier path than the alternative I chose       Instead  I proceeded  Senator Feinstein conducted the hearing in a      fair manner  After the hearing  I then did something else that my      predecessor as Chair so often did not  I proceeded to have the      Committee consider the nomination on its merits even though I knew I      would not support it  The Committee debated the nomination fairly      and openly  Objections to her confirmation  based on her record as      a Justice on the Texas Supreme Court  were aired and honestly      debated  A vote was taken and instead of hiding behind anonymous      holds or hidden blue slips  Senators put themselves on the record       The result was that the Owen nomination was rejected by a majority      of the Committee and not recommended to the Senate     Since that time much of what has      happened has been unprecedented  Despite the rejection of the      nomination by the Committee  the President resubmitted the      nomination the next year  I do not believe that had ever been done      before in our history  Then  on a party line vote  Republicans      forced the nomination to the floor  It was debated extensively and      the Senate withheld its consent  After a series of cloture votes       cloture was not agreed upon in accordance with the rules of the      Senate  Nonetheless  the President took further unprecedented      action in  again  resubmitting the nomination to the Senate  That      nomination is now pending  again  on the Senate Executive Calendar        By any measure the Presidents first      nominees were treated fairly  Judge Parker  Judge Shedd  Judge      Clement  Judge Cook  Judge Sutton  Judge McConnell  Judge Gregory      and Judge Roberts are each serving lifetime appointments on      important circuit courts  The first slate of nominees has now all      been accorded hearings  All but Judge Boyle have been considered by      the Judiciary Committee  All but one of those has been confirmed    This is no basis on which to break the      rules of the Senate  This is not justification to end the Senates      role as a check and balance on the Executive  This is not reason      for the majority to take the drastic and irreversible step of ending      protection of the minority through the tradition of extended debate      in the Senate    The White House and the Senate      Republican leaderships campaign for nuclear option seeks to end      the role of the Senate serving as a check on the Executive  But      that is precisely what the Constitution intends the Senate to      provide  Supporters of an   all powerful Executive have gone so      far as to seek to inject an unconstitutional religious test into the      debate and to characterize those who oppose the most extreme of the      Presidents nominees as against people of faith and to call for      mass impeachments of judges and other measures to intimidate the      judiciary  Our independent judiciary is an essential check on the      political branches    Pat Robertson says that he believes      that federal judges are a more serious threat to American than Al      Qaeda and the September 11 terrorists and more serious than a few      bearded terrorists who fly into buildings and the worst threat      American has faced in 400 years  worse than Nazi Germany   Japan and the Civil War  This is the sort of incendiary      rhetoric that is paving the way to the nuclear option  It is      wrong  it is destructive and it is short sighted    Chief Justice Rehnquist is right to      refer to the federal judiciary as the crown jewel of our system of      government  It is an essential check and balance  a critical source      of protection of the rights of all Americans  including our      religious freedoms  In A Man For All Seasons Sir Thomas More      speaks about the rule of law and the need for its protections  When      his family confronts him and demands that he break the law to get at      the Devil  he replies        What would you do  Cut a great road through the law to get after      the Devil   And when the last law was down  and the Devil turned      round on you  where would you hide  Roper  the laws all being flat           This country is planted thick with laws  from coast to coast  Mans      law  not Gods  And if you cut them down       do you really think      you could stand upright in the winds that would blow then      Yes  Id give the Devil benefit of law  for my own safetys sake   Our federal judges are not the Devil      and are not in the service of the Devil  Democratic Senators are      not the Devil and are seeking to uphold the Senate as a check on the      most extreme actions of the Executive  I pray that Republican      Senators will think about that and reflect on the protections that      our constitutional checks and balances provide  I trust that they      will honor the protections of the minority that make this      institution what it is  I hope that they will show the courage to      protect the Senate and the minority that the senior Senator from     Pennsylvania spoke about in his important statement a      few weeks ago
