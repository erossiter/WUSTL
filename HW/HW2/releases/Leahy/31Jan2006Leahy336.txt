       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The President s State Of The Union   Message                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     To The Presidents State Of The Union Message     Tuesday  January 31  2006  Though not      intended that way  the Presidents speech in too many instances is a      window into why so many Americans feel we are headed in the wrong      direction  He avoided several of the real issues that are most      important to Vermonters and to families across the nation  while      offering up a raft of false choices on others    Alternative Fuels  A welcome      exception is the Presidents new emphasis on alternative fuels  I      agree about the importance of relieving our over dependence on      foreign oil  just as we need to relieve our dependence on foreign      investors and on borrowing from Social Security to finance our debt      and obligations like the war in Iraq  Along with conservation       renewable energy is a key to a cleaner  more efficient energy      future  If the President follows through with sensible proposals       we can forge a bipartisan partnership of Democrats and Republicans      to work together to make this a safer and more prosperous country    Illegal Domestic Spying  PATRIOT      Act  The President      has misled when he has implied that he does not need to obey the      existing wiretapping law and that doing domestic spying his way       illegally    is a necessary choice between security and liberty  He      also misleads when he has suggested that the senators in the      bipartisan coalition trying to fix controversial parts of the      PATRIOT Act are against the PATRIOT Act  Those are deliberately      false choices  It also reflects demagoguery that literally comes      straight from Karl Roves political playbook  Americans deserve      both security and liberty  and we can have both by insisting that      the White House not break our laws or undermine the checks and      balances that prevent abuses and corruption  In America  no one       not even the President  is above the law  It is time for the White      House to talk straight to the American people and to stop playing      Karl Roves political games with their security  their liberty and      their Constitution    Health Care Crisis  At a time when      seniors in Vermont and across the country are contending with      problems caused by the Administrations botched Medicare      prescription drug program  and when millions of other families are      losing or cannot even afford basic health insurance  the President      offers little more than Band Aids  He has not even been willing to      step aside to let Congress fix some of the worst problems in the new      Medicare drug program  The President has got to realize that the      prescription drug program is riddled with giveaways to big drug      companies and that it was poorly designed  Vermonts seniors know      it needs serious reform    Overall this      Administrations priorities remain focused on payouts and favors to      special interests like big drug companies  big oil corporations and      others  at the expense of families  seniors and taxpayers  That has      contributed to the culture of corruption  and it needs to change       America can do better than that  The peoples priorities deserve to      come first
