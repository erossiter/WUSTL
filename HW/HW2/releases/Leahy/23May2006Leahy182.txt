       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The Delay Of Notification Of Veterans    Data Breach                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           A Heckuva Bad Job For Americas      Veterans          Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      To The Delay Of Notification Of Veterans Data Breach     May 23  2006   WASHINGTON       Tuesday  May 23     A leading champion of the publics privacy      rights  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking member of the Senate      Judiciary Committee  Tuesday said President Bush should consider      changing the leadership of the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA       in the wake of Sec  Jim Nicholsons nearly three week delay in      notifying millions of veterans of the theft of their sensitive      personal information  coming on top of earlier leadership failures       Leahys statement follows   This is a      serious breach that raises troubling questions about the management      of the Department of Veterans Affairs  Instead of promptly      notifying millions of veterans that their personal data was      irresponsibly handled and then stolen  VA officials held their      breath and crossed their fingers for nearly three weeks  For      millions of veterans  19 days of delay is 18 days too long to have      to wait to learn that their personal information is at risk  That      is unacceptable  as is the VAs decision not to treat these veterans      like most other victims of identity theft by providing them with a      free credit monitoring service to monitor their credit reports over      time for any signs of fraud   More than a year      after the data breaches at ChoicePoint Inc  and LexisNexis  the      theft of sensitive personal information is becoming an alarmingly      all too familiar story for too many Americans  By failing to follow      its own privacy policy  the VA has left our veterans vulnerable to      the insidious crime of identity theft  The Secretary has some      explaining to do   The failures of      leadership at the VA have been compounding for awhile  undermining      its service to veterans  In addition to this breach and the refusal      to compensate veterans for the credit reports they will have to buy      to guard against identify theft  there was last years debacle of a      billion dollar shortfall in VAs budget for veterans health care       after repeated denials  It all adds up to a heckuva bad job for      Americas veterans  The President should call Secretary Nicholson      into the woodshed for a serious shakeup in how the VA is run    In the meantime       Secretary Nicholson needs to answer why this information was left      vulnerable to such a breach  why he endorsed a delay in      notification  and what specific steps he is taking done to ensure      such a breach does not happen again  The nations veterans who      have been willing to make the ultimate sacrifice for their country       deserve to have the best tools available to protect themselves and      their families from identity theft
