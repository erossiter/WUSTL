       Leahy  New Bush Budget Is Mismatch For Vermont s And The Nation s Real   Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy  New Bush Budget     Is Mismatch For Vermonts And The Nations Real Priorities        Leahy Outlines New Budgets      Impact On Vermont WASHINGTON       Monday  Feb  6   The proposed budget released Monday by President      Bush undercuts Vermonts and the nations real priorities on issues      ranging across a variety of key environmental  housing  health care       education  and public safety programs across the country  said Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt    who released a summary of several of the      program cuts and their importance to Vermont   Leahy   a senior member of the Senate      Appropriations Committee  said  The Presidents budget is a      mismatch for the real priorities of ordinary Vermonters  This      budget downgrades the needs of our National Guard and our first      responders at a time they are being asked to take on more      responsibilities than ever before  The priorities of our Guard  our      first responders and of ordinary Americans are being made to take a      back seat to the misplaced priorities of this White House        Agriculture Environment    Leahy and Sen       Jim Jeffords and Rep  Bernie Sanders Monday announced their strong      opposition to a new tax on dairy farmers that is included in the      Presidents budget  see joint Vermont Congressional Delegation      news release  posted on the Leahy website  leahy senate gov   The      Administration has cut more than  175 million nationwide from land      conservation programs that help farmers affordably protect the      environment  In Vermont these programs have been vital tools in      cleaning up Lake Champlain  All of these conservation programs were      included in the 2002 Farm Bill  Specifically  the Bush budget cuts      the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP   one of the      primary federal programs which farmers use to control phosphorus      runoff going into Lake Champlain  The White House also proposes      cutting in halffunding for the Farmland Protection Program       another program authored and led by Leahy    which helps landowners      voluntarily protect their lands from development  The program is      based on the Farms for the Future pilot program created by Leahy      in Vermont  The Environmental Protection Agency budget also      proposes to cut more than  200 million from federal Clean Water      grants to states and towns to reduce storm water runoff     First      Responders    The Presidents      budget cuts nearly  400 million in homeland security resources for      state and local first responders  The budget request calls for the      elimination of the Leahy all state minimum formula that guarantees      Vermont and other states a modest but assured share of the overall      funding  Additional grant programs created earlier by Congress      focus on the greater needs of high risk and high density states and      regions  The President also slashes 55 percent of the funding for      fire departments nationwide to buy new equipment and to afford      needed training  Vermont by the end of this year will have received      more than  61 million in first responder grants under the Leahy      formula since 2002  under funds already approved by Congress for      this years budget  Further funds for Vermonts police  fire and      rescue agencies would be in jeopardy under the Presidents FY07      budget plan    HEALTH      CARE EDUCATION    The Presidents      budget hits ordinary Americans especially hard in terms of cuts in      health care and education  Almost half of the 141 programs slated      for elimination come from the Health and Human Service and Education      Departments    Health Care   At a time when thousands of seniors      are struggling to navigate the new Medicare prescription drug      program  the President has proposed cutting  36 billion from      Medicare  These cuts will hurt seniors  doctors and hospitals by      cutting reimbursements  and therefore ultimately access to care       Rural health programs in the new budget are cut by more than 70      percent and Area Health Education Centers  which play an active role      in educating Vermont health care professionals  are eliminated        On the heels of the first cut since      1970 to National Institutes of Health  NIH  medical research funding      to pursue new cures and treatments to some of the most devastating      diseases that affect ordinary Americans  the President now proposes      cutting funding for 18 of the 19 institutes  Some of this medical      research is conducted by clinics and medical specialists in      Vermont  The budget plan would slow many of the gains made in      research on cancer  diabetes  and other diseases    Education   The Education Department budget once      again underfunds No Child Left Behind and the Individuals with      Disabilities Education Act  As a result  9 408 Vermont students      would be denied Title I services that they had been promised under      NCLB  The new budget also eliminates 42 education programs       including the Educational Technology State Grants  Safe and Drug      Free Schools State Grants  Vocational Education State Grants  and      the Gear Up and TRIO programs  all of which are important to      Vermonts students and families  COMMUNITY      DEVELOPMENT    Community      Development Block Grants are used by states to help towns and cities      promote community and economic development and to build affordable      housing  This year  Vermonts total CDBG allocation is  8 36      million  an estimated  901 000 for Burlington and roughly  7 4      million for the rest of the state  Now  for the second year in a      row  the President proposes to eliminate the CDBG program and in its      place combine 18 federal programs into a consolidated community      development scheme that would result in a roughly 30 percent cut in      total funding  If the CDBG distribution criteria are retained       Vermont will lose  2 5 million in funding  If new criteria are      developed  all of the  8 36 million in funding to Vermont is in      jeopardy  NATIONAL      GUARD    The Defense      budget cuts the capability of the National Guard  the nations      primary military reserve and an essential emergency response force      at home  The Air Force seeks to remove funding for more than 14 000      pilots  maintainers and support personnel  which could lead to the      closure of units across the country  The Army is asking to convert      six combat brigades and one aviation brigade to engineering and      support functions  which  if ratified by Congress  will lead to loss      of critical equipment and undermine the forces ability to carry out      its dual missions  Leahy and Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo    the co chairs      of the Senate National Guard Caucus  last week announced they have      built a veto proof Senate majority of 75 senators who have joined      with them in opposing severe cutbacks in the National Guard  Their      initiative already has had the effect of scaling back even deeper      cuts that were in earlier drafts of the Presidents budget  The      Department of Defense budget request also assumes increased premiums      and co payments for retirees and members of the National Guard who      participate in the TRICARE Standard health insurance  Leahy and a      bipartisan coalition have led in recent years in extending TRICARE      health insurance to National Guard members and their families  The      increases will increase the financial burden on military families      who have earned and deserve the easy availability of affordable      health coverage through their efforts and sacrifice
