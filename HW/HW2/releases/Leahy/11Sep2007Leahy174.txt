       U S  Senate Adds  1 Billion To Repair Deficient Bridges                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               U S  Senate Adds  1 Billion To Repair Deficient Bridges          Vermont Would Receive  7 M  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Sept  11   In the wake of     last months Minnesota bridge collapse  the U S  Senate on Monday     approved an amendment to add  1 billion in targeted funding toward     bridge rehabilitation and replacement across the country  U S  Senators     Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Bernard Sanders  I Vt   announced that the     additional funding would direct more than  7 million in additional     funding to Vermont to replace and rehabilitate structurally deficient     bridges throughout the state  The amendment to the Senate     Transportation Appropriations Bill passed in a vote of 60 to 33  The nations bridges are deteriorating faster than     most states can afford to fix or replace them  said Leahy  a senior     member of the Appropriations Committee  which handles the Senates work     on the transportation funding bill  This problem is particularly acute     in Vermont  where we have one of the highest percentages of structurally     deficient bridges in the country  The war in Iraq continues to divert     resources needed here at home  and we need to do more  but this is a     sizable increase that will begin making a difference   Sanders  a member of the Senate Transportation and     Infrastructure Subcommittee of the Committee on Environment and Public     Works  said  I have held hearings all over Vermont on infrastructure     needs and understand very well that there are serious problems in     Vermont and across the country  This funding is a small step but an     important one toward helping us resolve the crisis of our crumbling     infrastructure  The Vermont Agency of Transportation recently     provided information on the status of the states bridges to Sanders      for use by the Subcommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure     Subcommittee  According to VTrans  Vermont has one of the highest     percentages of structurally deficient bridges in the nation  ranking 9th     with more than 16 percent  436  of its 2 686 long structures  with span     lengths of 20 feet or greater    meeting this classification  More than     half of Vermonts bridges  about 60 percent  are more than 40 years old      while 331  about 12 percent  are more than 80 years old   The amendment provides an additional  1 billion for     activities authorized under the Federal Highway Administrations Bridge     Replacement and Rehabilitation program  which provides grants to each     state for bridge replacement  bridge rehabilitation  preventative     maintenance  seismic retrofitting  bridge inspections  and activities     designed to protect bridges and extend their life spans  For the past     five years  an average of  5 3 billion has been spent on bridge     rehabilitation and replacement  The Senate passed amendment would add     to this level by about 20 percent  The following is a state by state breakdown of how     the extra  1 billion would be spent
