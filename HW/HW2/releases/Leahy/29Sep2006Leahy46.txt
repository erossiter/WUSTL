       House Leaders Drop 11th Hour Bid To Kill Leahy Amendment That Mandates   Improvements In New Border Crossing System                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Vermont     Victories In Homeland Security Budget Bill        House Leaders Drop 11th Hour Bid  To Kill Leahy     Amendment    That Mandates Improvements  In New Border Crossing System  House  Senate Now Ready To OK Bill With     Leahys Measure    To Delay Border Crossing ID Requirements Until Bush Administration Certifies    Better Coordination And Preparation       Leahy Also Beats Back Bid    To Curb First Responder Grants    To Vermont And Other Smaller States WASHINGTON  Friday  Sept  29   Vermont Friday was     poised to score two significant policy wins engineered by Sen  Patrick     Leahy  D Vt   as the U S  House and Senate neared final passage of the     annual homeland security budget bill  after key House leaders dropped an     11th hour bid to strip from the bill Leahys amendment to     mandate improvements in a controversial new border crossing ID system  Leahys legislation will buy more time to improve     implementation of the controversial PASS Card system for border     crossings  a system that will require new identity cards and methods     for crossing U S  borders  including the Northern Border with Canada      Leahy was joined by Sen  Ted Stevens  R Alaska  in writing and offering     the amendment  which would postpone implementation of the PASS Card     system  part of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     for     17 months  until June 1  2009  or earlier  if the Secretary of Homeland     Security and the Secretary of State certify to Congress that several     standards in the amendment are met before the program moves forward  House and Senate Appropriations Committee conferees     on Monday had approved Leahys amendment and included it in the final     bill  Leahys amendment had been in the Senate passed version of the     bill but not the Houses version  Since then  House Speaker Dennis     Hastert  R Ill   and House Judiciary Committee Chairman James     Sensenbrenner  R Wisc   have mounted a rare post conference bid to strip     the Leahy Stevens Amendment from the conference agreement  Speaker     Hastert now has ended his effort to remove the Leahy amendment  A floor     colloquy Friday involving Chairman Sensenbrenner is expected to indicate     his wish that the two agencies promptly comply with the amendments     requirements so that the PASS Card system can be implemented as close to     the original deadline as possible  Leahy and supporters of the     amendment will also introduce a Senate colloquy at the time of passage     to explain why the amendment is needed  The House is expected to pass     the bill Friday  before adjourning this years regular session  and the     Senate is expected to follow suit either Friday or Saturday  The final version of the bill also continues     Leahys all state minimum formula for the basic first responder grant     program  which has brought more than  70 million to Vermonts fire      police and rescue agencies in the last four years  Leahy also had     successfully led the effort to beat back an attempt to weaken the     funding formula during earlier Senate debate on the bill  Under the     final version of the bill  Vermonts first responders will receive a     minimum total of  6 75 million in grants over the next year  Leahy is a senior member of the Appropriations     Committee and of its Homeland Security Subcommittee  which handled the     Senates work in drafting the annual appropriations bill for the     Department of Homeland Security  Leahy was also a leading Senate     conferee on the bill  Leahy says the lack of sufficient coordination on     the PASS Card system between DHS and State  and between the Bush     Administration and the Government of Canada  has spelled trouble for the     system  unless its problems are corrected       We are buying time that we hope the Bush Administration will use     promptly and wisely to fix the PASS Card system  said Leahy  There     has been too much drift and too little careful drafting by these     agencies so far  and its been shaping up as a train wreck in slow     motion  Poor planning and premature implementation of this system could     clog our borders while making us less secure  There is widening     agreement in Congress that these problems need to be fixed  and its     encouraging that Congress is now ready to prod these agencies to come to     grips with this and to buy sufficient time to get this system ready     before it s unleashed on an unsuspecting public  Leahy also noted that President Bush this summer      when asked about the Leahy Stevens Amendment  implied that the     Administration will accept a deadline extension  if Congress passes one      see news account  below   The certification requirements in Leahys WHTI     amendment will require the two departments to  1   Ensure that the     technology for any Passport Card  PASS Card  meets certain security       standards      and that the National Institutes of Standards and Technology certify the       technology     chosen by DHS and State  2   Share the technology     with the governments of Canada and Mexico  3       Justify the fee set for the PASS Card   4       Develop an alternative procedure for groups of children traveling across     the border under adult supervision with parental consent  5       Install all necessary technological infrastructure at the ports of     entry to process the cards and train U S  agents at the border crossings     in all aspects of the new technology       6  Make the PASS Card available for international land and sea travel     between the United States and Canada  Mexico  or the Caribbean and     Bermuda      7  Establish a unified implementation date for all sea and land     borders                   from July 6 White House Bulletin account of Bush Harper news     conference        Passport Discussion   Momentum     Building To Delay Implementation Of Western Hemisphere Travel     initiative  President Bush met with Canadian Prime Minister Brian     Harper today  and border security issues were a key part of their     agenda  Both Prime Minister Harper and President Bush briefly discussed     the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI  in their remarks today      PM Harper said  The President and I agree that the implementations of     the provision of the WHTI must not unduly hinder cross border travel or     tourism or trade  To that end  we ve tasked our officials to agree on     common standards on secure and alternate documents and preferably as     soon as possible  President Bush also addressed the topic  saying      Yes  I think that if Congress decides there needs to be flexibility      there ll be flexibility  Interestingly enough  the Senate passed        made its intention clear to extend deadlines  That hadn t happened in     the House yet  And so  we re operating in the executive branch under     the idea that nothing will change  And therefore we need to get to the     Canadian government as quickly as possible our definition of what a     reasonable policy is  If Congress decides to be flexible  we obviously     will be flexible       Congress passed a law in the aftermath of 9 11 mandating that the State     and Homeland Security Departments require all Western Hemisphere     travelers have a passport to cross US borders beginning in 2008  While     much of the US media and political attention has focused on the US     border with Mexico  before the July 4 break both the House and Senate     quietly passed appropriations amendments that would force a delay in     implementation of that deadline  with an eye on US Canadian travel  US     lawmakers from states bordering Canada fear the technology meant to     facilitate travel of safe citizens across the US Canadian border has not     been developed as fast as hoped  and as a result  the 2008 deadline     threatens to dry up some of the tourism trade and other business in the     Canadian border regions       One key piece of the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative requires the     State Department to create a Passport Card  PASS Card  program meant     to facilitate travel across the US Canadian border  The idea was to     come up with a system that would not require cleared people  some of     whom commute daily between the US and Canada  to carry and show a     passport each time they traverse the border  The PASScard is also meant     to be considerably cheaper to obtain than a US passport  Canadian     border state lawmakers fear that the technology and implementation of     the PASScard system is lagging  and wont be in place in time to make     the WHTI efficient  The amendment sponsored by Sens  Leahy and Stevens      attached to two separate spending bills  would push WHTI implementation     back to June  2009 and              Ensure that the technology for any Passport Card meets certain security     standards  and that DHS and State agree on that technology              Share the technology with the governments of Canada and Mexico              Justify the fee set for the Passport Card               Develop an alternative procedure for groups of children traveling across     the border under adult supervision with parental consent              Install all necessary technological infrastructure at the ports of entry     to process the cards and train U S  agents at the border crossings in     all aspects of the new technology              Make the Passport Card available for international land and sea travel     between the United States and Canada  Mexico  or the Caribbean and     Bermuda              Establish a unified implementation date for all sea and land borders       The delay is strongly backed by the travel and tourism industries  An     industry source tells the Bulletin that not only is 2008 probably an     unworkable deadline  but also that State is pushing to phase in     implementation of the WHTI even earlier  requiring passports for all air     and sea passengers by January 1  2007  The industry source notes that     the Administration and the agencies involved are under heavy pressure in     the media and in pockets of Congress to step up implementation of the     post 9 11 security measures  having been criticized so far for a slow     response on many fronts       But the source notes that State still has yet to issue final regs on how     it would implement the air sea passport requirement  Without final     rules in place  there is little opportunity in the remaining months of     2006 for the government or the industry to mount a public information     campaign to let travelers know what the new requirements are  The     travel and tourism industry fears that confusion could seriously hurt     their business
