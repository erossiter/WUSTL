       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Reintroduction Of The OPEN   Government Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On The Reintroduction Of The OPEN Government Act  December 4  2007        Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today  I have joined with Senator Cornyn      to reintroduce the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our      National Government Act  the OPEN Government Act     the      first major reform to the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  in     more than a decade  The Senate      passed this historic FOIA reform legislation  S  849  before      adjourning for the August recess  But  sadly  this measure has been      stalled in the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee for      several months  preventing these long overdue FOIA reforms from      being enacted into law             Despite the unfortunate delay of this bill  I remain deeply      committed to enacting FOIA reform legislation this year  Because      time is of the essence  I am requesting that this legislation be      immediately placed on the Senate Calendar and that the Senate      promptly take up and pass this bill by unanimous consent  so that it      can be sent to the House             The version of the bill introduced today includes pay go language      that has been requested by the House and eliminates the provision on      citations to FOIA exemptions  After needlessly delaying the      enactment of this bill for several months  I hope that the House      Oversight and Government Reform Committee will promptly take up this      important measure  so that the House can enact this legislation and      send it to the President before the end of the year         The First FOIA Reforms in More Than a Decade            As the first major reform to FOIA in      more than a decade  the OPEN      Government Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of      excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help      to restore the publics trust in their government  This bill      will also improve transparency in the Federal Governments FOIA      process by               Restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA               Imposing real consequences on federal agencies for missing       FOIAs 20 day statutory deadline         Clarifying that FOIA applies to government records held by       outside private contractors         Establishing a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies        and        Creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and federal       agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation                     Specifically  the OPEN Government Act will protect the publics      right to know  by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to      inform the public  including freelance journalists and bloggers  may      seek a fee waiver when they request information under FOIA  The      bill ensures that federal agencies will not automatically exclude      Internet blogs and other Web based forms of media when deciding      whether to waive FOIA fees  In addition  the bill also clarifies      that the definition of news media  for purposes of FOIA fee waivers       includes free newspapers and individuals performing a media function      who do not necessarily have a prior history of publication     The      bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action  by      ensuring that the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a      request is received by the appropriate component of the agency and      requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the      appropriate agency component within 10 days of the receipt of such      requests  The bill allows federal agencies to toll the 20 day clock      while they are awaiting a response to a reasonable request for      information from a FOIA requester on one occasion  or while the      agency is awaiting clarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment       In addition  to encourage agencies to meet the 20 day time limit       the bill requires that an agency refund FOIA search fees if it fails      to meet the 20 day deadline  except in the case of exceptional      circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute  To address pay go      concerns  the bill requires that these refunds come from annual      agency appropriations          The bill also addresses a relatively  new      concern that  under current law  federal agencies have an incentive      to delay compliance with FOIA requests until just before a court      decision is made that is favorable to a FOIA requestor  The Supreme      Courts decision in Buckhannon Board and Care Home  Inc  v  West      Virginia Dept of Health and Human Resources  532 U S  598       2001   eliminated the catalyst theory for attorneys fees      recovery under certain federal civil rights laws  When applied to      FOIA cases  Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters from ever      being eligible to recover attorneys fees under circumstances where      an agency provides the records requested in the litigation just      prior to a court decision that would have been favorable to the FOIA      requestor  The bill clarifies that Buckhannon does not apply      to FOIA cases  Under the bill  a FOIA requester can obtain      attorneys fees when he or she files a lawsuit to obtain records      from the government and the government releases those records before      the court orders them to do so  But  this provision would not allow      the requester to recover attorneys fees if the requesters claim is      wholly insubstantial  To address pay go concerns  the bill also      requires that any attorneys fees assessed under this provision be      paid from annually appropriated agency funds          To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation  the      bill also creates      an Office of Government Information Services in the National      Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency level FOIA      disputes  In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency      will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer  who will monitor the agencys      compliance with FOIA requests  and a FOIA Public Liaison who will be      available to resolve FOIA related disputes               Finally  the bill does several things to enhance the agency      reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA  Tracking numbers      are not required for FOIA requests that are anticipated to take ten      days or less to process  The bill creates a tracking system for      FOIA requests to assist members of the public and the media  The      bill also establishes a FOIA hotline service for all federal      agencies  either by telephone or on the Internet  to enable      requestors to track the status of their FOIA requests  And  the      bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are      held by outside private contractors  no matter where these records      are located           OPEN Government is an American Value        The Freedom of Information Act is critical to ensuring that all      American citizens can access information about the workings of their      government  But  after four decades  this open government law needs      to be strengthened  I am pleased that the reforms contained in the      OPEN Government Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that      it works more effectively for the American people             I commend the bills chief Republican cosponsor  Senator John Cornyn       for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation      this year  I also thank the many cosponsors of this legislation for      their dedication to open government and I thank the Majority Leader      for his strong support of this legislation  I am also appreciative      of the efforts of Senator Kyl in helping us to reach a compromise on      this legislation  so that the Senate could consider and pass      meaningful FOIA reform legislation             But  most importantly  I especially want to thank the many concerned      citizens who  knowing the importance of this measure to the American      peoples right to know  have demanded action on this bill  This      bill is endorsed by more than 115 business  public interest  and      news organizations from across the political and ideological      spectrum  including the American Library Association  the U S       Chamber of Commerce  OpenTheGovernment org  Public Citizen  the      Republican Liberty Caucus  the Sunshine in Government Initiative and      the Vermont Press Association  The invaluable support of these and      many other organizations is what led the opponents of this bill to      come around and support this legislation         I hope that by once again passing this      important FOIA reform legislation  the Senate will reaffirm the      principle that open government is not a Democratic issue or a      Republican issue  But  rather  it is an American issue and an      American value  I encourage all of my Senate colleagues  on both      sides of the aisle  to unanimously pass this historic bill
