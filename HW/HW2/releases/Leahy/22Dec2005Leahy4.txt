       Congress Improves Benefits For Military Personnel                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Congress Improves Benefits For       Military Personnel         Graham Clinton DeWine Leahy      Secure TRICARE For National Guard And Reserve  WASHINGTON          The United States Senate last night approved the Fiscal Year       2006 Defense Authorization bill    The legislation improves benefits       for military personnel including a provision offered by U S        Senators Lindsey Graham  R South Carolina   Hillary Clinton        D New York   Mike DeWine  R Ohio   and Patrick Leahy        D Vermont  to expand TRICARE to all drilling reservists         Graham  Clinton  DeWine  and Leahy       have worked together and with other Senators to expand access to       health care for members of the National Guard and Reserve who       are playing an ever increasing and historic role in the global       War on Terror  The Senators noted that Guardsmen and Reservists       now make up approximately 40 percent of American forces in Iraq   Our work reflects a significant       triumph for the Guard  Reserves and their families  said       Graham  chairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on       Personnel  Now  after years of relative neglect  these       soldiers health care coverage and benefits are more in line       with their service to our nation  This years bill provides       continuous health care coverage for all drilling reservists  an       important improvement over what we were able to accomplish last       year   I am pleased that we have made       further progress towards our goal of increasing access of health       benefits for our National Guard and Reserve and their families       in New York and around the country  Senator Clinton said        Providing the Guard and Reserves  as well as their families        with adequate support and benefits is the least that a grateful       nation can do   We know how important it is that       we fund our military hardware and base installations  At the       same time  we cant ignore our military personnel  We cant       ignore those who volunteer to protect us  stated Senator Mike       DeWine  Its the least we can do  particularly as we continue       to rely more and more on our Reserve and National Guard   This is a measurable step forward       for readiness and for fairness for the Guard and its people        said Leahy  the co chair of the Senates National Guard Caucus        Ensuring that every member of the Guard and Reserve has access       to affordable health insurance is vital to the well being of       this essential force  At a time when the troops of our Guard       and Reserve are contributing so much to the war efforts in Iraq       and Afghanistan  as well as protecting us at home  this package       of new health insurance benefits will make a real difference        and its the least they deserve   Under the expansion of TRICARE       championed by the Senators  all members of the Selected Reserve       are eligible to enroll in the military health care program for a       monthly premium  The premiums are based on categories of       eligibility     Category 1         Members of the Selected Reserve who are called to active        duty qualify for TRICARE Reserve Select  TRS   Under this        program  established last year  a reservist would accumulate        one year of TRS coverage for every 90 days of active duty        service  Monthly premiums during the years of accumulated        eligibility are only 28 percent of the program cost  The        government picks up the remaining 72 percent  As has always        been the case  coverage is free of charge while on active        duty  This bill now permits accumulation of earned periods        of coverage for frequently deployed personnel  In addition         it authorizes 6 months of transitional coverage for family        members following the death of the Reserve member  if the        member dies while in an inactive status     Category 2         Members of the Selected Reserve who are not called to active        duty  and who otherwise do not qualify for health insurance        due to unemployment or lack of employer provided coverage         are eligible to enroll in TRICARE for a 50 percent        cost sharing premium  The government will pay the remaining        50 percent     Category 3         Members of the Selected Reserve who do not fit into either        of the above categories but would like to participate in        TRICARE are eligible to do so for an 85 percent cost share         Employers are allowed and encouraged to contribute to the        reservists share  The government contributes 15 percent of        the costs     I will continue to work to       improve benefits available to members of the Guard and Reserve        said Graham  The nation will continue to need their services        in large numbers  in fighting the War on Terror  I am proud of       and appreciate the progress weve made this year with the Senate       and Bush Administration working together   I am pleased a compromise was       reached and that the Senate today joined me in honoring the       service of our National Guard and Reserve members by giving them       and their families the healthcare benefits they need and       deserve  Senator Clinton said   Recent reports indicate about 40       percent of the junior enlisted lack any civilian health       insurance and this TRICARE expansion will help them and their       families receive needed coverage  We must ensure greater       continuity in health care for our Guardsmen and Reservists        which will enhance overall military medical readiness  This is       both a readiness and retention issue  Now more than ever  we       need to provide our Reserve and Guard personnel with adequate       support  Ensuring our servicemen and women have access to       healthcare insurance is the right thing to do  added Senator       DeWine   The defense bill authorized       additional benefits for the men and women serving our nation in       uniform  Among these important changes were    A 3 1 percent pay raise for        all military personnel    Payment of matching fund        contributions of up to 5 percent of basic pay for first term        enlistees who participate in the Thrift Savings Plan  The        TSP is a 401 k  retirement plan available to all federal        employees    Increases in maximum amounts        of assignment incentive pay and hardship duty pay     60 million increase in child        care and family assistance services to active duty and        Reserve military families    Critical skills retention        bonus of up to  100 000 over a career for members of the        Selected Reserve    Increases TRICARE benefits for        the surviving children of members who die on active duty    Increases to  100 000 in the        death gratuity allowance payable to survivors of all active        duty military decedents  including retroactive payment to        October 7  2001  the date of commencement of Operation        Enduring Freedom    Directs the establishment of a        uniform Department policy on casualty assistance to improve        the services provided to survivors and next of kin of        military members killed on active duty    In addition the bill        authorizes increases in the active duty end strength of        10 000 for the Army and 1 000 for the Marine Corps     The bill has been passed by the       House and is expected to be signed into law by President Bush in       the coming days
