       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of A Bill To Provide   For Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the      incoming Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  called on the      Senate Thursday to enact comprehensive immigration reform  Below is      Senator Leahys statement  as prepared  and the text of the      immigration legislation introduced as part of the Democratic      Leadership package    Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy     On The Introduction Of A Bill To Provide      For Comprehensive Immigration Reform     Senate Floor     110th Congress     January 4  2007  As the new Congress begins  we have a      tremendous opportunity before us to enact fair  comprehensive      immigration reform  It is time for bipartisan action  Accordingly       I join with Senators from both sides of the aisle to call for      Comprehensive Immigration Reform and will work to enact it  We need      to put aside the mean spiritedness and short sighted policies driven      by fear and recognize the dignity of those whose work contributes to      reinvigorating America  Consistent with our heritage as a nation of      immigrants we need to bring people out of the shadows     Through comprehensive immigration      reform  we can increase the opportunities for American businesses to      obtain the workers they need while ensuring that priority is given      to willing domestic workers    from dairy farms in Vermont to      multi national corporations  We have been told of the plight of      American farmers from New York to California and have seen the      photographs of piles of rotting fruit that have gone unharvested       We hear American technology companies lamenting the lost      opportunities and the loss of skilled innovators to other      countries  In Vermont  dairy farmers are yearning for more      available legal workers  while others have watched families in their      employ be torn apart through piecemeal  inconsistent and sometimes      heavy handed enforcement efforts  No American farmer or other      business should be put in the position of having to choose between      obeying the law or losing their livelihood    Where American workers can fill      available jobs  they should be given priority  Where these jobs are      available and unclaimed by American citizens  it makes no sense to      deny willing foreign workers the opportunity to work  Through our      collective efforts we can strike the balance to protect our domestic      workforce while meeting the needs of a productive economy     We must streamline and reform our visa      system for low skilled workers so we can help reduce the crippling      backlogs that affect American businesses  And we must increase the      number of low skilled work visas issued each year to keep up with      the needs of our economy  We should enact stronger  consistent      employer verification procedures  We should impose penalties for      those employers who flout the law and exploit those who have no      voice  We can do this by working together and enacting comprehensive      reform    Through comprehensive and smart      reforms  we can also increase our security  Let us work to focus      enforcement efforts on protecting us from those who seek to do us      harm  Let us put an end to the conditions that end in too many      needless deaths in the deserts of the Southwest     We must take a smarter approach to      dealing with the millions of people already hereone that does not      divide families and make instant criminals out of millions of      people  but rather honors our nations best traditions  When we      enact reforms to bring the millions of undocumented people in this      country out of the shadows  greater accountability will follow       When we provide incentives for undocumented people to enter a path      to citizenship  we will encourage them to live up to our traditions      of citizenship and civic responsibility  When we endow those who      seek to better their livesand the lives of their familieswith the      tools to do so legally  we help instill in them a sense of      belonging  of patriotism  and of opportunity  Those who decry this      aspect of immigration reform must carefully consider the alternative      path  By driving more people underground  we foster a culture of      lawlessness and mistrust   We cannot wall ourselves off from the      world  A 700 mile fence on a 2000 mile border is not the answer       Last fall  the Republican Congress rushed through a bill to build      700 miles of fencing and did so against the advice of the Department      of Homeland Security  That fence bill was neither fair nor      comprehensive  I share the disappointment of tens of millions of      Americans who had hoped President Bush would have exercised his      constitutional authority to veto that costly  cobbled together and      mean spirited law  Instead  the President seemed to have abandoned      his principles in signing the Secure Fence Act that will cost      between  2 billion and  9 billion and fail to perform as advertised      to seal our southern border  Scarring our southwestern landscape      with a symbol of fear  pandering and intolerance offends the great      heritage of our nation while sending the wrong message to our      neighbors and to the world about American values  It was a pricey      bumper sticker law passed to curry favor in certain quarters      before the elections  Instead  by focusing on technology       innovation  and personnel rather than partisan politics and divisive      walls  we can do a better job of securing our border     The President has said many times that      in order for the United States to achieve real security  we must      have comprehensive immigration reform  which must include a      realistic solution to bring out of the shadows the millions of      undocumented immigrants in the country and to meet the pressing      needs of employers for willing workers along with border security       In numerous statements  including a speech in Mission  Texas  in      August 2006  he recognized that without all components of      comprehensive reform working together  immigration reform will not      work    I will continue working to enact      legislation that will secure Americas borders  strengthen our      economy and bring about a realistic solution to the millions of      people who want to work and live legally in our country  I will      continue to support fair and comprehensive immigration reform and to      respect the dignity of those who seek to join mainstream American      society and to better their lives in the United States  Today  we      join together in the hope that common sense and bipartisanship will      prevail  I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the bill be      inserted into the Record                 Text of the      Legislation    S 9  To recognize the heritage of the      United States as a nation of immigrants and amend the Immigration      and Nationality Act to provide for more effective border and      employment enforcement  to prevent illegal immigration  to reform      and rationalize avenues for legal immigration  and for other      purposes        110th CONGRESS       1st Session       January 4  2007  IN THE SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES  MR  REID  for himself and MR  Leahy      and _____   introduced the following bill  which was read twice and      referred to the Committee on Judiciary        A BILL  To recognize the heritage of the      United
