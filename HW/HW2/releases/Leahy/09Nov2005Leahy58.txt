       Leahy Encourages Cameras In Nation s Courtrooms                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy       Encourages Cameras In Nation s Courtrooms  WASHINGTON        Wed   Nov  9   Today  the Senate Judiciary held a hearing on       televising federal court proceedings  A longtime advocate for       greater public access to government  Leahy has supported       allowing cameras in the nations courtrooms  Below is Leahys       statement from the hearing           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Cameras In The Courtroom November       9  2005  As the son of a printer I come by       my affection for the First Amendment honestly  and directly  As       we hear the testimony from this distinguished panel on whether       to allow the televising of federal court proceedings  I reflect       upon my father  who instilled in me a profound respect for the       freedom of speech which is at the foundation of our great       democracy  I was lucky enough to grow up in  Vermont  a place       where the culture nourishes the love of liberty and press       freedom  After all  Vermont held out in joining the Union until       1791  after the Bill of Rights was ratified and just a few years       later  the citizens of Vermont vigorously supported Matthew Lyon       in his fight against the Alien and Sedition Acts which was       instrumental in the eventual overturning of the that act         The freedoms       guaranteed by the First Amendment are served not only by the       press and speech  but also by ensuring that our citizens have       access to the government   When I was a young man and a       prosecutor  Vermont had a culture of open government in which we       had the opportunity to speak with our elected officials and       other leaders on a regular basis  While the values of       transparency must always be balanced against security needs and       the protection of personal privacy  the public will always have       a right to know what their government is doing  I think we can       all agree that our democracy works best when there is sunshine       in government    Yet  too often in recent years       this balance has been skewed  Freedom and security are always       in tension in our society  and especially so after the attacks       of September 11  We all understand that protecting our national       security requires that certain information be kept out of the       public eye  But even before that terrible attack  we saw the       Bush Administration drape a cloak of secrecy around all kinds of       information  In 2001  President Bush signed a new Executive       Order limiting the release of presidential records  despite the       clearly stated intent of Congress that such records should       become public 12 years after a president leaves office  Since       this Administration took office  classification has greatly       increased  More records are being classified and roped away       from public and press access  at enormous cost to taxpayers  and       fewer old records are being routinely declassified     With the current Administrations       dramatic shift towards secrecy  these have been tough times for       the publics right to know  It is more important now than ever       that we take steps not only to secure  but also to expand        access to government for all Americans  That is why I have       continually supported efforts to make all three branches of our       federal government more transparent and accessible  Except for       rare closed sessions  the proceedings of Congress and its       Committees are open to the public and carried live on cable       television and radio  Members and Committees also are using the       Internet and Web sites to make their work available to their       constituencies and the general public    The work of Executive Branch       agencies is subject to public scrutiny through the Freedom of       Information Act  among other mechanisms  We must demand       transparency from any government  but this Administration  with       its penchant for secrecy  requires vigilant attention  This       Administrations default position unfortunately has been secrecy       and non transparency  and at a great cost in accountability to       the public and damage to the Freedom of Information Act  one of       the cornerstones of our democracy  It establishes the right of       Americans to know what their government is doing  or not       doing  As President Johnson said in 1966  when he signed the       Freedom of Information Act into law    This legislation springs from one       of our most essential principles  A democracy works best when       the people have all the information that the security of the       Nation permits   Sadly  the Administration has       tried to undermine the Act and  in so doing  has done harm not       only the Act itself  but to the democratic principles it       serves  In 2001  Attorney General Ashcroft reversed his       predecessors policy on FOIA  Janet Reno told the government        When in doubt  disclose  John Ashcroft flipped this policy on       its head  sending the message that government agencies should       err on the side on non disclosure and promising that the       Department of Justice would defend those decisions to withhold       information in the courts  In nearly every piece of legislation       that touches on FOIA  we can count on government agencies or       powerful special interests to work overtime to tack on statutory       exemptions from FOIA    The Bush Administration has tried       to control the flow of information through the news media  It       tried to limit or in some cases even prevent the press from       documenting the death and destruction and deadly delay in the       shameful aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  It blocked the       publication of respectful photos of coffins holding the remains       of American soldiers killed in  Iraq  The Administration       broadcast ads featuring Armstrong Williams  a conservative       commentator  supporting the No Child Left Behind Act  without       disclosing that it paid for Williams endorsement  The       Government Accountability Office found that the government       engaged in illegal propaganda  And just days ago  a high level       White House official was indicted for lying to federal       prosecutors in the CIA leak investigation  This last episode        which remains under investigation  is an incredible example of       the government seeking to manipulate press coverage of a highly       sensitive issue    namely  why this Nation went to war in Iraq         A vital democracy cannot afford to       be spoon fed information by the government that belongs to the       people themselves  More can and must be done to increase access       to government  such as the work I am doing with Senator Cornyn       to improve the implementation of FOIA  Certainly  more can be       done in the Third Branch  Although most judicial proceedings       are open to those who can travel to the courthouse and wait in       line  emerging technology could invite the rest of the country       into the courtroom  All  50 states have allowed some form       of audio or video coverage of court proceedings  but the federal       courts lag behind  I have cosponsored several bills to address       this  including two bills currently pending  the Sunshine in the       Courtroom Act of 2005 with Senator Grassley  and the  Televising Supreme       Court Proceedings Act  with Senator Specter        These bills extend the tradition of openness to the Nations       federal courts and can help Americans be better informed about       the important decisions that are made there and how they are       made    In 1994  the Judicial Conference       concluded that the time was not ripe to permit cameras in the       federal courts  and it rejected a recommendation of the Court       Administration and Case Management Committee to authorize the       photographing  recording  and broadcasting of civil proceedings       in federal trial and appellate courts  Today  the time is       ripe  The First Amendment is one of the magnificent bequests of       earlier Americans to all the generations that follow  These       rights are a fragile gift  needing nurturing and protection by       each new generation  We should use the technology available to       this generation to give even greater effect to the guarantees of       that Amendment and the free and open government it facilitates        It is time to let the sunshine into our federal courts   I thank all of the witnesses who       have exercised their First Amendment rights by sharing their       thoughts with us today  The federal courts serve as a bulwark       for the protection of individual rights and liberties and the       Supreme Court is often the final arbiter of Constitutional       questions which have a profound effect on all Americans        Allowing the public greater access to the public proceedings of       the federal courts will allow Americans to evaluate for       themselves the quality of justice in this country  and deepen       their understanding of the work that goes on in the courts
