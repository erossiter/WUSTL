       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Amendment To Strike Immunity From The FISA   Amendments Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On Amendment To Strike Immunity From  The      FISA Amendments Act Of 2007  S 2248        I strongly oppose the blanket grant of retroactive immunity in the      Intelligence Committee bill to amend the Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act  This Administration violated FISA by conducting      warrantless surveillance of Americans for more than five years       They got caught  or they would probably still be doing it  When the      public found out about the Presidents illegal surveillance of      Americans  the Administration and the telephone companies were sued      by citizens who believe their privacy and their rights were      violated  Now  the Administration is trying to get this Congress to      terminate those lawsuits in order to insulate itself from      accountability  We should not allow this to happen              The Administration knows that these lawsuits may be the only way      that it will ever be called to account for its flagrant disrespect      for the rule of law  In running its illegal program of warrantless      surveillance  the Administration relied on legal opinions prepared      in secret and shown to only a tiny group of like minded officials      who made sure they got the advice they wanted  Jack Goldsmith  who      came in briefly to head the Justice Departments Office of Legal      Counsel described the program as a legal mess  This      Administration does not want a court to get a chance to look at that      mess  Retroactive immunity would assure that they get their wish                  Senator Rockefeller and I have been consulting since this summer to      find ways to obtain access to the information that our members      needed to evaluate the Administrations arguments for immunity       This is information that the Administration had consistently denied      to the Judiciary Committee  Indeed  Chairman Specter was prepared      to proceed to subpoena information from the telephone companies in      light of the Administrations stonewalling last Congress  Finally       Chairman Rockefeller obtained access for the Intelligence Committee      just before their markup on this bill  Eventually  I was able to      obtain access to previously unavailable materials for the members of      the Judiciary Committee as well              As this matter comes to the Senate  it is past time for all other      Senators and members of Congress to have access to the information      they need to make informed judgments about the provisions of these      bills  I say  again  that should include all Senators and      appropriately cleared staff  I urge the Administration to reverse      its ill advised course of the last several years and immediately      provide full access so that we can all work together based on direct      review of the documents and a common factual and legal understanding      of what has gone on and what is needed              I have drawn very different conclusions than Senator Rockefeller      about retroactive immunity  I oppose granting blanket retroactive      immunity  I agree with Senator Specter and many others that blanket      retroactive immunity  which would end ongoing lawsuits by      legislative fiat  undermines accountability  Senator Specter has      been working diligently as the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee       and now as its ranking member  to obtain judicial review of the      legality of the warrantless wiretapping of Americans from 2001 into      this year  I agree that the check and balance the judiciary      provides in our constitutional democracy has an important role to      play and should be protected  Judicial review can provide a measure      of accountability  and should              We hear from the Administration and some of our colleagues that we      must grant immunity or the telephone companies will no longer      cooperate with the government  Senators should understand that if      we do not grant retroactive immunity  telecommunications carriers      will still have immunity for actions they take in the future  If      they follow the law  they have immunity  Their cooperation in the      future will be required by legal orders and they will not be subject      to liability for doing what the law requires              Immunity in the future is not the issue  The issue is retroactive      immunity  what Senator Dodd likens to amnesty  for actions that were      not consistent with FISA  I believe that the rule of law is      important and that protecting the rights of Americans from unlawful      surveillance is important  I do not believe that Congress can or      should seek to take those rights and those claims from those already      harmed  Moreover  ending ongoing litigation would eliminate an      avenue of accountability for the governments illegal actions       Accordingly  I appose blanket retroactive immunity              Instead  I will continue to work with Senator Specter as well as      with Senators Feinstein and Whitehouse to try to craft a more      effective alternative to retroactive immunity  We are working with      the legal concept of substitution to place the government in the      shoes of the private defendants that acted at its behest  and to let      it assume full responsibility for the illegal conduct  I believe      that requires reaching agreement that the lawsuits should be able to      reach the merits and that the program will be subject to judicial      review so that its legality can be determined              Again  this Administration violated FISA by conducting warrantless      surveillance for more than five years  They got caught and they got      sued  Now  the Administrations insistence that those lawsuits be      terminated by congressional action is designed to insulate itself      from accountability  Retroactive immunity would do more than let      the carriers off the hook  It would shield this Administration from      any accountability for conducting surveillance outside the law  It      would stop the lawsuits that are now working their way through the      courts dead in their tracks and leave Americans whose privacy has      been violated illegally no chance to be made whole  These lawsuits      are perhaps the only avenue that exists for an outside review of the      governments actions  That kind of assessment is critical if our      government is to be held accountable  That is why I do not support      legislation to terminate these legal challenges and I will vote to      strike it
