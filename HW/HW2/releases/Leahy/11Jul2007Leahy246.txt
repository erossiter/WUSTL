       Leahy Pushes Administration To End Its Foot Dragging In Processing    Hometown Heroes  Survivor Benefits For First Responder Families                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy     Pushes Administration    To End Its Foot Dragging In Processing    Hometown Heroes Survivor Benefits    For First Responder Families WASHINGTON  Wednesday  July 11     Four years after     Congress unanimously passed the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act  the laws prime     sponsor  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Wednesday pressed the Bush     Administration to end its foot dragging in administering the program and     to promptly release funds designated for survivor benefits  Leahy  who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee      authored the legislation in the Senate in 2003 and has written to     President Bush and the Department of Justice asking why only six     applications have been approved and why the processing backlog has now     grown to nearly 200 pending claims  Families of fallen public safety     officers who suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes in the line of duty     or up to 24 hours after a non routine stressful or strenuous     line of duty activity or training event are eligible for survivor     benefits through the Justice Department  Currently  198 families of     fallen public safety officers are still waiting to hear from the     Department of Justice  DOJ  about their claims  Forty eight families     have been turned down  and only six families have received any benefits     from this program  Following are Leahys remarks from a news     conference Wednesday in which Leahy  other members of Congress  family     members whose claims are still pending  and representatives from the     fire and police communities called on the Bush Administration and the     Justice Department to release the funds under the Hometown Heroes     Survivors Benefits Act      Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hometown Heroes News Conference    Capitol Hill    July 11  2007 In November of 2003  Congress unanimously passed     the Hometown Heroes Act to extend federal survivor benefits to the     families of firefighters  police officers  and EMS responders who die of     heart attack or stroke in the line of duty  That December  with great     fanfare  the President signed the legislation into law before a large     group of fire service and law enforcement officers  Then  once the     camera lights were turned off  the pending cases almost immediately     began piling up at the Justice Department   Nearly three years passed before the Justice     Department released its final implementation rule  in effect  delaying     implementation of the law and disregarding the clear will of Congress to     promptly grant these surviving families the death benefits they are     due  Now  nearly four years after our Hometown Heroes bill became law      the Justice Department has approved only six claims  nationwide  and     denied 48 families this important benefit  out of the 260 applications     the Department has backlogged  We are here to call the Justice     Departments sorry record of administering this program into account      and to demand action to put this law fully into effect to help the     families of these Hometown Heroes  My frustrations  and the frustrations of the first     responder community  grow daily over the Justice Departments glacial     processing of these applications  and I am deeply troubled that the     White House has not put more pressure on the Attorney General to     implement this law  They know the Justice Department has stalled this     program  weve told them  again and again  We have sent two letters      one to the Attorney General back in April  and one to President Bush     back in June  asking that they immediately devise a plan for dealing     with the mountain of pending cases  Our letters have met the same     stalling and the same silence from this Administration that we have     found on many other oversight issues   Heart attacks and strokes are a grim fact of life     and death in the high pressure jobs of police officers  firefighters and     medics  They are killers that they face day in and day out  like     speeding bullets and burning buildings  Emergency first responders put     their lives on the line for us  and we owe their families our gratitude      our respect and our help  They are always there for us  We should be     there for them  For these families  no death payment can fill the void     left by these losses  but ending this disparity can help these families     keep food on the table and shelter over their heads  allowing them to     move on with their lives  as best they can  The Justice Department immediately should award the     families of these brave public safety officers their rightful benefits     under the law by expediting all of the outstanding Hometown Heroes     claims  And they should stop making burdensome information requests of     those who filed claims  like ten years worth of past medical records      Instead of harassing these grieving families  the Department of Justice     should be working with them to honor their lawful claims as promptly as     possible   We are discovering  once again  that first     responders simply are not a high enough priority for these folks  First     responders may not be well enough connected to the powers that be in the     Administration  but first responders are directly connected by lifelines     to their communities  and that should count for more  If this situation does not get resolved quickly  I     will work with Senator Specter to ensure that those responsible for     these endless delays give a full accounting of their actions to the     Senate Judiciary Committee and to the American people  We need heroes  and we have heroes  And this is     not the way to treat our heroes  We should honor them and respect their     families and the sacrifices they have made to help keep our communities     safe
