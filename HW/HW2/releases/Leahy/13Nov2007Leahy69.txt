       Statement Of Sen  Leahy  Senate Judiciary Committee Hearing On   Exploring The Scope Of Public Performance Rights                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  Hearing on Exploring The Scope Of Public Performance      Rights  November 13  2007            Like most people  I am an avid music fan  Music inspires us  Music      connects us to others and to matters larger than ourselves  Music      fills our memories  While I am grateful to broadcasters for all the      music I first heard on the radio  I also feel strongly that artists      should be compensated for their work  So the issue of performance      rights on sound recordings can be stated pretty simply  Should      broadcast radio continue to use musicians work without paying for      it             The issue of performance rights raises the issue of fairness       Although the question is simple  the answer may not be  First  is      it fair to continue to exempt broadcasters from royalty      obligations  Second  is it fair to U S  copyright holders for the      United States not to align its practices with all the other OECD      countries  which recognize a performance right  Third  is it fair      for some kinds of radio equivalents to pay royalties to performers      but for traditional broadcast radio stations to continue to be      exempt from such obligations  Webcasting and satellite radio pay      performers for their work  but broadcast radio  which generates      advertising revenue by playing the same music  does not  Fourth  is      it fair to require the same payment from small  noncommercial  or      religious radio stations as those broadcasters that own many      stations and generate large profits  And finally  is it fair to      impose public service requirements on broadcast radio but not to      make those demands of others             I want to be sure that our culture remains vital and vibrant  Radio      has been part of that vibrancy  whether it is old fashioned      broadcast radio or new fangled Internet radio  I want it not only      to survive  but to prosper  I want my grandchildren to have the      widest possible access to good music  including classics or new      creations  But I also want to be sure that the creative artists       those who perform that music  get their due  When we turn on the      radio  I want to know that the voices I hear belong to artists who      are being treated fairly              I thank our witnesses today  especially because they arranged to be      here on such short notice and with very busy schedules
