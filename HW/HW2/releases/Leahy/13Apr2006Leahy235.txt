       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy Regarding The Pro Democracy Protests In   Nepal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Regarding The Pro Democracy Protests In Nepal     April 13  2006  The protests were predictable after      the King showed absolutely no willingness to back down  even as the      Maoist insurgency has grown steadily worse    It is time for the army to put strong      pressure on the King before they harm more demonstrators and further      discredit themselves in the eyes of the Nepali people and the      international community    This is a precarious time for Nepal       but the peoples desire for democracy and peace will ultimately      prove stronger than the ambitions of a feudalistic autocrat
