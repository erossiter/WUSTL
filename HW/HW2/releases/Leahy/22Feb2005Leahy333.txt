       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Michael Chertoff                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT      Leahy       Calls For Hearings On Info Brokers      That Are Emerging As Private Intelligence Agencies       ChoicePoint Episode Is Latest Tripwire Warning Of The Need For Privacy       Protections  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Feb  22   The ranking       member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  a longtime champion of the       publics privacy rights  says ChoicePoints sale of personal and financial       records of thousands of Americans to con artists is a tripwire that should       trigger a broad congressional examination of the rapid rise of private       intelligence bureaus with little oversight and few rules that protect       public privacy   New technologies  new private public       domestic security partnerships  and the rapid rise of giant information       brokers that collect and sell personal information about each and every       American have all combined to produce powerful new threats to privacy        said Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt  Its time to turn some sunshine on these       developments so the public can understand how and why their personal       information is being used   Leahy is calling for a series of hearings       before the Senate Judiciary Committee to examine the privacy  security and       civil liberty implications of recent trends in information technology        including the creation of digital dossiers on individuals and the sale of       personal data to the government as these enhanced information gathering       technologies continue to emerge    In a letter to Committee Chairman Arlen       Specter  R Pa   sent on Tuesday  Leahy said  There is no doubt that the       advances of the information age have improved our lives and made us safer        But we will only be able to maximize their benefits to secure our nation       and preserve its values if we take proactive steps to understand these new       technologies and their implications   MSNBC last week reported that criminals       posing as legitimate businesses bought access to personal and financial       data stored by ChoicePoint  which compiles databases that include       information on virtually every American  including credit information        Social Security numbers and other data  which the firm sells to legitimate       firms and to government agencies  ChoicePoint has notified consumers in       all 50 states that their personal data may have been accessed by       unauthorized third parties        including more than 34 000 consumers in California  more than       10 000 in Florida and almost 7 000 in North Carolina  Reports indicate that       at least 145 000 may be affected   We need to master these technological       advances rather than allow them to master us  Recent events indicate that       we are in danger of losing this struggle  said Leahy  pointing to the       ChoicePoint episode as well as sobering findings of an investigation of       these issues in the new book  No Place to Hide by  Washington Post reporter Robert       OHarrow Jr   Privacy and liberty have always been       important to the American people  and our collective vigilance in       protecting these cherished values has allowed us to enjoy unparalleled       freedoms  safety and economic benefits  We must continue this vigilance        Leahy said  It       is time for the sunshine of congressional oversight to begin clarifying       some of these issues                Leahy       Letter to Specter Follows             February 22  2005 The Honorable Arlen Specter      Chairman      Senate Committee on the Judiciary      226 Dirksen Senate Office Building      Washington  D C  20510  Dear Arlen   I offer again my best wishes and prayers for       a speedy recovery as you face this challenge  and I look forward to your       quick return to the Senate    In recent days  we have learned that the       personal information of 145 000 Americans was sold by a private       corporation  ChoicePoint Inc   to criminals posing as legitimate       businesses  According to media reports  these criminals amassed enough       sensitive information about citizens in all 50 states  including more than       1 800 in Pennsylvania  to lay the groundwork for a massive       identity theft ring that shocked law enforcement officials         We are in an era in which advanced       technologies have opened up new possibilities that even a few years ago       seemed out of reach  Among those advances is the rapid collection  sharing       and analyzing of large amounts of data previously unavailable without great       effort  if at all  These powerful tools have enhanced our law enforcement       and homeland security efforts  as well as made our lives more convenient       and enjoyable    These advances also present new challenges       that require vigilant congressional scrutiny  The American people have the       right and the need to know and understand how their personal information is       being used  It is time for the sunshine of congressional oversight to       begin clarifying some of these issues  I am writing to request a series of       oversight hearings before the Judiciary Committee to consider these and       other important issues relating to technology  privacy and security       protections     Information Brokering          The rapid rise of database giants such as ChoicePoint  Acxiom  and         LexisNexis has created new challenges for privacy and security  These         information brokers have amassed billions of private and public records         on individuals that include sensitive information such as financial          travel  medical and insurance data  They often go into such detail as         the names of neighbors and family members or the collection of digital         photographs of individuals  I know of one woman  who when recently         contacted by her credit card company to verify purchases  was asked to         confirm detailed information about her ex husband and the address of her         former sister in law rather than the usual social security number or         mothers maiden name  These companies use this information to create         digital dossiers on individuals so that they can sell this data to         other companies for a variety of purposes including marketing and         screening for employment  Very little is known about the integrity and         handling of this information  and there are insufficient rules and         oversight to protect public privacy  The activities of this industry can         have significant consequences  as illustrated by the recent development         with the ChoicePoint  which has information on virtually every American          ChoicePoint is not alone  Acxiom has had two similar breaches  This is         only the latest tripwire warning about the privacy implications that lie         ahead for the American people as these technologies rush onward   I         attach recent articles on ChoicePoint      Government Access to Commercial Data          Increasingly  the FBI  DHS and many other agencies turn to information         brokers to gather and analyze individuals personal data on their behalf         for a variety of purposes    e g           to screen airline travelers or identify possible terrorists  For         example  an executive of ChoicePoint was recently quoted as saying  We         do act as an intelligence agency  gathering data  applying analytics          Also notable  in a recent public radio documentary drawn from the         groundbreaking book  No Place To Hide  by  Washington Post reporter         Robert OHarrow Jr     which chronicles and analyzes the emergence of         these personal database brokers  former U S  Assistant Attorney General         Viet Dinh  now a ChoicePoint security consultant  said The amount of         information that is publicly available to businesses about any individual         is mind boggling  I am not comfortable that we are where we need to be         in order to circumscribe governmental use of private intelligence  The         government alone can tail us  can investigate us and can deprive us of         life and liberty  The Committee should look at how to maximize the         benefits of this capability for legitimate purposes  while ensuring that         our legal protections on accessing and using such data keep pace     Government Data Mining          New technologies have allowed computers to rapidly sort and process         information for a myriad of purposes  including identifying how people         are related  recognizing patterns in human behavior and attempting to         predict future actions  Last year  the Technology and Privacy Advisory         Committee  TAPAC  appointed by Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to         examine the Total Information Awareness program issued a report which         concluded that this type of analysis  often called data mining is a         vital tool in the fight against terrorism  but when used in connection         with personal data concerning U S  persons  data mining can present         significant privacy issues  The report found that there is a critical         need for Congress to exercise appropriate oversight of data mining and         recommended that Congress take those steps necessary to ensure the         protection of U S  persons privacy and the efficient and effective         oversight of government data mining activities through the judiciary and         by this nations elected leaders through a politically credible         process  We need to look at these developments and their implications         for law enforcement  as well as our current laws  Hearings by our         Committee would be precisely in keeping with this finding     Impact of New Technologies on Surveillance         Law  Radio Frequency Identification  RFID  Technology          GPS  keystroke logging  spyware  and enhanced data storage are all         developments that increase our ability to know and track individuals          These changes have created new opportunities  as well as challenges for         law enforcement  An important question for the Committee is whether our         wiretapping and other applicable laws have kept pace as technology has         broadened the type and nature of information collection     Data Outsourcing  One of         the ways in which companies have reduced the cost of digitizing data has         been to send printed records abroad for data entry  Some of this         information includes highly personal data  and the Fourth Amendment and         other protections we enjoy on our soil do not always travel with that         data  For example  last year it was reported that a Pakistani         transcriber of medical files from a San Francisco hospital threatened to         post that information on the Internet unless she received back pay          Compromised data not only violates privacy  but might also be used by         terrorists for identity theft or for undermining domestic security  The         Committee should examine this trend and evaluate whether sufficient         protections are afforded     There is no doubt that the advances of the       information age have improved our lives and made us safer  But we will       only be able to maximize their benefits to secure our nation and preserve       its values if we take proactive steps to understand these new technologies       and their implications  I look forward to your return to the Senate and       working with you on these important oversight issues    Sincerely   Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member
