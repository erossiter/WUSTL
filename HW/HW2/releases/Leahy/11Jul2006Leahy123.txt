       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Lahy On The Nomination Of William J  Haynes To   The Fourth Circuit Court Of Appeals                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of William J  Haynes II      To The Fourth Circuit Court Of Appeals      July 11  2006  William J  Haynes II has been      renominated to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals  I have met with      Mr  Haynes twice and shared with him my questions and concerns about      this nomination  Mr  Haynes has been General Counsel of the      Department of Defense since 2001  and in that role has been a key      player in some of the more controversial and questionable policies      this Administration has issued relating to the treatment and      detention of military detainees    The first time around  Mr  Hayness      nomination was rushed through the Committee in March 2004 before      members of the Committee had answers to our questions  It was      shortly thereafter that we learned of the scandalous treatment of      prisoners at Abu Ghraib prison  which raised additional questions      about treatment and interrogation of detainees  In the intervening      years  we have learned a bit more about policies and legal positions      apparently advocated by Mr  Haynes  and the devastating effects      those policies have had on our military and our security  My      questions and concerns about this nomination have continued to grow      as more information has become available    Press reports and Mr  Hayness own      statements in the Judiciary Committee questionnaire and elsewhere      indicate that he played a key role in developing United States      policy toward detainees in Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere       Specifically  he made legal findings and set policies for military      tribunals for detainees  the designation of individuals as enemy      combatants  and the limits on cruel  inhumane  or degrading      interrogation techniques    Many of these policies have since been      discredited  The Supreme Court  in the case of  Hamdan v  Rumsfeld       recently ruled that military tribunals as constituted by this      Administration were illegal  and that the theory of almost      unlimited presidential power that underpinned many of this      Administrations policies is invalid  On the issue of detainee      interrogation policy  the Department of Justice in late 2003      withdrew the controversial 2002 Bybee memo asserting that the      President could authorize and immunize torture  and the Defense      Department in 2005 declared its working group report  which had      reached similar conclusions  a non operational historical document        The question for Mr  Haynes is where      he stood in the development and analysis of these crucial       discredited policies and legal analysis  I look  by way of      comparison  at Alberto Mora  former General Counsel of the United      States Navy  Mr  Mora this year won a Profile in Courage Award from      the John F  Kennedy Library Foundation for standing up to policies      that he recognized as alien to our morals and values and dangerous      to our troops  Mr  Mora wrote a July 7  2004  memorandum to the      Navys Inspector General  setting out his tireless efforts to      reverse what he saw as an intolerable direction in United States      policy and legal analysis   Mr  Mora said in accepting the Profile      in Courage Award that for as long as these policies were in effect      our government had adopted what only can be labeled as a policy of      cruelty  He said  Cruelty disfigures our national character  It      is incompatible with our constitutional order  with our laws  and      with our most prized values  Cruelty can be as effective as torture      in destroying human dignity  and there is no moral distinction      between one and the other   I want to hear from Mr  Haynes what      his role was in the debates over the interrogation and punishment of      detainees  whether he shared Mr  Moras horror at policies      authorizing cruelty  and whether he stood up to others to try to put      a stop to these policies  Public accounts suggest otherwise  They      suggest that Mr  Haynes defended the Administrations authorization      of cruel interrogation tactics  that he discounted the concerns of      Mr  Mora and others  and that he personally recommended that      Secretary Rumsfeld approve specific cruel interrogation techniques       His actions may have earned him a nomination from this President       but they have only heightened my concerns about this nomination        Yesterday I received a letter from 20      retired senior military officials  many of them generals and      admirals expressing deep concern about this nomination  They are      particularly concerned that Mr  Haynes may not have given proper      regard to the views of uniformed and experienced military      attorneys  They wrote        Mr  Haynes was arguably in the strongest position of any other      senior government official to sound the alarm about the likely      consequences for military personnel of the views being put forward      by the Justice Department  because he had the benefit of the clear      and unanimous concerns voiced by the uniformed Judge Advocate      General of each of the military services  Yet Mr  Haynes seems to      have muted these concerns  rather than amplify them   Press reports suggest that career      military lawyers were also shut out of the process of determining      procedures for military tribunals and that Mr  Haynes played a key      role in this process  including opposing any civilian review of the      tribunals  If Mr  Haynes had listened to career uniformed      attorneys  perhaps the Supreme Courts decision in the  Hamdan case checking the      encroachment of Executive power would not have been necessary   Documents and press accounts suggest      that Mr  Haynes similarly disregarded the concerns of law      enforcement officials who argued that the Defense Departments      interrogation policies were ineffective and potentially harmful   The 20 retired senior military      officers wrote that the authorization of cruel interrogation      techniques has had and will have a devastating effect on our country      and on our military  They wrote  Today  it is clear that these      policies  which rejected long standing military law grounded in      decades of operational expertise  have fostered animosity toward the      United States  undermined rather than enhanced our intelligence      gathering efforts  and added significantly to the risks facing our      troops serving around the world   This distinguished group of retired      officers concluded that the Administrations detainee policies have      put our troops in harms way and undermined our security  We know      that these policies resulted in abuses at Abu Ghraib and elsewhere       for which young soldiers have been prosecuted and punished  If Mr       Haynes was in fact instrumental in formulating and defending these      policies  it is difficult to understand how he earned a promotion      while others who implemented these policies were severely punished   We learn this morning  during the      course of a hearing that Mr  Haynes did not attend but to which he      sent his deputy  that days ago  the Defense Department issued a      memorandum stating that military detainees being held do deserve      some protections under the Geneva Conventions  It was not mentioned      in the Administrations written testimony  some of which was not      distributed until near midnight last night did not mention this      relevant memorandum from last week  Nor did Mr  Haynes deputy      mention it in his initial remarks  Instead  we learned about it      through press accounts and had to ask about the press accounts to      determine its existence  We now would like to know what role Mr       Haynes played in its formulation and whether it reflects an      admission of error and change of heart and legal analysis on his      part    I also have significant concerns      whether Mr  Haynes would recuse himself if issues and policies on      which he worked at the Department of Defense were to come before him      as a judge  He has refused to make that commitment to me in our      private conversations or at an earlier hearing  My suspicion is      that a motivation of the President for making this nomination is to      have another sure vote on the Fourth Circuit to uphold his actions       The Fourth Circuit and the D C  Circuit have emerged as the courts      to which the Administration directs issues on which the President      asserts unitary executive power and wants to be sustained    The key to our constitutional system      is the separation and balance of power  The legislative and      judicial branches must serve as a check on the Executive  The      Republican Congress has failed to act as a check  instead acting as      a rubber stamp for this Presidents policies  That makes the      independent judiciary all the more important  Mr  Hayness record      of helping to formulate  justify and defend this Administrations      damaging policies and his failure to commit to recusing himself from      hearing cases as a judge on these very same policies raise major      concerns whether he would act as a check on the Executive     I also have concerns about whether Mr       Haynes has always in the past been straightforward with Congress       with the American people  and with me  Mr  Haynes wrote a letter to      me on June 25  2003 in response to a letter I had sent to      then National Security Advisor Condoleeza Rice  In his letter  Mr       Haynes wrote that  under Article 16 of the Convention Against      Torture  the United States also has an obligation to undertake       to prevent other acts of cruel  inhuman  or degrading treatment or      punishment which do not amount to torture  He defined cruel       inhuman  or degrading treatment as that treatment or punishment      prohibited by the Fifth  Eighth or Fourteenth Amendments to our      constitution and said  United States policy is to treat all      detainees and conduct all interrogations  wherever they may occur       in a manner consistent with this commitment   I found that letter reassuring  as did      many others  Press reports suggest  though  that when Mr  Haynes      sent that letter to me  the Department of Defense had recently      approved many harsh interrogation techniques and had adopted a      working group report presenting a flawed legal justification for      cruel treatment of detainees  Indeed  press accounts suggest that      as recently as late last year  Mr  Haynes helped to defeat a      proposal that would have made it official Department of Defense      policy that detainees be treated in accordance with Common Article      Three of the Geneva conventions  barring cruel  inhumane  and      degrading treatment  It is of great concern to me if Mr  Haynes      made reassuring statements to Members of Congress  while pursuing a      very different policy                      Letters of Opposition
