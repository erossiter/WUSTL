       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To SEC And FTC Investigations Of   ChoicePoint And ChoicePoint s Change In Product Offerings                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt           Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         To SEC And FTC Investigations Of ChoicePoint        And ChoicePoints Change In Product Offerings        Friday  March 4  2005    The         fact that both the SEC and FTC are looking into ChoicePoints practices is         welcome  ChoicePoint was careless in the treatment of peoples sensitive         personal data  and the decision of key executives to sell nearly  17         million of stock near the time of this breach raises grave questions about         the circumstances of those sales  Our upcoming Judiciary Committee         hearing will let some sunshine in on these practices so the American         people can know how their information is being collected  stored  sold and         used  and so that Congress can consider the need for privacy and security         rules to protect the public   The        ChoicePoint debacle spotlights the fact that highly personal information        about each and every American is threatened today by too few safeguards        against breaches like these that can instantly throw thousands of peoples        lives into chaos  The government is outsourcing more and more data        analysis and security screening work to private data bureaus like        ChoicePoint  which have grown exponentially in just the last few years          Problems like these certainly raise questions about the way ChoicePoint and        other data brokers are handling its contracts with the federal government        that involve highly sensitive personal and financial information about        millions of Americans  A growing number of us in Congress intend to push        hard to get answers to those questions          ChoicePoint has told the public that the company had never had a similar        problem before  but the facts tell a different story  In 2002 ChoicePoint        had sold sensitive personal data to a woman posing as a legitimate real        estate business person  resulting in at least a million dollar loss due to        fraudulent activity  This was the same type of scam  and it appears that        the company did not fully learn from this earlier mistake  ChoicePoint is        not alone  in the past two years  Acxiom has also had two security        breaches   It is        high time for this industry to get serious about its security and privacy        practices  While ChoicePoint has now indicated that it will be pulling out        of certain markets  the issues raised by this industrys practices are much        broader than this incident  A single market shift does not satisfy all        concerns  and the upcoming congressional inquiries  will help gauge the        depth of these problems                      in the Senate Banking and Senate Judiciary        Committees
