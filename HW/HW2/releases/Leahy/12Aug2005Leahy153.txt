       Letter From Senate Judiciary Democrats To Attorney General Alberto   Gonzales                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Letter From Senate Judiciary      Democrats To Attorney General Alberto Gonzales     August 12 2005     The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W      Washington       D C  20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   We write in response to your letter of      last Friday rejecting our limited request for documents relating to      any work done by Judge John G  Roberts  Jr   on a small number of      important cases during the time that he served as Principal Deputy      Solicitor General  We are disappointed by your response and urge you      to reconsider  We would welcome the chance to meet with you in      person to discuss your concerns and our concerns   We have been concerned by media      reports that the Administration is delaying the release of White      House Counsel documents it has promised to turn over  Your decision      to deny access to even the limited group of documents we requested      from Judge Roberts s time as Principal Deputy Solicitor General  the      most important period of his Executive Branch service  is all the      more disturbing   The Judiciary Committee is entitled to      a complete understanding of Judge Roberts s role in the Office of      the Solicitor General  OSG  in the 16 cases identified in our July      29thletter  Of the various administration positions he held  his      service as the political deputy in the OSG may well be the most      relevant for evaluating the Supreme Court nomination  He had an even      more significant policy role there than in his previous positions       and his approach to his work as an appellate advocate before the      Supreme Court may particularly illuminate his views on judicial      decision making  Since he was also in a considerably more senior      position  he had had more time to refine his legal analysis and      question his previous views  and documents from that period may      provide even more insight than the highly revealing documents from      earlier in his career   As you know  the records we have      received so far were already publicly available  and suggest that      Judge Roberts  while working for the Attorney General earlier in his      career  had strong views about such vital issues as access to the      courts  women s rights to equal treatment  the right to privacy  and      the scope of civil rights laws  It is therefore especially important      for us to examine his later work on these issues in cases before the      OSG in order to get a sense of his approach to these and other key      rights and values at a different time in his career  In addition       the internal documents from that period will help us to evaluate      whether the views in the publicly available OSG briefs representing      the Bush Administration were also shared by Judge Roberts      personally  and to evaluate the progression and consistency of his      legal reasoning and analysis throughout his career   In a 1991 resume  Judge Roberts      himself emphasized that he had final responsibility for determining      whether the United States would seek further review of adverse      decisions in some 380 cases by that point in his service at the      OSG  This statement makes clear the importance of his work in that      Office and the amount of discretion he commanded there  Nonetheless       of these 380 cases  and the many others that were handled by the OSG      during his tenure  we have requested only documents relating to 16      cases that appeared to raise key issues vital to the rights of all      Americans   These documents were prepared by      attorneys in the OSG acting for the American people  We are      requesting them for use by the Senate in the exercise of the      Senate s explicit constitutional responsibility  and they are      therefore not subject to the attorney client privilege  Judiciary      Committee Chairman Specter  in his letter relating to the documents      we have requested  did not lend support to any claim of      attorney client privilege  Indeed  former Senator Fred Thompson  who      is helping the White House with this nomination  previously said of      the attorney client privilege that   i n case after case  the      courts have concluded that allowing it to be used against Congress      would be an impediment to Congress  obligation and duty to get to      the truth and carry out its investigative and oversight      responsibilities  Former Senator Thompson noted that even President      Nixon  with his expansive concept of presidential power  did not      claim such a privilege when White House Counsel John Dean testified       and that President Reagan did not claim the privilege when notes and      memoranda of lawyers were produced in the inquiry into Iran Contra        Congressional Record  Dec  20  1995   Similarly  Senator Orrin      Hatch has said  The attorney client privilege exists as only a      narrow exception to broad rules of disclosure  And the privilege      exists only as a statutory creation  or by operation of State common      law  No statute or Senate or House rule applies the attorney client      privilege to Congress  In fact  both the Senate and the House have      explicitly refused to formally include the privilege in their      rules   Congressional Record  Dec  20  1995    It is instructive to look at the      reasoning of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia      Circuit  when that court declined in 1998 to recognize the      attorney client privilege claim of Deputy White House Counsel Bruce      Lindsey  The Court emphasized that even the most sensitive      conversations between the President and his top advisors may have to      be revealed to a grand jury  and the Court further stated that      conversations with legal advisers should be treated no differently   Only a certain conceit among those      admitted to the bar could explain why legal advice should be on a      higher plane than advice about policy  or politics  or why a      President s conversation with the most junior lawyer in the White      House     is deserving of more protection from disclosure in a grand      jury investigation than a President s discussions with     a Cabinet      Secretary  W e do not believe lawyers are more important to the      operations of government than all other officials  or that the      advice lawyers render is more crucial to the functioning of the      Presidency than the advice coming from all other quarters       I t      would be contrary to tradition  common understanding  and our      governmental system for the attorney client privilege to attach to      White House Counsel in the same manner as private counsel   In re Lindsey  158 F 3d      1273  1278  D C  Cir  1998    This case makes clear that documents      from the White House Counsel s office are not subject to the      attorney client privilege  as to the documents at issue here arising      from the OSG  which represents the American people rather than the      President specifically  the inapplicability of any privilege is even      clearer  And  as noted above  any privilege that might apply in a      grand jury context would not apply to a document request from      Congress  Indeed  in one case cited as recognizing limited      privileges  the D C  Circuit emphasized that its holding was in the      grand jury context and not applicable to Congress  The Court wrote        W e take no position on how the institutional needs of Congress      and the President should be balanced   In re Sealed Case  121      F 3d 729  D C  Cir  1997   Moreover  as you are aware  the      Department of Justice has provided similar documents in the      consideration of numerous past nominees  When Robert Bork was      nominated to the Supreme Court  the last time a Supreme Court      nominee had served in the OSG  the Department of Justice provided      documents from his time as Solicitor General  including both      documents on Watergate related issues and others concerning  substantive      matters of interest to Senators  Those documents were provided in a      spirit of compromise pursuant to a limited request from members of      the Senate Judiciary Committee  much like the request we made with      respect to Judge Roberts  Similarly  the Committee requested and      received internal memoranda drafted by Justice Rehnquist  as well as      internal Department of Justice memoranda relating to the nominations      of Benjamin Civiletti to be Attorney General and Stephen Trott to be      a Ninth Circuit judge  and others  In fact  the White House has      released documents from Judge Roberts s time as a legal advisor to      the Attorney General  documents which the National Archives   would have made public anyway      without      offering any principled distinction as to why       the documents from the OSG should not be released as well   You stated in your letter last Friday      that OSG documents must be kept confidential in order to protect the      free flow of ideas among attorneys within the office  It is      important to note  however  that Judge Roberts was not a career      attorney within that office  He was a political appointee in a      leadership position  politically responsible for making high level      policy decisions  As such  he could not have expected  nor was he      entitled to  any confidentiality protection that some argue should      apply to the advice of career staff attorneys  Former Acting      Solicitor General Walter Dellinger  who had opposed Senate efforts      to obtain Miguel Estrada s OSG documents  pointed out in a recent      op ed article in the Washington      Post that Judge Roberts s case is different and      distinguishable because he was a policy making and decision making      official in the OSG and because he has been nominated to be one of      the nine Justices of the Supreme Court  In contrast  Mr       Estrada was a line attorney in the Office and was nominated to one      of the hundreds of judgeships on the nation s many courts of      appeals   You expressed concerns in your letter      about protecting the confidentiality of other attorneys in the OSG      whose memos were reviewed and commented upon by Roberts  We      would welcome working with you to  address      these and any other confidentiality      concerns that may arise as to      particular documents  In past nominations  including those of Judge      Bork to the Supreme Court and Justice Rehnquist to be Chief Justice       there were discussions back and forth between Senators and the      Department of Justice about the production of documents leading      ultimately to mutually satisfactory solutions  We look forward to      such a process now and would welcome speaking with you in person to      discuss these issues further   We appreciate your prompt attention to      this matter  and we hope that we can resolve this fundamental      important issue expeditiously so that the Committee will have      adequate time to review the requested documents in preparation for      Judge Roberts  hearing  Thank you for your cooperation with this      request   Sincerely   Leahy Kennedy     Biden
