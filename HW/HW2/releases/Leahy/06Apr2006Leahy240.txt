       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of The Vermont   Wilderness Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Introduction Of The Vermont Wilderness Act Of 2006     April 6  2006 MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  I join with Senator Jeffords today to introduce the       to designate two new wilderness      areas and to make a number of additions to existing wilderness areas      in Vermonts Green Mountain National Forest  This legislation will      also designate a new National Recreation Area  NRA  in the Green      Mountain National Forest in the area commonly known as Moosalamoo  The U S  Forest      Service has recently released its Record of Decision  ROD  and Final      Environmental Impact Statement  FEIS  for the revision of the Green      Mountain National Forest Land and Resource Management Plan  This      has been an effort encompassing several years  a lengthy process      including significant public involvement  and a great deal of      difficult and detailed work on the part of the Forest Service staff      in Vermont and our region  I want to extend      my appreciation and thanks to the staff of the Green Mountain      National Forest for their perseverance and professionalism      throughout the plan revision process  This has been by no means an      easy task  with Vermonters and other interested citizens who care      deeply about the National Forest weighing in with sincere and often      conflicting views on land  resource and forest management decisions  While there is      much of interest in such a comprehensive plan  the primary role of      the Congress lies with wilderness and other related special      designations  such as National Recreation Areas  The Vermont      Congressional Delegation has taken this responsibility seriously as      we have sought a compromise between those who would prefer      significant additions in wilderness areas and those who would prefer      none  If this recommendation were enacted  about a quarter of the      current Green Mountain National Forest would be designated as      wilderness  Just as the      recently released Land and Resource Management Plan for the Green      Mountain National Forest has elicited abundant feedback across the      spectrum of interested citizens and organizations  we expect our      proposal to do the same  We offer this legislation as a good faith      effort to find a middle ground  and once this proposal is referred      to the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  of      which I am a member  we will welcome constructive comments and      criticisms to improve the bill  Since the Vermont Congressional      Delegation has long been on the public record in favor of additional      wilderness designations within the Green Mountain National Forest       comments that are as specific as possible will be especially helpful      in helping to refine our proposal   In specific      terms  this legislation proposes a new wilderness area in the      area of approximately 28 500 acres  In the      Romance  Monastery and Worth Mountain areas the bill proposes adding      approximately 12 500 acres  which together would become the      in honor of Joseph Battell  who once owned      some 9 000 acres in this area and bequeathed thousands of acres to      Middlebury College  which eventually became the core of the north      half of the Green Mountain National Forest  The bill also      proposes designating approximately 4 200 acres for addition to the      existing       2 200 acres to the       800 acres to the       and 40 acres to the       The proposed      covers approximately 17 000      acres  This legislation      does not include additional acreage for the George D  Aiken      Wilderness Area or the Bristol Cliffs Wilderness Area  It does not      propose a wilderness designation for the area known as Lamb Brook       and it does not propose a new National Recreation Area in the      Somerset region  Our legislation      builds on the recommendations of the Forest Service  In many areas      the Delegation bill closely tracks the Forest Service plan             areas are nearly identical  In the      Glastenbury area  the Forest Service added more than 8 000 acres to      their original plan  and we have further increased the acreage of a      proposed       In addition  this legislation adds      about 2 000 acres to the Lye Brook Wilderness  above the Forest      Service recommendation  Finally  we are proposing the new       which encompasses lands the Forest      Service included in a Remote Backcountry management category  which      is essentially managed as a wilderness area  In the Moosalamoo      area  this legislation codifies the       which has the strong      support of the various communities and local partners in the area       We believe this designation best represents the actual goals of the      various stakeholders and merits this national designation       Furthermore  we have included the Forest Services Escarpment      management category in the designated area and have also included      previously agreed upon management guidelines in the bill  I would offer the      following thoughts which we have returned to on those numerous      occasions over recent years whenever this subject has been brought      up for discussion in our State  In sponsoring      this legislation today  the Vermont Congressional Delegation is      demonstrating our commitment to additional wilderness designations      on the Green Mountain National Forest  The Green Mountain National      Forest is the largest contiguous public land area in Vermont and      within a days drive for over 70 million people  We are committed to      protecting some National Forest lands for future generations under      the National Wilderness Preservation System   Our proposals      have not been driven by acreage quotas  but rather by data supplied      by the Forest Service and by interested Vermonters  Therefore  what      is too much for some will be too little for others  The timing of      this introduction was conditioned so as to allow the Forest Service      process to reach its conclusion and  at the same time  to enable      Vermonters and other interested parties to review both the Forest      Service and the Delegation recommendations  Throughout our      deliberations  we have appreciated the help of the Forest Service      staff and have recognized their commitment to their planning      regulations  guidelines and timetable  We invite all Vermonters to      join us in thanking the Forest Service staff for all the hard work      in their planning effort   While this      legislation proposes to add significant wilderness to the Green      Mountain National Forest  it bears noting that most of the lands      designated in this bill are not suitable for timber harvesting       This legislation would retain many thousands of acres available for      timber harvesting which will have to be managed in a fair  open and      professional manner  We are committed to the development of such a      process and we know the Forest Service shares this commitment  We      invite all interested parties to join in this effort  It is our hope      that given the superior manner in which the Forest Service conducted      the Forest Plan Revision process  unnecessary appeals and litigation      of the plan and future management activities can be avoided    The Green      Mountain National Forest has expanded since the last wilderness      designations were made  As Senator Stafford  then Congressman      Jeffords and I remember  during the consideration of the last      Vermont Wilderness bill in 1984 there were many perspectives on the      use of our National Forest  We assume there will be again this      time  As we were 1984  we remain committed to carrying on the      strong conservation legacy that generations of Vermonters  like      Senator Robert Stafford  have fostered over the decades   We urge anyone      who is interested in the Green Mountain National Forest to review      the whole Plan  as the Forest Service has recommended  and to look      beyond their own primary areas of concern so that we can all do what      we can to help implement the Plan  In closing  I      would note that the Delegation knows that you cannot undertake every      possible use on every acre of National Forest land  and we believe      most Vermonters support our approach to this issue  In recognition      of this fact  we are introducing this legislation as a vision for the      Green Mountain Forest for this and future generations
