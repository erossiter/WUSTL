                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chief Sponsor Of The Leahy Stevens Amendment     On The State Departments Proposed Rule  Issued Tuesday     To Implement The PASS Card Border ID System     Part Of The Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  WHTI     Tuesday  Oct  17  2006 Its depressing to     see that the Administration is still stumbling toward a debacle with the     PASS Card system  Earlier this month Congress prescribed repairs to fix     PASS Cards worst problems  but so far these agencies have blithely     ignored the help  That has to change  and we will push to make sure     that it does change  This draft rule     shows the importance of our reforms to improve the PASS Card system and     to make these agencies more accountable  Though our amendment has been     moving toward enactment for most of this year  the Administration has     failed to incorporate most of these improvements into their plan      Without even testing the technology for use as a passport or personal     ID  they have chosen a weaker security standard that would make our     borders less secure and that would risk the personal information of     millions of Americans  But this draft rule isnt the last word  Under     our new law  the security issue will be revisited when the National     Institute of Standards and Technology is required to certify whether it     would protect Americans personal identification
