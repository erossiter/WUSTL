       Comments Of Senate Judiciary Chairman Patrick Leahy After A Private   Meeting With White House Counsel Fred Fielding                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comments Of Senate Judiciary      Chairman Patrick Leahy     After A Private Meeting With White House Counsel Fred Fielding     Tuesday  March 20  2007 I was glad to      meet Mr  Fielding and I welcome the fact that these issues have his      full attention  I dont accept      his offer  It is not constructive and it is not helpful to be      telling the Senate how to do our investigation  or to prejudge its      outcome   Instead of freely      and fully providing relevant documents to the investigating      committees  they have only selectively sent documents  after erasing      large portions that they do not want to see the light of day   Testimony should      be on the record  and under oath  Thats the formula for true      accountability  I hope the      President will agree to be forthcoming  The straighter      the path to the truth  the sooner we will finally know the facts
