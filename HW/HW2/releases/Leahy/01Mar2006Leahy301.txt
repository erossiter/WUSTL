       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  PATRIOT Act Reauthorization                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      PATRIOT Act Reauthorization     March 1  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  the Senate      will soon be voting to reauthorize the USA PATRIOT Act  As one of      the authors of the original 2001 bill  as someone who voted to      reauthorize an improved version of the Act back in July 2005       and as an American concerned with our security  I am glad that we      are making progress  but disappointed at the missed opportunity to      get it right    I believe that the PATRIOT Act      provides important and valuable tools for the protection of      Americans from terrorism  These matters should be governed by law      and not by whim  Legislative action should be the clear and      unambiguous legal footing for Government powers  I am glad that the      sunsets that Congressman Armey and I insisted be included in the      2001 Act brought about reconsideration and some refinement of the      powers authorized in that measure  Now the challenge to Congress is      to provide the effective oversight that will be needed in the days      ahead and to ensure that there is effective court review of the      actions that affect the rights of Americans   Several specific provisions of this      bill reflect substantial improvement over both the original PATRIOT      Act and the reauthorization proposal initially produced by the      House Senate conference  Most importantly  the bill contains      several sunshine provisions that I proposed to facilitate      oversight and ensure some measure of public accountability for how      the Government uses its powers    For the first time ever  the Justice      Department will be required to report publicly on its use of two      secret surveillance tools that have come under fire from both civil      libertarians and the business community  the FISA business record      authority and the so called national security letters  or NSLs  The      Justice Department has been declassifying this information      sporadically  when politically convenient  it could offer no      plausible justification for keeping the information classified       especially when comparable data regarding more sensitive      surveillance techniques such as wiretapping and physical searches is      routinely disclosed   Public reporting will help restore      public confidence in our governments use of its PATRIOT Act powers       but the sort of data that can be reported publicly falls short of      what is needed to ensure that these powers are properly used  I am       therefore  pleased that the conference accepted my proposal that      these powers be subject to detailed  comprehensive  and unclassified      audits by the Justice Departments Office of the Inspector General       Specifically  the OIG will audit the effectiveness and use       including any improper or illegal use  of the FISA business record      and NSL authorities during the last several years  In performing      these audits  the OIG will examine the categories of records      obtained  the importance of the information acquired  the manner in      which the information is retained and disseminated  and whether the      information is used for data mining purposes  The NSL audit will be      followed by a report on the feasibility of applying minimization      procedures in the context of NSLs to ensure the protection of the      constitutional rights of  United States persons   Yet another sunshine provision that I      proposed  and the conference accepted  draws from a bill that I      introduced in the last Congress with Senators Specter and Grassley       This provision requires the FISA court to publish its procedures and      share rules with the Congress in an unclassified report  The      conference also agreed to require annual reporting on the use of      sneak and peak search warrants and FISAs emergency surveillance      authorities    Finally  the bill includes a      scaled back version of a data mining provision that was added by      floor amendment in the House  As contained in the current bill  the      provision calls for a one time report on pattern based data mining      by the Department of Justice  Pattern based data mining develops      models based upon expected behavior or profile of criminal or      terrorist activity and then mines databases of personal information      seeking to identify such patterns  This practice raises concerns      over both profiling and individual privacy    In addition to sunshine provisions  I      proposed that we retain the sunset mechanism that worked so well in      the original PATRIOT Act  Back in the fall of 2001  Republican      House Majority Leader Dick Armey and I insisted on 4 year sunsets      for certain PATRIOT Act powers with great potential to affect the      civil liberties of Americans  Those sunsets contributed to      congressional oversight  Without them I expect the Bush      Administration would have stonewalled our requests for information      and for review of the way they were implementing the statute  The      sunsets were the reason we have been going through a review and      renewal process over the last few months   During this process  I proposed and      the Senate agreed to 4 year sunsets on three key provisions  The      House initially approved 10 year sunsets on two provisions  With      steadfastness and hard work on the part of Senate conferees we were      able to achieve the 4 year sunsets that were in the Senate bill  I      commend  as well  Representative Conyers and the House for passing      an instruction to the House conferees to abide by the 4 year      sunsets  Despite strong majority support in both bodies for 4 year      sunsets and even after the House had voted to instruct its      conferees  it took weeks to persuade Republican leaders in the House      and the Bush Administration to accept this commonsense measure        These improvements were hard won  The      Bush Administration pursued its usual strategy of demanding sweeping      executive powers and resisting checks and balances  As usual  it      was short on bipartisan dialogue and long on partisan rhetoric  And      as usual  the Republican majorities in the House and Senate did      their utmost to follow the White Houses directives and prevent any      breakout of bipartisanship  But a ray of bipartisanship did break      out  and the bill is the better for it  The current bill contains      4 year sunsets  not 7 or 10 year sunsets  The bill no longer      contains a provision that would have made it a crime merely to      disclose the receipt of a national security letter  It no longer      requires American citizens to tell the FBI before they exercise      their right as Americans to seek the advice of counsel  Chairman      Specter and I worked together on these improvements and our efforts      have produced a better bill for the protection of all Americans  In      this regard  I also compliment all of the Senate Democratic      conferees whose efforts were extraordinary  Whether they vote for      or against the final product  Senators Rockefeller  Levin and  Kennedy all deserve the thanks      of the Senate and the American people for their hard work and      steadfastness   Late changes were achieved by      Republican Senators who had joined us in resisting the conference      report in December  It is regrettable that the Bush Administration      would not engage all of us in a bipartisan conversation on ways in      which to improve the bill  The White House counsel only spoke to      the Republican Senators  In that setting  they negotiated to      achieve what they view as improvements and what they could  It is      less than we would have liked    Among the last changes to the bill is      one that I proposed and feel strongly about  We clarify that      libraries as they traditionally and currently function are not      electronic services providers  and may not be served with an NSL for      business records simply because they provide Internet access to      their patrons  Under this clarification  a library may be served      with an NSL only if it functions as a true Internet Service      Provider  as by providing services to persons located outside the      premises of the library  but this is an unlikely scenario  In most      if not all cases  if the Government wants to review library records      for foreign intelligence purposes  it will need a court order to do      so  The language I proposed to Senator Sununu in this regard was      less ambiguous than that to which the Bush Administration would      agree  Still  my intent  Senator Sununus intent and the intent of      Congress is this regard should be clear  Senators Sununu and Craig      were also able to improve upon earlier language to remove the      requirement that Americans who consult with a lawyer about an NSL      first report that contact to the Government    While there is much that is good in      the bill  however  the bill still has serious flaws and troubling      omissions  I have spent several months working closely with Members      from both parties in an attempt to improve these defects  We have      improved them to some extent  and I want specifically to thank      Senators Sununu and Craig for their vital role in achieving the      prohibition on the use of NSLs with libraries  In my judgment       however  the bill still falls short in several critical regards    Weaker Checks on      Secret Orders for Business Records  I will start with the bills treatment      of Section 215 of the      PATRIOT Act  the business records provision that has been so      important to the libraries  Under Section 215  the Government can      obtain a secret order that compels access to sensitive records of      American citizens  and also imposes a permanent gag on the      recipient   Before passage of the PATRIOT Act       there were two significant limitations on the FBIs power to seize      business records  First  it could be used only for a few discrete      categories of travel records  such as records held by hotels       motels  vehicle rental facilities  Second  the legal standard for      obtaining the order was demanding  The Government had to present      specific and articulable facts giving reason to believe that the      subject of the investigation was a foreign power or an agent of a      foreign power   Passed in the weeks following 9 11       the PATRIOT Act did away with these limitations  It both expanded      what the FBI may obtain with a Section 215      order and it lowered the standard for obtaining it  Under current      law  the Government need only assert that something    anything         is sought for an authorized investigation to protect against      terrorism or espionage  and the judge will order its production       What counts as an authorized investigation is within the discretion      of the Executive branch   The Senate  in the reauthorization      bill that we passed last July  reestablished a significant check on      this power  Under the Senate bill  relevance to an authorized      investigation is not enough  the Government must also show some      connection between the records sought and a suspected terrorist or      spy  This is a fundamental protection that would not hamstring the      Government  but would do much to prevent overreaching in Government      surveillance  I fought for it in the Senate  Chairman Specter and      every Republican Senator voted for it  Unfortunately  it was      stripped out in conference    The current bill is deficient with      respect to Section 215      in two other respects  First  the current bill allows the      Government to use secret evidence to oppose a judicial challenge to      a Section 215 order  At the Governments request  the court must      review any Government submission in secret  regardless of whether it      contains classified material  This has the potential to turn an      adversarial process into a kangaroo court and will  at a minimum       make it very difficult for the recipient of a Section 215 order to      obtain meaningful judicial review that comports with due process        Second  unlike the Senate bill  the      current bill does not permit the recipient of a Section 215      order to get meaningful judicial review of its automatic  permanent      prohibition on disclosure  Businesses that receive Section 215      orders cannot get review of its prohibition on disclosure if the      Government asserts that disclosure may endanger national security      or may interfere with diplomatic relations  This is the type of      provision to which I have never agreed in connection with NSLs or      Section 215 orders  The Bush Administration has used the last round      of discussions with Republican Senators to make it worse in my view      by forbidding any challenge for a year  The Bush Administration has      simply refused to listen to reason on this and insists on this thumb      on the scale of justice     Inadequate      Safeguards For National Security Letters  The current bill also falls short on      its treatment of national security letters  These are  in effect  a      form of secret administrative subpoena  They are issued by FBI      agents without the approval of a judge  grand jury  or prosecutor       They allow the agents to obtain certain types of sensitive      information about innocent Americans simply by certifying its      relevance to a terrorism or espionage investigation  Like Section      215 orders  NSLs come      with a permanent gag  The recipient of an NSL is prohibited from      telling anyone that he has been served   The bill does not allow meaningful      judicial review of an NSLs gag order  It requires the court to      accept as conclusive the Governments assertion that a gag order      should not be lifted  unless the court determines the Government is      acting in bad faith  This raises serious First Amendment and due      process concerns  Fixing this provision was one of my top      priorities in the conference and during my subsequent discussions      with Chairman Specter  The Bush Administrations refusal to agree      to this change was a significant factor in my consistent opposition      to the conference report in December  Despite strong opposition to      this provision from the right and the left  the Bush Administration      refused to correct it  They also refused  as an alternative  to      sunset the NSL authority  I sought remediation of this provision      through discussions with Senators Specter and Sununu  They were      unable to achieve that result  This creates  in my view  a sham      judicial proceeding within the complete control of the Government      that smacks too much of a police state  It is wrong and needs to be      fixed     Sneak and Peek      Searches  The bills treatment of the PATRIOT      Acts so called sneak and peek provision is another area of      concern  Section 213 of the PATRIOT Act authorized the Government      to carry out secret searches in ordinary criminal investigations       Armed with a Section 213 search warrant  FBI agents may enter and      search a home or office and not tell anyone about it until weeks or      months later    It is interesting to recall that four      years ago  the House Judiciary Committee took one look at the Bush      Administrations original proposal for sneak and peak authority and      dropped it entirely from its version of the legislation  As      Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  I was able to make some      significant improvements in the Administrations proposal  but      problems remained  In particular  Section 213 says that notice may      only be delayed for a reasonable period  The Bush Administration      has abused that flexible standard and used it to justify delays in      notice of a year or more  Pre PATRIOT Act case law stated that the      appropriate period of delay was no more than seven days   The Senate voted to replace the      reasonable period standard  which the Bush Administration has been      abusing  with a basic 7 day rule  while permitting the Government to      obtain additional 90 day extensions of the delay from the court       The current bill sets a 30 day rule for the initial delay  more than      three times what the Senate  and pre PATRIOT Act courts  deemed      appropriate  The shorter period would better protect Fourth      Amendment rights without in any way impeding legitimate government      investigations  The availability of additional 90 day extensions      means that a shorter initial time frame should not be a hardship on      the Government  But our improvement has been rejected in favor of      too much Government power     Controversial      Extras  The current bill is also loaded with      extraneous provisions that have nothing to do with the expiring      PATRIOT Act authorities  or even with terrorism  I am particularly      concerned that the bill modifies habeas corpus law  a highly      controversial provision that is wholly improper to consider in this      context  The changes to habeas added here at the insistence of a      small number of Republican conferees have nothing to do with      terrorism or even more general tools of federal enforcement  These      changes were not included in the PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill of      either the House or the Senate  They were added late in the      conference process  after all Democratic conferees were shut out       They received no serious consideration by either bodys Judiciary      Committee  and have been strongly opposed by the U S  Judicial      Conference and others  And yet  these modifications could have very      serious consequences  possibly unintended consequences  in habeas      cases that are already pending in  California and other States   Yet another extraneous provision of      the bill will revive a small group of pending death penalty      prosecutions for aircraft hijacking murders committed in the 1970s      and 80s  Specifically  it is designed to overrule the district      court decision in United     States v  Safarini       which struck the death penalty for a 1986 hijacking offense on the      grounds that the Federal Death Penalty Procedures Act of 1994 could      not be retroactively applied to a pre 1994 crime  absent clear      congressional intent to do so  To my knowledge  Congress has never      enacted death penalty legislation intended to allow the execution of      a tiny number of known offenders for crimes they are alleged to have      committed from one to three decades previously  Whether the      Government can ultimately persuade the courts that this does not      violate the letter of the Ex Post Facto and Bill of Attainder      clauses of the Constitution  it certainly violates their spirit  It      is telling that the Department of Justice  in its testimony before      the House Judiciary Committee  strongly recommended adding in a      severability clause  in case this provision was ultimately held      invalid by a court of law  I share the Departments skepticism      regarding the constitutionality of this wrongheaded provision  and      deeply regret its inclusion in the conference report    Conclusion  From my point of view  this bill      presents a complex mixture of valuable provisions and significant      improvements on the one hand  but also serious flaws and missed      opportunities on the other  The final product would have been      better had the Bush Administration not insisted on locking Democrats      out of the negotiations  They did that first in connection with the      conference and again after the Senate would not proceed to pass the      conference report last December  I tried to have conversations with      the White House to improve the bill  but my efforts were dismissed       So long as the Bush Administration can get the votes it needs on the      Republican side of the aisle  it sees no purpose in any bipartisan      effort   We are left with a dilemma  The bill      is in some ways an improvement on current law with better sunshine      and reporting provisions  But some key provisions remain      significantly flawed  A judgment on the package of both worthwhile      and flawed provisions is a difficult one to make  I suspect that I      am not the only Member wrestling with that judgment  I respect      those who conclude that on balance  the bills virtues outweigh its      vices  But I believe we can and should do better     I will continue to work to improve the      PATRIOT Act  I will work to provide better oversight over the use      of national security letters and to remove the un American      restraints on meaningful judicial review  I will seek to monitor      how sensitive personal information from medical files  gun stores      and libraries are obtained and used  Today  I will join Senators      Specter  Sununu  Craig  and others in introducing a bill to improve      the PATRIOT Act and reauthorization legislation in several important      respects  While we have made some progress  much is left to be      done    In 2001  I fought for time to provide      some balance to Attorney Generals demands that the Bush      Administrations anti terrorism bill be enacted in a week  We      worked hard for six weeks to make that bill better and were able to      include the sunset provisions that contributed to reconsideration of      several provisions over the last several months  Last year I worked      with Chairman Specter and all the Members of the Judiciary Committee      and the Senate to pass a reauthorization bill in July  As we      proceeded in House Senate conference on the measure  the Bush      Administration and congressional Republicans locked Democratic      conferees out of their deliberations and wrote the final bill  That      was wrong  In December  working with a bipartisan group of Senators      we were able to urge reconsideration of that final bill  Senators      Sununu and Craig were able to use that opportunity to make some      improvements  I commend them for what they were able to achieve and      hope that my support for their efforts has been helpful  I wish      that along the way the Bush Administration had shown interest in      working together to get to the best law we could for the American      people    Karl Rove  Vice President Cheney and      others in the Bush Administration have been explicit that they would      rather play partisan politics with these important matters than      legislate in a bipartisan way  That is wrong    By contrast  immediately after 9 11       Senator Daschle  the Majority Leader in the Senate and I  as      Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee  put aside any political      considerations and labored as Americans  not Republicans or      Democrats or politicians  to do all that we could in the best      interests of the American people to bring us together and to      authorize those actions needed to be taken  For our efforts we were      criticized by Vice President Cheney and Attorney General Ashcroft       who reneged on agreements that would have made the original PATRIOT      Act a better law  Senator Daschle and I were also the targets of      letters laced with deadly anthrax that resulted in the death of      innocent postal workers and the shutting down of several Senate      buildings  No arrests or convictions have ever resulted from those      deadly attacks    Even after we worked so hard to pass      the PATRIOT Act  the Bush Administration resumed its partisan      attacks  not against al Qaeda but against patriotic Democrats like      Max Cleland  as they continued each election cycle to use the      terrorist attack that had occurred on their watch for their partisan      political gain  That was wrong  They engaged in partisan attacks      while Democrats gave them a pass for the worst attack on American      soil that killed nearly 3 000 Americans  This was a terrorist      attack that Senator Specter has said could have been prevented had      the Bush Administration properly understood and used its powers      under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  The 9 11      Commission documented how the Bush Administration dropped the ball      by failing in so many ways to connect the dots   I wish that they had taken the advice      President Clinton and others in his administration and made      terrorism their number one priority when they assumed power in      January 2001  We recently heard President Bush make his fifth State      of the Union address  but in his inaugural address and his State of      the Union speech in early 2001 he did not mention terrorism  except      in connection with Star Wars  his missile defense shield proposal      that was the initial focus of the Bush Administration  His first      Attorney General cut the budget for counterterrorism just before      9 11   In September and October 2001       Democrats joined together as Americans  Congress adopted the      Authorization for the Use of Military Force to authorize sending our      armed forces into Afghanistan to get those responsible for the 9 11      attacks  and we worked night and day to pass the USA PATRIOT Act        Now we see the Bush Administration      seeking to twist the Authorization for the Use of Military Force      into a justification for its secret  illegal wiretapping of      Americans emails and telephone calls  We see the Bush      Administration claiming that it need not fulfill its constitutional      responsibility to faithfully execute the laws and that it can pick      and choose among the laws it chooses to recognize  And we see a Bush      Administration that continues to attack anyone that gets in their      way and insists on the rule of law    Confronted with the Bush      Administrations claims of unchecked power  I do not believe that      the restraints we have been able to include in this reauthorization      of the PATRIOT Act are sufficient  I will continue to work to      provide the tools that we need to protect the American people  I      trust that Vermonters will understand that while I have repeatedly      voted to extend and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act  this measure falls      short of what they deserve  I cannot support it in its current      form  I will continue to work to provide the oversight and checks      needed on the uses of Government power and seek to improve the      reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act that will be adopted by the      Senate today
