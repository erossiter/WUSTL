       Judiciary Chairmen Leahy  Conyers Seek Basis For President s Executive   Privilege Claim As They Take Next Steps To Enforce Congressional Subpoenas                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Judiciary Chairmen Leahy      Conyers Seek Basis    For Presidents Executive Privilege Claim    As They Take Next Steps To Enforce Congressional Subpoenas  WASHINGTON  Friday  June 29         Today  Senate and House Judiciary Chairmen Patrick Leahy  D VT  and     John Conyers  Jr   D MI  sent a letter to White House Counsel Fred     Fielding  responding to the President s executive privilege assertion     over documents relating to the US Attorney investigation  Leahy and     Conyers reiterated their concern that the President s sweeping assertion     was unprecedented  They also demanded the White House immediately     provide us with the specific bases for your claims regarding each     document withheld via a privilege log   and a copy of any explicit     determination by the President with respect to the assertion of     privilege    The full     text of the letter is below       and is followed by background information on executive     privilege   June 29  2007 Fred Fielding  Esq     Counsel to the President    The White House    1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  Fielding  The return date and     time for the White House Chief of Staff  Joshua Bolten  to appear before     our Committees on behalf of the White House and bring with him the     documents compelled by the subpoenas we issued on June 13 was yesterday     at 10 a m  Mr  Bolten did not do so  Instead  you wrote us that      despite conceding that you have responsive documents in your possession      you refuse to produce even a single one based on a blanket executive     privilege claim  We had hoped our Committees subpoenas would be met     with compliance and not a Nixonian stonewalling that reveals the White     Houses disdain for our system of checks and balances   We urge the President     to reconsider this step and withdraw his privilege claim so the American     people can learn the truth about these firings  If he is unwilling to     withdraw these claims  we call on you to provide more specific     information to facilitate ruling on those claims and our consideration     of appropriate action to enforce our subpoenas  On June 13  we issued     subpoenas compelling the White House to produce documents related to our     Committees investigations into the mass firings and replacements of     U S  Attorneys and politicization at the Department of Justice  We did     so reluctantly after seeking voluntary cooperation from the White House     for three months  Even though the evidence gathered by our Committees     shows that White House officials were heavily involved in these firings     and in the Justice Departments response to congressional inquiries     about them  the White House has not produced a single document or     allowed even one White House official involved in these matters to be     interviewed   Our Committees rejected your take it or     leave it offer of off the record  backroom interviews and severe limits     on the scope of our requests as unacceptable  more than three months     ago  Since that time  despite our many attempts to narrow the dispute     and begin to obtain the information we need  you have not made any     effort to work with us on a voluntary basis  Even now  in response to     subpoenas authorized by our Committees  you have again merely restated     your initial  unacceptable offer  Your proposal is not commensurate     with our exercise of the broad investigatory power of Congress    Our power to investigate has been     described as essential to the legislative function by the Supreme Court     and as penetrating and far reaching as the potential power to enact and     appropriate under the Constitution   Eastland v  United States Servicemans     Fund  421 U S  491  504  n  15  1975   Indeed  the Court has     specifically recognized that Congress broad investigatory authority     encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as     well as proposed or possibly needed statutes  and includes the power to     inquire into and publicize corruption  maladministration  or     inefficiencies in the Executive Branch   Watkins v  United States      354 U S  178  182  200 n 33  1957   Moreover  as we have said many     times  your proposal would constrain not only our investigation  but     also the ability of the American people to learn the truth about these     firings  In fact  the letter     you enclosed from Acting Attorney General Clement makes clear that     internal White House documents  which you have refused even to discuss     making available  contain information directly responsive to our     subpoenas  According to Mr  Clement  those documents specifically     discuss the possible dismissal and replacement of U S  Attorneys  the     wisdom of such a proposal  specific U S  Attorneys who could be     removed  potential replacement candidates  and possible responses to     congressional and media inquiries about the dismissals  The subject     matter of these documents heightens our concern about the involvement of     White House officials in these firings and in the inaccurate testimony     given to our Committees about them  including possible obstruction of     justice and other violations of federal law  It is precisely for these     reasons that we have sought for many months to obtain information from     the White House  Your action today in     stonewalling the Committees investigations is also inconsistent with     the practices of every Administration since World War II in responding     to congressional oversight  In that time  presidential advisers have     testified before congressional committees 74 times voluntarily or     compelled by subpoenas  During the Clinton Administration  White House     and Administration advisors were routinely subpoenaed for documents or     to appear before Congress  For example  in 1996 alone  the House     Government Reform Committee issued at least 27 subpoenas to White House     advisors  The veil of secrecy you have attempted to pull over the White     House by withholding documents and witnesses is unprecedented and     damaging to the tradition of open government by and for the people that     has been a hallmark of the Republic  Moreover  your blanket     assertion of executive privilege belies any good faith attempt to     determine where privilege truly does and does not apply  A serious     assertion of privilege would include an effort to demonstrate to the     Committees which documents  and which parts of those documents  are     covered by any privilege that may apply   Indeed  the subpoenas     themselves specifically stated that for each document withheld  you     should provide a description of the nature  source  subject matter  and     date of the document  the name and address of each recipient of an     original or copy of the document and the date received  the name and     address of each additional person to whom any of the contents of the     document were disclosed along with the date and manner of disclosure      and the specific legal basis for the assertion of privilege  Such     privilege logs have been provided by the White House in previous     Administrations  and this Justice Department has provided similar logs     in this very matter  which have been used to help resolve disputes about     the production of documents  Yet  you have failed to provide any such     information  In addition  at least     since the Reagan Administration in 1982  there has been a specific     determination and signed statement by the President when executive     privilege has been asserted  In accord with this procedure  President     Bush himself has issued such assertions during his Administration      See  e g   Memorandum for the Attorney General re     Congressional Subpoena for Executive Branch Documents  December 12      2001   See also Procedures Governing Responses to     Congressional Requests for Information  issued on November 4  1982  and     6 Op  OLC 31  1982   Yet you have failed to include any such     Presidential assertion or even state whether you have now decided to     disregard this established procedure   Please provide the     documents compelled by the subpoenas without further delay  If you     continue to decline to do so  you should immediately provide us with the     specific factual and legal bases for your claims regarding each document     withheld via a privilege log as described above and a copy of any     explicit determination by the President with respect to the assertion of     privilege  You have until July 9  2007  at 10 a m  to bring this and     any other information you wish to submit to our attention before we move     to proceedings to rule on your claims and consider whether the White     House is in contempt of Congress   We were disappointed     that we had to turn to these subpoenas in order to obtain information     needed by the Committees to learn the truth about these firings and the     erosion of independence at the Justice Department  We are even more     disappointed now with yet further stonewalling   Whether or not we have     the benefit of the information we have directed you to provide by July     9  we will take the necessary steps to rule on your privilege claims and     appropriately enforce our subpoenas backed by the full force of law       Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY      JOHN CONYERS  JR   Chairman          Chairman    Senate Judiciary Committee     House Judiciary Committee  cc  The Honorable Arlen Specter     The Honorable Lamar S  Smith                 Background      The White     Houses Broad Claims of Executive Privilege Are Not Supported by Law  Background   President Bush has asserted     executive privilege in response to two document subpoenas from the     Senate and House Judiciary Committees  The subpoenas requested     categories of documents highly relevant to the unprecedented and     improper firing of nine United States Attorneys and the politicization     of the Department of Justice   The executive     privilege is not a broad and sweeping authority the President can hide     behind because he does not want to cooperate with congressional     oversight    it should not prevent Congress from examining White House     documents vitally important to its investigation  While     courts have recognized a privilege based in the Constitution  that     privilege is not absolute and must be balanced with other     constitutional interests  including Congresss oversight powers   Courts And Legal Experts Agree Executive     Privilege Is Limited     The     Supreme Court held that the executive privilege is not absolute     in United States v  Nixon      418 U S  683  706  1974   writing that neither the doctrine of     separation of powers  nor the need for confidentiality of high level     communications  without more  can sustain an absolute  unqualified     Presidential privilege    The DC Circuit elaborated that the     privilege is qualified  not absolute  and can be overcome by an adequate     showing of need   In re Sealed Case  121 F 3d     729  745  D C  Cir  1997            The District of Columbia Circuit found     that even in the area of national security  there was no absolute     executive privilege against congressional demands for information      The executive would have it that the Constitution confers on the     executive absolute discretion in the area of national security  This     does not stand up  While the Constitution assigns to the President a     number of powers relating to national security   it confers upon     Congress other powers equally inseparable from the national security       United States v  ATT      567 F 2d121  128  D C  Cir  1977        The documents requested by the House and Senate Committees do not     implicate any national security concerns      The     Congressional Research Service emphasizes the limited nature of the     executive privilege  Executive privilege is not an     absolute  It is a qualified privilege and is balanced against the     constitutional needs and obligations of other branches  Congressional     Research Service  October 21  2005   The Documents Requested By Committees Do     Not Fit Into Narrow Executive Privilege     The     privilege covers communications related to presidential decision making      which is not at issue here  The DC Circuit has found that     the presidential communications privilege applies to communications     intimately connected to his presidential decision making   In re Sealed Case  121 F 3d     at 753  However  numerous witnesses before both House and Senate     Committees have testified that the President did not decide which U S      Attorneys should be fired     The     privilege  even if it does apply  is overcome by real public need    as     exists here  Executive privilege is overcome where the     subpoenaed materials likely contain important evidence and where that     evidence is not available elsewhere   In re Sealed Case  121 F 3d     at 755  Again and again  the evidence the Committee has obtained in     this investigation shows significant involvement by Sara Taylor  Harriet     Miers  and others in the White House  but the White House has shut down     all avenues of obtaining information about that extremely important     involvement    The broader deliberative process      privilege does not apply  That      privilege does not apply when there is reason to believe government      misconduct occurred  as has been clearly established in this matter       and does not apply to full documents  only to specific and relevant      passages  Several of the high ranking officials at the Department      of Justice have resigned since this investigation began   In re Sealed Case       121 F 3d at 745     The White Houses Claims Of Privilege     Are Sweeping And Overly Broad     The     non partisan Congressional Research Service has been critical of this     White Houses sweeping characterizations of executive privilege      The current Bush Administration  has articulated a legal view of the     breadth and reach of presidential constitutional prerogatives that  if     applied to information and documents often sought by congressional     committees  would stymie such inquiries  CRS further notes that the     Department of Justices assertions of these broad notions of     presidential prerogatives are unaccompanied by any authoritative     judicial citations  CRS Congressional Oversight Manual  January 3      2007  at 45     The     White House has not sought in good faith to determine where privilege     truly does and does not apply  The White House Counsel     asserted privilege and declared that therefore the White House will not     be making any production in response to these subpoenas for documents      June 28  2007 Letter from Fred Fielding to Chairmen Leahy and Conyers      A serious assertion of privilege would include a serious effort to     determine which documents  and which parts of those documents  are     covered by any privilege that may apply  White House officials have     provided no such comprehensive review    The White House Has Not Sought     Accommodation     Most     disputes between Congress and the Executive about access to documents     and information are resolved through compromise  CRS     Congressional Oversight Manual at 39     The     White House in this case has made one unacceptable take it or leave it     offer of extremely limited access to witnesses  off the record     interviews  without transcripts  and a small number of documents  The     White House has refused to negotiate further  The Senate and     House Judiciary Committees have sought the kind of compromise solutions     which generally accompany this type of investigation  but have been     consistently rebuffed by the White House  Even the Department of     Justice has made attempts to respond to congressional inquiries
