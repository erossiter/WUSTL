       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee  On   Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations      May 1  2006   This evening the       Senate will consider another lifetime appointment to the federal       judiciary  Michael Barrett of  Ohio  Mr  Barrett       has the support of his home state Senators and bipartisan       support from within his State  When the Senate proceeds to       confirm him  we will bring the number of judicial nominations       confirmed since January 2001 to 238  including the confirmations       of two Supreme Court Justices and 43 circuit court judges         When the White House works with       Senators to identify qualified  consensus nominees  Democrats in       the Senate have demonstrated our willingness to act promptly        In fact  100       judges were confirmed during the 17 months I chaired the       Judiciary Committee  This compares quite favorably to the 138       judges confirmed during the other 45       months of the Bush Administration when the Senate has been       controlled by a Republican majority     Unfortunately  as       demonstrated by the       recent withdrawals of several nominees  all too often this White       House seems more       interested in rewarding cronies and picking political fights  than in selecting       lifetime appointments after thorough vetting  Sadly  the       Republican Senate has proceeded to rubber stamp these important       nominations and failed in its role as a constitutional check on       the President    The controversial nominations of       Judge Terrence Boyle and Brett Kavanaugh are contemporary cases       in point  With the extreme right wing and special interest       groups agitating for a fight over judicial nominations  the       Republican leader of the Senate is answering their demands by       seeking to force Senate debate on these controversial nominees        Rather than focus on proposals to end the subsidies to big oil       and rein in gas prices  rather than devote our time to       immigration reform legislation  rather than completing a budget        the Republican leader came to the floor last week to signal a       fight over controversial judicial nominations is in the offing        Such a controversial maneuver serves only to divide and distract       us from Americas       real problems  During this Presidents administration  gas       prices have more than doubled and undocumented immigrants have       doubled  but judicial vacancies have been cut in half from the       time when Republicans in the Senate were stalling President       Clintons judicial nominations  Despite the real problems that       confront Americans with respect to security  health insurance        rising health costs  rising energy costs  and spiraling deficits       and debt  some would rather pick an election year fight over       judicial nominations    One of the nominations on which       the Republican leader wants to focus attention is that of Judge       Terrence Boyle to the United States Court of Appeals for the       Fourth Circuit  According to recent reports  as a sitting       United States District Judge and while a circuit court nominee        Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in       which he held investments  In at least one instance  he is       alleged to have bought General Electric stock while presiding       over a lawsuit in which General Electric was accused of       illegally denying disability benefits to a long time GE       employee  Two months later  he ruled in favor of GE and denied       the employees claim for long term and pension disability       benefits  Whether or not it turns out that Judge Boyle broke       federal law or canons of judicial ethics  these types of       conflicts of interest have no place on the federal bench         This is not the first judicial       nominee to engage in these kinds of apparent ethical lapses        Less than two months ago   the President withdrew the nomination       of Judge James Payne to the Court of Appeals for the 10th       Circuit after information became public about that nominees       rulings in a number of cases in which he appears to have had       conflicts of interest  Those conflicts were pointed out not by       the Administrations screening process or by the   ABA  but by journalists      During the last few       months  President Bush also withdrew the nominations of Judge       Henry Saad to the Court of Appeals for the 6th       Circuit and Judge Daniel P  Ryan to the Eastern District of       Michigan  And we saw the arrest of another Bush Administration       official and former judicial nominee to the Court of Appeals for       the 4th Circuit  Claude Allen  who had earlier       withdrawn as a nominee and more recently resigned his position       as a top domestic policy adviser to the President  When we are       considering lifetime appointments of judicial officers who are       entrusted with protecting the rights of Americans  it is       important to be thorough  Unfortunately  all too often this       White House seems more interested in rewarding cronies    They add to the long       list of nominations by this President that have been withdrawn        Among the more well known are Bernard Kerik to head the       Department of Homeland Security and Harriet Miers to the Supreme       Court  It was  as I recall  reporting in a national magazine       that doomed the Kerik nomination  It was opposition within the       Presidents own party that doomed the Miers nomination     Over the weekend we       heard that this Administrations former FDA director is under       investigation and its political director testified  again before       a federal grand jury  Of course  Mr  Libby remains under       indictment  and Messrs  Safavian  Scanlon  Abramoff and a number       of House Republicans are caught up in another criminal probe          In light of this       long list of failures of the White House to fulfill its       commitments to the American people to be above reproach and its       lackluster vetting process  it is more important than ever that       the Senate and the Senate Judiciary Committee afford nominees       the kind of careful scrutiny that will yield enough information       to decide on a nominees fitness for an important appointment        In Judge Boyles case  not only were his answers to the       Committees questions evasive  but he failed to produce even the       unpublished opinions he issued from the bench     I am also concerned that the       Senate Judiciary Committee is being required to consider the       nomination of Brett Kavanaugh to the United States Court of       Appeals for the D C  Circuit without a complete record  The       Democratic Members of the Committee have twice asked for another       hearing in connection with his nomination  Mr  Kavanaugh failed       to provide meaningful and substantive responses to many of the       questions posed to him at his first hearing and he delayed for       seven months before providing evasive and incomplete answers to       written questions    In addition  a new hearing is       warranted because several troubling issues have come to light       since his initial nomination  As Associate White House Counsel       and staff secretary  Mr  Kavanaugh has served in the inner       circle of the White House at a time when many controversial       policies and decisions were being considered  Senators have not       had a chance to question him about his role in connection with       those matters  For example  what was Mr  Kavanaughs role in       connection with the warrantless spying on Americans  What was       his involvement in the policies affecting detainee treatment and       interrogation  What was his involvement in connection with       military tribunals  torture  and rendition of prisoners to other       countries  Given the scandals now plaguing the White House  it       is important to know whether Mr  Kavanaugh has had a role in       connection with the actions of Jack Abramoff  Michael Scanlon       David Safavian  the       matters being investigated in connection with the Plame matter        and many other matters    The wall of secrecy that the       Administration has maintained is no environment in which       carefully to consider an Administration insider for a lifetime       appointment to an important federal judicial position     I hope the Republican leadership       will reconsider its plans to force confrontation  I urge them        instead  to work with us to identify and confirm qualified       nominees to these important positions
