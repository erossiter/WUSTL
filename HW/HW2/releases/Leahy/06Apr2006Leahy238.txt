       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Humanitarian Crisis In Darfur   Sudan                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy    The Humanitarian Crisis In Darfur  Sudan    April 6  2006    Mr      LEAHY  Mr  President  almost two years have passed since the     Congress declared the atrocities in Darfur  Sudan to be genocide      and more than a year and a half since the Administration publicly     reached the same conclusion   Yet     since those declarations  the United States and other nations have     failed to devise an effective strategy to bring peace to the     desperate people of that remote  war ravaged region  The human cost     of this failure has been staggering       Earlier this month  President Bush celebrated International Womens     Day  but there is no cause for celebration for the women of Darfur      thousands of whom have been the victims of rape and other acts of     sexual violence inflicted by government security forces and the     militias they support       Through systematic massacres  rape  torture and the burning of     hundreds of villages  Darfur has been pillaged and the lives of its     people destroyed   The     Government of Sudan has repeatedly attempted to disguise its role in     the violence and it has been impossible to ascertain an accurate     death toll  but some where between 200 000 and 300 000 people have     died of murder or starvation       Many thousands more have ended up in squalid refuge camps after     their homes were reduced to ashes by the government sponsored     janjaweed militias  At     the same time that this has been happening  Sudans President Omar     Hassan al Bashir has reportedly squandered  4 5 million to purchase     a 118 foot  172 ton presidential yacht so he can entertain foreign     dignitaries and create a perverse fa  ade of Sudanese progress and     sophistication       Just to transport it by land from Port Sudan to Khartoum required     severing 132 electric lines  plunging neighborhood after     neighborhood into temporary darkness   It     is difficult to conceive of the level of greed  arrogance and     twisted logic that would cause the leader of an impoverished country     to blithely waste millions of dollars on a ridiculously ostentatious     yacht to cruise the Nile River  while thousands of Sudanese children     have fallen victim to the janjaweeds brutality       Tens of thousands more are at serious risk of death by starvation      malnutrition  disease and mayhem  U N  Undersecretary General for     Humanitarian Affairs Jan Egeland recently stated that Darfur is     returning to   the abyss   of early 2004 when the region was   the     killing fields of this world    The     scale of atrocities occurring in Darfur is appalling  and for too     long the international community has been doing too little  hoping     that somehow the situation would improve       Instead  in recent weeks we have seen the violence spread across the     border into Chad  The Government of Sudan is actively exporting the     Darfur crisis to its neighbor by providing arms to the janjaweed and     allowing them to attack Chadian refugees and villagers  seizing     their livestock  and killing anyone who resists  As a result      200 000 Chadians have been forced from their homes  displaced in     their own country       Earlier this month  the Senate unanimously passed S Res 383  which     calls on the President to take immediate steps to help improve     security in Darfur  The resolution proposes a no fly zone over     Darfur and the deployment of NATO troops to support the African     Union forces currently on the ground   The     African Union has done its best  but with only 7 000 troops      inadequate resources and a weak mandate to patrol a vast area  it     has been unable to prevent the militias from continuing to attack     civilians with impunity   I     strongly support a role for NATO to bolster the African Unions     mission until a UN peacekeeping mission can be fully deployed  which     could take a year or more       Only a few nations have the trained troops to contribute  and their     numbers are stretched thin among many UN missions  NATO troops on     the ground could reinforce the African Union force with their     superior command and control and intelligence gathering     capabilities       Until recently the Bush Administration refused to support additional     troops  However  in the last several weeks  President Bush has     showed a renewed interest in Darfur  On March 9  at a hearing     before the Senate Appropriations Committee  Secretary of State     Condoleezza Rice testified that the Administration is committed to     the deployment of a larger peacekeeping force       Despite this encouraging rhetoric  however  the Administration     continues to under fund the African Union mission  The  161 million     requested in the Fiscal Year 2006 Supplemental request for     peacekeeping in Darfur will only cover the U S  share of sustaining     the current number of troops   It     will do nothing to pay for the additional troops that President Bush     has finally acknowledged are needed  With people dying needlessly     every week  the President needs to address the Darfur crisis more     urgently       Earlier this week  I was pleased to co sponsor an amendment  which     was accepted  to the FY 2006 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations     bill to add  50 million in peacekeeping funds for Darfur    The     funds in the supplemental bill for peacekeeping in Darfur were     barely adequate to support the current African Union mission through     the rest of this fiscal year  The additional  50 million will go to     training and equipping the African Union force that has done its     best despite scarce training and too little heavy equipment        There is no question that the Government of Sudan bears a great deal     of the responsibility for the crimes against humanity that have     occurred  and continue to occur  within its borders and now in     eastern Chad  It has sponsored brutal militias  hampered the     African Union peacekeepers  and impeded the work of international     relief organizations       And  most recently  it has opposed reconstituting the African Union     force as a UN force  presumably fearing that the UN could pose a     challenge to its own ability to act with impunity in a part of the     world that is often beyond the spotlight of public scrutiny      But     we in this country  the richest and most powerful nation on Earth      have done too little to stop the genocide in Sudan  Many more lives     could have been saved if we and other nations had shown stronger     leadership   Let     us hope that the Bush Administration will match its rhetoric with     resources to support the number of troops that are needed to do the     job
