       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The FTC s ChoicePoint Settlement                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Reaction Of      Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt       To The FTC s ChoicePoint Settlement     Thursday  January 26  2006  This is a significant step forward      for accountability  and it also sends an unmistakable signal to      others in the burgeoning field of data brokering  As the largest      civil penalty in FTC history  this settlement also shows that the      Commission shares the publics concern about security for their      personal information  which today is stored in more and more      databanks and trafficked as a valuable commodity    The ChoicePoint breach highlights a      dangerous vulnerability in the information economy  the inadequate      screening of the customers who are buying personal information  I      am particularly troubled by the FTCs findings that ChoicePoint      turned over personally identifiable information about consumers to      subscribers whose applications clearly raised red flags  and that      ChoicePoint failed to tighten its application approval procedures      even after receiving subpoenas from law enforcement authorities      alerting it to fraudulent activity  The series of data breaches      over the last year has also begun to focus Congresss attention on      this problem  and Chairman Specter and I will continue to push for      action on the data security bill we have introduced to raise the bar      for the safeguards that are needed to protect this sensitive data
