       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman     Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Judicial Nominations    July 19  2007  Today the Committee holds another hearing with another circuit court     nominee  another district court nominee from Mississippi and one from     Washington State   Before the 4th of July recess  the Senate had this year already     confirmed THREE circuit court nominees  That is three more that were     confirmed by that time in 1999 with a Republican led Senate and three     more than the Republican led Senate confirmed in the entire 1996     session   The Senate has confirmed 20 Circuit Court nominations and 125 total     federal judicial nominees while I have presided as Judiciary Chairman      in less than two full years  It is a little known fact that during the     Bush Presidency  more circuit judges  more district judges and more     total judges have been confirmed  in less time  while I served as     Judiciary Chairman than during the longer tenures of either of the two     Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities   This week the President sent us four new circuit court nominations      Like last year  the President has been slow to send us new nominations      sending these just before the August recess  Before this week  of the 15     circuit court vacancies  the President had sent us nominations for only     five of them  I also wish that the President sought the advice and not     merely the after the fact consent of home state senators in making these     nominations  It appears the Senators from New Jersey were not consulted     about the new nomination to the Third Circuit for their state  This is a     break from the practice that has worked in the past of cooperation and     consultation that has led to success and a sign that the White House is     returning to its tired playbook of picking unnecessary fights over     nominations rather than filling vacancies   Congressional Republicans also seem to be following that playbook      They seem to love to shut down the Government and seem intent on     manufacturing excuses to do so  In 1995 it was Newt Gingrich  who did     not like his treatment on Air Force One  When they were in the Senate     majority a few years ago    and while surreptitiously stealing our     computer files   it was Senate Republicans who insisted on a 40 hour     debate on this Presidents court packing schemes  Now  despite our     progress and our efforts to work to fill judicial vacancies  some in the     Senate Republican leadership seem to be at it  again   It is Republicans who held up this Presidents nomination of Judge     Neff since last year and stalled Senate action on a dozen judicial     nominations  Indeed  it was Republicans who were the ones who voted     against confirming President Bushs judicial nominees last week  Already     this year we have proceeded to confirm more judges than were confirmed     in all of 2005 when Republicans ran the Senate  We have also already     surpassed the confirmation total for the entire 1996 session when a     Republican led Senate confirmed 17 district court nominees and not a     single circuit nominee  The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts     lists 48 judicial vacancies  The President has sent us only 26     nominations for these 48 remaining vacancies  Twenty two of these     remaining vacancies  almost half  have no nominee  Of the 14 vacancies     deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial emergencies  the     President has yet to send us nominees for seven of them  exactly half      Of the 15 circuit court vacancies  almost half are without a nominee  If     the President had worked with the Senators from Michigan  Rhode Island      Maryland  California and New Jersey  we could be in position to make     even more progress  And of the 22 vacancies without any nominee  the     President has violated the timeline he set for himself at least 12     times12 have been vacant without so much as a nominee for more than 180     days  The number of violations may in fact be much higher since the     President said he would nominate within 180 days of receiving notice     that there would be a vacancy or intended retirement rather than from     the vacancy itself  We conservatively estimate that he also violated his     own rule 12 times in connection with the nominations he has made  That     would mean that with respect to the 48 vacancies  the President is out     of compliance with his own rule at least 24 times   As it is  we have helped cut the circuit vacancies from a high mark     of 32 in the early days of this Administration  to as few as 13      Contrast that with the Republican led Senates lack of action on     President Clintons moderate and qualified nominees that resulted in     increasing circuit vacancies during the Clinton years from 17 to 26      During those years  the Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous and     successful efforts under the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in     anticipation of a Republican President  More than 60 percent of current     circuit court judges were appointed by Republican Presidents  with the     current President having appointed more than 30 percent of the active     circuit judges already   Senate Republicans know the difficulties with four of the Presidents     current circuit nominees  If they were candid they would concede that     they are having difficulties themselves trying to work with this White     House on filling judicial vacancies with acceptable nominees   I continue to try to work with this White House and to make progress      Next year the Thurmond rule will kick in until after a new president is     inaugurated  That is why I have urged the White House to work with     Senators of both parties and to fill the 5th Circuit vacancy from     Mississippi with the nomination of the Honorable Henry Wingate  Judge     Wingate would be the first African American from Mississippi to serve on     the 5th Circuit  He is the Chief Judge of the District Court for the     Southern District of Mississippi  He was appointed to the federal bench     in Mississippi by President Ronald Reagan  He has served with honor and     distinction for more than 20 years  since we helped confirm him in 1985      He has served as the Chief Judge of the District Court since 2003  He     was a naval officer and is a member of the Naval Reserve  He was an     assistant attorney general  an assistant district attorney  an assistant     U S  attorney  a professor and a trial lawyer   I cannot imagine why an experienced judge appointed by Ronald Reagan     would be unacceptable to this White House  But if for some reason he is      I will work with the White House  the Senators from Mississippi  the     Senates Majority and Republican leader and our Ranking Member  the     senior Senator from Pennsylvania to identify another worthy candidate      For all our efforts  for my efforts to treat Judge Southwick fairly  all     we hear from the other side is complaining  And we read that some are     itching to pick a fight over the nomination  Last week the press was     full of stories of meetings with right wing groups and the partisan     benefits to be gained by Republicans picking such a fight  This is not a     partisan fight that needs to be waged  We can work together to fill this     5th Circuit vacancy  I hope the President and Senate Republicans will     work with us   There are five more judicial nominations on the agenda for Judiciary     Committee consideration this week  They will increase to 30 the number     of judicial nominees the Committee has reported this year and when     confirmed will bring the confirmations while I served as chairman to     130   I look forward to hearing from the nominees being considered today      as well  I thank Senator Cardin for agreeing to chair todays hearing
