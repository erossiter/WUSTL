       Leahy  Hatch Introduce Sweeping Patent Reform Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Leahy  Hatch Introduce Sweeping Patent Reform Bill  Bipartisan Legislation Overhauls U S  Patent      Code      Administrative Review Process WASHINGTON       Friday  August 4   The U S  Senates two leaders on intellectual      property issues have joined together to introduce comprehensive      patent reform legislation that would address the urgent need for      revision and renewal in the complicated  cumbersome but vital U S       patent process  Senator Patrick      Leahy  D Vt    the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee      and the leading Democratic member of its Intellectual Property      Subcommittee  teamed up with Senator Orrin Hatch  R Utah   the      chairman of the IP Subcommittee  on a bill that would overhaul the      U S  patent system by implementing new  streamlined international      standards  updating the existing patent code  and bringing clarity      to the complicated administrative review process   This legislation      is not an option  but a necessity  said Leahy  If youre staying      put in the fast moving fields of technology and intellectual      property  then youre falling behind  To preserve and build on our      position as the global leader in intellectual property and      technology  we need to be looking ahead and moving forward  and this      bill is our first step  Leahy and Hatch have organized several      hearings examining the patent system over the last two years  before      the Judiciary panel and its Intellectual Property Subcommittee   It is not the      bill I would have written if I were the sole author  but it reflects      a remarkable achievement  and a substantial step toward real      reform  Leahy said   Senator      Leahys statement on the bill is below  A summary of the bills      key provisions follows                   Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Introduction Of Patent Reform Bill     August 3  2006 The Senate is about to adjourn for its August      recess    four weeks when we get to reconnect with our constituents       catch up on the concerns of our home states  and study our      legislative plans with a depth and attention that we cannot devote      during the hectic days we are in session  Some of us may even spend      a little time with our families and friends  As I have done in      years past  I will be in Vermont  The choice between spending      August in Washington  D C  or Middlesex  Vermont has always been an      easy one for me   When the Senate is in session  our obligations      are many and varied  as important as they are diverse  We hold      hearings  and then we pursue follow up questions  We try to engage      in oversight  though that has not been a particularly fruitful      exercise with this current Administration  We investigate issues       and then we endeavor to craft solutions  We vote  and we caucus       and we deliberate   It is not always a process that yields results       but today I can report it has  I am pleased to join with the      Chairman of the Intellectual Property Subcommittee today in      introducing a bipartisan bill on patent reform  The bill is the      result of almost two years of hard work on hard issues  We held      several hearings  had innumerable meetings with a universe of      interested participants in the patent system  and received input      from a number of voices in debate about patent reform  We delved      deeply into the myriad problems plaguing our patent system       especially those that hinder the issuance of high quality patents       In introducing this bill together  we take a      productive step toward updating the most outdated aspects of the      patent code and attempt to bolster the Patent and Trademark Office      in its administrative review of patents throughout the process  We      are striving to place incentives on the parties with the most      information to assist the PTO by sharing that information  We place      our patent system in line with much of the rest of the world  by      moving from a first to invent system to a first to file   Congress needs to address the urgent needs for      revision and renewal in our patent system  and we must harness the      impressive intellectual power and varied experiences of all the      players in the patent community as we finalize our new laws  I      believe that  while introducing this bill today is not the end of      the process  and indeed  in many respects  it is truly the      beginning  it is a significant accomplishment that we have come      together to set down a comprehensive approach to overhauling our      patent system  If the United States is to preserve its position at      the forefront of innovation  as the global leader in intellectual      property and technology  then we need to move forward  and this bill      is our first step  We must improve and enhance the quality of our      patent system and the patents it produces   This legislation is not an option  but a      necessity  Senator Hatch and I have made genuine progress on this      complex issue  We agreed on many salutary changes  but it can be no      surprise that we differed on some aspects of the effort  as well       Recognizing the critical importance of compromise  of offering a      bill to the interested public to study and improve  and of taking a      clear first step down the path to genuine reform  we both made      concessions  This is not the bill I would have introduced if I      were the sole author  and I expect Senator Hatch would say the      same  I appreciate the concessions that Senator Hatch made  I      have tried to be both reasonable and accommodating in honoring my      commitment to him  a commitment that he requested specifically  to      introduce a bill before the August recess   In particular  I am concerned about how some of      the changes proposed would affect the generic pharmaceutical      industry  especially the provision that would limit the inequitable      conduct defense to only those cases in which a patentees willful      deception of the PTO results in an invalid patent claim  While I      think we should expect the highest caliber of behavior by those who      are seeking patents  which are  after all  often highly profitable      government monopolies  surely we can at least insist on an absence      of affirmative deceit  I hope and expect that we can continue the      discussion on this issue as the year progresses   I also want to ensure the delicate balance we      have struck in the post grant review process  and make certain that      the procedure is both efficient and effective at thwarting some      strategic behavior in patent litigation  and at promoting a      healthier body of existing patents  Fee shifting  even in a limited      set of cases  likewise raises concerns that should have a more      public airing   I respect the necessity for considering and      balancing a number of different concerns as we draft comprehensive      and complicated legislation  I will never sacrifice the quality of      the laws we produce to expediency  but I recognize the utility of      such compromises when  as with this bill  introduction is a first      step in a larger and longer discussion   I am extremely pleased that Senator Hatch and I      have come together to tackle these important and urgent issues       Many hours of hard work were spent by both of our offices to develop      legislative language so that we can  today  jointly introduce a bill      to move the debate forward  The bill is a remarkable achievement       and a substantial step towards real reform  I look forward to      continuing to work with Senator Hatch  other members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee  and the affected parties on these matters                  Summary of Hatch Leahy Patent Reform Bill         The bill streamlines the United States patent process with       international standards by shifting from a first to invent       system to a first to file one  This creates a simple        unambiguous and user friendly system for patent seekers  holders       and others by removing the contentiousness about who invented       something first         The bill sets out a clear and objective set of standards for       damages by declaring a statutory approach to apportionment of       damages  Under the bipartisan measure  a judge would consider       three factors in determining damages   1  the relevant value of       the infringed thing   2  any history of non exclusive       marketplace licensing  and  3  any other relevant legal       factors         The bill creates a balanced post grant review procedurethat       allows a second opportunity for objective reviews of those       claims that demonstrate real economic harm  To take advantage       of this second window  the complainant must make its showing by       the usual preponderance of the evidence standard  and will be       barred from raising the claims again in another proceeding         The bill permits a greater role for third parties in the patent       application process by allowing outsiders who have knowledge       relating to a pending application to submit relevant information       to the Patent and Trademark Office  PTO   This way  the PTO       examiners are able to collect more comprehensive input from       varied players in the field  who have every incentive to       ensure that only the new and innovative inventions are patented               The bill limits willfulness determinations to truly egregious       and intentional behavior  Previously  if someone looked at a       patent  any infringement of that patent was necessarily       willful and hence subjected the person looking at it to three       times the damages they would have incurred had they simply never       investigated in the first place  Thus  it created an incentive       for inventors not to review patents at all  which is directly       contradictory to the patent systems core goal of promoting the       broad dissemination and understanding of new inventions         Following the language of the Equal Access to Justice Act  the       bill requires a court to award attorneys fees and costs to a       prevailing party unless the court determines that the       complaining party was substantially justified or that special       circumstances make an award unjust         The bill limits the inequitable conduct defense to       infringement to circumstances in which at least one claim of the       patent is invalid  A patent applicant commits inequitable       conduct by making affirmative misrepresentation  or failing to       disclose material facts to the PTO  with the intent to deceive       the PTO  Sometimes such inequitable conduct results in a       flawed patent  sometimes the patent is fine  in either case  the       patent system suffers  and the patent is awarded  at least in       part  through fraud  The strong and appropriate disincentive       to inequitable conduct is the possible penalty in later       litigation over the patent   having the patent declared       unenforceable as a result of that conduct  Thus  in the       situation in which a branded drug company sues a generic for       infringement  and the generic can show both that the branded       company deceived the PTO to get the patent in question  and that       the patent itself is flawed  the patent may be held       unenforceable by the court  and the generic may manufacture that       drug
