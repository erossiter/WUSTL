       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The President s State Of The Union  Message                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT                 Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    To The Presidents State Of The Union Message    Tuesday  January 23  2007  I welcome the Presidents change in     tone  I stand ready to work with the White House and with senators     across the aisle on comprehensive immigration reform and on other     pressing issues the President has discussed    But though President Bushs tone now     sounds more accepting of other views  his basic policies so far have     not changed  Americans have clearly called for a new direction and     for bipartisanship  The President says he heard the people  but now     is the time for evidence that he has also listened to what they are     saying   It is regrettable that the President     has rejected opportunities for a change of course in Iraq  He has     dismissed bipartisan suggestions advanced by the Iraq Study Group      by our commanders who have been on the ground in Iraq  and by the     peoples elected representatives in Congress  Escalating the     conflict will put more of our troops in danger and will worsen the     wars toll on efforts to address urgent needs in our country  In my     view  the Congress should use its constitutional authority to try to     change course in Iraq by opposing an escalation of troops and     changing our budget priorities so we can bring our troops home   The mess in Iraq also continues to     diminish our ability to protect our borders  ensure quality     education for our children  and address problems here at home  With     violent crime once again on the rise in our towns and cities  we are     spending more in Iraq in one week than we spend in an entire year to     help our communities fight crime through the COPS program  which the     President has decimated in his budget plans   Also lacking is real leadership from     the President on global warming  one of the greatest threats that we     face today and that our children and grandchildren will face     tomorrow  We need a bold plan to drastically reduce greenhouse gas     emissions  and the American people are way ahead of the President in     recognizing that  There is no more time to lose on this   The President has finally entered the     debate on the health insurance crisis that millions of American     families are feeling and facing in their everyday lives  But his     patchwork solution  to tax insurance plans that offer more coverage      is not the answer  It would launch a race to the bottom in     insurance coverage  Working families and uninsured Americans need     real health coverage answers  not another complication on their tax     forms
