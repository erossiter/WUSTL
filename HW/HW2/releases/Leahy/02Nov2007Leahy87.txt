       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Sri Lanka                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  On Sri Lanka  November 2  2007        MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  it has been a little over a year since I      last spoke in this chamber about the fragile peace process in Sri      Lanka  I want to take a moment to discuss the situation today       because in the past year we have seen human rights in that small      island nation steadily deteriorate  I also want to correct some      confusion that may have occurred as a result of statements reported      in the press regarding the Senates action in connection with the      Fiscal Year 2008 State  Foreign Operations Appropriations bill       That bill passed the Senate by a vote of 81 to 12 on September 6       2007  and we are waiting to begin conference discussions with the      House of Representatives              Over the years  I have been a strong supporter of U S  Sri Lankan      relations  A good friend  Ambassador James Spain  served there  and      the American people acted quickly to provide emergency assistance      for Sri Lanka after the December 2004 tsunami devastated Sri Lankas      east  north and southern coasts  claiming tens of thousands of      lives  Beyond that  we have long supported the Sri Lankan      governments efforts to respond to acts of terrorism by the LTTE       which has been designated by the Department of State and the      European Union as a foreign terrorist organization because of its      attacks against civilians  assassinations of political leaders       forced recruitment of children  and other crimes              We deplore these tactics  However  we are also aware that the LTTE      has  at times  shown a willingness to participate in serious      negotiations  as well as to respond to human rights concerns  These      overtures should be pursued  We also recognize that the LTTE should      not be equated with the Tamil community  There are many ethnic      Tamils living in and outside of Sri Lanka who do not condone acts of      violence and terrorism against civilians  Many have been victims of      the LTTE themselves              At the same time  our aid to the Sri Lankan government is not a      blank check  We have been increasingly concerned with reports of      abuses by Sri Lankan government forces  not from the LTTE or their      supporters as some have inaccurately claimed  but from the United      Nations  the Department of State  and international human rights      organizations  These reports are not disinformation or      misinformation as some Sri Lankan officials have alleged  Rather       they contain specific  documented  consistent information indicating      a steady increase in serious human rights violations by both Sri      Lankan government forces and the LTTE since the collapse of the      ceasefire  While the first acts of aggression were attributed to      the LTTE  these reports also implicate government forces in attacks      on civilians  extrajudicial executions  torture  and forced      disappearances  There is also evidence that Sri Lankan government      forces have stood by while allied paramilitary organizations have      carried out abuses  including forcibly recruiting child soldiers       With few exceptions  the Sri Lankan government has yet to bring the      perpetrators  including members of government security forces  to      justice             It is important to note that the Sri Lankan governments respect for      human rights and rule of law has deteriorated even outside      conflict affected areas  The Millennium Challenge Corporation      suspended more than  11 million intended for Sri Lanka because of      the deteriorating security situation and the governments worsening      performance on human rights  Freedom House  whose assessments of      political rights and civil liberties are factored into the      Millennium Challenge Corporations analysis  stated The serious      human rights abuses and excessive restrictions on freedom of speech      and association by the government of Sri Lanka merit the countrys      removal from a list of eligible recipients for U S  Millennium      Challenge Account assistance  We want to see a Millennium      Challenge compact for Sri Lanka  but these problems must first be      recognized and effectively addressed             An international human rights field presence  under the auspices of      the United Nations  could do much to improve the situation  Given      the gravity and scale of the violations witnessed in Sri Lanka  and      particularly the inability of the Sri Lankan government to monitor      the abuses taking place in areas held by the LTTE  such a presence      would help protect lives  document abuses by all sides  and support      the government and civil society in protecting the civilian      population  The Department of State has publicly endorsed such a      role for the United Nations             It is due to this information  from reputable sources  that the      Senate attached three conditions to our assistance to the Sri Lankan      military in the Fiscal Year 2008 State  Foreign Operations      Appropriations bill  Anyone who reviews those conditions should      agree that they are reasonable and appropriate  They would require      the Sri Lankan government to be bringing to justice members of the      military who have been credibly alleged to have committed gross      violations of human rights  end unreasonable restrictions on access      in the country by humanitarian organizations and journalists  and      agree to the establishment of a field presence of the Office of the      UN High Commissioner for Human Rights in Sri Lanka              It is regrettable that rather than explain why the Sri Lankan      government should not meet such reasonable standards when it is      seeking millions of dollars in U S  taxpayer assistance  some Sri      Lankan officials have attacked our motives and falsely attributed      our actions to LTTE propaganda  Others have insisted that they are      meeting these standards already  when the facts clearly indicate      that far more needs to be done             We want Sri Lanka to succeed in stopping terrorism  and we recognize      that military force can be necessary against terrorist tactics  But      there is no military solution to the Sri Lankan conflict  which has      dragged on for more than two decades  Thousands of innocent people       Sinhalese  Tamils and Muslims  have been killed  More than 1 000      are reported to have disappeared in just the past twelve to      eighteen months  and many more before that  Hundreds of thousands      of civilians have been displaced by the fighting  Families on both      sides of the conflict have suffered terribly  and the country      remains divided and no closer to peace                   Every time a Sri Lankan soldier violates international humanitarian      law it alienates the very people in the Tamil community whose      support the government needs to combat terrorism  Our country has      experienced a similar problem in Iraq  where killings of civilians      have hurt our mission  tarnished our image and weakened the support      of our allies             Mr  President  I would hope that the Sri Lankan government would see      our action for what it is  We want to help  but not      unconditionally  I believe the United States could and should play      a more active role  with other key partners  in helping to      facilitate negotiations on a political settlement  But rhetoric      about human rights and the appointment of ineffectual commissions of      inquiry that have no credibility  only goes so far  The situation      remains grave and those responsible for abuses are rarely punished       making a peace agreement more difficult to achieve  A field      presence of the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights       with sufficient mandate and capability to conduct full and      unfettered monitoring throughout the country  communicate its      findings to all sides of the conflict and the public  and provide      advice and technical assistance  is overdue  Also urgently needed      is greater access for humanitarian organizations to assist civilians      caught in the cross fire and for journalists to report the facts              The Sri Lankan people have suffered the consequences of ethnic      discrimination  violence and injustice for the better part of their      countrys history  We cannot solve Sri Lankas conflict  only the      Sri Lankan people can  But we can and want to continue helping if      the government demonstrates that it takes our concerns seriously
