       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Evaluating The Propiety And Adequacy Of   The OxyContin Criminal Settlement                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Evaluating The Propriety And Adequacy Of The OxyContin Criminal     Settlement     July 31  2007     I scheduled todays hearing at the request of the     distinguished Ranking Member  The Senior Senator from Pennsylvania has     long expressed an interest in criminal liability for the introduction of     dangerous or defective products into the marketplace  I agree with him     that this is an important issue and one where further congressional     action may be warranted       This hearing will examine the recent plea agreement between the makers     of OxyContin and the Federal government  Last month  this Committee held     a hearing addressing the role of rogue online pharmacies in our Nations     growing prescription drug abuse problem  Among young people      prescription drugs have become the second most abused illegal drug      behind marijuana  In fact  if you exclude marijuana  more adults and     teens report abusing prescription drugs than all other illicit drugs     combined  I noted then that Purdues admitted misrepresentations about     the addictiveness and abuse potential of their product was very     troubling       The criminal conduct involved in the marketing of OxyContin has been one     of the most tragic examples in recent memory of a company favoring the     bottom line over the health of our Nations citizens  The tragic irony     is that the dangerous product here purported to help people manage pain      And I know that for many it has been effective  But for many others      this drug  and its diversion due to widespread distribution  has caused     terrible harm    from addiction to death  Purdue made billions of     dollars marketing OxyContin as a less addictive alternative to other     painkillers  Today  we will hear about what punishment the Justice     Department found appropriate for this criminal conduct       I look forward to discussing today with the witnesses how best to     prevent this type of dangerous corporate decision making from occurring     again  Americans should not have their lives reduced to a mere factor in     an actuarial table  While the makers of OxyContin have been prosecuted      have pleaded guilty  and are paying a multi million dollar fine  no one     from the company is going to jail  I believe it is fair to ask in light     of Purdues profits from OxyContin of approximately  2 8 billion between     1995 and 2004  whether the  680 million in penalties they received in     this plea agreement will serve as a deterrent to similar future conduct     or just another cost of doing business as usual       We will hear testimony today about the way Purdues conduct has affected     the lives of those who have lost loved ones as a result of taking     OxyContin  Many are asking why the three executives who pleaded guilty     were not given jail time  Certainly nothing makes corporate executives     think twice about malfeasance more than the prospect of the iron bars     slamming shut  The Judge who presided over the plea agreement stated at     the sentencing hearing  I do not doubt that many of our fellow citizens           will deem it inappropriate that no jail time is imposed  It     bothers me  too  The United States Attorney who prosecuted the case     will testify today about why he did not insist that the responsible     corporate officials pay a similar price as the individuals who sell     OxyContin on the street  I look forward to hearing from the witnesses     and thank them for joining us this afternoon
