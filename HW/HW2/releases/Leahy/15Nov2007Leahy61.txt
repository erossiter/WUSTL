       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On Judiciail And Executive Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On Judicial And Executive Nominations  Executive Business Meeting   November 15  2007     Today the Committee will reach a      significant landmark in our progress on the consideration of      nominations for lifetime appointments to the Federal bench  We will      report out four judicial nominations on our agenda today  With the      nominations of Joseph N  Laplante for the District of New      Hampshire  Reed Charles OConnor for the Northern District of Texas       Thomas D  Schroeder for the Middle District of North Carolina  and      Amul R  Thapar for the Eastern District of Kentucky  the Committee      will have reported 40 judicial nominations this year              The Committee has worked hard all year to expeditiously consider the      Presidents nominations  I thank the      home state Senators  Senators Gregg  Sununu  Hutchison  Cornyn       Dole  Burr  McConnell and Bunning  for their consideration of these      nominees  I especially want to thank Senator Whitehouse for      chairing the hearing on these nominations     I am glad we were able to accommodate the      request of Senator Specter  our ranking member  to promptly consider      the nomination of Mr  Thapar  The National Asian Pacific American      Bar Association wrote to us in support of his nomination  which is      the first of a South Asian American to be an Article III judge  If      confirmed  he would become only the seventh Asian Pacific American      Article III judge in our Nations history         The 40 nominations we will have reported after today  one week      before the Thanksgiving recess  exceeds the totals reported in all      of 2004 and 2005  when a Republican led Judiciary Committee was      considering this Presidents nominees  all of 1989  all of 1993      when a Democratic led Senate was      considering President Clintons nominees  all of 2000  when a      Republican led Judiciary Committee was considering President      Clintons nominees  and all of 1996  when      the Republican led Senate did not confirm a single one of President      Clintons circuit nominees      Of these 40 nominations  six have been for      seats on federal appellate courts  far exceeding the total reached      during the entire 1996 session during which a Republican led Senate      did not confirm a single one of President Clintons circuit      nominees             We continue to make similar progress in the full Senate  Earlier      this week the Senate confirmed the nomination of Robert Dow to the      Northern District of Illinois  the 35th nomination for a      lifetime appointment to the Federal bench this session alone  And      we are poised to make even more progress  The Senate could easily      confirm one more judicial nomination previously reported by this      Committee that is now pending on the executive calendar  that     of John Daniel Tinder to the Court of      Appeals for the Seventh Circuit  With those two nominations       along with the four nominations we report out today  the Senate is      positioned to confirm 40 nominations by Thanksgiving  easily      exceeding the totals of the each of the last three     years when a Republican led Senate was      considering this Presidents nominees             This Committee has treated President Bushs nominations fairly       Those who urge that we expedite the nomination of Judge Catharina      Haynes to the Fifth Circuit fail to mention that the Senate has      already confirmed two Fifth Circuit nominations this year  those of      Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod and Judge Leslie Southwick              I wish that President Clintons nominations to that same court had      fared as well with a Republican Congress  When President Bush came      into office in 2001  not a single Fifth Circuit nominee had been      confirmed in six years  Republicans having blocked consideration of      three qualified nominees to that court among the 60 judicial      nominations that were pocket filibustered              Those who urge us to expedite the nomination of Judge Haynes  a      nominee from Texas  fail to mention that we have already confirmed      five of President Bushs nominees to the Fifth Circuit  three of      whom were from Texas  and we have another nomination on todays      agenda for the Northern District of Texas             Compare that record to the fate of many of President Clintons      judicial nominees from Texas  who were blocked and delayed by the      Republican majority  including Enrique Moreno  nominated to the      Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals  but who never got a hearing  never      got a vote  Judge Jorge Rangel  nominated to the Fifth Circuit Court      of Appeals  but who never got a hearing  never got a vote  and Judge      Hilda Tagle to the District Court  whose confirmation was delayed      for nearly two years for no good reason              We continue to make significant progress on ALL circuit court      nominations  When the Senate confirms the      Tinder nomination now pending on the Senates Executive calendar  we      will have confirmed six circuit court nominees  matching the total      circuit court confirmations for all of 2001      We will also have exceeded the circuit      court totals achieved in all of 2004 when a Republican led Senate      was considering this Presidents circuit nominees  all of 1989  all      of 1983  when a Republican led Senate was considering President      Reagans nominees  all of 1993 when a Democratic led Senate was      considering President Clintons nominees  and  of course  the entire      1996 session during which a Republican led Senate did not confirm a      single one of President Clintons circuit nominees the entire      session             Yet despite all of our efforts to promptly consider and report      judicial nominees  some on the other side continue to complain  If      they were candid they would concede that we Democrats  we      Democrats  have confirmed more of President Bushs nominees for      any given period of time while we have been in charge than the      Republicans did  We have had three different leaderships in this      Committee during the time President Bush has been in office  Yet       it is a little known fact that during the Bush Presidency  more      circuit judges  more district judges    more total judges         were confirmed in the first 24 months that I served as Judiciary      Chairman than during the 2 year tenures of either of the two      Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate majorities                  Indeed  I recall the generous treatment Democrats gave the circuit      court nominees of Presidents Reagan and Bush in the Presidential      election years of 1988 and 1992  In those two elections  the      Democratic controlled Senate averaged nine circuit court      confirmations  Regrettably  the Republican Senate reversed that      course in the treatment of President Clintons circuit court      nominations  confirming an average of only four in the Presidential      election years of 1996 and 2000  and none in the entire 1996      session         We have placed a priority on working to      restore integrity and independence to the Justice Department  Last      week  we reported out of Committee the nomination of Michael J       Sullivan to be Director of the Bureau of Alcohol  Tobacco  Firearms      and Explosives  The nomination of Ronald Jay Tenpas will be on the      agenda of our next business meeting  Of course  we still      await nominations for the Deputy Attorney General  the Associate      Attorney General  a number of Assistant Attorney General positions      and  importantly  21 U S  Attorney positions around the country       over one fifth of all U S  Attorney positions  When we receive      those nominations  they will go to the top of our priority list             Despite criticism from this Administration  we continue to make      progress on judicial vacancies when the White House will work with      us  Twenty six of these vacancies  more than half  have no      nominee  Of the 17 vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to      be judicial emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees      for nine of them  more than half of them  Of the 14 circuit court      vacancies  six  nearly half  are without a nominee  If the      President had worked with the Senators from Michigan  Rhode Island       Maryland  California  New Jersey  and Virginia  we could be in      position to make even more progress              I recall at the end of last Congress Senator Specter decrying the      nominations then stalled on the Senate floor due to Republican      holds  He said             A good number of these nominees are also in districts where there      are judicial emergencies  I think that from time to time we in the      Senate  where we have the responsibility for confirmation  don t      really take seriously enough the impact of judicial vacancies  The      courts are busy  The Third Circuit  my circuit  is overwhelmed       District Court Judge Jordan ought to be confirmed  My colleagues      have told me about the problems posed by vacancies in their states       If these other 13 districts nominees are not confirmed today  they      will languish until who knows  January turns into February and      February in March  We always find a reason around here not to do      something  That applies most emphatically to the judges              I took Senator Specters advice very seriously  as I always do  and      we have found a way this year to make progress on those nominations      that once languished on the floor and many more as well  We will      continue to proceed promptly and efficiently to confirm nominations      to fill vacancies and improve the administration of justice in the      country             One of the signs of this progress is that we have helped cut the      number of circuit vacancies from a high water mark of 32 in the      early days of this Administration to as low as 13 this year       Contrast that with the Republican led Senates lack of action on      President Clintons moderate and qualified nominees that resulted in      increasing circuit vacancies during the Clinton years from 17 when      he was inaugurated to 26 when he left office  During those years       the Republican led Senate engaged in strenuous and successful      efforts under the radar to keep circuit judgeships vacant in      anticipation of a Republican President  We have reversed that      course             I would rather see us work together as we have today in the      selection of nominees so that we can confirm judges rather than      fight about them
