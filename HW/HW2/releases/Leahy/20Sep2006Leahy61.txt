       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On H R  6061  Secure Fence Act Of 2006                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On H R  6061  Secure Fence Act Of 2006    September 20  2006 Over the last couple     of weeks  the President has used his pulpit to inform the Senate that     his top priority had to be fixing the problem he created when he     unilaterally proclaimed what laws govern military commissions  That     desire to work with Congress stood in stark contrast to his position in     2002  when a number of us reached out to the Administration to work with     us on a bipartisan statute to establish the authority for fair and     effective military commissions  Four years later  having rejected any     role for Congress  the Administrations go it alone plan has succeeded     in having no terrorist military commission trials completed and no     convictions   Still  Congress set     to work and the Armed Services Committee last week reported a bipartisan     bill to authorize military commissions  They worked with  and listened     to  the professionals in the military  But this week  the Senate     Republican leadership has threatened to filibuster that bipartisan bill     and refused to proceed to its consideration   To recap  last week     the Senate Republican leadership was demanding immediate action on     military commissions as the Senates priority  This week  it appears     the priority is a 700 mile fence along our Southern border and a study     of similar barrier along the Northern border  It is getting hard to     keep track of what the Republican Senates priorities really are  In     the spring  the Majority Leader praised and voted for comprehensive     immigration reform  and stood with Senators on both sides of the aisle     in support of that bill  Now the Senate Republican leadership seems     ready to throw all of our hard work over the side and abandon our     principles  Just last year  the Republican leadership could not have     been more critical of what it called leadership led partisan     filibusters  yet today that is exactly what they are threatening      If there is an     opportunity for Senate floor time  why not use it instead to put an end     to the ongoing war profiteering and contracting fraud in Iraq  Why not     help those still suffering from Katrina  Why not pass a federal budget      or consider the appropriations bills required by law to be completed by     October 1  Why not work on lowering health care costs  health insurance     costs  fuel costs or the rising costs of interests rates and mortgage     rates   This bill  which the     House of Representatives rushed through last week  is not ready for     consideration on the Senate floor  It has had no committee     consideration whatsoever in the Senate  and differs sharply from the     considered Senate action just a few months ago  Why has the Republican     congressional leadership not been willing to proceed to a conference so     that we could make real progress on comprehensive immigration reform      This is an issue on which the President could be of help and show some     leadership   Along with a     bipartisan majority of Senators  I voted for a far more measured version     of a physical barrier on the Southern border during the Senates debate     on comprehensive immigration reform  The Senate has demonstrated its     commitment to border security as an integral part of comprehensive     reform  The Senate bills fencing provision called for 370 miles of     fencing in the most vulnerable high traffic areas  That is what the     Administration requested and recommended  That is what we were told the     Secretary of Homeland Security wanted  And our measure was not designed     to insult or inflame our neighbors  It had a provision for consultation     with the Mexican government  We had in the Judiciary Committee taken     into account the differences along the Northern border and our close     working relationship with the Canadian government  These provisions and     actions helped foster respect and effective cooperation between our     country and our neighbors and allies   The bill we debate     today is a hasty  ill considered  mean spirited measure that will cost     taxpayers billions of dollars  A wall of this magnitude will be a scar     on our landscape  a scar on a fragile desert ecosystem  and a scar on     our legacy as a nation of immigrants  What does a 700 mile barrier wall     say about us as a free country   Most troubling  this     bill would give the Secretary of Homeland Security unfettered power to     decide what laws to follow and what laws to ignore  Read the bill  It     was the Department of Homeland Security that just last year mismanaged     the preparations for Hurricane Katrina that contributed to such     devastation and suffering  It is the Department of Homeland Security     that has not managed to secure our ports  our chemical plants  our     borders  It is the same Department of Homeland Security that the     Republican House would entrust with unlimited power to take all actions     the Secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and     maintain operational control over the entire international land and     maritime borders of the United States  I do not think any     Executive official  and certainly not those who mismanaged our     preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina  should be given such     a blank check  Remember how this     Administration has misinterpreted the Authorization for Use of Military     Force  That was the measure by which Congress authorized the President     to go to Afghanistan and get Osama bin Laden  Instead of accomplishing     that  the Administration argues it means that Congress meant to allow     the President to violate the FISA law and secretly wiretap Americans     without a warrant  This is the President who signs a law with his     figures crossed behind his back and then issues a signing statement     reserving to himself the power to decide what laws to follow and how and     when  This is the Administration to which the Republican House wants to     give a blank check  after Justice OConnor and the Supreme Court have     reminded us that our Constitution provides for checks and balances not a     blank check for the Administration  Rather than do its job and pass     comprehensive immigration reform  as the Senate did  the House and now     the Senate Republicans want to punt all power to the Executive  The     only thing the House left out of its bill was calling this a war on     immigrants in which they view Secretary Chertoff as the     commander in chief   Have the lives lost     in Iraq and billions of taxpayers dollars unaccounted for  9 11 and     Katrina taught us nothing  How many more disastrous mistakes must this     Administration make before the Republican Congress recognizes that     abdicating our constitutional role and concentrating power in the     Executive branch is the wrong strategy for protecting the security and     rights of the American people  Do we need to create yet another     environment for crony contractors of the Bush Cheney Administration to     bilk taxpayers out of billions with no oversight or accountability  I     hope not   Five years of Bush     Republican incompetence has left Americas borders unsecured and our     immigration system broken  We joined to pass a bipartisan Senate bill     with tough  practical  comprehensive immigration reform to secure the     borders  enforce our laws  and fix our immigration system  We want to     bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows  The President and his     Administration say that will make us safer  President Bush told the     American people he supports comprehensive immigration reform  Now he     must tell Republicans in Congress to stop obstructing it  They have not     even proceeded to a conference on the bill  Nor do we need a     study to determine whether we should build a barrier along the 3 175     miles of Northern border  As I have said before  and I will say again      I have heard some cockamamie ideas in my time in the Senate  but this     one rises to the top  In length and in almost every other way  the     Northern Border is different than the Southern Border  The Northern     Border  which spans the continent  is the worlds longest and safest     international boundary  and Canada is our most important trading     partner  It is clear to me that those who want to build an enormously     costly barrier across it have no clue about the character  the history     and the day to day commercial importance of the Northern Border and the     needs of the states and communities that would be affected  It is best     to nip this foolishness in the bud before Congress wastes more tax     dollars in another boneheaded stunt   America can do better     than this  and the Senate has already pointed the way with our     bipartisan  comprehensive approach  We need comprehensive reform that     reflects American values and is effective  The House bill will cost     American taxpayer dearly but accomplish little
