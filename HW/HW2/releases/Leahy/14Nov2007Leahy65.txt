       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On No Safe Haven  Accountability For Human   Rights Violators In The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of      Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Subcommittee On Human Rights And The Law      Hearing On No Safe Haven  Accountability For Human Rights Violators          In The United States      November 14  2007  I thank Senator Durbin for holding      this important hearing to bring needed oversight to the crucial area      of human rights enforcement  I was proud to work with Senator Durbin      in creating the Human Rights and the Law Subcommittee  which is      working to closely examine important and difficult legal issues that      have increasingly been a focus of the Judiciary Committee  I      congratulate Chairman Durbin and Ranking Member Coburn for the      significant work they have already done and will continue to do in      this Subcommittee  and I hope the Subcommittees work with be a      first step toward reversing and correcting the damaging policies      established by this Administration over the last six years        It is vital that the United States reclaim its historic role as a      beacon to the world on issues of human rights  One key way to do so      is to ensure that this country will never be a safe haven for those      who commit atrocities  Congress took an important step toward doing      this in 2004  when it passed the Anti Atrocity Alien Deportation      Act  a piece of legislation I introduced and worked for years to      pass  That statute has made it easier for this country to keep out      those who commit human rights abuses and to deport those      perpetrators of abuses who are already here  This law has prompted       among other accomplishments  the deportation of Kelbessa Negewo to      Ethiopia  where he is now serving a life sentence for torture and      multiple killings        The Anti Atrocity Alien Deportation Act also authorized the Office      of Special Investigations at the Justice Department  which      previously focused only on prosecutions of Nazi war criminals  to      expand its focus to include prosecutions of all perpetrators of      human rights abuses  I look forward to hearing more today about that      sections work to bring these criminals to justice        Senators Durbin and Coburn have worked through this Subcommittee to      expand on that important legislative accomplishment  I was glad to      cosponsor their Genocide Accountability Act  which would close a      loophole that has long existed in our criminal law allowing those      who commit or incite genocide to seek refuge in our country without      fear of prosecution for their actions  That bill has passed through      the Judiciary Committee  as have similar bills providing for      prosecution of those who seek refuge in the United States after      committing human trafficking offenses or recruiting child soldiers       I hope the Senate will follow the Judiciary Committees lead in      passing this important legislation and working to ensure that the      United States is never a refuge for those who commit crimes against      humanity  I hope todays hearing provides added support for this      legislation and ideas for any additional legislation necessary for      rigorous human rights enforcement        The Judiciary Committee has restored oversight to a Department of      Justice that had run amok on principles as fundamental as keeping      prosecutions free from political influence  limiting executive      power  and clearly prohibiting torture  I am glad that the Human      Rights Subcommittee is extending the Judiciary Committees strong      progress on oversight into this key area  It will be important to      ensure that the Justice Department and the government as a whole is      doing everything it can to combat human rights abuses and provide      accountability to those who perpetrate them        Perhaps more than anything  though  we must lead by example  It is      an outrage that some in this Administration  from our State      Department to our newly confirmed Attorney General  have been      unwilling to say that waterboarding is illegal  The United States      does not torture  and we should not have to discuss whether or not      we can use the ancient and cruel practice of waterboarding  The      answer should be self evident        It is an outrage that the last Congress and this Administration      passed a law allowing non citizens  including the millions of      lawful  permanent residents living in this country  to be held      indefinitely on mere suspicion of involvement in terrorism  without      the ability to challenge their detention in court  I will continue      working with Senator Specter to restore the Great Writ of habeas      corpus  And it is an outrage that our government has engaged in      extraordinary rendition  including sending a Canadian citizen to      Syria to be tortured  and has not apologized or changed its policy            We must promote accountability for human rights violations committed      abroad  and we must never let those who commit these horrible crimes      escape prosecution by coming to the United States  But no amount of      enforcement against foreign nationals will compensate if we abandon      our commitment to upholding the highest standards of human rights in      the conduct of our own government and our own country        I commend Senators Durbin and Coburn for holding this timely and      pertinent oversight hearing and for their diligent work to fill      loopholes in the law and conduct oversight to ensure that human      rights abuses are punished  I hope the rest of Congress and the      Administration will similarly recommit to the principles of human      rights
