       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Subcommittee On   Intellectual Property  Patent Law Reform  Injunctions And Damages                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy     Ranking Member  Subcommittee On Intellectual Property     Patent Law Reform  Injunctions And Damages     June 14  2005  This afternoon  the Intellectual      Property Subcommittee continues its public examination of the many      issues faced by our patent system  Americans inventions  and their      entrepreneurial drive  have helped to make the  United States the undisputed global      leader when it comes to intellectual property  We in Congress must      do our part to ensure that our leadership continues  and that      Americans are encouraged and rewarded for their contributions        Our task here is a complex one  as we      try to retain the best aspects of a system that has fostered and      promoted the innovative spirit of our country  while making the      changes necessary to ensure that we are not inadvertently hampering      those same efforts  And so  the Senate must produce legislation      that will do just that  I have been working with Senator Hatch  and      will continue to do so  on this important initiative  I am grateful      to our friends in the House for all their work  and look forward to      a day  a day coming soon  when we can introduce related      legislation in the Senate  If past experience is a useful predictor      of future outcomes  there is a very good chance that Senator Hatch      and I will produce legislation that can reach the Presidents desk   At this Subcommittees hearing in      April  we heard a great deal about patent quality  and about reforms      that may be necessary to ensure that the Patent and Trademark Office      issues patents for work that is truly innovative  Today  we move      our focus from the work rooms of the PTO to the court rooms across     America  In discussions      with interested parties  three possible areas of reform have      featured prominently  the use of injunctive relief and damages in      patent infringement cases  the possibility of administrative      processes rather than      litigation to resolve certain issues  and  finally  the role of      subjective elements in patent litigation  While we need to be      thorough in considering all of these issues  and others besides  I      am particularly interested today in hearing about injunctions and      damages  as those seem to be the so called hot buttons as we try      to draft fair legislation   I would like to thank our witnesses      for taking time out of their busy schedules to share their thoughts      and insights with us  As I mentioned  I am particularly interested      in hearing from you all on the subject of injunctive relief  In      issuing injunctions  courts are directed to balance the equities in      a given case  evaluating the harm to one party if an injunction is      issued versus the harm to the other party if the injunction is not      issued  and to consider the public interest  Some argue that under      the current legal standard  plaintiffs are granted injunctions in      nearly all cases  In such cases  where a defendant is faced with      the virtual certainty that production and marketing will grind to a      halt  weak cases may be leveraged into lucrative licensing      agreements  On the other hand  I am sensitive to the fact that      injunctive relief must be available for those cases in which      irreparable harm is truly likely  and where the demands of equity      compel injunctive relief  We all know that there is not yet      consensus on how to solve this piece of the puzzle  but I hope      todays hearing will move us toward a solution    A related issue that I would encourage      the witnesses to address is the question of apportionment of      damages  I have heard from some quarters that a verdict of      infringement can result in an award of damages out of proportion to      the actual role that the infringed item plays in the overall      product  It seems reasonable that the damages awarded should relate      to the value of the infringement  but that is doubtless easier for      me to say than for a judge and jury to determine  I would be      grateful for some discussion of this issue by the witnesses   Another reform we have heard mentioned       one that was touched on at this panels last hearing  is the use      of administrative procedures to reduce the quantity of litigation       as well as to improve patent quality  There seems to be general      support for this idea  and when we met last April several witnesses      spoke of the desirability of creating a post grant review process      that would allow a third party to challenge a patents validity      within the PTO  without entering the courtroom    Finally  I have heard considerable      support for some proposals to modify the subjective elements of      patent litigation    the finding of willfulness in infringement       and the determination of inequitable conduct and what that can      entail  Investigating these elements can be costly and requires a      determination of a partys state of mind at the time a patent      application was filed  For example  the willful infringement      standard  by which treble damages can be awarded if a defendant was      aware of a plaintiffs patent  may have the unintended effect of      discouraging companies from making a comprehensive search of prior      art so that they can avoid being penalized with an enhanced award       We must look at these issues  as well  before we can claim to have      produced a comprehensive patent reform bill   When we talk about patent reform  we      must remember that we are ultimately talking about the products that      will be available to consumers  The ongoing Blackberry dispute      drives this home to me  and I expect to many of you  in a      particularly powerful way  I do not know who is right in that case       but I do know that I was not alone in breathing a sigh of relief      when the parties announced an agreement  Now  the newspapers tell      us  that deal may be unraveling  Even as we contemplate reform       many of us will be watching this case in particular with a nervous      tick in our thumbs   The Blackberry case has the potential      to affect many people in this hearing room  but a ruling by the      Supreme Court yesterday may affect millions of people in homes      throughout the United States  I hope that the ruling in Merck v       Integra Lifesciences will provide a much needed boost to scientific      research developing life saving medicine and lead to the development      of lower cost drugs  In this regard  I would also like to see      greater sharing of drug patents and an end to the practices by which      some companies have delayed competition through anti competitive      conduct    A few years ago  I authored and we      passed legislation to force companies signing non compete agreements      to disclose those agreements to the FTC  I think the FTC and the      Department of Justice need to do more to encourage competition        In a similar vein  I hope that the      Senate Republican leadership will soon allow us to turn to the Stem      Cell Research Enhancement Act  H R  810  This is a bill with 200      House sponsors  led by Congressman Castle and Congresswoman      DeGette  It passed the House last month with 238 votes  The      critically important research this legislation would authorize on      embryonic stem cells  which would otherwise be discarded  holds      great promise and hope for those with family members suffering from      debilitating disease and injury    More effective treatments for      Parkinsons and Alzheimers disease  for diabetes  for spinal cord      injuries  and for many other diseases and conditions are all      possibilities  This is vital work  critical research but its      authorization by the Senate has been shunted aside by the Republican      leadership   Mr  Chairman  you and I have a lot of      years invested in tackling some pretty tough issues  and in few      areas do the issues get more complex than in patent litigation  The      solutions will not be simple  but I am confident that you and I       working together and working with our colleagues in the House  can      solve this puzzle and get it to the Presidents desk
