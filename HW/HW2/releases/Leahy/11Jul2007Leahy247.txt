       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Preserving Prosecutorial   Independence                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is The Department      Of Justice Politicizing The Hiring And Firing Of U S  Attorneys        Part VI July 11  2007    Today  the Committee welcomes Sara      Taylor  until recently the White House Political Director  She is      accompanied by her attorney Neil Eggleston  whom we have permitted      to be seated next to her at the witness table during the hearing to      provide her with his advice and counsel   In April  Senator Specter and I wrote      to Ms  Taylor asking for her cooperation with the Committees      investigation but we did not hear back from her  Since then  she      has left the White House and we have scheduled this hearing to learn      more about the role White House political operatives played in the      unprecedented firings of a number of U S  Attorneys who had been      appointed by this President  I had a chance to meet Ms  Taylor just      before the hearing  I thank her for appearing today and share with      her my hope that she will cooperate with us by testifying to the      best of her knowledge and information  The choice is hers     I feel strongly that law enforcement      should be above politics and that effective law enforcement in which      the American people can have confidence requires its independence      from partisan political activities  That is what appears to have      been compromised in this purge and by the signal it sent to federal      prosecutors around the country    There is clear evidence that Ms       Taylor  a top aide to Karl Rove  was among the staffers who played a      key role in these firings and in the Administrations response to      cover up the reasons behind them when questions first arose  The      White House continues to cover up the facts and reasons for these      firings  Ms  Taylors lawyer informed us last week that she would      like to cooperate with our investigation and I hope that she will       The White House lawyers have resorted to an unprecedented  blanket      assertion of executive privilege and are seeking to interfere with      the obligations of Ms  Taylor to testify and to prevent other      witnesses and the Republican National Committee from providing      information requested by this Committee and the House Judiciary      Committee    Of course this belated blanket claim      of executive privilege belies the initial reaction of the White      House and of the President himself that minimized his involvement      and the involvement of Karl Rove in these matters  This follows the      pattern we saw that culminated in the conviction of Mr  Libby for      obstruction of justice  perjury and lying in another matter     What is the White House trying to      hide  Why would it interfere in Ms  Taylors testifying if  as her      lawyer says  she wishes to cooperate    We have learned from the selective      documents we obtained from the Department of Justice that Ms  Taylor      was involved in the discussions and planning that led to the removal      of Bud Cummins and bypassing the Senate confirmation process to      install Tim Griffin  another former aide to Mr  Karl Rove  as U S       Attorney in the Eastern District of Arkansas  We know from these      documents that Ms  Taylor was part of a group that discussed using      the Attorney Generals expanded authority under the Patriot Act      Reauthorization to appoint Mr  Griffin as interim U S  Attorney      indefinitely  doing an end run around the Senates constitutional      advice and consent responsibility  We know from documents and      testimony that Ms  Taylor played a role in approving the plan for      firing multiple U S  Attorneys on December 7  2006  We know she was      involved in subsequent discussions regarding the congressional      testimony of Department officials and the Administrations response      to the growing scandal surrounding the firings  So why is the White      House trying to block this Committee from hearing from Ms  Taylor      directly    We also understand that tens of      thousands of emails from RNC accounts used by White House political      operatives have been identified and turned over to the White House      but  despite our best efforts  not produced to the congressional      investigating committees  What are they hiding in these emails   From the outset of this scandal the      President has spoken about the firing of U S  attorneys as if it      were a matter handled and decided by the Attorney General and      something Mr  Gonzales would have to explain to Congress and the      American people  The President was hands off and arms length  He      indicated to the American people that he had to ask others whether      anything improper was done and relied on a review by White House      lawyers for his assertion that nothing was    Are we now to understand from the      White House claims of executive privilege that these were decisions      made by the President  That is a direct contradiction of the      Presidents earlier statements that he was not responsible for this      scandal  for the firing of such well regarded and well performing      U S  attorneys for partisan political purposes and to affect      elections    When we had the Attorney General      testify under oath  he did not know who added U S  attorneys to the      list of those to be fired or the reasons they were added  Indeed       the bottom line of the sworn testimony from the Attorney General       the Deputy Attorney General  the Attorney Generals former Chief of      Staff  the White House liaison and other senior Justice Department      officials was that they were not responsible  Senator Specter said      recently that two of the questions at hand are  who ordered the      firings and why  We need answers to these questions    who did make      these decisions  Was it  in fact  the political operatives at the      White House  Was it an attempt to affect elections  What role did      Ms  Taylor and others in Karl Roves White House political office      play    Even this White House cannot dispute      the evidence we have gathered to date showing that White House      officials were heavily involved in these firings and in the Justice      Departments response to congressional inquiries about them    The White House continues to try to      have it both ways  but at the end of the day it cannot  It cannot      block Congress from obtaining the relevant evidence and credibly      assert that nothing improper occurred  What is the White House      hiding  Was the President involved and were his earlier statements      to the American people therefore misleading  Or is this simply an      effort by the White House legal team to protect White House      political operatives whose partisan efforts have been uncovered in a      new set of White House horrors    For months  I have been giving the      White House every opportunity to work with us voluntarily to provide      the information we have sought  This week  the White House ignored      an opportunity to meet its burden of explaining its blanket      privilege claims  Specifically  what is it the White House is so      intent on hiding that they cannot even identify the documents  the      dates  the authors and recipients that they claim are privileged       Would we see the early and consistent involvement of Ms  Taylor and      other high ranking White House political operatives in what should      be independent and neutral law enforcement decisions  Ms  Taylors      honest testimony could help us begin to answer these questions  It      is apparent that this White House is contemptuous of the Congress      and feels that it does not have to explain itself to anyone    not      to the peoples representatives in Congress  nor to the American      people  I urge Ms  Taylor not to follow the White House down this      path    This is a serious matter with serious      consequences for the administration of justice  This is about      improper political influence of our justice system  it is about the      White House manipulating the Justice Department into its own      political arm  It is about manipulating our justice system to pursue      a partisan political agenda  It is about pressuring prosecutors to      bring cases of voter fraud to try to influence elections  of      sending a partisan operative like Bradley Schlozman to Missouri to      file charges on the eve of an election in violation of Justice      Department guidelines  It is about the unprecedented and improper      reach of politics into the Departments professional ranks  such as      the admission by the Departments White House Liaison Monica      Goodling that she improperly screened career employees for political      loyalty and wielded undue political influence over key law      enforcement decisions and policies      It is about political operatives pressuring      prosecutors to bring partisan cases and seeking retribution against      those who refuse to bend to their political will    such as the      example of New Mexico U S  Attorney David Iglesias  who was fired a      few weeks after Karl Rove complained to the Attorney General about      the lack of purported voter fraud enforcement cases in Mr       Iglesias jurisdiction  It is about high ranking officials      misleading Congress and the American people about this political      manipulation of justice    Along the way  this subversion of the      justice system has included lying  misleading and stonewalling the      Congress in our attempts to find out what happened  This      Administration has instituted an abusive policy of secrecy aimed at      protecting themselves from embarrassment and accountability       Apparently the President and Vice President feel they  and their      staff  are above the law  In America no one is above the law        Untoward White House interference with      federal law enforcement is a serious matter  It corrupts federal      law enforcement  threatens our elections and has seriously undercut      the American peoples confidence in the independence and      evenhandedness of law enforcement    Congress will continue to pursue the      truth behind this matter because it is our constitutional      responsibility    and it is the right thing to do       I hope Ms  Taylor chooses to reject the White      Houses insistence that she abet their stonewalling and  instead       works with us so that we can get to the bottom of what has gone on      and gone wrong                                Questions  Round One                  Questions  Round Two                  Closing
