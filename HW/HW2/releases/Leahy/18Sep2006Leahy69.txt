       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Second Anniversary Of The Death   Of Munir Said Thalib                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On      The Second Anniversary     Of The Death Of Munir Said Thalib     September 18  2006 Mr  LEAHY  Today we remember the life and work      of Munir Said Thalib  Indonesias foremost human rights defender       who on September 7  2004  was fatally poisoned while on an airplane      flight to the Netherlands where he planned to continue his legal      studies  This despicable crime  in which the Indonesian      Intelligence Service has been implicated  had repercussions      throughout Asia and around the world and has particularly serious      implications for Indonesia  Munir was an outstanding human rights advocate      best known as a founder and director of the highly respected      Commission for Disappeared Persons and Victims of Violence  He      was working as the director of the Jakarta based human rights group      Imparsial before his murder  In 2000  Munir received the Right      Livelihood Award for his courage and dedication in fighting for      human rights and the civilian control of the military in Indonesia  Two years after his untimely and tragic death       the Indonesian government has failed to properly investigate and      prosecute those responsible  Despite the conviction of an airline      pilot for his role in the murder  the police and Attorney Generals      office continue to ignore the evidence and recommendations of a      Presidential Fact Finding Team that has implicated senior Indonesian      intelligence officers and airline officials in the crime  President      Yudhoyono has rightly described this matter as a test case for      whether Indonesia has changed from its authoritarian past  At this      point  it appears that a culture of impunity remains deeply embedded      in Indonesian society  The fiscal year 2007 State  Foreign Operations      Appropriations bill that was reported by the Appropriations      Committee on July 10  2006  includes my amendment which requires a      report on progress on human rights in Indonesia  including the      investigation of the murder of Munir Said Thaib  If the Indonesia      Government aspires to be seen as one that respects human rights and      the rule of law  which is fundamental to any democracy  it is      essential that whoever was responsible for ordering and carrying out      this heinous crime be identified and brought to justice
