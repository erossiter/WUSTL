       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Hearing On The FBI s Information  Technology Modernization Program  Trilogy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT         Opening Statement Senator Patrick Leahy       Committee On Appropriations        Subcommittee on Commerce  Justice  State and the        Judiciary       Hearing on The FBIs Information Technology        Modernization Program  Trilogy       February 3  2005 I commend Chairman Gregg for        convening this hearing today  This is an important        issue for the FBI and its missions in protecting the        country  and I appreciate the opportunity to serve as        ranking member on this hearing  I am pleased that both        Director Mueller and Inspector General Fine have        returned to testify  I welcome them and the other        witnesses  and I look forward to their testimony   I know that Groundhog Day was        actually yesterday  but the subject of todays hearing         problems the FBI is having with its computers  calls to        mind the sense of d  j   vu that the film of the same name        captured so well  It is unbelievable given the years        that have gone by and the advances in technology that        have marched on in the meantime that we are here today        to discuss whether or not to completely scrap a key        component of the FBIs Trilogy project    the        long anticipated Virtual Case File  This program has        been a train wreck in slow motion  at a cost of  170        million to American taxpayers and an unknown cost to        public safety  And sadly  VCF is but one of many        Trilogy problems at the FBI   Apoplectic would be too mild a        description of my reaction to the unraveling of the        Trilogy project  or the Tragedy project  as some FBI        agents have taken to calling it  Bringing the FBIs        information technology into the 21st Century        should not be rocket science  it is a complicated        process  but it is certainly doable  The history of the FBIs efforts to        upgrade its information technology has been long and        tortured  Back in 2000  when we began discussions about        Trilogy as a way to bring the FBIs antiquated systems        into the 21st Century  we were warned of dire        consequences to our security and our safety if the        improvements were not imminent  Congress responded by        devoting  581 million to the effort   Time and again  the project has        fallen victim to escalating costs  imprecise planning         mismanagement  implementation concerns  and delays  The        necessary network  hardware and software upgrades were        not delivered in a timely manner  Consequently  the        estimated December 2003 deadline for completion of VCF        passed unmet  The program was then dubbed unusable         and we now know that what is being tested is a        significantly scaled down version  a so called VCF lite         And in keeping with the past disappointments and        delays  we have recently learned that the future of this        lite version remains in question  Congress was led to believe that        VCF was progressing on track despite some delays and        cost overruns on the project  Yet now we hear that VCF        may never be completed at all  In effect  that means        for Congress  for the FBI and  most importantly  for the        American taxpayer  this has been  170 million in        vaporware    widely advertised  but never actually        available for use   There has been no shortage of        opportunities for straightforward reporting to the        oversight committees of Congress as things began to come        off the tracks  including numerous hearings  punctuated        by several damaging reports from OIG  the Government        Accountability Office  and the National Research        Council  These delays and disappointments were never        communicated to Congress  and it is not because Congress        failed to ask  The FBI was repeatedly pressed for        realistic assessments of VCF  But getting straight        answers from the Justice Department and the FBI proved        so difficult that Congress finally turned to the        Government Accountability Office for an independent        assessment  It was only in the shadow of an impending        OIG report that the reality of the situation has come to        light  It appears the FBI bears the brunt        of the responsibility for this derailment  a classic        example of too many cooks  with the predictable        results  The initial contract for VCF was modified 36        times  During this period  the FBI had five different        Chief Information Officers and  reportedly  10 different        project managers  Beyond all that shuffling at the top         several teams were brought into the process at various        times to help set requirements  assess deliverables and        manage costs  Even the recent efforts of the GAO to        audit the project have been thwarted by repeated changes        in the personnel responding to auditors inquiries   It is not clear to me even yet what        the FBI truly knew and whether the Bureau articulated        what it needed  though initial reports suggest the FBI        made an art form of redefining and changing its        requirements  The projects contractor  Science        Applications International Corporation  has said it        received changes on almost a daily basis    some small         but many  significant  Unbelievably  the OIG reports        that the process for defining the requirements and        baselines for the VCF continues to this day  I look        forward to hearing from Inspector General Fine on this        matter   Technology changes rapidly  and I        appreciate the FBIs efforts to keep pace  But the        private sector has had to make these hard decisions with        similar pressures  and it is not unreasonable to demand        as much from the FBI  The September 11th        attacks did change the FBIs assessment of what it        needed  But three years have passed for the Bureau to        regroup  and in that time Congress has responded with        the necessary financial resources to assist the Bureau        in adapting in these tasks  This has been an        outrageously expensive on the job training program         Congress paid for something to be built  not for        learning about what to build through trial and error  Our highest priority must be to        protect the American people  To do its job effectively         the FBI must have state of the art technology that        works  This is a vital task  and now Congress will have        to provide still more funding to get the job done  But        throwing money at this chronic problem alone will not        fix it  The FBI must stop hiding its problems and begin        confronting them  The FBI needs to engage in a full        working partnership with the authorizing and        appropriations committees to which the Bureau is        accountable to for programs like this  Doing that will        better protect the public  conserve tax dollars  and        save everyones time  The camels back is broken  For a        course correction to succeed  there must be a true        accounting  and it is going to start today  We want to        hear what went wrong  who was responsible  and how we        are going to move forward
