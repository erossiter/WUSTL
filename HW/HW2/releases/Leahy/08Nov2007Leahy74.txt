       Judiciary Committee Chairman Urges Passage Of Reporters  Shield Law                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Judiciary Committee       Chairman Urges Passage Of Reporters Shield Law     WASHINGTON  Thursday  Nov  8        2007   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt         again today urged the Senate to consider important legislation       to protect the publics right to know by shielding the flow of       information between reporters and their confidential sources             The Judiciary Committee last month       passed the Free Flow of Information Act  bipartisan legislation       that would establish a federal qualified reporters shield law        The House has passed similar legislation  and Leahy has       requested that the House bill be placed on the Senates       executive calendar to accelerate its consideration  Leahy has       been encouraging the Senate to take up and pass either bill       A new study released by Privacy       International  a privacy  civil liberties and human rights       watchdog organization states that approximately 100 countries       have adopted laws that protect journalists from being forced to       reveal confidential sources  The United States is just one of a       few established democracies that does not       Dozens of media organizations       across the country support the Senates legislation  including       the Vermont Press Association  the New England Press       Association  the Associated Press  the American Society of       Newspaper Editors  The New York Times Company  and The       Washington Post       Statement Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate       Judiciary Committee   Urging Senate       Consideration Of The Free Flow Of Information Act   November 9  2007      MR  PRESIDENT  When the Judiciary       Committee reported federal reporters shield legislation to the       floor on October 23  I called on the Senate to promptly consider       and pass this important legislation  The Senate version of the      Free Flow of Information Act        S  2035  is bipartisan legislation that was favorably reported       by the Judiciary Committee on a strong bipartisan vote  The       House has already passed legislation on this same subject  H R        2102  with a strong  veto proof majority of 398 to 21         Both of these bipartisan bills are       available and waiting for Senate action  and I believe that       there are well over sixty votes in favor of passing a shield       bill in the Senate  I strongly support the enactment of a       federal shield law for journalists  and I urge the Senate to       promptly consider and pass federal shield legislation       All of us have an interest in       enacting a balanced and meaningful first amendment privilege        According to a newly released study by Privacy International  a       privacy  civil liberties and human rights watchdog organization        the United States is one of just a few established democracies       around the world that does not have a law to protect journalists       from being forced to reveal confidential sources  In fact        according to that study  approximately 100 countries have       adopted laws that allow journalists to honor their promise of       confidentiality       Sadly  the press has become the       first stop  rather than the last resort  for our government and       private litigants when it comes to seeking information  This is       a dangerous trend that can have a chilling effect on the press       and the publics right to know       Enacting federal shield       legislation would help to reverse this troubling trend  In       fact  proceeding promptly to consideration of this legislation       is something I strongly support  Should the Senate take up the       bipartisan shield bill that overwhelmingly passed in the House        federal shield legislation could go immediately to the       President s desk and be signed into law without delay this year       The Senate bill has the support of       a bipartisan coalition of Senators  including Senators Specter        Schumer  Lugar  Dodd  Graham and myself  who have all united to       cosponsor this legislation  In addition  more than 50 news       media and journalism organizations support this legislation  and       the call for Senate action on this historic bill extends to       editorial pages across the country  including in  The New York Times  Arizona       Republic  L  A  Times  Salt Lake Tribune  and       San Francisco Chronicle  among others        The Senate and House bills protect       law enforcement interests and safeguard national security        Moreover  both of these bills follow the lead of 33 States and       the District of Columbia which have shield laws  and many other       States  including Vermont  which recognize a common law       reporters privilege  Tellingly  the Bush Administration has       not identified a single circumstance where a reporters       privilege has caused harm to national security or to law       enforcement  despite the fact that many courts have recognized       such a privilege for years       Given the overwhelming need and       support for a federal shield law to protect the publics right       to know  I urge the Senate to promptly consider and pass a       federal shield bill       I ask that a copy of a support       letter from the Media Coalition Supporting the Free Flow of       Information Act  which is signed by 67 different news       organizations  be printed in the record following my statement
