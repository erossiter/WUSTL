                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Democratic Senators Seek Specific      Papers     Relating to Supreme Court Nominee  Judiciary Panel Members Set      Document Priorities To Expedite Review      Process WASHINGTON       Tuesday  July 26     The Democratic members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee Tuesday sent a letter to President Bush seeking      specific documents written by Supreme Court nominee John Roberts      while he worked in the White House Counsels office for former      President Ronald Reagan  The letter is the first request by      Democratic senators for information relating to the record of Judge      Roberts    The letter is      attached and below   The Honorable      George W  Bush     The White House     1600 Pennsylvania Ave  NW     Washington  D C       20500 Dear Mr       President  We are      disappointed that the White House appears to have so quickly moved      to close off access by the Senate to important and informative      documents written by Supreme Court nominee John Roberts while he was      at the Department of Justice  According to news reports today  your      Administration may be preemptively protecting thousands of documents      not even requested yet by the Committee  documents that could very      well hold important information necessary to evaluate Judge Roberts      judicial philosophy and legal reasoning  While many      documents are being delivered today from Judge Roberts work for      Attorney General William French Smith at the Reagan Justice      Department  it is far too early to determine whether these documents      are relevant  adequate  or even helpful  It may be that this group      of documents  along with the upcoming hearings  will give us enough      information to fulfill our constitutional duty to advise and consent      on this nomination  But it would be premature for either the Senate      or the White House to make that determination now  Judge Roberts      spent some four years working for President George H W  Bush  and it      may very well be that documents from that time will be helpful to      the Committee as well  It is our hope      that the confirmation process moves swiftly and smoothly over the      coming weeks  We can assure you that no Senator is attempting to      unduly delay the proceedings  We intend to work with Chairman      Specter if and when further requests for documents or information      appear appropriate  But in the meantime  we believe that judgment      should be withheld on which and how many documents regarding this      nominee might be released to the Senate  The history of past      nominations is varied but clear  each confirmation process is      different  and the type and number of documents shared between the      White House and the Senate has depended on the nature of the debate       the needs of the Committee  and a cooperative negotiation between      the Senate and the White House  A blanket statement that entire      groups of documents are off limits is both premature and ill      advised  Finally  it is      our understanding that many more publicly available documents will      soon be sorted and delivered to the Committee  In the interests of      speeding up the process  we have attached a list of the document      areas within that group we feel would be most helpful to the      Committee  To the extent your staff can assist in expediting the      delivery of those documents  we would be grateful  Sincerely  Patrick Leahy     Edward Kennedy     Joseph Biden     Herbert Kohl     Dianne Feinstein     Russell Feingold     Charles Schumer      Richard Durbin   ATTACHED  Particular matters of Interest  JGR  Law of War  JGR  Texas Redistricting  JGR  Abortion  JGR  Acid Rain  JGR  Affirmative Action      Correspondence  JGR  Appointee Correspondence 1985  JGR  Appointee Memos  Clearance       Announcements  etc   JGR  Appointments Clause  JGR  Asbestos Legislation  JGR  DC Chadha  JGR  Change in Presidential Term  JGR  Civil Rights Commission  JGR  Comparable Worth  JGR  Conflicts of Interest  JGR  Death Squads Investigation       SSCI  JGR  DOJ Daily Reports JGR  EECO  JGR  Equal Opportunity in Education  JGR  Ethics  JGR  Exclusionary Rule  JGR  First Amendment  JGR  Flag  American  JGR  Independent Counsel JGR  Iran Emergency       JGR  Jones  Bob  Univ  Decision  JGR  Judges  JGR  Legal Services Corporation  JGR  Pardons  JGR  Political Activity  JGR  Pro Bono  JGR  Reagan  Bush Rallies Guidance  JGR  Recess Appointments  JGR  School Prayer JGR Supreme Court  JGR  War Powers
