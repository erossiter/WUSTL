       Congressional Record Statement On The Confirmation Of Michael Mukasey To   Be Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Congressional Record Statement     Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Nomination Of Michael B  Mukasey      To Be The Attorney General Of The United States     November 8  2007   Mr  LEAHY  I thank the Chair        Mr  President  this debate is as much a discussion of principles      that are vital to American ideals and to the American soul as it is      a debate about who is going to act as the Attorney General for the      next 14 months        During the Judiciary Committee s consideration of this nomination      earlier this week  Senators Kennedy  Kohl  Feingold  Durbin  Cardin       Whitehouse  and I made clear the fallacy that would disregard      settled law and discredit America s role in the struggle for liberty      and human dignity  something we should all support        On the way to rationalizing support for a particular nominee  just      as with rationalizing support for a particular piece of legislation       it may be tempting this once  just this once  we might tell      ourselves  tacitly to abet the arguments of those who want to define      torture down to make it something less  Whatever the      temptation  whatever the temptation  this once  we cannot      rationalize away our core American ideals  the rule of law  and the      principle that in America  not even the President is above the law            The President and Vice President should not be allowed to violate      our obligations under the Convention Against Torture and the Geneva      Conventions  should not be allowed to disregard U S  statutes  such      as our Detainee Treatment Act and War Crimes Act  They should not be      allowed to overturn more than 200 years of our Nation s reverence      for human rights and moral leadership around the world        The administration has compounded its lawlessness by cloaking its      policies and miscalculations under a veil of secrecy  They left the      Congress  they left the courts  and  most importantly  they left the      American people in the dark about what they were doing  The      President says we do not torture  but then he had his lawyers      redefine   torture    and he had them do that in secret memos  in      fundamental conflict with American values and law        Again  yesterday  I wrote to the White House counsel reiterating my      earlier request for this administration s secret  purported      justifications for having Americans engage in waterboarding and      other treatment that would violate our Nation s obligations and      values        I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of my      most recent letter to Counsel Fielding on this point        There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in      the RECORD  as follows          Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I agree with the generals  the admirals       and the judge advocates general that waterboarding is torture and is      illegal  The generals  the admirals  the judge advocates general say      waterboarding is torture and illegal        I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the RECORD a copy of a      letter I received from MG John Fugh  RADM Don Guter  RADM John      Hutson  and BG David Brahms  dated November 2        There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in      the RECORD  as follows          Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  these distinguished military officers       flag officers  people who are charged with knowing what is our law       what is our Constitution  what are our treaty commitments  and what      are the rules our military must follow  write with absolute clarity       and I quote the significant sentence from their letter        Waterboarding is inhumane  it is torture  and it is illegal        They also quote the sitting judge advocates general of the military      services from our committee s hearing last year in which they      unanimously and unambiguously agreed that waterboarding is inhumane       it is illegal  it is a violation of law        Think for a moment  if another nation picked up an American and      waterboarded that American and we heard about it  no Senator  no      American would have to know the circumstances and the purported      justifications for it  We would condemn it  All 100 of us would be      on the floor condemning it  and 435 members of the other body would      be condemning it  Whoever was President of the United States would      condemn it  But you know what  that was before this debate began       and now  tragically  this administration has so twisted America s      role and our laws and values that apparently our own State      Department is now ordered they cannot say that waterboarding of an      American is illegal        Mr  President  that is how far we have sunk  I ask unanimous consent      to have printed in the Record a copy of a letter I sent to Secretary      Rice protesting this order        There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in      the RECORD  as follows          Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  senior State Department legal officers are      told that waterboarding  which has been recognized as torture  not      for the last 10 years or 50 years or 100 years  but has been      recognized as torture for the last 500 years  is a   technique        they cannot rule out as something a foreign intelligence service      might be justified in using against Americans  This is   Alice in      Wonderland          Never mind that President Teddy Roosevelt  no shrinking violet he       prosecuted American soldiers for this more than 100 years ago  Never      mind that we prosecuted Japanese soldiers for waterboarding      Americans during World War II  Never mind what repressive regimes      are doing to this day around the world  It is appalling        When it comes to our core values  the things that make our country      great  that define America s place in the world  it does not depend      on the circumstances  it depends on our core values  America  the      great and good nation that has been a beacon to the rest of the      world on human rights  does not torture  it should not stand for      torture  and it should stand against torture        I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a copy of a      letter I received from the National Religious Campaign Against      Torture  dated November 1        There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in      the Record  as follows           Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  what do we set as an example  We lose our      way on this question of torture  When America arranged to have a      Canadian citizen  changing a plane in the United States on the way      to Canada  sent to Syria to be tortured  what did we tell the rest      of the world  I will tell you what we told the rest of the world       Here we have the outrageous conduct of President Musharraf s      Government in Pakistan  He is closing down the courts  he is closing      down the opposition  he is closing down the press  We have to meekly      say  Please don t do that  we do send you billions of dollars in      aid  please don t destroy democracy        A Cabinet Minister in his Government was interviewed yesterday on a      Canadian show  When he was asked if he was ashamed of the images the      world was seeing of Pakistanis being clubbed by police in the      streets  part of his reply was this  Are other countries  referring      to the United States  ashamed of taking persons from another country      to a third country and torturing them  Are they ashamed        I would like to think as Americans we hold the high moral ground       but we can be lectured because we have not  by the likes of a member      of the Cabinet of a despotic regime in Pakistan  and there is no      answer to it  There is no answer to it because what he objects to us      doing is sending a citizen of another country who was on our land to      Syria to be tortured  and we have no answer to that because this      administration and this Government did it        I am proud to be an American  I am so happy my maternal grandparents      immigrated to this country from Italy and gave me a chance to be an      American  as did my great grandparents from Ireland  I am proud of      it  I am proud to see my children growing up as Americans  now my      grandchildren  as I know the distinguished Presiding Officer whose      family has been in this country much longer than mine is proud of      his American heritage  But torture should not be what America stands      for  Indeed  the better example is set by the Army Field Manual       which instructs our forces to consider how we would react if what a      soldier is about to do to someone was done to an American soldier       How would our soldiers react if they found somebody waterboarding an      American soldier  They would do everything to rescue them because it      would be wrong and it would be illegal  It is not just illegal and      wrong if somebody else does it  it is illegal and it is wrong if we      do it        Sadly  when I cited this very standard in a written question to      Judge Mukasey and asked if it would be an abuse if another country      waterboarded an American  he sidestepped the question  and he failed      to condemn even waterboarding of Americans  When we found our State      Department to begin to do the same  I saw a pattern        In their recent letter to the nominee  Senators Warner  McCain  and      Graham do not take that approach  They recognize  as I do and I hope      all Senators do  that waterboarding  under any circumstances       represents a clear violation of U S  law  That is what Senators      Warner  McCain  and Graham said  As chairman of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  I agree with them        When the administration and others state that we cannot state      whether America waterboards people because it would tip off our      enemies  they have it precisely wrong  That is about as effective as      Saddam Hussein hinting that he had weapons of mass destruction  even      though he did not  as he tried to impress his enemies        In refusing to say we do not waterboard prisoners  what do we do  We      end up giving license to others  When the United States cannot state      unequivocally that waterboarding is torture and illegal and will not      be tolerated  what does that mean for other Governments  What      comfort does that provide the world s most repressive regimes  How      does it allow the United States  that hitherto has been a beacon for      human rights  to criticize or lecture these repressive regimes that      torture that way        Some have sought to find comfort in Judge Mukasey s personal      assurance that he would enforce a future  some kind of new law      against waterboarding if Congress were to pass one  Even some in the      press have used that talking point from the White House  Any such      prohibition would have to be enacted over the veto of this      President  a President who has not ruled out the use of      waterboarding        But the real damage in this argument is not its futility  The real      harm is that it presupposes we don t already have laws and treaty      obligations against waterboarding  As we know  when we enter a      treaty  it becomes the law of the land  We have laws already against      it  We don t need a new law  No Senator should  with any kind of      clear conscience  abet this administration s legalistic obfuscations      by those  such as Alberto Gonzales  who take these positions  or      John Yoo and David Addington  by agreeing somehow that the laws we      already have on the books do not already make waterboarding illegal       We have been properly prosecuting water torture for more than 100      years        Vote for the nominee or vote against the nominee  but don t hide      behind some kind of a cloak and say maybe we should have a law in      the future  We have that law  This is as if  when somebody murders      somebody with a baseball bat  they were to say  We had a law against      murder  but we never mentioned baseball bats  Murder is murder       torture is torture  Our laws make both illegal  and our laws  but      especially our values  do not permit this to be an open question or      even one that depends on who is doing the waterboarding  We cannot      say it is wrong when other countries do it but  of course  it is      right when we do it because our heart is pure  That is a      prescription for disaster  That is what heightens the risk to      American citizens and soldiers around the world  and it gives      repressive regimes comfort  and that is something I will not do        I will not accept this fallacious argument  I will not accept this      pretense that it is OK because we have not yet passed a law  when      that has always been the law in the United States  It was in      Theodore Roosevelt s day  it was when we prosecuted Japanese      soldiers after World War II for waterboarding  and it is today        It would be like saying we haven t a specific law for some of the      things done in Abu Ghraib  Of course  we had not  We knew such      actions violated every principle of our law  Are we going to say       however  it was all right because we didn t have spelled out in the      law every single thought that could be raised about torture so we      could specifically cite to that        Mr  President  hasn t there been enough harm done to the United      States by the images of Abu Ghraib  Hasn t there been enough harm      done to the United States by this Government intentionally taking a      Canadian citizen and sending that citizen to Syria to be tortured       Hasn t there been enough harm done to this country that we don t      need to have Senators stand on the floor of the Senate and say       Well  maybe sometime in the future we should have a law against      waterboarding  when our top military and everybody else all agree      this is already against the law        Now  I wish I could support Judge Mukasey s nomination because I      like him  I like his legal abilities  I like his background as a      prosecutor  He is a tough  no nonsense prosecutor  But we are      dealing with an administration that has been acting outside the law       an administration that has now created a confirmation contortion       Mr  President  I am not a moral contortionist  and I am not going to      aid and abet the confirmation contortions of this administration       When many of us voted to confirm General Petraeus  the      administration turned around and  for political advantage  tried to      claim when we voted to confirm the general  we also voted for the      President s war policies  Well  I did not vote for a war in Iraq  I      voted against it  And I do not vote to allow torture  And just as I      do not support this President s Iraq policy  I do not support his      torture policy or his views of unaccountability or unlimited      Executive power        No one is more eager to restore strong leadership and independence      to the Department of Justice than I  For almost 3 years  it has been      leaderless  For almost 3 years  it has engaged in every single      effort not to follow the law  but to find ways around the law  That      has created a terrible problem of morale among the very wonderful      men and women  the talented men and women who work there        We all know what we need most right now is an Attorney General who      believes and understands there must be limitations on Executive      power  Whether the Executive is a Republican or a Democratic      President  there have to be limitations  America needs to be certain      of the bedrock principles of our laws and our values and that no      President  no American  can be authorized to violate them  In      America  no one is above the law  The President of the United States      is not above the law  He is not allowed to place anybody else above      the law  That is what has maintained this democracy for over 200      years        When we began considering this nomination  I observed that the      Department of Justice has experienced an unprecedented crisis of      leadership  It is a crisis that has come more and more into view as      Senator Specter and I have led a bipartisan group of concerned      Senators serving on our Judiciary Committee to consider a U S       attorney firing scandal  a confrontation over the legality of the      administration s warrantless wiretapping program  and the      politicization of hiring at the Department of Justice  What we have      seen is not just poor leadership  but the complete breakdown of the      principles that have always embodied the Department of Justice and      the position of Attorney General        For me  the issue has never been personal to Alberto Gonzales  The      Judiciary Committee s investigations into the Department s many      scandals were not designed to force the resignation of Alberto      Gonzales  but rather to restore the integrity and the mission of the      Department of Justice  My goal was not to force his resignation but      to restore the Department of Justice  That the administration had      him remain more than 6 months after the U S  attorney firing scandal      was known continued the harm and forestalled the restoration of      order        It was not just the fact that he lost my confidence that forced him      to leave  It was not the Senate passing a resolution of no      confidence  Rather it was our bipartisan efforts in which      Republicans and Democrats who care about Federal law enforcement and      the Department of Justice joined together to press for      accountability        The issue during the Senate confirmation of Alberto Gonzales remains      today  The Department of Justice has always set out to enforce the      law and to ensure that no one  not even the President  is above the      law  As we consider the nomination of Michael Mukasey  we must      determine what kind of Attorney General he would be and whether he      will stand for the rule of law against the demands of this White      House        I began my consideration of this nomination as I did with the last      Attorney General nomination  hoping to be able to support the      nominee  After the hearing for the last nominee in 2005  I decided      that I could not vote for the confirmation of Alberto Gonzales  I      did so noting  as Justice James Iredell had in 1792  that the person      who serves as Attorney General   is not called Attorney General of      the President  but Attorney General of the United States    This is      a different kind of Cabinet position  distinct from all the others       and it requires greater independence  The departing Attorney General      never understood this  Instead  he saw his role as a facilitator for      this White House s overreaching policies and partisan politics        The crisis of leadership that led to the resignation of the entire      senior leadership of the Department and their staffs  as well as      Karl Rove and his two top aides at the White House  has taken a      heavy toll on the tradition of independence that had long guided the      Department of Justice and protected it from political influence  As      a former prosecutor I know that the dismay runs deep  from the      career attorneys at Justice and in our U S  attorney offices       straight down to the cops on the beat        The Senate should only confirm a nominee who will bring a commitment      to the rule of law and American liberties and values back to the      Justice Department  As I have reviewed Judge Mukasey s nomination  I      have found much to like  He has impressive credentials  vast      experience as a lawyer and a judge  and a refreshingly      straightforward manner  I liked him when I met him  and I am      convinced that he is a man of integrity and would not be governed      merely by personal or political loyalty        At his hearing  he answered firmly that he would not tolerate      political meddling in investigations or litigation and would end      hiring based on politics  and he was clear in asserting that he      would resign if the President insisted on going forward with a      course of action he had found to be illegal  These were encouraging      signs        But I am concerned that he shares with this administration a view of      virtually unbridled executive power and authority  In these      uncertain times  it may be tempting simply to defer the Commander in      Chief  but I believe that in difficult times  it is more important      than ever to insist on the rule of law and the principles that have      made our country unique in the world for more than 200 years  Even      Judge Mukasey s strong promise to resign if the President insists on      an illegal course of action loses its power if he believes the      President to be largely unconstrained by law  If nothing the      President can do would be illegal  there would never be an occasion      for him to make such a principled stand        That is why I was so disappointed by Judge Mukasey s answers      suggesting that he sees little occasion to check the President s      power  I was disturbed by his insistence that  with regard to      warrantless wiretapping and the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance      Act  the President has inherent authority outside of the statute and      could authorize and immunize conduct contrary to the law  I fail to      see a valid distinction justifying his assertion that the President      could have the power of an executive override in the surveillance      context  but not in the torture context  and I worry about where his      reasoning could lead us        I was disappointed in his abandoning his initial answer to parrot      the White House s conclusion that a U S  attorney could not bring a      congressional contempt citation to a grand jury  That is the      mechanism in the law that allows an independent court the      opportunity to referee any claim of executive privilege that the      executive and legislative branches could not resolve amongst      themselves  He  instead  insisted that the solution in such a      situation was an   accommodation   of the kind that this      administration has been consistently unwilling to make  Once again       his position leads me to worry that he would allow this President s      unprecedented assertions of power to go completely unchecked        I was saddened to hear Judge Mukasey say that he apparently would      not support habeas corpus rights for detainees  rejecting a core      legal right and a basic American value which Senator Specter and I      have fought so hard to restore  I was disappointed to see him echo      in response to my questions the same administration policy on      extraordinary rendition that has led to several disgraceful episodes      for this Nation and fail to commit even to review the case of Maher      Arar  a prominent and disturbing episode of rendition        Which brings me back to the issue that came to dominate the      consideration of this nomination  the issue of torture  The United      States does not torture  The United States does not inflict cruel       inhuman  and degrading treatment  This is part of the moral fiber of      our country and our historical place as a world leader on human      rights  and it has long been fixed in our laws  our Constitution       and our values        That is why I was so saddened when Judge Mukasey  given repeated      opportunities  refused to say that the ancient and extreme technique      of waterboarding  a brutal practice in which a person is subjected      to simulated drowning  is illegal  There may be interrogation      techniques that require close examination and extensive briefings       Waterboarding is not among them  Judge Mukasey does not need a      classified briefing to learn about waterboarding  He could go to the      library to read about waterboarding that was done as far back as the      Spanish Inquisition  or about American prosecutions of Japanese war      criminals for waterboarding after World War II  Evan Wallach  a      judge at the U S  Court of International Trade  a professor who      teaches the law of war  and a former JAG officer  wrote an      insightful column in last Sunday s Washington Post that I ask      unanimous consent be printed in the Record        There being no objection  the material was ordered to be printed in      the Record  as follows        Waterboarding Used To Be a Crime        By Evan Wallach        As a JAG in the Nevada National Guard  I used to lecture the      soldiers of the 72nd Military Police Company every year about their      legal obligations when they guarded prisoners  I d always conclude      by saying    I know you won t remember everything I told you today       but just remember what your mom told you  Do unto others as you      would have others do unto you    That s a pretty good standard for      life and for the law  and even though I left the unit in 1995  I      like to think that some of my teaching had carried over when the      72nd refused to participate in misconduct at Iraq s Abu Ghraib      prison        Sometimes  though  the questions we face about detainees and      interrogation get more specific  One such set of questions relates      to   waterboarding          That term is used to describe several interrogation techniques  The      victim may be immersed in water  have water forced into the nose and      mouth  or have water poured onto material placed over the face so      that the liquid is inhaled or swallowed  The media usually      characterize the practice as   simulated drowning    That s      incorrect  To be effective  waterboarding is usually real drowning      that simulates death  That is  the victim experiences the sensations      of drowning  struggle  panic  breath holding  swallowing  vomiting       taking water into the lungs and  eventually  the same feeling of not      being able to breathe that one experiences after being punched in      the gut  The main difference is that the drowning process is halted       According to those who have studied waterboarding s effects  it can      cause severe psychological trauma  such as panic attacks  for years            The United States knows quite a bit about waterboarding  The U S       government  whether acting alone before domestic courts  commissions      and courts martial or as part of the world community  has not only      condemned the use of water torture but has severely punished those      who applied it        After World War II  we convicted several Japanese soldiers for      waterboarding American and Allied prisoners of war  At the trial of      his captors  then Lt  Chase J  Nielsen  one of the 1942 Army Air      Forces officers who flew in the Doolittle Raid and was captured by      the Japanese  testified    I was given several types of torture             I was given what they call the water cure    He was asked what      he felt when the Japanese soldiers poured the water    Well  I felt      more or less like I was drowning    he replied    just gasping      between life and death          Nielsen s experience was not unique  Nor was the prosecution of his      captors  After Japan surrendered  the United States organized and      participated in the International Military Tribunal for the Far      East  generally called the Tokyo War Crimes Trials  Leading members      of Japan s military and government elite were charged  among their      many other crimes  with torturing Allied military personnel and      civilians  The principal proof upon which their torture convictions      were based was conduct that we would now call waterboarding        In this case from the tribunal s records  the victim was a prisoner      in the Japanese  occupied Dutch East Indies        A towel was fixed under the chin and down over the face  Then many      buckets of water were poured into the towel so that the water      gradually reached the mouth and rising further eventually also the      nostrils  which resulted in his becoming unconscious and collapsing      like a person drowned  This procedure was sometimes repeated 5 6      times in succession        The United States  like Britain  Australia and other Allies  pursued      lower ranking Japanese war criminals in trials before their own      tribunals  As a general rule  the testimony was similar to      Nielsen s  Consider this account from a Filipino waterboarding      victim        Q  Was it painful        A  Not so painful  but one becomes unconscious  Like drowning in the      water        Q  Like you were drowning        A  Drowning   you could hardly breathe        Here s the testimony of two Americans imprisoned by the Japanese       They would lash me to a stretcher then prop me up against a table      with my head down  They would then pour about two gallons of water      from a pitcher into my nose and mouth until I lost consciousness       And from the second prisoner  They laid me out on a stretcher and      strapped me on  The stretcher was then stood on end with my head      almost touching the floor and my feet in the air        They then      began pouring water over my face and at times it was almost      impossible for me to breathe without sucking in water        As a result of such accounts  a number of Japanese prison camp      officers and guards were convicted of torture that clearly violated      the laws of war  They were not the only defendants convicted in such      cases  As far back as the U S  occupation of the Philippines after      the 1898 Spanish American War  U S  soldiers were court martialed      for using the   water cure   to question Filipino guerrillas        More recently  waterboarding cases have appeared in U S  district      courts  One was a civil action brought by several Filipinos seeking      damages against the estate of former Philippine president Ferdinand      Marcos  The plaintiffs claimed they had been subjected to torture       including water torture  The court awarded  766 million in damages       noting in its findings that   the plaintiffs experienced human      rights violations including  but not limited to       the water      cure  where a cloth was placed over the detainee s mouth and nose       and water producing a drowning sensation          In 1983  federal prosecutors charged a Texas sheriff and three of      his deputies with violating prisoners  civil rights by forcing      confessions  The complaint alleged that the officers conspired to        subject prisoners to a suffocating water torture ordeal in order      to coerce confessions  This generally included the placement of a      towel over the nose and mouth of the prisoner and the pouring of      water in the towel until the prisoner began to move  jerk  or      otherwise indicate that he was suffocating and or drowning          The four defendants were convicted  and the sheriff was sentenced to      10 years in prison        We know that U S  military tribunals and U S  judges have examined      certain types of water based interrogation and found that they      constituted torture  That s a lesson worth learning  The study of      law is  after all  largely the study of history  The law of war is      no different  This history should be of value to those who seek to      understand what the law is  as well as what it ought to be        Mr  LEAHY  More than 100 years ago  in 1901 and 1902  U S  military      commissions charged American officers with waterboarding detainees      in the Philippines  and President Theodore Roosevelt wrote        Great as the provocation has been in dealing with foes who      habitually resort to treachery  murder and torture against our men       nothing can justify the use of torture or inhuman conduct of any      kind on the part of the American Army        This country s abhorrence for cruel treatment of detainees goes back      further still to General George Washington who wrote of captured      troops during the Revolutionary War        Treat them with humanity  and let them have no reason to complain of      our copying the brutal example of the British Army in their      treatment of our unfortunate brethren        Those are American standards and American values that should not be      compromised        As RADM John Hutson  former Judge Advocate General of the Navy       testified to the Judiciary Committee        Other than perhaps the rack and thumbscrews  water boarding is the      most iconic example of torture in history  It has been repudiated      for centuries  It s a little disconcerting to hear now that we re      not quite sure where water boarding fits in the scheme of things  I      think we have to be very sure where it fits in the scheme of things            Judge Mukasey acknowledged that  in evaluating interrogation      techniques  we look to standards such as whether the conduct        shocks the conscience    whether it is   outrageous    or whether      it is   for the purpose of humiliating and degrading the detainee         He was unwilling  though  to say that waterboarding meets these      standards  To me  it is not a hard call that waterboarding shocks      the conscience  that it is outrageous  that it humiliates and      degrades detainees  I do not believe that the question whether      waterboarding is illegal is subject to a balancing test  It is       Indeed  it is that kind of   balancing test   that has allowed this      President to claim the discretion to commit so many abuses that have      brought such disgrace on this great country        Senator McCain  who knows too much about the issue of torture  said      recently        Anyone who knows what waterboarding is could not be unsure  It is a      horrible torture technique used by Pol Pot and being used on      Buddhist monks as we speak  People who have worn the uniform and had      the experience know that this is a terrible and odious practice and      should never be condoned in the U S  We are a better nation than      that        I agree        Nothing is more fundamental to our constitutional democracy than our      basic notion that no one is above the law  This administration has      undercut that precept time after time  They are now trying to do it      again  with an issue as fundamental as whether the United States of      America will join the ranks of those governments that approve of      torture  That is why I will vote no on the President s nomination            Mr  President  I reserve the remainder of my time
