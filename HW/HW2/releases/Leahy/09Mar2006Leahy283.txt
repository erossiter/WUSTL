Thursday  March 9  2006        Rumsfeld Finally Yields Some Answers     To Leahys Questions     On Pentagons Database Entries About Vermonters  NOTE  The Leahy Rumsfeld      correspondence  including todays new letter from the Defense      Department  is all   along with a transcript of todays Leahy Rumsfeld      exchange on this at todays Appropriations Committee hearing        It took three pointed letters and the spotlight of a high profile      hearing on Capitol Hill  but after nearly three months Senator      Patrick Leahy has finally gotten answers hes been seeking about a      Defense Department database and its entries about Vermont anti war      activists   Leahy asked Defense Secretary Donald      Rumsfeld about the issue Thursday at a hearing by the Senate      Appropriations Committee  the panel that handles the Senates work      in writing the Defense Departments budget bills    where Leahy is a      senior member          Shortly after the Leahy Rumsfeld exchange at the hearing  a letter      from the secretarys office was delivered to Leahy  containing far      more answers than did earlier responses      Leahy began his inquiries after NBC      News last December revealed that a Pentagon program  intended to      alert defense officials to actual threats to military property and      personnel  actually has logged entries about peaceful groups       According to NBC  the organizations include Quakers in Florida  The      news account said entries in the system also included some from      Vermont   Leahy has written three letters to      Secretary Rumsfeld asking about the program and about any entries      involving Vermonters  He has sent three letters in all  on December      21  January 27 and February 17     Leahy says the earlier replies by Department of      Defense  DOD  officials to his letters have been largely      unresponsive to his detailed questions  Leahys last letter gave      the defense secretary a deadline of March 15    In the new letter  Deputy Under      Secretary of Defense Robert W  Rogalski tells Leahy that the Defense      Department did not conduct any investigations of the domestic      activities of Vermonters and did not target any groups in Vermont      for the collection of intelligence  Rogalski said DOD did receive      two reports from the Department of Homeland Security about protests      against DOD recruiters by Vermont groups  which prompted reports      that were entered on the TALON Reporting System  created in 2003 to      document  share and analyze unfiltered information about suspicious      incidents related to possible foreign terrorist threats to DOD        The letter spells out several actions      that have been taken since the NBC and Leahy inquiries to correct      problems with the TALON program and its related Cornerstone      database  According to the letter  a small number of TALON      reports  dealing with domestic anti military protests or      demonstrations potentially impacting DOD facilities or personnel       were found that did not meet established criteria and that should      not have been retained in the Cornerstone database  The letter said      they now have been removed   The letter discloses that the      Cornerstone database also contained 15 additional TALON reports      relating to suspicious activity in Vermont that had been reported to      DOD by concerned citizens  DOD personnel or civilian law enforcement      agencies  and that three were later removed after determining no      link to possible terrorist activity    Defense officials  according to the      letter  have now also completed a nationwide review of the TALON      database and identified 186 protests and 43 named individuals in      related reports that should not have been entered  The letter said      only one of them concerned an anti war protests in Vermont in which      a person was named  All reports concerning demonstrations  protests      or other anti war related activities  including those that contained      U S  person names  have been purged    Also in the wake of the NBC and Leahy      inquiries  the TALON Cornerstone rules have been clarified and new      guidance given to personnel who deal with the program     Reaction Comment from Senator Patrick      Leahy       It should not have to take this much effort to get answers  but Im      glad to finally have them  It is also encouraging to know that this      episode has led to clarification of the rules and to new training in      those rules    Somewhere between governments      legitimate security needs and the American peoples right to privacy      is a proper balance when it comes to the sensitive issue of the use      of databases and data mining  The rules that protect against abuse      need to be clear  and the rules need to be followed  Congressional      oversight helps find and enforce the right balance  but oversight by      the current Congress has been lacking to the point of negligence       Vigilant oversight helps keep abuses from creeping back into the      system  and Ill continue to do my part
