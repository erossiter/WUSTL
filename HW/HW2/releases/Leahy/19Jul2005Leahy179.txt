       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Presiden ts Nomination of Judge   John  G  Roberts  Jr                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Presidents Nomination Of John G  Roberts Jr      To The U S  Supreme Court     Tuesday  July 19  2005  The President has announced his      choice  Now the Senate must rise to the challenge and do its work       To fulfill our constitutional duties we need to consider this      nomination as thoroughly and carefully as the American people      deserve  That will take time and the cooperation of the nominee and      the Administration  That will take Republicans as well as Democrats      taking seriously our constitutional obligations on behalf of the      American people    We need to ensure that the Supreme      Court remains a protector of all Americans rights and liberties      from government intrusion and that the Supreme Court understands the      role of Congress in passing legislation to protect ordinary      Americans from abuse by powerful special interests  No one is      entitled to a free pass to a lifetime appointment to the Supreme      Court  There are far different considerations for circuit court      nominations than for those to the Supreme Court  How the nominee      views precedent  what the nominee regards as settled law  and how      the nominee will exercise the incredible power of a Supreme Court      Justice to be the final arbiter of the meaning of the Constitution       all of these raise very different considerations than those weighed      for the lower courts    Justice Sandra Day OConnor is a      model justice  She brought a fair and open mind to the bench and      decided cases without a political agenda  She is widely respected      as a jurist of common sense and practical values who brought no      agenda  from the right or the left  She did not prejudge cases  I      regret that the extreme right has been so critical of her and was so      adamantly opposed to her successor sharing her judicial philosophy      and qualities    The Constitution calls on the Senate      to dutifully examine nominations to the courts  not to rubber stamp      them  I look forward to hearings that will inform the Senate and      the American people in making the Senates confirmation decision   I will continue to work with Chairman      Specter as our committee prepares for the confirmation process      ahead  It will take sufficient time and a great deal of hard work      for the committee to prepare for these hearings  We want a process      that is fair to both the nominee and to the American people     Ours is a nation based on the rule of      law  and the test of a good judge is his or her ability to fairly      apply the law  As I evaluate candidates for lifetime appointments      to the federal bench that often will span not merely years but      decades and sometimes eras  I want to make sure that every person      who comes before the court will know and feel that they will be      treated fairly  That is the basic test that I will apply again  as      this confirmation proceeding goes forward
