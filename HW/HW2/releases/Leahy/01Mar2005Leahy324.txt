become a serious fraud on consumers        and on online commerce costing billions of dollars a year           ___________________________          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Introduction Of The Anti Phishing Act Of 2005        Monday  February 28  2005 Today I am introducing a        bill  the Anti Phishing Act of 2005  which targets a serious threat to the        security of the Internet  Phishing is a rapidly        growing class of identity theft scams on the Internet that is causing both        short term losses and long term economic damage  In the short term  these        scams defraud individuals and financial institutions  Estimated losses        from phishing attacks are now in the billions of dollars  and those losses        are growing  The short term losses  however  are just a chapter in a        larger story  In the long term  phishing undermines the publics trust in        the Internet  By making consumers uncertain about the integrity of the        Internets complex addressing system  phishing threatens to make us all        less likely to use the Internet for secure transactions  If you cant        trust where you are on the web  you are less likely to use it for commerce        and communications  Those well versed in        popular culture may guess that phishing was named after the phenomenally        popular Vermont band  Phish  But phishing over the Internet was in fact        named from the sport of fishing  as an analogy for its technique of luring        Internet prey with convincing email bait  The F is replaced by a P H        in keeping with a computer hacker tradition   Phishing attacks usually        start with emails that are  in Internet jargon  spoofed  That is  they        are made to appear to be coming from some trusted financial institution or        commercial entity  The spoofed email usually asks the victim to go to a        website to confirm or renew private account information  These emails        offer a link that appears to take the victim to the website of the trusted        institution  In fact the link takes the victim to a phony website that is        visually identical to that of the trusted institution  but is in fact run        by the criminal  When the victim takes the bait and sends their account        information  the criminal uses it  sometimes within minutes  to transfer        the victims funds or to make purchases  Phishers are the new con artists        of cyberspace  Phishing is on the        rise  The Anti Phishing Working Group reports that the number of new        phishing messages climbed at a monthly rate of 38 percent in the last six        months of 2004  The number of new phishing websites has climbed 24 percent        per month since last August  And phishing attacks are increasingly        sophisticated  Early phishing attacks were by novices  but there is now        evidence that some attacks are backed by organized crime  Some of the        attacks these days also include spyware  a type of software that is        secretly installed on the victims computer to surreptitiously capture        account information when the victim visits legitimate websites  In addition  the        Internet faces the threat of pharming  This insidious crime does not        rely on email bait  Rather  it attacks web browsers and the Internets        addressing system  The effect is that even individuals who type a desired        Internet destination into their web browser may be redirected to a phony        web site  with the same disastrous result as clicking on the phony link in        a phishing attack  Some phishers and        pharmers can be prosecuted under wire fraud or identity theft statutes  but        often these prosecutions take place only after someone has been defrauded         For most of these criminals  that leaves plenty of time to cover their        tracks  It has been reported that the average phishing website is active        on the Internet for less than six days  Moreover  the mere threat of these        attacks undermines everyones confidence in the Internet  When people        cannot trust that websites are what they appear to be  they will not use        the Internet for their secure transactions  Traditional wire fraud and        identity theft statutes are not sufficient to respond to phishing and        pharming   The Anti Phishing Act of        2005 protects the integrity of the Internet in two ways  First  it        criminalizes the bait  It makes it illegal to knowingly send out spoofed        email that links to sham websites with the intention of committing a        crime  Second  it criminalizes the sham websites that are the true scene        of both types of crime   There are  of course         important First Amendment concerns to be protected  The Anti Phishing Act        protects parodies and political speech from being prosecuted as Phishing         We have worked closely with various public interest organizations to ensure        that the Anti Phishing Act does not impinge on the important democratic        role that the Internet plays   To many Americans         phishing and pharming are new words  They are certainly a new form of an        old crime  They are also very serious  and we need to act aggressively to        keep them from eroding the publics trust in online commerce and        communication  I look forward to working with others in the Senate in        addressing this growing threat to the Internet with effective and        responsible action                            See following fact sheet for more information        The Anti Phishing Act Of 2005       Fact Sheet     The Anti Phishing Act         of 2005  introduced in the U S  Senate on February 28 by Sen  Patrick         Leahy  D Vt    is intended to combat a rapidly growing Internet scam         called phishing  Phishers are con artists in cyberspace  Phishing         refers to a popular Internet scam in which the victim receives an email         that appears to come from a trusted source such as a financial         institution  and that asks for certain personal information  The email         typically includes a hyperlink that appears to take the victim to the         website of that financial institution  but which is actually a sham site         Any personal information        entered is stolen and used  sometimes within minutes  for unlawful        purposes such as transferring funds or purchasing goods  Phishing is        growing exponentially  In the last few years alone  the estimated losses        have exceeded billions of dollars  and the losses continue to mount  In        addition  the Leahy bill responds to the threat of pharming  This        insidious crime attacks web browsers and the Internets addressing system         The effect is that even individuals who type a desired Internet destination        into their web browser may be redirected to a phony web site  with the same        disastrous result as clicking on the phony link in a phishing attack         Moreover  current law does not adequately respond to these problems         Neither phishing nor pharming always fit neatly into traditional wire fraud        and identity theft statutes  Neither wire fraud nor identity theft        statutes protect against one of the greatest harms caused by phishing and        pharming  a diminished trust in the Internets system of addressing and        linking Trust in this system is crucial to the Internet fulfilling its        potential as a medium for all manner of secure communications  The Anti Phishing Act of        2005 would enter two new crimes into the U S  Code  The first prohibits        the creation or procurement of a website that represents itself to be that        of a legitimate business  and that attempts to induce the victim to divulge        personal information  with the intent to commit a crime of fraud or        identity theft  The second prohibits the creation or procurement of an        email that represents itself to be that of a legitimate business  and that        attempts to induce the victim to divulge personal information  with the        intent to commit a crime of fraud or identity theft   In order to protect        important First Amendment concerns  the Leahy bill carefully protects        speech    even speech that may be deceptive  such as the innocent parodying        of commercial websites for political commentary  The bill protects such        important speech by including the requirement that the actor must have the        specific criminal purpose of committing a crime of fraud or identity theft
