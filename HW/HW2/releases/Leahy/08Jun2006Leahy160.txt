       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations       June 8  2006  Today the Senate will confirm four       lifetime appointments to United States District Courts  Noel       Hillman and Peter Sheridan  who have been nominated to seats on       the U S  District Court for the District of New Jersey  and       Thomas Ludington and Sean Cox  who have been nominated to seats       on the U S  District Court for the Eastern District of       Michigan  They are all nominees who have the support of       Democratic home state Senators    I am glad the Republican       leadership has taken notice of the fact that  as I discussed       earlier this week  these nominees have been ready for action for       some time  since being reported unanimously last month  I also       look forward to working with the Republican leadership to       schedule debate and consideration of Sandra Segal Ikuta  who has       been nominated to a seat on the U S  Court of Appeals for the       Ninth Circuit  and Andrew Guilford to be a District Judge for       the Central District of California who also have the support of       Democratic home state Senators and could also be easily       confirmed  When they are considered  and I hope the Republican       leadership will agree to do that next week and not delay  we       will have confirmed 250       of President Bushs nominees to lifetime appointments on the       federal courts    As I noted earlier this week  the       nominees we are considering today could have been confirmed       earlier if the Republican leadership had chosen to proceed with       them instead of pressing forward first with the controversial       nomination of Brett Kavanaugh and the divisive debate over a       constitutional amendment that had no chance of passing  I do       commend the Republican Senate leadership for wisely passing over       the controversial nominations of William Gerry Myers III        Terrence W  Boyle and Norman Randy Smith to turn to these       nominations today  In the course of an hour or two this week       the Senate will confirm five lifetime appointments to the       federal courts  Debate on those flawed nominations will take       much longer  The Republican leadership is right to have avoided       such controversial nominations that were only reported on a       party line vote    During the 17 months I was       Chairman of the Judiciary Committee and the Senate was under       Democratic control  we confirmed 100 of President Bushs       nominees  After today  in the last 17 months under Republican       control  the Senate will have confirmed 43    Regrettably  rather than fill       judicial vacancies with qualified nominees  the Republican       leadership seems all too often more focused on picking fights        Last month they forced debate on the controversial nomination of       a White House insider selected for a lifetime position on the       D C  Circuit as a reward for his loyalty to President Bush  I       did not support confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh  That was the       fight that the Republican leader had promised the narrow special       interest groups of the right wing of his party     The President and Senate       Republican leadership continue to pick fights over judicial       nominations rather than focus on filing vacancies  This is part       of their partisan effort to agitate conservative voters no       doubt  They are willing to play politics with the Constitution       and with the courts  They treat the Constitution as a billboard       for campaign posters and political ads    Judicial vacancies have now grown       to nearly  50 from the lowest vacancy rate in       decades  More than half these vacancies are without a nominee        The Congressional Research Service has recently released a study       showing that this President has been the slowest in decades to       make circuit court nominations and the Republican Senate among       the slowest to act  If they would concentrate on the needs of       the courts  our federal justice system and the needs of the       American people  we would be much further along     This week we passed a milestone        confirming the 17th judicial nominee this session        That was the total number of judges confirmed in the 1996       congressional session  when Republicans controlled the Senate       and stalled the nominations of President Clinton  In the 1996       session  however  Republicans would not confirm a single       appellate court judge  All 17 confirmations were district court       nominees  That is the only session I can remember in which the       Senate has simply refused to consider a single appellate court       nomination  That was part of their pocket filibuster strategy       to stall and maintain vacancies so that a Republican President       could pack the courts and tilt them decidedly to the right  In       the important D C  Circuit  the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh       was the culmination the       Republicans decade long attempt to pack the D C  Circuit that       began with the stalling of Merrick Garlands nomination in 1996       and continued with the blocking of President Clintons other       well qualified nominees  Elena Kagan and Allen Snyder     If the Republican leadership will       work with us to schedule Sandra Segal Ikutas nomination for       consideration and a vote  we are likely to add another circuit       court confirmation to that total  I only wish President       Clintons nominees had received the same treatment   The road ahead is likely to be       rocky  In the run up to the Kavanaugh nomination debate  we saw       that the  Senate Republican leadership is apparently heeding the       advice of The Wall Street       Journal editorial page  which wrote   a  filibuster       fight would be exactly the sort of political battle Republicans       need to energize conservative voters after their recent months       of despond  Rich Lowery  editor of the conservative  National Review        listed a fight over judges as one of the ways President Bush       could revive his political fortunes  writing that he should         p ush for the confirmation of his circuit judges that are       pending  Talk about them by name  The G O P  wins judiciary       fights    Republican Senators are relishing       picking fights over controversial judicial nominees  Senator       Thune has said  A good fight on judges does nothing but       energize our base         Right now our folks are feeling a       little flat  Senator Cornyn has said  I think this is       excellent timing  From a political standpoint  when we talk       about judges  we win  On  May       8  2006  The New York Times       reported  Republicans are itching for a good election year       fight  Now they are about to get one  a reprise of last years       Senate showdown over judges   The Washington Post       reported on May 10  Republicans had revived debate on Kavanaugh       and another Bush appellate nominee  Terrence Boyle  in hopes of       changing the pre election subject from Iraq  high gasoline       prices and bribery scandals    We should not stand idly by as             Republicans  choose to use lifetime federal       judgeships for partisan political advantage  In a May 11  2006        editorial The Tennessean       wrote      T he nation should look with       complete dismay at the blatantly political angle on nominations       being advocated by Senate Republicans now        Republicans are       girding for a fight on judicial nominees for no reason other       than to be girding for a fight  They have admitted as much in       public comments        In other words  picking a public fight       over judicial nominees is  in their minds  the right thing to do       because its the politically right thing to do        Now        Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political       purposes  The appointment of judges deserves far more respect       than to be an admitted election year ploy        It should be       beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to       nothing but a tool for political gain   On  May       3  2006  The New York Times      wrote in an editorial  The Republicans have long       used judicial nominations as a way of placating the far right of       their party  and it appears that with President Bush sinking in       the polls  they now want to offer up some new appeals court       judges to their conservative base   Consider the Presidents       nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the Fourth Circuit  We       have learned from recent news reports that  as a sitting United       States District Judge and while a circuit court nominee  Judge       Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he       held investments  In at least one instance  he is alleged to       have bought General Electric stock while presiding over a       lawsuit in which General Electric was accused of illegally       denying disability benefits to a long time employee  Two months       later  he ruled in favor of GE and denied the employees claim       for long term and pension disability benefits  Whether or not it       turns out that Judge Boyle broke federal law or canons of       judicial ethics  these types of conflicts of interest have no       place on the federal bench  Certainly  they should not be       rewarded with a promotion to the Fourth Circuit  Certainly  they       should be investigated         The President should heed the call of North Carolina Police       Benevolent Association  the North Carolina Troopers       Association  the Police Benevolent Associations from South       Carolina and Virginia  the National Association of Police       Organizations  the Professional Fire Fighters and Paramedics of       North Carolina  as well as the advice of Senator Salazar and       former Senator John Edwards  and withdraw his ill advised       nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle  Law enforcement from   North Carolina and law enforcement       from across the country oppose the nomination  Civil rights       groups oppose the nomination  Those knowledgeable and respectful       of judicial ethics oppose this nomination  This nomination has       been pending on the calendar in the Republican controlled Senate       since June of last year when it was forced out of the Committee       on a party line vote  It should be withdrawn     Also on the calendar is the       nomination of William Myers to the Ninth Circuit  This is       another Administration insider and lobbyist whose record has       made him extremely controversial  I opposed this nomination       when it was considered by the Judiciary Committee in March 2005        He was a nominee who the so called Gang of 14 expressly listed       as someone for whom they made no commitment to vote for cloture        and with good reason  His anti environmental record is reason       enough to oppose his confirmation  His lack of independence is       another  If anyone sought to proceed to this nomination  there       would be a need to explore his connections with the lobbying       scandals associated with the Interior Department and Jack       Abramoff  This nomination should also be withdrawn     A few months ago  the President       withdrew the nomination of Judge James Payne to the Court of       Appeals for the 10th Circuit after information became public       about that nominees rulings in a number of cases in which he       appears  like Judge Boyle  to have had conflicts of interest        Those conflicts were pointed out not by the Administrations       screening process or by the  ABA        but by journalists         Judge Payne joins a long list of nominations by this President       that have been withdrawn  Among the more well known are Bernard       Kerik to head the Department of Homeland Security and Harriet       Miers to the Supreme Court  It was  as I recall  reporting in a       national magazine that doomed the Kerik nomination  It was       opposition within the Presidents own party that doomed the       Miers nomination    During the last few months        President Bush also withdrew the nominations of Judge Henry Saad       to the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit and Judge Daniel P        Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan after his   ABA rating was downgraded     It is not as if we have not been       victimized before by the White Houses poor vetting of important       nominations  If the White House had its way  we would already       have confirmed Claude Allen to the Fourth Circuit  He is the       Bush Administration insider who recently resigned his position       as a top domestic policy adviser to the President  Ultimately       we learned why he resigned when he was arrested for fraudulent       conduct over an extended period of time  Had we Democrats not       objected to the White House attempt to shift a circuit judgeship       from Maryland to Virginia  someone now the subject of a criminal       prosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores       would be a sitting judge on the Fourth Circuit confirmed with a       Republican rubberstamp    Yet another controversial pending       nomination is that of Norman Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit        This nomination is another occasion on which this President is       seeking to steal a circuit court seat from one State and       reassign it to another one  one with Republican Senators  That       is wrong  I support Senators Feinstein and Boxer in their       opposition to this tactic  I have suggested a way to resolve       two difficult situation if the President were to renominate Mr        Smith to fill the Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit  instead of       a vacancy for a California seat  Regrettably  the White House       has not followed up on my suggestion         A complicit Republican controlled Senate remains all too eager       to act as a rubberstamp for the Bush Cheney Administration  The       nomination of Kavanaugh was one of the few to be downgraded by       the  ABA upon further review  Until the       Republican controlled Senate proceeded to confirm this White       House insider  I cannot recall anyone being confirmed after such       a development  Another first  and another problematic       confirmation that ill serves the American people   Another troubling nomination is       that of William James Haynes to the Fourth Circuit  which has       been pending in the Republican controlled Senate without action       for three years  Mr  Haynes is the General Counsel at the       Defense Department and was deeply involved developing the       torture policies  detention and interrogation policies  military       tribunals and other controversial aspects of the manner in which       this Administration has proceeded unilaterally to make mistakes       and exceed its legal authority  Concerns about the Haynes       nomination may not be confined to Democratic Senators  according       to recent press reports   I trust that the Senate will not       repeat the mistake it made before  It was only after Jay Bybee       was confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit       that we learned of his involvement with the infamous Bybee memo       seeking to justify torture and degrading treatment  I had asked       him what he had worked on while head of the Department of       Justices Office of Legal Counsel  but he had refused to       respond  This former Defense Department and Justice Department       insider now sits on the Ninth Circuit for life     Finally  there is the more recent       nomination of Michael Wallace to a vacancy on the Fifth       Circuit  Mr  Wallace received the first  ABA       rating of unanimously not qualified that I have seen for a       circuit court nominee since President Reagan  Yet that is one       of the controversial nominations we can expect the Republican       Senate to target for action given their track record     One of the most important checks       and balances to unprecedented overreaching by the Bush Cheney       Executive branch is an independent judiciary  I have sought to       expedite consideration of qualified  consensus nominees and       urged the President to work with us to make selections that       unite all Americans  When the White House fails to make those       kind of selections  I hope that the Republican controlled Senate       will stop rubberstamping this them and stop using controversial       judicial nominations to score partisan political points  Our       courts are too important  The rights and liberties of the       American people are too important  The courts are the only       check and balance left to protect the American people and       provide some oversight of the actions of this President
