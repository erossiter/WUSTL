       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Scheduling Of A Committee Vote On   The Nomination Of Judge Samuel Alito To The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Scheduling Of A Committee Vote     On The Nomination Of      Judge Samuel Alito To The Supreme Court      January 16  2006 In our      conversations over this weekend  Chairman Specter and I reached an      agreement regarding how the Committee should proceed to      consideration of the Alito nomination  We agreed to proceed on      Tuesday  January 24  This allows all Senators  Republicans and      Democrats to conclude Martin Luther King  Jr  holiday events      without having to rush back to Washington before the Senate returns      to session  In accordance with our discussion  there is no need to      proceed with a business meeting tomorrow  January 17 This      arrangement accommodates Republicans and Democrats    As we had discussed last Friday  the      only purpose a meeting tomorrow would have served would have been to      hold over the nomination  pursuant to Committee rules and      longstanding practice  I have assured Chairman Specter that no      Democratic Senator will hold the matter over on January 24  He does      not anticipate that any Republican Senator will seek to hold it over      at that time   Finally  once      the nomination is debated and voted upon by the Committee  I expect      floor consideration will begin in accordance with Senate rules and      when the Republican leader  in consultation with the Democratic      leader  chooses to proceed to the matter
