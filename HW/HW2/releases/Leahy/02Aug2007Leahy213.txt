       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Recidivism Reduction And Second   Chance Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Recidivism Reduction And Second Chance Act Of 2007    Executive Business Meeting     August 2  2007 The Committee today turns to the Recidivism     Reduction and Second Chance Act of 2007  I was pleased to again join     Senators Specter  Biden  and Brownback as an original co sponsor of this     legislation  The Second Chance Act is a good first step toward a new     direction in criminal justice that focuses on making America safer by     helping prisoners turn their lives around and become contributing     members of society   In recent years  this Congress and the states have     passed a myriad of new criminal laws creating more and longer sentences     for more and more crimes  As a result  this country sends more and more     people to prison every year  There are currently more than 2 million     people in jail or prison  and there are more than 13 million people who     spend some time in jail or prison each year  Most of these people will     at some point return to our communities  What kind of experience     inmates have in prison  how we prepare them to rejoin society  and how     we integrate them into the broader community when they get out are     issues that profoundly affect the communities in which we live   As a former prosecutor  I believe strongly in     securing tough and appropriate prison sentences for people who break our     laws  But it is also important that we do everything we can to ensure     that  when these people get out of prison  they enter our communities as     productive members of society  so we can start to reverse the dangerous     cycles of recidivism and violence  I hope that the Second Chance Act     will help us begin to break that cycle   The Second Chance Act would fund collaborations     between state and local corrections agencies  nonprofits  educational     institutions  service providers  and families to ensure that offenders     released into society have the resources and support they need to become     constructive members of the community  The bill would require that the     programs supported by these grants demonstrate measurable positive     results  including a reduction in recidivism  We should be supporting     good programs and demanding results for our federal tax dollars  The bill would also set up a task force to     determine ways to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of federal     programs related to prisoner reentry and would authorize additional     programs that would encourage employment of released prisoners  improve     substance abuse treatment programs for prisoners  and assist the     children of prisoners   I want to thank Senator Biden  Senator Specter  and     Senator Brownback for working with me to make a good bill even better      They accepted my suggestion to fix a provision that would have made it     difficult for states without large urban areas to obtain grants  They     also agreed with me that it made sense for victim services agencies to     have a role in administering grants  for victims needs to be     specifically addressed by grants authorized by the bill  and for     safeguards to be added to provisions aiming to integrate families of     offenders in order to ensure that children are protected  Finally  they     worked with me to include an important study of the collateral     consequences of criminal convictions federally and in the States  which     will encourage appropriate policy to help successfully reintegrate     released offenders into society  All of these changes have been     incorporated into the bill   I thank the Vermont Department of Corrections and     the Vermont Center for Crime Victim Services for helping me to identify     these improvements and to make this bill better for the people of     Vermont and the people of America  The Vermont Department of     Corrections strongly supports the Second Chance Act  which gives me     confidence that this legislation represents an important step in making     our country safer  I hope all Senators will support this important     legislation
