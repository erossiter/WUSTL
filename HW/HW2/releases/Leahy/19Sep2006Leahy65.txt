       Hill s National Guard Advocates Hold News Conference To PRotest DOD   Bill s Proposed Decisions On National Guard                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Hills National Guard Advocates      Hold News Conference     To Protest DOD Bills Proposed Decisions On National Guard       Empowerment Steps Likely      To Be Dropped  While Provision Threatening State Control Likely To      Be Added      WASHINGTON  Sept  19   Congressional leaders heading the fight for      National Guard empowerment Tuesday expressed grave disappointment      over the House and Senate conference agreement on the Fiscal Year      2007 Defense Authorization Bill for abandoning the National Guard      empowerment thrust of the Senates version of the bill  The      conference report is also likely to take a sizable step toward      weakening states authority over their Guard units  according to the      congressional leaders who are leading the fight for Guard      empowerment        Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo   and Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the co chairs      of the Senates National Guard Caucus  said the conference      agreement is expected to include a provision making it easier for      the President to declare martial law  stripping state governors of      part of their authority over state National Guard units in domestic      emergencies  The provision is opposed by the National Governors      Association and by key leaders in both the House and Senate  The      conference report is also expected to drop a Senate adopted      provision authored by Bond and Leahy to elevate the status of the      National Guard within the Pentagon       During committee deliberations thus far  negotiators from the House      and Senate Armed Services Committees have dropped a Senate adopted      version of the National Defense Enhancement and National Guard      Empowerment Act of 2006  a bill first introduced in the Senate in      March by Bond and Leahy  The legislation  which was added as an      amendment to the Authorization Bill  would codify the National      Guards prominent role in the nations defense since the September      11th attacks  The legislation  which flowed from several      major reports on the National Guard and homeland security  would      have elevated the Chief of the National Guard Bureau to rank of full      General with four stars  while ensuring that the Deputy Commander of      the United States Northern Command would come from the ranks of the      National Guard        Also expected to be included in the conference report is a widely      opposed provision to allow the President more control over the      National Guard  The conference committee has made changes the      Insurrection Act  which governs when the President can call to      action the National Guard without the consent of state governors to      restore public order  Under the changes  the President would now be      able to invoke the Act during such regular occurring events as a      natural disaster  Because posse comitatus restrictions that      prevent the militarys involvement in law enforcement do not apply      when the Insurrection Act is invoked  the changes would nullify      these long standing laws        This would be a one two punch against Guard empowerment that runs      counter to the Guards needs and the Guards crucial missions  said      Leahy  We can deal with a range of situations at home if the      people and resources of the National Guard remain regularly under      the control of the officials who are closest to managing these      situations  At the same time  the Guard also needs more      institutional muscle to ensure it has the equipment and authorities      it needs to carry out its dual missions  As it stands  this defense      bill would go in exactly the wrong direction   Bond added  Whenever the nation has called      upon the National Guard for support  both at home and abroad  the      Guard has responded in exemplary fashion  The Guard has earned a      promotion and the enhanced authority necessary to be in the huddle      of the Pentagon s senior defense team  Unfortunately that is not      presently the case which is why the legislation we are discussing is      so vital to national security and the ability of the Guard to      promote and protect its key policy provisions and requirements              Remarks Of U S  Senator Patrick      Leahy      Co Chair  Senate National Guard Caucus     News Conference On The National Guard Empowerment Act     Tuesday  September 19  2006 Thank you       General Koper  General Taylor and General Conaway  I appreciate      your joining us today  This petition is so impressive  It speaks      directly to strong desire of our men and women in the National Guard      for a more substantial voice at the highest levels of the Defense      Department  It is also makes clear to those of us on Capitol Hill      that the men and women of the National Guard have expectations for      us  just as we always expect great things from them   The National      Guard has delivered for America  over and over again  The National      Guard has played a crucial role in our national defense at home and      abroad  At the high water mark  the Guard made up almost 40 percent      of the troops on the ground in Iraq  Here at home  the Guard is      being routinely called up to support such diverse missions as      airport and border security and  of course  disaster relief    Regrettably  we      are here because Congress at this critical moment is on the verge of      an outright failure in supporting the National Guard  Reports      continue to trickle out of the conference on the Defense      Authorization Bill that House and Senate leaders plan to drop a      slimmed down version of our National Guard Empowerment Act  which      will give the Guard more of a voice in the upper reaches of the      Pentagon   Compounding this      setback  we also hear that the conferees are ready to adopt changes      to the Insurrection Act  which will make it easier for this or any      future President to use the military to restore domestic order      WITHOUT the consent of the nations governors  To put it another      way  the Defense Authorization Bill will actually encourage the      President to declare federal martial law  something has been done      in only three  three  occasions over the past several      decades   From coast to      coast  the members and leaders of the National Guard are alarmed and      puzzled by these setbacks  and Senator Bond and I could not agree      with them more  The Guard empowerment thrust of this years Defense      Authorization Bill in the Senate was a long awaited reform that      would help ensure that the Guard has the bureaucratic muscle to      match its needs in fulfilling the lengthening list of missions we      are asking the Guard to perform  Our Guard Empowerment initiative      would clear away some of those bureaucratic cobwebs  to help take      advantage of the Guards ability to respond to emergencies at home      quickly  We must end this troubling pattern that the active duty      forces continually raid high priority National Guard programs and      personnel accounts to pay their own bills  We saw that troubling      pattern in action late last year  when the Army and the Air Force      tried to cut the end strength of the National Guard by upward of      17 000 and 14 000  respectively  With more than 70 senators joining      us  Senator Bond and I helped block that decision  but that episode      dramatically showed how the Guard often gets the short end of the      stick in key budget and policy deliberations   At the same time       we certainly do not need to make it easier for Presidents to declare      martial law  Invoking the Insurrection Act and using the military      for law enforcement activities goes against some of the central      tenets of our democracy  It creates needless tension among the      various levels of government  one can easily envision governors and      mayors in charge of an emergency having to constantly look over      their shoulders while someone who has never visited their      communities gives the orders   A bill that began      with such promise in empowering the National Guard now increasingly      appears to be shaping up as a double setback for the Guard  That is      inexplicable  that is indefensible  and that is wrong  The last      thing Congress should be doing is making the National Guards job      more difficult  We urge the Defense Bill conferees to adopt the      Empowerment Bill and drop the ill advised changes to the      Insurrection Act  The Guard is      always there for America  Now the ball is in Congresss court  and      we cannot afford to let our Guard down  Thank you
