       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Vote On The Nomination Of  Alberto Gonzales To Be Attorney General Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT                   Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Vote on the Nomination of Alberto R          Gonzales        To Be Attorney General Of The United States        February 3  2005           MR  LEAHY  Mr  President  this has been  for the         most part  a substantive debate  and a necessary         debate  Though partisans on the other side of the         aisle at times have tried to smear anyone who has         voiced concern about this nomination  anyone who         listened to the statements of those of us who oppose         this nomination know that each of us has praised the         journey that Alberto Gonzales and his family have         taken  As the grandson of immigrants  I have         unbounded respect for all that he and his family         have accomplished   On         Tuesday  the Senate heard from Senators Feinstein          Schumer  Kennedy  Mikulski  Dayton  and         Stabenow  Yesterday  the debate on this side of the         aisle included eloquent and powerful statements by         Senators Byrd  Durbin  Jack Reed and Jeffords  all         articulating their reasons for opposing this         nomination on the merits  No one should be accusing         these Senators of doing anything but their         constitutional duty  Today  we heard  as well  from         Senators Dodd  Obama  Cantwell  Bingaman  Johnson          Levin and Feingold  Each has spoken from conviction         and is voting from conscience   We         have also made time to hear from one of our newer         Democratic Senators  Senator Salazar  regarding the         assurances and commitments he has obtained from the         nominee and on which he is relying  And today he         returned to the floor to make another important         statement that rejected those who have tried to play         a divisive ethnic card  He spoke about the true         meaning of diversity and our national journey toward         equal rights for all  I commend him and thank him         for his remarks   As         Senator Biden observed during the confirmation         hearing  none of us came to that hearing having         determined to vote against this nomination  We         listened  we asked questions  we sought answers  We         reviewed and weighed the record  It was not an easy         decision for any of us  Each of us would have liked         to have supported the first Hispanic nominee to be         Attorney General  We each made a decision on the         merits of the nomination  We did not ignore his         judgments that contributed to the scandals in the         war against terror and the mistreatment of detainees         around the world          When this nomination was announced last year  many         of us were inclined to support Judge Gonzales  As         the confirmation process unfolded  however  one by         one  members of the Judiciary Committee began to         have doubts  Many were troubled by the nominees         refusal to engage with us in an open discussion of         his views on a wide range of issues  For some  the         key question was how Judge Gonzales interprets the         scope of Executive power and his belief that the         President possesses authority to ignore our laws         when acting as Commander in Chief  For others  the         tipping point was the nominees continued adherence         to flawed legal reasoning regarding torture  a         stubborn commitment betraying seriously poor         judgment  Finally  and deeply troubling to many of         us  is the nominees lack of independence from the         President  In the end after serious consideration         of the record  each of us arrived at the same         conclusion    that we could not in good conscience         vote in favor of this nomination  It         is wrong for partisans to castigate Senators for         debating this nomination and for considering the         critical role this nominee played in the development         of legal policies that could not withstand the light         of day  Consistent with my oath of office and my         commitment to the people of Vermont  I will         vote my conscience again today  I urge each and         every Senator to do the same  Review the record            truly review the actions of this nominee over the         last four years    and vote accordingly   I         am not in the business of predicting vote totals but         I will predict this  Democratic Senators will not         vote as a bloc  Some will vote against this         nomination  Some will vote in favor  They will do         so not on the basis of some party caucus position         but as individual Senators  I urge all Senators          Republican  Democrats and Independents  to approach         this vote in that way  on the merits  after         reviewing the record and in good conscience  This         should not be a party line vote on either side of         the aisle  but one where each Senator votes his or         her best judgment          Many Senators here today no doubt believe that the         President is owed a high degree of deference in his         cabinet choices  That does not erase our         constitutional obligations as Senators  We have a         duty to advise and consent  and I take that         responsibility very seriously  The Attorney General         of the United States is unique among cabinet         officers  He or she is the top federal law         enforcement officer in the land  The power and         discretion of the Attorney General is enormous  And         the Attorney General must have sufficient         independence to uphold the law and enforce the law         even if it may serve to embarrass or disadvantage         the President           When Judge Gonzales was designated and appeared in         the White House with the President he offered a very         significant insight into how he views the role of         the Attorney General  He emphasized how much he         looked forward to continuing to work with friends         and colleagues in the White House in a different         capacity on behalf of our President  During his         confirmation hearing  the nominee appeared to         continue serving as a spokesman for the         Administration and its chief defense lawyer on a         wide range of important matters  His defenders here         on the Senate floor have excused his answers by         characterizing them as the views of the         Administration          The Attorney General of the United States         must represent the interests of all Americans and is         the nations chief law enforcement officer  One of         the key questions raised by this nomination is         whether  if confirmed as Attorney General  the         nominee will serve not just this President but all         the American people and whether he will show the         independence necessary to enforce the law  The         Attorney General  perhaps more than any other member         of the Cabinet  is supposed to be there for all of         us  All Americans need to feel that the Attorney         General is looking out for them and protecting their         rights  There will be times when the Attorney         General of the United States has to enforce the law         and cannot be worried about friends  colleagues and         benefactors at the White House          Ultimately  the Attorney Generals duty is to uphold         the Constitution and the rule of law  not labor to         circumvent it  Both the President and the nation         are best served by an Attorney General who gives         sound legal advice and takes responsible action          without regard to political considerations  not         develop legalistic loopholes to serve the ends of a         particular President or Administration           While other members of the cabinet may legitimately         serve as public emissaries for Administration         policies  the Attorney General must interpret and         enforce the laws of this Nation  In so doing  the         Attorney General must serve all Americans  not just         the President  He must follow investigations         wherever they may lead  no matter who is the subject         of investigation or who may be embarrassed by it  I         raised this matter of independence with Judge         Gonzales when he was designated and reiterated it in         a letter I sent to him before his hearing  I ask         that a copy of that letter be included in the         Record           Accordingly  I was not surprised to hear the nominee         repeat back to the Committee that the         responsibilities of the Attorney General differ from         those of a White House counsel  What I did not see         during the hearing is any demonstration that this         nominee had embraced that difference and was acting         on it  Indeed  he deferred to the official policies         of this Administration throughout the Judiciary         Committee proceedings  When asked about the Bybee         memo  he answered  I dont have a disagreement with         the conclusions then reached by the Department  He         articulated a patently false reading of the torture         convention that would allow for foreigners captured         overseas to be subjected to cruel  inhuman and         degrading treatment at the hands of American captors         or surrogates  He appeared to accept the notion         that the President has authority to immunize those         who commit torture under his command   A         letter signed by a number of high ranking former         military officers  including a former head of the         Joint Chiefs  General John Shalikashvili  stated         that         the interrogation policies that Judge Gonzales         helped to define  have fostered greater animosity         toward the  United States  undermined         our intelligence gathering efforts  and added to the         risks facing our troops serving around the world   As         best we can tell  Judge Gonzales rejected the advice         of Secretary Powell and career military officers         when he recommended to the President that the Geneva         Conventions should not apply to the conflict in        Afghanistan  Admiral John D  Hutson  the         former Judge Advocate General of the Navy  testified         to the Judiciary Committee that the advice given by         Judge Gonzales to the President on this point was         shallow in its legal analysis  short sighted in its         implications  and altogether ill advised  Frankly          it was just wrong           These military men are joined in opposition to this         nomination by a large number of organizations          including the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights          the La Raza Centro Legal  and the Mexican American         Political Association  Three leading human rights         organizations  Human Rights Watch  Human Rights         First  and Physicians for Human Rights  none of         which have ever opposed a nomination before  did so         for the very first time  They acknowledge that the         struggle to stamp out torture around the world has         been made harder by the legal positions adopted by         the Bush Administration  including Mr  Gonzales s         refusal to state that a President could not lawfully         order torture  The Congressional Hispanic Caucus         and the Mexican American Legal Defense and         Educational Fund have both issued statements stating         that they cannot support this nomination  I ask         unanimous consent to include in the Record a list of         organizations opposing or not supporting the         nomination           While I have heard partisan attacks from the other         side of the aisle  I have not heard Republicans         offer a strong defense of Judge Gonzales actions         and judgment  What they come back to again and         again is his inspirational life story  Having an         Hispanic American serve as Attorney General is         overdue and something to which I look forward          Having an African American serve as Attorney General         is  likewise  overdue  In his letter to the         Judiciary Committee  retired Major General Melvyn         Montano may have said it best  Judge Gonzales         should be evaluated on his record  not his         ethnicity   At         particular moments in our history  the Senate at its         best can be the conscience of the Nation  The         history books and our children and grandchildren         will look back on these times and make their own         judgments about how worthily the Senate has served         that role as we confront any number of difficult         issues in these challenging times  But I do believe         that  whatever the outcome of this confirmation         proceeding  it is worthy of the Senate that we at         least held this debate  It is worthy of the Senate         that these issues were deemed important enough to         discuss for several days on the floor of the United         States Senate  To have wished them away or to have         just glossed over them would have been a disservice         not only to todays generations of Americans  in and         out of uniform  but also to tomorrows generations         of Americans  And it would have been a disservice         to the Senate that we all so deeply respect    I have deeply believed         that it should concern the Senate that we         have seen departures from our countrys honorable         traditions  practices and established law in the use         of torture  originating at the top ranks of         authority  and emerging at the bottom  At the         bottom of the chain of command  we have seen a few         courts martial          While at the top  we have seen medal ceremonies          pats on the back and promotions     At his recent inaugural         address President Bush spoke eloquent words about         our countrys historic support for freedom  To be         true to that vision  we need a Government that leads         the way in upholding human rights  not one secretly         developing legalistic rationalizations for         circumventing them  We need to climb our way back         to the moral high ground that has distinguished our         great country and that has been an inspiration to         the world          Members of the Senate have a solemn obligation to         uphold the law and to protect the Constitution          Each of us must decide whether or not the nominee         has the sound judgment and the independence required         to serve as the Attorney General of the         United States  I might have been willing to vote         for Judge Gonzales to serve in any number of         different positions in the Government  but in my         view he is not the person for this job  I wish we         could vote for his life story and not for the actual         record  as it unfolded before our hearings  I urge         each Senator to consider the record of this         nomination  I know that each Senator will consult         his or her conscience in reaching a decision  and         that is in keeping with the best traditions of the         Senate
