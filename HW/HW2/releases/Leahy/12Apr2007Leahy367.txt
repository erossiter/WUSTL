       Senate Judiciary Committee Authorizes Chairman Leahy To Issue Subponeas   As Part Of Panel s Ongoing Investigation Into Mass Firings Of Prosecutors                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Senate Judiciary Committee Authorizes    Chairman Leahy   To Issue Subpoenas As Part Of Panels Ongoing Investigation   Into Mass Firings Of    Prosecutors  Panel    Approves Authorization To    Compel White House And   Justice    Dept     Documents  Officials  WASHINGTON  Thursday  April 12    The Senate    Judiciary Committee on Thursday authorized Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt    in consultation with Ranking Member Arlen Specter     R Pa    to issue subpoenas for documents from the White House and the    Department of Justice relating to the panels ongoing investigation into the    mass firings and    replacements of eight prosecutors last year    We continue to seek cooperation from the    Administration as we try to get to the bottom of an apparent abuse of power    that has allowed politics to corrupt federal law enforcement  said Leahy     There remain several obstacles to the ability of the investigating   committees    to learn the truth about what occurred with these firings and why  The    selectivity and incompleteness of the highly redacted set of documents we    have received so far from the Department of Justice present one set of    obstacles   Leahy continued  The refusal of the White House to provide relevant documents    and access to White House staff who played a role in these firings and    replacements are other    obstacles  The announcement by the White House last night that they and    the Republican National Committee have lost an undisclosed number of    relevant emails that political operatives were using on RNC accounts    presents yet another obstacle  I am beginning to wonder whether the White    House has any interest in the American people learning the truth about these    matters   The authorization approved Thursday covers all    documents in the possession  control or custody of the Department of Justice    and the White House related to the committees ongoing investigation     Another authorization for subpoenas was approved by the committee for J     Scott Jennings  Special Assistant to the President and Deputy Director of    Political Affairs  and William E  Moschella  Principal Associate Deputy    Attorney General   The Committee is expected to vote on a similar    authorization next week for Sara M  Taylor  Deputy Assistant to the    President and Director of Political Affairs   Below is Chairman Leahys statement from the    Committees Executive Business Meeting earlier today     Statement Of Senator    Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Committee On The Judiciary   Executive Business Meeting   April 12  2007    Today  the Committee proceeds to consider    authorizations for subpoenas in connection with our investigations into the    mass firings of U S  Attorneys around the country  The Committee is seeking    a more thorough production of relevant documents from the Department of    Justice  documents from the White House and testimony of William Moschella     who is currently at the Department of Justice  and Scott Jennings  who    remains a deputy of Karl Rove at the White House    We continue to seek cooperation from the    Administration as we try to get to the bottom of an apparent abuse of power    that has allowed politics to corrupt federal law enforcement  There remain    several obstacles to the ability of the investigating Committees to learn    the truth about what occurred with these firings and why  The selectivity    and incompleteness of the highly redacted set of documents we have received    so far from the Department of Justice present one set of obstacles  The    refusal of the White House to provide relevant documents and access to White    House staff who played a role in these firings and replacements are others     The announcement by the White House last night that they and the Republican    National Committee have lost an undisclosed number of relevant e mails that    political operatives were using on RNC accounts presents yet another    obstacle  I am beginning to wonder whether the White House has any interest    in the American people learning the truth about these matters     By authorizing subpoenas for documents and for    two more individuals shown to be involved through testimony and documents    obtained in the course of the investigation  the Committee maintains its    flexibility so that we can do a thorough investigation not only into the    firing of the U S  attorneys  but also into the politicization of the entire    process for hiring and firingthem    Next week we are scheduled to hold another    oversight hearing with Attorney General Gonzales  Since his last testimony    before the Committee  we have heard sworn testimony from former United    States Attorneys forced from office and from D  Kyle Sampson  until last    month the Attorney Generals chief of staff  That testimony sharply    contradicted the accounts of the plan to replace U S  Attorneys testified to    by the Attorney General on January 18  2007 and by Deputy Attorney General    McNulty on February 6  2007  as well as the denials of involvement from the    White House and from the Attorney Generals March 13  2007 press    conference    A growing number of Senators  both Republican    and Democratic  have called for the Attorney Generals resignation  Likewise    Members of the House of Representatives and other current and former public    officials  both Republican and Democratic  have called for his resignation     The President determines the standard of conduct  candor  competence and    effectiveness for his Administration  President Bush and his spokespeople    continue to tell the American people that the Attorney General enjoys his    confidence and support  so the Attorney General must represent the standards    this President expects    I want the American people to have a Justice    Department and United States Attorneys offices that enforce the law without    regard to political influence and partisanship  I want the American people    to have confidence in federal law enforcement and I want our federal law    enforcement officers to have the independence they need to be effective and    merit the trust of the American people    What we have heard from the Administration has    been a series of shifting explanations and excuses and a lack of    accountability or acknowledgement of the seriousness of this matter  The    answers to our questions from the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney    General at their hearings earlier this year  as well as statements from    White House spokespeople and other Justice Department officials have been    contradicted by the testimony of the former U  S  Attorneys and the limited    emails and other documents we have obtained from the Department of Justice     Despite the initial denials of White House involvement  it is now apparent    that White House officials were involved in the planning and execution of    the firings  the consideration of replacements  and the subsequent    misleading explanations from Justice officials     Our investigation is an important one and we    should not limit its scope or prejudge its outcome  We need to follow the    facts and get to the truth    We have still received no response from White    House Counsel Fred Fielding to three letters we have sent him since his    unacceptable take it or leave it offer of March 20  That proposal would    unacceptably constrain our ability to investigate and deny the American    people what they want and deserve  namely the public testimony of the White    House staff who were involved in this affair    On March 22  10 Members of this Committee    responded to Mr  Fieldings March 20 letter and invited the White House to    agree to provide the investigating Committees of the Congress  both House    and Senate  with access to witnesses  information and relevant documents     On March 28  House Judiciary Chairman Conyers and I sent a letter to Mr     Fielding asking him to reconsider his all or nothing approach with respect    to documents  He had identified documents that the White House was willing    to provide  and we urged him to provide those documents to us without delay    so as to narrow our dispute and further the investigation     Last Thursday  I sent Mr  Fielding another    letter  asking him to provide us the materials and information about    reviews by the White House staff that have led the President to conclude    publicly that there was no wrongdoing and nothing inappropriate  The White    House cannot have it both ways  If they wanted to remain silent  they    should have  They have not  Instead  they proclaim their conclusion that    based on their internal reviews nothing bad happened but then withhold from    Congress the information  facts  documents and witnesses we need to make    evaluations of the matter    There has been no response to these three    letters  To date  we have received no documents from the White House and no    testimony of any White House personnel   The Washington Post column    earlier this week was correct to note  Fielding    couched his March 20 offer in take it or leave it terms    and then promptly    left    The President acknowledged at his press    conference on March 20 that Congress is examining these questions and the    role the White House played in the resignations of these U S  attorneys     He said that he recognized the importance of our understanding how and why    this decision was made  He indicated that the White House would be making    the relevant White House staff available and providing relevant documents     Despite his indicating that we would be provided with information from the    White House  that has not happened    Despite this lack of cooperation  the    President and White House surrogates assert publicly that there was no    wrongdoing  With all due respect to President Bush  we need to know who was    involved in conducting the reviews by the White House staff  what did they    examine  who did they interview  and what documents did they review in    coming to the conclusion that no one did anything improper  What other    investigations and reviews has the Administration undertaken into this    matter  Who was involved in conducting those investigations and reviews     what did they examine  who did they interview  and what documents did they    review in coming to the conclusion that there is no evidence of wrongdoing     What evidence of wrongdoing has the Administration rejected as not    credible in the course of its investigations and reviews into these    matters    The dismissed U S  attorneys have testified    under oath and said in public that they believe political influence was    applied  They have given chapter and verse and specific examples  If they    are right  that mixing of partisan political goals into federal law    enforcement is highly improper  What has led the Administration to discount    that testimony   What has led it to discount the March 29    testimony of D  Kyle Sampson  former Chief of Staff to the Attorney General     that the Attorney General and White House officials including Karl Rove and    former White House Counsel Harriet Miers were deeply involved in the    decision to fire and replace certain U S  Attorneys  who  according to    internal evaluations and performance reviews  had been doing their jobs    well  The testimony of Mr  Sampson  corroborated by documents released by    the Department  demonstrated that  contrary to the Attorney Generals    statements  Attorney General Gonzales had talked to Mr  Sampson about the    plan to fire prosecutors many times dating back at least two years     beginning after the 2004 election when he was still the White House counsel   What has led it to discount Mr  Sampsons    testimony that Karl Rove complained to the Attorney General about U S     Attorneys not being aggressive enough against voter fraud in three    jurisdictions and that those three names were added to the list of U S     Attorneys targeted for removal  Documents and the testimony of Mr  Sampson    have shown that Mr  Iglesias was held in high regard and even mentioned for    possible promotion to the highest levels of the Department in 2004 and 2005     until late in 2006  At that time  Administration officials received calls    from New Mexico Republican lawmakers upset that Mr  Iglesias would not hurry    an investigation in order to indict Democrats before the 2006 elections     Then Mr  Rove apparently spoke to the Attorney General and David Iglesias    was added to the list for replacement   What has led the Administration to    discount Mr  Sampsons testimony that he had suggested to the White    House that Patrick Fitzgerald be fired and replaced in the middle of the    investigation and prosecution in connection with the leaking of Valerie    Plames identity as an undercover CIA agent  This investigation led to the    conviction of I  Lewis Libby  the former Chief of Staff to the Vice    President  for perjury  lying and obstruction of justice   What has led the Administration to discount    documents showing that discussions began at the highest levels of the    Justice Department about the real problem with Carol Lam  former U S     Attorney for the Southern District of California  immediately following    notice of the expansion of the public corruption probe Ms  Lam was leading    into the activities of Republican Rep  Randy  Duke  Cunningham and other    Republican officials  What about documents and testimony showing that John    McKay  former U S  Attorney for the Western District of Washington  was    highly praised by Mr  Sampson and others in the Administration and supported    by them for a judgeship as late as the summer of 2006  but was included in    the list of people to fire later in 2006  Documents and Mr  McKays    testimony suggest that Republicans were upset with Mr  McKay for his    decision not to intervene in connection with the close 2004 gubernatorial    election in Washington    What about the testimony of Deputy Attorney    General Paul McNulty that former Eastern District of Arkansas U S  Attorney    H E  Bud Cummins  III was removed to make room for Tim Griffin  a former    operative for Karl Rove  Or the documents that demonstrate this was done    over the objection of home state Senators and with an intent to circumvent    Senate confirmation   Those who seek to justify the firings in order    to more vigorously investigate voter fraud have yet to counter the recent    testimony of FBI Director Mueller to the Senate Judiciary Committee that he    was not aware of any voter fraud cases that should have been brought but    were not  nor had any FBI agents or officials brought such complaints to his    attention   This investigation stems from this Committees    jurisdiction and responsibilities to the Senate and the American people     Under the Senates Organizing Resolution and Standing Rules  the Judiciary    Committee has the authority to conduct oversight and investigations related    to the Department of Justice and U S  attorneys offices  We have the    authority to examine whether inaccurate or incomplete testimony was provided    to the Committee  to consider legislation within our jurisdiction  and to    protect our role in evaluating nominations pursuant to the Senates    constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent  Indeed  it was    in light of this jurisdiction  the confirmation power vested in the Senate     and the jurisdiction of this Committee over the review of U S  attorney    nominations  our Ranking Member observed early on that we have primary    responsibility to investigate this matter    I hope that Republicans and Democrats on the    Committee will support these authorizations so that the Committee can    maintain the flexibility to obtain access to the documents and witnesses it    needs to continue with this important investigation and get answers to    important questions
