       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Fiscal Year 2008 State And   Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen      Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Appropriations Subcommittee For State And Foreign Operations    On The Fiscal Year 2008 State And Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill    September 6  2007    Mr  LEAHY  Mr      President  I want to begin my remarks on the Fiscal Year 2008 State and     Foreign Operations bill by thanking Majority Leader Reid and Minority     Leader McConnell for calling up this bill for consideration by the     Senate  With the cooperation of all Senators and a little luck  we can     get it done very quickly   I also want to thank     Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for the allocation our     subcommittee received   I am very appreciative     of Senator Gregg and his staff for the bipartisan way they worked with     me and my staff  This has enabled us to maintain the working     relationship that I had with Senator McConnell during the many years he     chaired this subcommittee  It has once again enabled us to write a     balanced bill that was reported by the Appropriations Committee with the     support of 28 of its 29 members    As a housekeeping matter  I want to remind     all Senators that on August 2  2007  by a vote of 83 14  the Senate     approved S 1  the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007      clearing the measure for the President  When signed by the President      this ethics reform legislation will significantly improve the     transparency and accountability of the legislative process   While the President has not yet acted on that     legislation  I want to inform Senators that we intend to abide by the     requirements of that legislation during the consideration of this bill      The legislation requires that the Chairman of the Committee of     jurisdiction certify that certain information related to congressionally     directed spending be identified and that the required information be     available on a publicly accessible congressional website in a searchable     format at least 48 hours before a vote on the pending bill   The information required includes     identification of the congressionally directed spending and the name of     the Senator who requested such spending  With regard to the pending     legislation  the Committee bill and report do not include any     congressionally directed spending as defined in S  1  A description of     how the Committee addresses this issue is contained in the Committee     report numbered 110 128  dated July 10  2007  and has been available on     the internet for nearly two months   I am submitting for the Record the     certification by the Chairman of the Committee on Appropriations  and I     ask unanimous consent that it be printed at the close of my remarks      Mr  President  Senator     Gregg and I did our best to address the many requests we received from     Members  as well as the Presidents priorities   As always  the bill     falls short in some areas  but that is the nature of the Appropriations     process  We had difficult choices to make  but we tried to treat     everyone fairly  This bill contains a     total of  34 4 billion in budget authority  Although the President has     threatened to veto all appropriations bills that are above his     budget request  this bill is  700 million below the Presidents     fiscal year 2008 budget request  I repeat  this bill is  700 million     below the Presidents budget request  Without taking the time     to go into great detail about the provisions in this bill  I want to     highlight a few issues  The bill provides a     significant increase for State Department and United States embassy     operations and security costs  part of which is to implement the     Secretarys Transformational Diplomacy Initiative  We provide  1 35 billion     for assessed contributions to international peacekeeping missions      These funds support peacekeeping missions the United States Government     has voted for in Sudan  Liberia  the Democratic Republic of Congo      Haiti  Lebanon  and other nations    We provide  5 09 billion to combat HIV AIDS      which is  940 million above the Presidents request  This includes  590     million for the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria      Added to the  300 million in the Labor  Health and Human Services bill      the Senate provides a total of  890 million for the Global Fund  an     increase of  166 million above last years budget   The bill contains  476 5 million for Child     Survival and Maternal Health  These programs address the most basic     public health needs in the worlds poorest countries   We provide  509 million for Educational and     Cultural Exchange Programs  which many Senators requested additional     funding for  particularly to build bridges with predominantly Muslim     countries    This bill supports life saving programs for     millions of destitute refugees and displaced persons in Darfur  Iraq      the Middle East and Colombia  More than 4 million Iraqis have fled     their homes  Many of these people have worked for the United States     Government  U S  contractors  or the U S  news media and are being     targeted because of those affiliations  Other Iraqis are being killed     simply because they are academic scholars or officials of Iraqs     Ministry of Education  We have a moral responsibility to help these     people    There is up to  1 billion in this bill for     humanitarian and reconstruction programs in Afghanistan to help counter     the resurgence of the Taliban and al Qaeda   The bill provides  1 2     billion for the Millennium Challenge Corporation  We support the MCCs     mission  We believe it has significant potential to help countries     whose governments are demonstrating sound fiscal and development     policies   However  the MCC has     disbursed only about  100 million of the  6 billion appropriated     since 2004  With so many other competing demands  we could not     afford to tie up more money for the MCC and also fund the priorities of     Senators and other urgent needs  I do hope and expect that we can find     additional funding for the MCC when we meet with the House in     conference   Senators should know     that there are provisions in this bill concerning international family     planning that the President has said he will veto  That is no surprise      since these provisions are no different from what was contained in past     bills Senator McConnell and I brought to the Senate floor  They are     supported by a majority of Senators  but not enough to override a veto      Again  these same     provisions have been in the State  Foreign Operations bill year     after year  Each year  the President says he will veto the bill because     of them  And each year  they get resolved in conference with the     House  This year will be no exception  Mr  President  I would     remind all Senators  this is a carefully balanced bill  Any amendment     that would add funding to an account or program requires an offset  We     urge all Senators to come to the floor today with any amendments so     Senator Gregg and I can try to resolve them quickly  We want to finish     the bill tomorrow at the latest  For all of the reasons I     have noted and many more  the Senate should pass this bill without     delay   Mr  President  I ask     unanimous consent that the committee amendment be agreed to  that the     bill as thus amended be considered original text for the purpose of     further amendment  and that no points of order be waived by virtue of     this agreement
