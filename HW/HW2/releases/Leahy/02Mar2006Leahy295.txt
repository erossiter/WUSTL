       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  The PATRIOT Act Reauthorization Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     The PATRIOT Act Reauthorization Bill      On His Decision To Vote No      Senate Floor     March 2  2006 Todays vote      marks another stage in reauthorizing the USA PATRIOT Act  Our goal      has always been to mend it  not end it  To that end we passed a      bipartisan bill with better provisions last July after it was      unanimously reported by the Judiciary Committee  After the      House Senate conference was hijacked and Democratic conferees were      excluded while the Bush Cheney Administration and congressional      Republicans wrote the bill  I worked to get that process and the      bill back on track   Working with      Chairman Specter  we were able to make some progress and get some      helpful additions and changes  But the conference report insisted      on by the Bush Cheney Administration and passed by Republican      leaders through the House was still flawed  Last December I worked      with a bipartisan coalition of Senators to oppose final passage of      that conference report and create additional opportunities for      improvements   That led to the      Sununu bill  which is in essence an amendment of the conference      report   I supported      Senator Sununus efforts and voted for that bill  which contained      some improvements I had pushed for  Our effort to protect libraries      from national security letters was very important to me and that is      why I supported Sununus bill in spite of the worsening of the gag      rule provisions insisted upon by the Bush Cheney Administration  Today we turn to      the conference report  Even with the Sununu bill  the conference      report has not been improved sufficiently for me to support it       Just as I opposed it last December  I continue to oppose it  The      bill that the Senate will adopt today falls too far short and      impinges too greatly on the liberties of Americans   The Founders      made a profound choice when they framed the Fourth Amendment to our      Constitution as a measure to ensure the right of the people to be     secure  The Fourth Amendment is  of course  about      guaranteeing our privacy rights and the requirement of a judicial      check on the Government invading our homes  papers and effects  The      Founders saw that as the right to be secure  So do I  I believe      that Americans security includes our national security  our      security from terrorism and also our right to be secure as      Americans  And that means exercising the liberties  rights and      freedoms that define us as Americans   I do not believe      that this bill achieves the balance that we could have and should      have achieved  The final product would have been better had the      Bush Cheney Administration and congressional Republicans not      insisted on locking Democrats out of the negotiations throughout the      process   Still  this      bill  through our efforts  in some ways represents an improvement      with better sunshine and reporting provisions  I worked hard to      include these new provisions because sunshine  coupled with the      sunset provisions  add up to more accountability in the use of these      government powers  But some key provisions remain significantly      flawed  I respect those who conclude that  on balance  the bills      virtues outweigh its vices  I believe we can and should do better       I am one who      worked diligently on the original PATRIOT Act in the days following      the attacks of 9 11  I also voted to reauthorize an improved       bipartisan version of the act back in July of 2005  I joined with      Senator Sununu in leading the effort to ensure that the provisions      did not expire when we were at an impasse last fall   In the PATRIOT Act  we provided      important and valuable tools for the protection of Americans from      terrorism  I have worked and voted to preserve them  I am      disappointed that this conference report represents a missed      opportunity to get it right  to recalibrate the balance better to      respect the liberties and rights of Americans while protecting us      from those who threaten harm   I am concerned       as all Americans are  with our security  We come to work everyday      in a building that was targeted for destruction by al Qaida  I was      the target of a letter laced with deadly anthrax that killed      innocent postal workers  It doesnt hit much closer to home than      that   Many of us have recalled Benjamin      Franklins wise counsel  He was a man involved in a revolution      against King George III  Had it failed  he would have been hanged       Most of those around him would have been hanged  When he was      working to form a government that would respect liberty and protect      people  he cautioned that those who would give up essential      liberties for temporary security deserve neither liberty or      security  We must preserve our essential liberties  The serious bad parts of this bill      are made unacceptable because we currently have an Administration      that does not believe in checks and balances and prefers to do      everything in secret  We now see the Bush Cheney Administration      seeking to twist the Authorization for Use of Military Force against      al Qaida into a justification for its secret  warrantless      wiretapping of Americans  emails and telephone calls  We see them      claiming that they need not fulfill their constitutional      responsibility to faithfully execute the laws but can pick and      choose among the laws they decide to recognize   Legislative action should be the      clear and unambiguous legal footing for any Government powers  These      matters should be governed by law  not by whim or some shifting      concept on the Presidents inherent authority that is exercised in      secret  Confronted with this Administrations claims of inherent      and unchecked powers  I do not believe that the restraints we have      been able to include in this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act are      sufficient   I will continue      to work to provide the tools that we need to protect the American      people  I trust that Vermonters will understand that while I have      repeatedly voted to extend and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act  this      permanent measure falls short of what they deserve  I will continue      to work to provide the oversight and checks needed on the use of      Government power  I know that the Senate will adopt this measure       but it is a pale shadow of what it could be  It is not the best      that the greatest democracy on Earth deserves  I will keep fighting      for us to do better   I will continue      to work to improve the PATRIOT Act  I will work to provide better      oversight over the use of national security letters and to remove      the un American restraints on meaningful judicial review  I will      seek to monitor how sensitive personal information from medical      files  gun stores and libraries are obtained and used  I will join      Senators Specter  Sununu  Craig  and others in introducing a bill to      improve the PATRIOT Act and reauthorization legislation in several      important respects  Much is left to be done
