       Leahy  White House Delays Sending Key Department Of Justice Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy  White House Delays       Sending Key  Department Of Justice       Nominations      WASHINGTON        Tuesday  Dec  4  2007   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman       Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Tuesday exposed the White House for       stalling key nominations for vacancies in the Department of       Justice  The Administration Nov  15 announced it intended to       send nominations to Capitol Hill for the Deputy Attorney       General  the Associate Attorney General  and the Assistant       Attorney General for the Civil Division  Almost three weeks       later  the Senate has not received the nominations        Statement of       Senator Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate       Judiciary Committee      White House Delays On Executive Branch Vacancies   December 4  2007      It is December and there are few       legislative days left to us before the Christmas holidays and       the end of this session  I had hoped and planned to devote the       energy and attention of the Judiciary Committee to working with       the Administration to fill the remaining high level vacancies at       the Department of Justice by reviewing the nominations  holding       the needed hearings and making significant progress         Indeed  while we were preparing in       October for the confirmation hearing on the Mukasey nomination       to be Attorney General  I urged the President and others to work       with us to make progress  We proceeded to prepare for and hold       a significant hearing on the Mukasey nomination in which many       important issues were raised  The Committee then proceeded to       consider the nomination and  given concerns about the nominees       answers to certain key questions  a number of Senators who had       hoped to be able to support the nomination were not able to do       so  We nevertheless proceeded and the nomination was reported       to the floor  It was scheduled for debate by the Leader        expeditiously debated  and soon after confirmed         Over the course of this year the       Judiciary Committees investigation into the firing of United       States Attorneys and into the influence of White House political       operatives on federal law enforcement resulted in the       resignations of the leadership of the Justice Department        including the Attorney General  the Deputy Attorney General  the       Associate Attorney General  the chiefs of staff of the Attorney       General and Deputy Attorney General  the White House liaison        and many others  There have also been a number of White House       resignations  including that of Karl Rove and his deputies Sara       Taylor and Scott Jennings        As I met with Michael Mukasey in       preparation for his hearing and in our conservations since his       swearing in  I have emphasized the need to fill the remaining       vacancies with nominees who will restore the independence of       federal law enforcement  For months I have been talking       publicly and privately as well about the need to name U S        Attorneys around the country  where more than a quarter of those       positions are not Senate confirmed appointments         With great fanfare  in the days       before the congressional Thanksgiving recess  the White House       made a show of releasing the names of a score of nominees  That       announcement was mostly bluster  So  for example  today          more than two and a half weeks after the grand announcements          Mark R  Filip has not been nominated to be the Deputy Attorney       General  Kevin OConnor has not been nominated to be the       Associate Attorney General  and Gregory Katsas has not been       nominated to be the Assistant Attorney General in charge of the       Civil Division at the Department of Justice  Nor have we       received their questionnaires  their FBI background information       or their ethics reports       Indeed  we only this week received       the questionnaires for the Presidents nominations to head the       important Civil Rights Division and the Tax Division at the       Department of Justice  more than two weeks after those       nominations were announced       Further  with respect to United       States Attorneys and United States Marshals vacancies  we have       not seen the cooperation or expedition that I would have liked        We finally received the questionnaires and FBI background       information on three U S  Attorney nominees just yesterday  I       have asked Committee staff to review these matters quickly and       will ask Senators to consider the nominations of Diane J        Humetewa to be U S  Attorney for the District of Arizona        Gregory Brower to be the U S  Attorney for the District of       Nevada  and Edmund Booth to be U S  Attorney for the Southern       District of Georgia as promptly as possible and  if possible  as       soon as this Thursday morning  I note that Ms  Humetewa and Mr        Brower are being named as replacements for two of the       outstanding U S  Attorneys who were fired on December 7 last       year as part of the ill advised partisan plan that  when we       investigated  led to the resignations of Attorney General       Gonzales and so many others who were involved  Paul Charlton and       Daniel Bodgen should not have been fired and are stilled owed an       explanation and apology by this Administration         I will make progress when I can        I had hoped to hold a confirmation hearing on the nomination of       Mark Filip to be the Deputy Attorney General  the second highest       official at the Justice Department  as soon as next Wednesday        I felt I could only proceed to do so if we received the       paperwork and the nomination by yesterday in order to allow       Senators an opportunity to prepare for the hearing on an       expedited basis  Without those materials it would be       ill advised and far too rushed to proceed next week  Depending       on when we receive the overdue materials  we may still be able       to hold a hearing before this session ends  but time is       fleeting        This Administration has known       since at least May 14  2007  when the former Deputy Attorney       General Paul McNulty announced that he was resigning  that there       was to be a vacancy in this important position  Yet even after       he proceeded to resign  there was no one named  That was more       than four months ago        When the Administration prevailed       upon Craig Morford to serve as the Acting Deputy Attorney       General  I wrote to the White House counsel to ask whether Mr        Morford would transition from being named the acting to being       the Presidents nominee  That was back in July  I was trying       back then to move forward and to put effective leadership in       place  For my efforts  I was essentially told to mind my own       business and that they would tell me who would be the new Deputy       Attorney General when they decided who would be nominated to be       the next Deputy Attorney General  I thank Mr  Morford for his       service  for his willingness to answer the call when the       Department was in complete disarray and for the personal       sacrifices he has been called upon to make by being separated       from his family for months and months       By not providing the nominations       to the highest ranking vacancies within the Justice Department       and not providing the basic background materials needed to       review such nominations before the Thanksgiving recess  the       Administration has once again foreclosed the opportunity to have       these nominees considered by the Senate and in place this year        They will now necessarily carry over into the next session        That is unfortunate and unnecessary
