       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Comprehensive Immigration Reform     April 5  2006  Yesterday  bipartisan progress was      interrupted when some tried to make this into a partisan fight       That was unfortunate  I hope that we are back on track   We heard from a number of Senators who      support the bipartisan comprehensive bill  some who came down to      speak for first time in this debate  Senator Menendez spoke from      his unique perspective on one who was a member of the House during      their debate on their narrow and punitive bill and is now a Member      of the Senate  Senator Nelson described amendments in which he is      interested  Senator Lieberman spoke about an amendment he and      Senator Brownback wish to offer relating to asylum  but Republicans      are objecting  Senator Kerry spoke forcefully and eloquently   I want to speak for a moment about the      comments made by Senator Salazar  I was struck by his description      of the slurs to which he has been subjected for his support of the      comprehensive  bipartisan Committee bill  This is wrong  It is      unacceptable  Senator Salazar is an outstanding Senator who has      made great contributions and served previously as the Attorney      General of his state  He is thoughtful and genuine  and approaches      issues in a serious manner    I am deeply offended that opponents of      comprehensive immigration legislation have subjected him to these      slurs  It reminds me of when many of us were called anti Catholic       anti Christian  anti Hispanic  anti Southern  anti woman and      anti American  The other side can be quick to smear  I find it      most unfortunate that a Senator of the quality and integrity of Ken      Salazar could be subjected to this form of attack   President Bush called for a civil      debate and his supporters should have followed that suggestion       They have not  Sadly  again  no one from the other side stepped up      to condemn the unfounded attacks and to disassociate themselves from      such poisonous conduct    Also during yesterdays debate  we had      a procedural discussion that became unnecessarily heated  During      the course of the day  I suggested  and Democratic leader suggested       and members of the staff suggested amendments on which we could take      votes  We could have made greater progress by taking votes on these      amendments  which were offered by Republicans  Democrats  many of      which were bipartisan  On our side  we followed through by sending      an initial list of amendments that we believe can be scheduled for      debate and votes    Some on the other side have tried to      turn this into a partisan debate  The Democratic leader  Senator      McCain  Senator Kennedy and others have taken a bipartisan      approach  We want to vote on a bipartisan product  which  of      course  is what the Committee product is    Opponents trying to curtail the      bipartisan approach were accusing Democrats of obstructing the bill       not trying to complete action  Far from it  Indeed  in response       the Democratic leaders filed a petition for cloture that I hope will      bring successful action on a comprehensive  realistic and fair      immigration bill and so that we complete action this week  on the      majority leaders schedule
