       Leahy Takes Next Step On White House Subpoenas  Directing Compliance By   Current And Former White House Officials                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Takes Next Step On       White House Subpoenas   Directing Compliance By       Current And Former White House Officials    Chairman RulesThat Executive       Privilege And Immunity Claims Are Not Legally Valid     WASHINGTON  Thursday  Nov  29         Taking the next step to enforce subpoenas that the White House       has refused to heed  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick       Leahy  D Vt   Thursday ruled that White House claims of       executive privilege and immunity in the Senates investigation       of the mass firings of U S  Attorneys are overbroad        unsubstantiated  and not legally valid to block current and       former White House officials from fulfilling Judiciary Committee       subpoenas  Leahy directed them to comply immediately with the       subpoenas that were issued by the Committee earlier this year       Leahy issued subpoenas for       documents and testimony to White House Chief of Staff       and former White House political director       on June 13  2007  and to former White House       Deputy Chief of Staff       and White House deputy political director       on July 26  2007  Bolten produced none of       the White House documents compelled by subpoena and       at all before the Committee to testify       as required by subpoena after the White House asserted a novel       claim that he was immune from testifying  While       and       appeared before the Committee for sworn testimony        both cited the White Houses claim of executive privilege in       failing to answer many of the Committees questions about their       roles in the dismissals of U S  Attorneys       I have given the White Houses       claims of executive privilege and immunity careful       consideration  wrote Leahy  I hereby rule that those claims       are not legally valid to excuse current and former White House       employees from appearing  testifying and producing documents       related to this investigation  Accordingly  I direct Mr  Bolten        Mr  Rove  Ms  Taylor and Mr  Jennings to comply immediately with       the Committees subpoenas by producing documents and testifying       or face possible contempt citations       The White House failed to       substantiate its broad claims of privilege and immunity or       provide a privilege log as requested in a from Leahy and House Judiciary Committee Chairman       John Conyers  D Mich   to White House Counsel Fred Fielding  In       his ruling  Leahy found that the complete lack of particularity       of the White House claims  including the lack of a privilege log       or any specific factual basis for the privilege claims  makes       the scope of the claims improper and called Fieldings       assertion of executive privilege on behalf of the President       surprising in light of the significant and uncontroverted       evidence that the President had no involvement in the firings       of well performing U S  Attorneys       Since March  the Senate Judiciary       Committee has held a series of hearings to investigate the       politicization of the Department of Justice  particularly in the        Leahy moved to issue       the subpoenas after the White House rejected efforts to work out       an accommodation to provide the materials needed for the       Committees investigation  The House Judiciary Committee has       already approved contempt citations for Bolten and former White       House Counsel Harriet Miers in connection with the U S        Attorneys scandal  Revelations brought to light by the       congressional investigations led to the resignation of former       Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and the departure of virtually       the entire senior leadership of the Justice Department  Rove       and other White House political operatives related to the       scandal also have left        Leahys ruling on the White       Houses claims of executive privilege is the next step in       enforcing the Committee issued subpoenas to Bolten  Taylor  Rove       and Jennings  Failure to comply with the directive may lead the       Committee  and the full Senate  to consider holding the White       House in contempt                       For a PDF of       Leahys ruling              Ruling on the White       Houses Claims of Executive Privilege and Immunity  Made in Response to Senate       Judiciary Committee Subpoenas    Chairman Patrick Leahy  Senate Judiciary Committee      Since the beginning       of this Congress  the Senate Judiciary Committee has conducted       an investigation into the unprecedented mass firings of federal       prosecutors by those in the Administration of the President who       appointed them  In the course of this investigation  which has       led to the resignations of the Attorney General  the senior       leadership of the Justice Department  their staff  and several       high ranking White House political officials  the Committee has       uncovered grave threats to the independence of law enforcement       from political manipulation  The evidence accumulated from the       testimony of nearly 20 current and former Justice Department       officials and documents released by the Department shows that       the list for firings was compiled based on input from the       highest political ranks in the White House  including Karl       Rove  The evidence shows that senior officials were apparently       focused on the political impact of federal prosecutions and       whether federal prosecutors were doing enough to bring partisan       voter fraud and corruption cases  It is now apparent that the       reasons given for these firings were contrived as part of a       cover up       The Committees attempts to obtain       information from the White House  first requested voluntarily       and later legally compelled by subpoenas  have been met with       stonewalling  In the process  the White House has asserted       blanket claims of executive privilege and novel claims of       absolute immunity to block current and former officials from       testifying and producing documents in compliance with the       Committees subpoenas  Today  I am ruling on those claims             I        White House Invoked Blanket Privilege Claims to Avoid Complying       with Subpoenas      On June 13 and July 26  I issued       Judiciary Committee subpoenas that had been authorized months       earlier for White House documents and for documents and       testimony from current and former White House officials related       to the firings  In response  White House counsel Fred Fielding       conveyed President Bushs blanket claim of executive privilege       over all information from the White House related to the       Committees investigation  Based on this claim of executive       privilege  White House Chief of Staff Joshua Bolten and other       current and former White House officials have refused to comply       with subpoenas to provide documents and information  In       addition  Mr  Fielding has written not only to current White       House employees subpoenaed by the Committee and directed them       not to testify about the firings  but has reached out to       instruct former White House political director Sara M  Taylor       not to testify to the best of her knowledge  Finally  the White       House has asserted the novel claim that Karl Rove  subpoenaed by       this Committee for testimony and documents  is immune as an       immediate Presidential Advisor from appearing at all or       testifying       That Mr  Fielding asserts       executive privilege on behalf of the President is surprising in       light of the significant and uncontroverted evidence that the       President had no involvement in these firings       To date  the       President has not taken responsibility for the firings and his       own statements regarding the firings refer to others making the       decisions  The Attorney Generals former chief of staff  the       former political director at the White House and the Attorney       General himself have testified under oath that they did not talk       to the President about these firings  Courts analyzing executive       privilege claims have made clear that the purpose of the       privilege is to protect the Presidents ability to receive       candid advice  The Presidents lack of involvement in these       firingsby his own account and that of many otherscalls into       question any claim of executive privilege       The effects of the       White Houses assertions of privilege and immunity are  unmistakablethey are to withhold critical evidence       related to the Committees investigation that the Committee has       demonstrated it needs in order to perform its legislative and       oversight functions and to explore the veracity of testimony to       the Committee        Selectively citing letters from       Mr  Fielding  former employee Ms  Taylor and her former deputy        J  Scott Jennings  refused to answer most of the Committees       questions related to the firings  They produced no documents        despite their obligations to do so pursuant to the Committees       subpoenas  In response to the subpoena to Mr  Rove  the       Committee received only a letter from Mr  Fielding  Mr  Rove       did not appear to testify and produce documents or even to       assert executive privilege in response to questions       The White Houses other blanket       assertion is that there was no wrongdoing in the firings  We       have asked for the basis for this assertion  None has been       provided  In light of the evidence gathered by the Committee       showing the significant involvement of White House political       officials in improper politicization of law enforcement  the       White House is not entitled to withhold key evidence  If the       White House has information that led the President and others to       discount the evidence of wrongdoing the investigating Committees       have gathered so far  then it should be produced  Otherwise  we       must conclude that they do not have it and it does not exist             II        White House Rejected Voluntary Cooperation      I reluctantly moved to issue these       subpoenas only after exhausting every avenue seeking voluntary       cooperation  Before issuing the subpoenas  I sent nearly a       dozen letters seeking voluntary cooperation with the Committees       investigation to the White House and its current and former       employees  Despite mounting evidence of significant involvement       by White House political officials  the White House did not       produced a single document or allow even one White House       employee or former employee involved in these matters to be       interviewed voluntarily       Indeed  the White Houses only       response to our many attempts to work out an accommodation has       been to restate an unacceptable take it or leave it offer of       limited document availability and off the record  backroom       interviews with no transcript  no oath  and no ability to follow       up  The Committee rejected that as unacceptable when it was       offered in March and  despite all of our efforts  the White       House has been unwilling to work with us on a voluntary basis        When I wrote to the President in August following the suggestion       of Senator Specter  the Committees Ranking Member  to ask the       President to sit down with us and work out an accommodation  my       offer was flatly rejected  The White House also flatly rejected       an additional attempt earlier this month by the House Judiciary       Committee to reach an accommodation       III        White House Failed to Support Privilege Claims      After the White House counsel made       a blanket privilege assertion in response to this Committees       subpoenas and subpoenas issued by House Judiciary Chairman       Conyers  we gave the White House the opportunity to provide the       factual and legal basis for its blanket privilege assertion  A       serious assertion of privilege would include an effort to       demonstrate to the Committees which documents  and which parts       of those documents  are covered by any privilege that is       asserted to apply and why  But the White House has ignored       these opportunities  In light of the evidence pointing to       significant involvement by White House political officials        which had been communicated to the White House multiple times        the White Houses refusal to provide a listing of those       documents on which it asserts privilege and a specific factual       and legal basis for the assertion of executive privilege claims       renders its privilege assertions wholly unsupported and invalid       The complete lack of particularity       of the White House claims  including the lack of a privilege log       or any specific factual basis for the privilege claims  makes       the scope of the claims improper  That is so especially here       where there is no indication of presidential involvement  The       White Houses privilege claim extends to all communications with       third parties and the Department of Justice from any White House       employee irrespective of the purpose of the communication and       despite Mr  Fielding having offered to provide documents showing       third party communications if the Committee would agree to       terminate its investigation  The extension of this privilege       claim to the knowledge of former employees is even more       attenuated        Executive privilege  even when       properly asserted  is qualified  not absolute1        and neither the doctrine of separation of powers  nor the need       for confidentiality of high level communications  without more        can sustain an absolute  unqualified Presidential privilege 2             The White House has fallen well       short of providing adequate support for its claims         IV  The       Committee Has Demonstrated Compelling Congressional Need That       Outweighs the Overbroad  Unsubstantiated Executive Privilege       Claims      Claims of executive privilege can       be overcome by an adequate showing of need 3        In contrast to the White Houses improperly asserted and       unparticularized privilege claims  invoked despite the       Presidents lack of involvement in these firings  the       Committees need for this information has been       well established  Evidence gathered by the investigating       Committees of the Senate and House shows that White House       political officials played a significant role in originating        developing  coordinating and implementing these unprecedented       firings and the Justice Departments response to congressional       inquiries about it        The evidence we have found       supports a conclusion that officials from the highest political       ranks at the White House  including Mr  Rove  manipulated the       Justice Department into its own political arm to pursue a       partisan political agenda  We have found evidence of the       involvement of White House political officials in pressuring       prosecutors to bring partisan cases and seeking retribution       against those who refuse to bend to their political will  An       example is New Mexico U S  Attorney David Iglesias  who was       fired a few weeks after Karl Rove complained to the Attorney       General about the lack of purported voter fraud enforcement       cases in Mr  Iglesias jurisdiction        We have found that at least one       Department official  the White House liaison Monica Goodling        who attended political briefings provided by White House       political officials  admitted while testifying in the House       under a grant of immunity to screening career employees for       political loyalty and to wielding undue political influence over       key law enforcement decisions and policies  We have found that       officials at the White House and the Justice Department were       determined to use the Attorney Generals new authority enacted       as part of the Patriot Act reauthorization to put in place       interim U S  Attorneys indefinitely  doing an end run around       the Senates constitutional and statutory role in the       confirmation of U S  Attorneys        Along the way  this subversion of       the justice system has included lying  misleading  stonewalling       and ignoring the Congress in our attempts to determine what       happened  It is       obvious that the reasons given for these firings were contrived       as part of a cover up and that the stonewalling by the White       House is part and parcel of that same effort  During his sworn       testimony  the Attorney General himself contrasted these       politically motivated firings with the replacement of other       United States Attorneys for legitimate cause       Another       demonstration of this Administrations partisan intervention in       federal law enforcement is its threat to block the Justice       Department from pursuing congressional contempt citations  This       Administration has announced its intentions to interfere with       our system of justice by preventing a United States Attorney       from fulfilling his or her sworn  constitutional duty faithfully       to execute the laws and proceed pursuant to section 194 of title       2 of the United States Code       The constitutional powers of       Congress and the responsibilities of this Committee to the       Senate and the American people overrule the White Houses       unsupported privilege claims  The Supreme Court has long       recognized that Congress has broad power to investigate the       administration of existing laws and to expose corruption        inefficiency  waste within the executive branch 4        The evidence obtained raises concerns about the violation of       federal laws  including possible obstruction of justice  laws       prohibiting misleading or inaccurate testimony to Congress  and       possible violations of laws like the Hatch Act prohibiting       retaliation against federal employees for improper political       reasons  The Committee has the responsibility to conduct       investigations and obtain executive branch information in order       to consider legislation within our jurisdiction 5        including legislation related to the appointment of U S        Attorneys  and to protect our role in evaluating nominations       pursuant to the Senates constitutional responsibility to       provide advice and consent  Indeed  it was in light of this       jurisdiction  the confirmation power vested in the Senate  and       the jurisdiction of this Committee over the review of U S        Attorney nominations  that Senator Specter  the Committees       Ranking Member  observed early on that we have primary       responsibility to investigate this matter      The White Houses privilege claim       is particularly inappropriate in light of the evidence       suggesting possible wrongdoing by government officials  Not       only has the Supreme Court recognized that Congress broad       investigative power is necessary to determine whether there was       wrongdoing and address it  but previous administrations have       recognized that executive privilege should not be invoked to       prevent investigations into wrongdoing      V  No       Support for Immunity Claim    Also without support is the White       House claim that Mr  Rove is immune from the obligation to       appear in response to a Senate subpoena  There is no proper       basis for Mr  Roves refusal to appear  and it flies in       the face of legal and historical precedent  Since World War II        74 presidential advisors  in positions of proximity to the       President similar to Mr  Rove  have testified before Congress        many of those compelled by subpoena  Even the President has not       been immune from compliance with subpoenas  In support of its       novel immunity argument  the White House relies on a July 10       memorandum from Stephen G  Bradbury  Principal Deputy Assistant       Attorney General in the Office of Legal Counsel  that amounts to       a selective and incomplete collection of untested executive       branch memoranda  opinions  presidential letters and speechesin       short  assertions of executive power by the executive branch        Indeed  the White House does not and cannot cite a single court       decision in support of its contention      VI        Conclusion  White House Officials Directed to Comply with       Subpoenas     I have given the White Houses       claims of executive privilege and immunity careful       consideration  I hereby rule that those claims are not legally       valid to excuse current and former White House employees from       appearing  testifying and producing documents related to this       investigation  Accordingly  I direct Mr  Bolten  Mr  Rove  Ms        Taylor and Mr  Jennings to comply immediately with the       Committees subpoenas by producing documents and testifying          Issued this 29th       day of November  2007             __________________
