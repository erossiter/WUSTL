       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Bush Administration s Failure To   Comply With Subpoenas For Warrentless Wiretapping Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Bush Administrations Failure To Comply     With Subpoenas For Warrantless Wiretapping      Documents     August 20  2007         Video and audio courtesy of            Today was the deadline for the       Administration to comply with the Judiciary Committees       subpoenas for documents related to the legal justifications for       and Presidents authorization of the warrantless wiretapping       program  The Administration failed to adequately comply        despite our granting an extension of  more than a month       past the original return date  The Administration has produced       no documents  no adequate basis for noncompliance  no privilege       claims  and no complete privilege log    For more than six years  the Bush       Administration intercepted communications of Americans in the       United States without warrants and without following the       required procedures of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act        FISA   Since the President confirmed his warrantless       surveillance program in December 2005  the Senate Judiciary       Committee has conducted an inquiry into that program of       warrantless electronic surveillance        Our focus has been on the legality of that program  not on its       operational details   In June  the Senate Judiciary       Committee subpoenaed the information regarding the       Administrations legal analysis  We did this following a       bipartisan vote of the Committee  and we did after almost two       years of seeking voluntary cooperation from officials for the       legal justifications on which the Administration based its       contention that it could operate outside the law  Initially        July 18th was set as the date for the information to       be produced  As the date approached I received a telephone call       from Joshua Bolten and Fred Fielding asking for more time to       assemble and review the materials called for by the subpoenas        Mr  Fielding estimated that could be done by August 1  I       granted the Administrations request for the extension of time       and looked forward to its compliance  Instead  there has been       noncompliance and dilatory unresponsiveness  One week after the       time requested had passed  I set August 20th as the       new return date  This is almost two months after service of the       subpoenas and three weeks past the time the White House counsel       estimated would be needed    With the temporary amendment to       FISA that the Administration demanded be passed in early August       set to expire in a few months  it is essential that we       understand how the Bush Administration has interpreted FISA and       how it has justified its activities outside that statutory       framework  If we are to consider more permanent legislative       changes to FISA  this is now vitally important  For Congress to       legislate effectively in this area it must have full information       about the Executive Branchs interpretations of FISA  We cannot       and should not legislate in the dark while the Administration       hides behind a veil of secrecy  The Administrations failure to       comply with the Judiciary Committees subpoenas for its legal       analysis gives me little comfort    I received a letter this morning       from the Office of the Vice President identifying some documents       that would be responsive to the Committees subpoena  The       acknowledgement of these documents is a good first step  and it       should be followed by the Administration turning them over to       the Committee pursuant to the subpoena  I have worked in good       faith with this Administration  first seeking the information       voluntarily from officials and then accommodating their requests       for more time  Unfortunately  that good faith has been met with       continued stonewalling tactics of dodge and delay     The Administrations response       today also claims that the Office of the Vice President is not       part of the Executive Office of the President  That is wrong        Both the United States Code and even the White Houses own web       site say so  at least it did as recently as this morning The       Committees authorization  approved in a bipartisan 13 3 vote        clearly covered the three offices cited in the subpoena  In       fact  the Committee responsibly narrowed its request to specify       only these three offices that have been linked to the domestic       surveillance program  rather than all of the offices within the       Executive Office of the President   The letter I received today from       the White House Counsel did not identify any documents  but       expressed vague hopes of negotiation and accommodation while       raising the specter of more privilege claims  If the White       House is serious about complying with the subpoena  then I would       work out arrangements to protect national security and       classified documents  It is not enough for the White House to       try to look reasonable at the last minute after months of delay        it is well past time for the White House to start acting       reasonably   The Senate Judiciary Committee has       been willing to accommodate reasonable requests and to work with       the Administration to allow it to respond to our subpoenas  I       had hoped the White House would use this additional time       constructively to finish gathering the relevant information and       to work with us in good faith to provide it so that we will have       the information we need to conduct effective oversight at long       last  Again today  however  the Administration has failed to       adequately respond to the Judiciary Committees subpoenas  The       Administration has not provided a single responsive document        has provided no basis for any claim of privilege  and has       provided no detailed log of withheld documents
