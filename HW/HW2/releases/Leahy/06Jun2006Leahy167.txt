       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On Judicial Nominations       June 6  2006  As we resume consideration of       judicial nominations today  it is worth taking stock of the       mileposts we have passed and those we are working toward        Chairman Specter has now chaired the Judiciary Committee for 17       months  I congratulate him on that  The Committee has been       extremely active  and we have achieved a good deal working       together    We reported a bill to provide       compensation to asbestos victims and began its consideration in       the Senate  Just recently  we joined together to introduce a       new version of our legislation  to note the passing of our       friend Judge Becker and to recommit ourselves to finishing this       bipartisan task to provide fair compensation to asbestos victims       and reduce the litigation burden that asbestos cases have       imposed on our civil justice system    We worked together to report a       comprehensive immigration reform bill and continued to work with       Senators Kennedy  McCain  Hagel  Martinez and others in a       bipartisan coalition that culminated in Senate passage of S 2611       late last month  We look forward to help from the President to       enact that measure later this year    We worked together to revive and       reauthorize the expiring provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act  I       supported the Judiciary Committee and Senate bill  When our       bill was hijacked  I appreciated Chairman Specters efforts to       restore some balance and his efforts to work with those of us       seeking improvements  Sadly  the final product insisted upon by       the Bush Cheney Administration and House Republicans was not one       I could support    We are working together now in a       bipartisan  bicameral partnership to reauthorize the expiring       provisions of the Voting Rights Act  We need to complete       hearings on our bill without further delay and I hope that we       can report our bipartisan bill by mid June so that these       important provisions  including those in section 203 providing       voting access for language minorities  can be reauthorized this       year   We worked together to report       privacy legislation to the Senate last November  Senate action       on our bill is overdue  The recent theft of millions of       veterans personal information and the growing problem of       identification theft remind us how important these issues are       for so many Americans    We have also worked together on       competitiveness issues including the NOPEC legislation to       clarify that our antitrust laws should be applied to the OPEC       cartel  our broader bill on windfall oil company profits  and       our bill to end the antitrust exemption for the insurance       industry    We have made progress on several       issues  but our work is far from over  There are only 13 weeks       left in this legislative session of the Senate and we still have       much that needs to get done  The Republican controlled House       and Senate have yet to enact a federal budget and are in       violation of the statutory deadline of April 15        We have yet to pass a single appropriations bill  and we are       required by law to pass 13  We have yet to reconcile and enact       the emergency supplemental appropriations bill that has been       pending for months and that includes funding for Iraq and       Katrina victims and other matters  We have yet to reconcile and       enact lobbying reform and ethics legislation  We have yet to       deal with the skyrocketing cost of gasoline  We have yet to       reconcile and enact a bipartisan and comprehensive immigration       reform bill  We need to enact stronger privacy protection       legislation  especially in the wake of the theft of information       on more than 26 million veterans  We have yet to enact stem       cell research legislation  We need to reauthorize the Voting       Rights Act  We have yet to enact patent reform legislation        And I hope that we will take up  pass and enact our asbestos       compensation legislation and my measure to speed lifesaving       medicine to those in desperate need    I have urged that we exercise       effective oversight of the Executive branch  and I have       supported Chairman Specters efforts to get to the bottom of the       NSAs unprecedented program of domestic spying on Americans       without warrants  We need to make more progress on this       important front and to restore accountability and check and       balances in our government    One of the most important checks       and balances to unprecedented overreaching by the Bush Cheney       Executive branch is an independent judiciary  With respect to       judicial nominations  we worked together in connection with the       nominations of Chief Justice Roberts  whom I came to support        and Justice Alito  whom I did not  I have sought to expedite       consideration of qualified  consensus nominees and urged the       President to work with us to make selections that unite all       Americans    Today we will proceed to confirm       another lifetime appointment to the federal courts in  New Jersey  With the support of the New Jersey Senators       we were able to confirm Judge Susan Davis Wigenton just before       the last recess  Her nomination  as well as the nomination of       Renee Marie Bumb that we are considering today  were reported       favorably by the Judiciary Committee to the Senate more than a       month ago    Rather than proceed to those       nominations promptly  the Republican leadership of the Senate       delayed their consideration while proceeding over time with       circuit court nominations  I was cooperative in proceeding to       the confirmation of Judge Milan Smith to the Ninth Circuit  His       confirmation demonstrated  again  that we can work together  I       was pleased for his brother  the Senator from       Oregon  and believe that he will be a fine judge    Regrettably  the Senate Republican       leadership chose not to move to any of the four District Court       nominations from New Jersey  or the two nominations to District       Courts in Michigan that their home State Democratic Senators       have reached out to support  Instead  they forced debate on       another controversial nomination  that of a White House insider       selected for a lifetime position on the D C  Circuit as a reward       for his loyalty to President Bush  I did not support       confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh  That was the fight that the       Republican leader had promised the narrow special interest       groups of the right wing of his party    The President and Senate       Republican leadership continue to pick fights over judicial       nominations rather than focus on filing vacancies  Judicial       vacancies have now grown to more than 50 from the       lowest vacancy rate in decades  More than half these vacancies       are without a nominee  The Congressional Research Service has       recently released a study showing that this President has been       the slowest in decades to nominate and the Republican Senate       among the slowest to act  If they would concentrate on the       needs of the courts  our federal justice system and the needs of       the American people  we would be much further along    Still  we have passed a milestone        When the Senate votes today to confirm Renee Bumb as a district       court judge  the Republican controlled Senate will have this       year confirmed 17 judicial nominations  That was the total       number of judges confirmed in the 1996 congressional session        when Republicans controlled the Senate and stalled the       nominations of President Clinton  In the 1996 session  however        Republicans would not confirm a single appellate court judge        All 17 confirmations were district court nominees  That is the       only session I can remember in which the Senate has simply       refused to consider a single appellate court nomination  That       was part of their pocket filibuster strategy to stall and       maintain vacancies so that a Republican President could pack the       courts and tilt them decidedly to the right  In the important       D C  Circuit  the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh was the       culmination the       Republicans decade long attempt to pack the D C  Circuit that       began with the stalling of Merrick Garlands nomination in 1996       and continued with the blocking of President Clintons other       well qualified nominees  Elena Kagan and Allen Snyder     Of course  with the confirmation       today  we will tie that record of 17 confirmations for the       year  It is June  and we have a few more weeks in which to make       progress  There remain four more district court nominees on the       calendar whose consideration could be scheduled for debate and       vote but are being delayed   not by Democratic opposition   but       by Republican control  There is also another circuit court       nominee on the calendar who was reported with Democratic support       from the Judiciary Committee and whose confirmation could be       scheduled for debate and vote  Successful consideration of       those five additional nominees will bring the Senates total       judicial confirmations to 22  thereby matching the total       achieved all last year    But the road ahead is likely to be       rocky  In the run up to the Kavanaugh nomination debate  we saw       that the  Senate Republican leadership is apparently heeding the       advice of The Wall Street       Journal editorial page  which wrote   a  filibuster       fight would be exactly the sort of political battle Republicans       need to energize conservative voters after their recent months       of despond  Rich Lowery  editor of the conservative  National Review        listed a fight over judges as one of the ways President Bush       could revive his political fortunes  writing that he should         p ush for the confirmation of his circuit judges that are       pending  Talk about them by name  The G O P  wins judiciary       fights   Republican Senators are relishing       picking fights over controversial judicial nominees  Senator       Thune has said  A good fight on judges does nothing but       energize our base         Right now our folks are feeling a       little flat  Senator Cornyn has said  I think this is       excellent timing  From a political standpoint  when we talk       about judges  we win  On May 8  2006   The New York Times       reported  Republicans are itching for a good election year       fight  Now they are about to get one  a reprise of last years       Senate showdown over judges   The Washington Post       reported on May 10  Republicans had revived debate on Kavanaugh       and another Bush appellate nominee  Terrence Boyle  in hopes of       changing the pre election subject from Iraq  high gasoline       prices and bribery scandals    We should not stand idly by as       Republicans  choose to use lifetime federal judgeships for partisan       political advantage  In a May 11  2006  editorial  The Tennessean       wrote      T he nation should look with       complete dismay at the blatantly political angle on nominations       being advocated by Senate Republicans now        Republicans are       girding for a fight on judicial nominees for no reason other       than to be girding for a fight  They have admitted as much in       public comments        In other words  picking a public fight       over judicial nominees is  in their minds  the right thing to do       because its the politically right thing to do        Now        Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political       purposes  The appointment of judges deserves far more respect       than to be an admitted election year ploy        It should be       beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to       nothing but a tool for political gain   On May 3  2006   The New York Times       wrote in an editorial  The Republicans have long used judicial       nominations as a way of placating the far right of their party        and it appears that with President Bush sinking in the polls        they now want to offer up some new appeals court judges to their       conservative base   Consider the Presidents       nomination of Judge Terrence Boyle to the Fourth Circuit  We       have learned from recent news reports that  as a sitting United       States District Judge and while a circuit court nominee  Judge       Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in which he       held investments  In at least one instance  he is alleged to       have bought General Electric stock while presiding over a       lawsuit in which General Electric was accused of illegally       denying disability benefits to a long time employee  Two months       later  he ruled in favor of GE and denied the employees claim       for long term and pension disability benefits  Whether or not it       turns out that Judge Boyle broke federal law or canons of       judicial ethics  these types of conflicts of interest have no       place on the federal bench  Certainly  they should not be       rewarded with a promotion to the Fourth Circuit  Certainly  they       should be investigated         The President should heed the call of North Carolina Police       Benevolent Association  the North Carolina Troopers       Association  the Police Benevolent Associations from  South Carolina and Virginia  the National Association of       Police Organizations  the Professional Fire Fighters and       Paramedics of North Carolina  as well as the advice of Senator       John Edwards  and withdraw his ill advised nomination of Judge       Terrence Boyle  Law enforcement from North Carolina and law       enforcement from across the country oppose the nomination  Civil       rights groups oppose the nomination  Those knowledgeable and       respectful of judicial ethics oppose this nomination  This       nomination has been pending on the calendar in the       Republican controlled Senate since June of last year when it was       forced out of the Committee on a party line vote  It should be       withdrawn    Also on the calendar is the       nomination of William Myers to the Ninth Circuit  This is       another Administration insider and lobbyist whose record has       made him extremely controversial  I opposed this nomination       when it was considered by the Judiciary Committee in March 2005        He was a nominee who the so called Gang of 14 expressly listed       as someone for whom they made no commitment to vote for cloture        and with good reason  His anti environmental record is reason       enough to oppose his confirmation  His lack of independence is       another  If anyone sought to proceed to this nomination  there       would be a need to explore his connections with the lobbying       scandals associated with the Interior Department and Jack       Abramoff  This nomination should also be withdrawn    A few months ago  the President       withdrew the nomination of Judge James Payne to the Court of       Appeals for the 10th Circuit after information became public       about that nominees rulings in a number of cases in which he       appears  like Judge Boyle  to have had conflicts of interest        Those conflicts were pointed out not by the Administrations       screening process or by the ABA  but by       journalists         Judge Payne joins a long list of nominations by this President       that have been withdrawn  Among the more well known are Bernard       Kerik to head the Department of Homeland Security and Harriet       Miers to the Supreme Court  It was  as I recall  reporting in a       national magazine that doomed the Kerik nomination  It was       opposition within the Presidents own party that doomed the       Miers nomination    During the last few months        President Bush also withdrew the nominations of Judge Henry Saad       to the Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit and Judge Daniel P        Ryan to the Eastern District of Michigan after his  ABA rating was downgraded    It is not as if we have not been       victimized before by the White Houses poor vetting of important       nominations  If the White House had its way  we would already       have confirmed Claude Allen to the Fourth Circuit  He is the       Bush Administration insider who recently resigned his position       as a top domestic policy adviser to the President  Ultimately       we learned why he resigned when he was arrested for fraudulent       conduct over an extended period of time  Had we Democrats not       objected to the White House attempt to shift a circuit judgeship       from Maryland to Virginia  someone now the subject of a criminal       prosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores       would be a sitting judge on the Fourth Circuit confirmed with a       Republican rubberstamp    Yet another controversial pending       nomination is that of Norman Randy Smith to the Ninth Circuit        This nomination is another occasion on which this President is       seeking to steal a circuit court seat from one State and       reassign it to another one  one with Republican Senators  That       is wrong  I support Senators Feinstein and Boxer in their       opposition to this tactic  I have suggested a way to resolve       two difficult situation if the President were to renominate Mr        Smith to fill the Idaho vacancy on the Ninth Circuit  instead of       a vacancy for a California seat  Regrettably  the White House       has not followed up on my suggestion        A complicit Republican controlled Senate remains all too eager       to act as a rubberstamp for the Bush Cheney Administration  The       nomination of Kavanaugh was one of the few to be downgraded by       the ABA upon further review  Until the       Republican controlled Senate proceeded to confirm this White       House insider  I cannot recall anyone being confirmed after such       a development  Another first  and another problematic       confirmation that ill serves the American people   Another troubling nomination is       that of William James Haynes to the Fourth Circuit  which has       been pending in the Republican controlled Senate without action       for three years  Mr  Haynes is the General Counsel at the       Defense Department and was deeply involved developing the       torture policies  detention and interrogation policies  military       tribunals and other controversial aspects of the manner in which       this Administration has proceeded unilaterally to make mistakes       and exceed its legal authority  Concerns about the Haynes       nomination may not be confined to Democratic Senators  according       to recent press reports   I trust that the Senate will not       repeat the mistake it made before  It was only after Jay Bybee       was confirmed to a lifetime appointment to the Ninth Circuit       that we learned of his involvement with the infamous Bybee memo       seeking to justify torture and degrading treatment  I had asked       him what he had worked on while head of the Department of       Justices Office of Legal Counsel  but he had refused to       respond  This former Defense Department and Justice Department       insider now sits on the Ninth Circuit for life     Finally  there is the more recent       nomination of Michael Wallace to a vacancy on the Fifth       Circuit  Mr  Wallace received the first ABA       rating of unanimously not qualified that I have seen for a       circuit court nominee since President Reagan  Yet that is one       of the controversial nominations we can expect the Republican       Senate to target for action given their track record    Working together we could do       better  I made the point when in the 17 months I chaired the       Judiciary Committee we proceeded to confirm 100 judicial       nominees of President Bush  I urge the White House to work with       us  I hope that the Republican controlled Senate will stop       rubberstamping this Presidents nominees and stop using       controversial judicial nominations to score partisan political       points  Our courts are too important  The rights and liberties       of the American people are too important  The courts are the       only check and balance left to protect the American people and       provide some oversight of the actions of this President
