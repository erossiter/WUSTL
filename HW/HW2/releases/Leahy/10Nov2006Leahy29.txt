       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On House Plans To Vote Monday On The New   England Wilderness Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On House Plans To Vote Monday     On The New England Wilderness Act     November 10  2006  The on and off progress that has      slowed this bill is on again  I am hopeful that we can get the New      England Wilderness Act to the Presidents desk without further      delay   This is a week that has begun to melt      some of the glacial pace that has prevented Congress from acting on      many issues that are important to Vermonters and the nation  and      final passage of this bill may offer some of the first proof of that      change
