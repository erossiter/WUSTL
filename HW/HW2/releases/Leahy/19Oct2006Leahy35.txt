 SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Vermont Congressional Delegation    Defends Vermont Stone Industry  Urges VA    To Continue Using Superior Vermont Stone And Craftsmanship    At The Nations Veterans Cemeteries       THURSDAY  Oct  19     Vermonts Congressional Delegation is asking the     Department of Veterans Affairs to reverse a decision to stop using     Vermont marble and Vermont craftsmen in the creation of thousands of     memorials placed at the nations veterans cemeteries     Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Sen  James     Jeffords  I Vt   and Congressman Bernie Sanders  I Vt   took the action     after Barre based Granite Industries of Vermont  GIV  informed them that     GIV had lost a VA contract to a Mississippi firm despite being the low     bidder  having 16 years of experience as a provider of stone memorials     to the VA  and having never had a stone rejected due to quality during     the past decade    Jeffrey Martell  president of GIV  asked     for the Vermont Congressional Delegations assistance after filing a     formal protest with the VA in late September  The VA will now review     the protest  including the letter sent by Leahy  Jeffords and Sanders      and determine if the contract was awarded fairly  GIV currently     produces approximately 20 000 memorials annually for the VA    The text of the Delegations letter     follows     October 18  2006   The     Honorable R  James Nicholson    Secretary of Veterans Affairs    810 Vermont Ave NW     Washington  DC 20420   Dear Secretary Nicholson   We are writing in support of a protest     concerning Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  Contract Award Number     VA786 P 0158 awarded on September 26  2006  in response to Solicitation     No  VA 786 06 RP 0118  A current VA contractor and respondent to the     solicitation  Granite Industries of Vermont  GIV   has brought its     protest concerning this headstone contract to our attention   It is our understanding that for the past     16 years GIV has provided first class headstones to the VA without a     single defect or poor quality stone for more than a decade  It is     currently performing under contract  V786 P 575  providing the VA with     20 000 marble headstones annually  The management and workforce of GIV     take pride in their ability to provide the VA and the families of     thousands of veterans with stones unmatched in quality  GIV has also     taken great efforts to provide professional  courteous and expedited     service to the VA in fulfilling its contracts  Vermont is known     globally as home to some of the strongest and most beautiful granite and     marble in the world  Vermont has supplied headstones for Americas     soldiers since the Battle of Gettysburg    When GIV was not awarded contract     VA786 P 0158  GIV management was rightfully concerned considering it had     underbid the contract awardee by  30 a headstone  or  90 000 over the     life of the contract  We understand that GIV was told by the     contracting officer that GIV was not chosen based on past performance      Given the 16 year near perfect track record GIV has with the VA  it is     hard to believe that awarding this contract to a company at a higher     price with equal or poorer past performance standards could possibly be     in the best interest of the VA or the American tax payer     Our concern about this contract award was     only heightened when we learned that the contracting officer would not     expound upon the claim that the past performance of GIV contributed to     its failure to secure this contract  If GIV has never delivered a stone     of poor quality to the VA  and if GIV has met or exceeded its     competitions service and delivery standards  we are at a loss to     understand why the VA would choose to discontinue such a business     relationship   As Vermonts Congressional Delegation and     as concerned lawmakers  we write in support of GIVs protest under the     Federal Acquisition Regulations concerning this contract  We also     request that the VA offer a full and immediate explanation concerning     the contracting officers claim relating to unacceptable past     performance from GIV   Should you have any questions concerning     our requests  please feel free to contact Daniel Ginsberg of the office     of Senator Leahy at  202  224 4242  Laurie Schultz Heim of the office of     Senator Jeffords at  202  224 5141 or Warren Gunnels of the office of     Congressman Sanders at  202  225 4115  Thank you for your assistance     and cooperation   Sincerely   PATRICK     LEAHY     United States Senate    JAMES JEFFORDS  United States Senate  BERNIE SANDERS    U S  House of Representatives
