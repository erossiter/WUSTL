       Senators Send Letter To Committee Leadership Asking For Emergency   Funding For LIHEAP                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Senators Send Letter      To Committee Leadership     Asking For Emergency Funding For LIHEAP     September 20  2005 Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   joined      other Senators in requesting that Sens  Thad Cochran  R Miss        and Sen  Robert Byrd  D WV   the chairman and ranking member of the      Senate Appropriations Committee  respectively  include  1 276      billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Low Income Home      Energy Assistance Program in the wake of Hurricane Katrina            September 20  2005  The       Honorable Thad       Cochran The       Honorable Robert C  Byrd      Chairman       Ranking Member      Committee on       Appropriations       Committee on Appropriations      United States       Senate       United States Senate      Washington  DC       20510       Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman       Cochran and Ranking Member Byrd   Hurricane Katrina upset the lives       of millions  displacing families from their homes and inflicting       severe economic damage  Without question  the people of the       Gulf region deserve our support  and we stand ready to help        As the Appropriations Committee considers an urgently needed       comprehensive supplemental appropriations bill to address       Hurricane Katrinas devastation as well as its economic and       energy impacts on the nation  we urge you to include  1 276       billion in emergency Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP        funds  With this additional funding  the LIHEAP program will be       able to provide the same level of purchasing power as last       year  This funding is critical to avoid a looming  but       preventable  crisis for millions of additional Americans caused       by the soaring cost and diminishing affordability of home       heating fuel as winter approaches   The effects of Hurricane Katrina       are being felt by Americans outside of the Gulf Region as       gasoline  heating oil  and natural gas prices rise in the wake       of this disaster  Indeed  there is an imminent emergency       confronting millions of low income Americans unable to afford       the cost of rising energy prices  The current skyrocketing in       energy prices coupled with energy debt remaining from last       winter and this summer are leading to increased disconnections       and arrears among consumers as the winter heating season begins        threatening the well being of low income families and       seniors  This situation warrants the provision of emergency       LIHEAP funding in the comprehensive supplemental request   Prior to Hurricane Katrinas       devastation in the Gulf region  Americans were facing record       prices for oil  natural gas  and propane  Hurricane Katrina       damaged platforms and ports and curtailed production at       refineries in the Gulf of Mexico  the source of almost a third       of U S  oil output  Crude oil for October delivery stands at       over  66 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange  Heating       oil prices increased dramatically after Hurricane Katrina        Prices averaged  1 70 per gallon in July  but now stand over  2       per gallon  Before Hurricane Katrina struck  the Energy       Information Administration  EIA  predicted a 16 percent increase       in heating oil costs  This increase comes on top of the 34       percent increase during the 2003 2004 winter  Natural gas       prices also rose dramatically after Hurricane Katrina  and now       stand over  12  more than 140 percent increase compared to last       year at this time  EIAs Short term Energy Outlook reports        The ranges for expected heating fuel expenditure increases this       winter are 69 percent to 77 percent for natural gas in the       Midwest  17 percent to 18 percent for electricity in the South        29 percent to 33 percent for heating oil in the Northeast  and       39 percent to 43 percent for propane in the Midwest  Heating       costs for the average family using heating oil are projected to       hit  1 666 during the upcoming winter  This represents an       increase of  403 over last winters prices and  714 over the       winter heating season of 2003 04  For families using natural       gas  prices are projected to hit  1 568  representing an       increase of  611 over last years prices and  643 over 2003 04        States need additional funding immediately to help low income       families and seniors to ensure they can afford to heat their       homes  States are bracing for potentially crisis conditions       caused by the lack of affordable heating sources  particularly       for seniors and the disabled    Almost daily  newspapers are reporting      on the impacts of higher energy costs for consumers  Hurricane      Katrinas impact on energy markets comes on top of soaring energy      prices over the past several years  Utilities from New England to      Florida to Oregon are seeking rate increases  In addition to rising      energy prices  the economic devastation in the Gulf region is likely      to impact the national economy  Many more Americans will need      LIHEAP assistance than the 5 million households that received aid      during FY 2005  State LIHEAP programs are expecting a major      increase in applications due to the rapid increase in home energy      prices and this additional funding will allow them to address the      need for assistance   Residents and business affected by      Hurricane Katrina deserve the nations full support and financial      assistance  and we stand ready and willing to do everything we can      to help  We recognize that the Committee is still working to      assess the needs wrought by Hurricane Katrina and will face      difficult priorities in determining emergency funding  We feel that      preventing hardship for millions of Americans by acting to provide      LIHEAP emergency funds before we have another crisis on our hands is      an important priority  Thank you for your serious consideration of      our request              Sincerely    Susan M  Collins            Jack Reed  Jeff      Bingaman      Joseph R  Biden Olympia J
