       Jeffords And Leahy Seek Funding For Low Income Home Energy Assistance                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT    Jeffords And Leahy Seek Funding        For Low Income Home Energy Assistance         Vermont Receives Another  500 000 in Emergency Funds Washington  D C   Tuesday  March 1   Vermonts Senators today requested        that the Federal budget include  3 billion in funding for the Low Income        Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   In a letter to the Senate Budget        Committee  Senators Patrick Leahy and Jim Jeffords  who were joined by        nearly 50 of their colleagues  outlined the vital role that LIHEAP plays in        ensuring that our nations low income families and seniors have the        resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs   Also today  the U S  Department of Health and Human Services released         500 000 in emergency LIHEAP funds to Vermont  Leahy and Jeffords fought to        include the emergency funds on top of the programs  2 billion current        funding level  which allotted Vermont more than  11 million before any        emergency funds were distributed  Including Tuesdays announcement  Vermont        will have received  13 710 069 in LIHEAP funds  a one year record amount        that has helped the state respond to an increased number of applications        for assistance  The Vermont Department of Public Service has reported a 45 percent rise        in home heating oil costs and a 27 percent rise in propane costs since last        year  The Vermont Fuel Assistance Program  the state organization that        distributes LIHEAP funds  reports that applications for the home heating        assistance program have increased by 5 to 7 percent since the 2003 2004        winter  when more than 18 000 Vermont households benefited from LIHEAP        funds  LIHEAP funds are projected to help more than 19 000 Vermont        households this winter   Following is the text of the letter   The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital        safety net for our nations low income households  LIHEAP helps low income        families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in        the North and hot summers in the South  We are writing to request that the        budget provide  3 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2006 and that the allocation        provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2007  With  3 billion in        regular funding and advance appropriations  LIHEAP can help working        low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain        economic stability   For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens        living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable  These families        often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans  spending up to 17        percent of their income on home energy bills  Each year  this burden grows        as natural gas  heating oil and propane prices continue to increase   Since 1981  the number of households eligible for LIHEAP assistance has        grown  This winter  LIHEAP will serve an estimated 5 million households         Yet  this is only about 15 percent of the 32 million households that are        eligible for federal assistance  We recognize the difficult choices that        you face in shaping the fiscal 2006 budget resolution  however  we believe        that the continued growth in households eligible for LIHEAP assistance        demonstrates that the need for this program has never been greater  The        LIHEAP program remains seriously underfunded  The program needs at least  3        billion simply to equal the purchasing power it provided in 1982   Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income        families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying        their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as        prescription drugs  housing and food  The Boston Medical Center found that        many poor children with chronic health conditions start to lose weight and        suffer additional health problems associated with malnutrition in the        winter because their families are spending less of their income on food and        medicine and more on fuel bills  The National Energy Assistance Directors        Association surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by        households when faced with high energy bills  The survey found that in the        last five years   38 percent of LIHEAP recipients went without medical or dental care   30 percent went without filling a prescription or taking the full dose        of a prescribed medicine   28 percent did not make a rent or mortgage payment   22 percent went without food for at least one day  and  21 percent became sick because their home was too cold   We also request advance funding for LIHEAP  Advance funding enables        states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating        season in spring and early summer  Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to        plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be        more economical with limited Federal resources  It also ensures that states        provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait         Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to        make sure that working families  seniors and disabled individuals have the        resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs
