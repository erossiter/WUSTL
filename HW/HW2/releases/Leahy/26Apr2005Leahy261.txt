       Specter Leahy Bill A FAIR Compromise On Asbestos                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Specter Leahy Bill A FAIR      Compromise On Asbestos   Judiciary Panel Considers      Bipartisan Bill Creating  140B Trust Fund For Asbestos Claims    WASHINGTON  Tuesday       April 26    The Senate Judiciary Committee on Tuesday held a      hearing on the bipartisan Fairness in Asbestos Injury Resolution      Act  or the FAIR Act  The bill is sponsored by the leading members      of the panel  Sens  Arlen Specter  R Pa    the chairman  and Patrick      Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member  The Specter Leahy      bill would establish a  140 billion trust fund to fairly compensate      victims suffering from asbestos related disease  said Leahy  who      described the legislation as a compromise that balances the      interests of victims and businesses  The bill  co sponsored by Sens       Dianne Feinstein  D Ca    Orrin Hatch  R Utah   Mike DeWine       R Ohio   Max Baucus  D Mont    and George Voinovich  R Ohio   is      the culmination of years of bipartisan discussion  The effort to      stem the rising tide of asbestos litigation cases clogging the      nations courts began more than three years ago  Below is Leahys      statement from the hearing    CONTACT  Tracy Schmaler       202 224 2154        David Carle  202 224 3693    Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing on S  852  the FAIR Act of 2005     April 26  2005  I am pleased to join the Chairman at      this hearing on our bipartisan legislation to address the serious      problem of asbestos related disease  the FAIR Act of 2005   S       852     This bipartisan bill is the product of      years of difficult and conscientious craftsmanship and      negotiation  Chairman Specter  with whom I have worked so hard on      this legislation  rightly calls this one of the most complex issues      we have ever tackled  It is not the bill that I would have written       were I alone responsible for its drafting  nor is it the bill that      Senator Specter might have produced were he solely responsible for      drafting a bill  Nor should anyone be surprised to hear that the      interested groups  the labor organizations  the industrial      participants in the trust fund  their insurers  the trial bar  are      each less than pleased with some portion of the bill or another   That is the essence of legislative      compromise  We have worked hard to advance and protect the ultimate      goal of fair compensation to victims as the lodestar of our efforts       and we have all had to make sacrifices on a variety of subsidiary      issues as we worked together to resolve this emergency  What we      have achieved is a significant step toward a better  more efficient      method to compensate asbestos victims    Asbestos is among the most lethal      substances ever to be widely used in the workplace  Between 1940      and 1980  more than 27 5 million workers were exposed to asbestos on      the job  and nearly 19 million of them had high levels of exposure      over long periods of time  We even know of family members who have      suffered asbestos related disease from washing the clothes of loved      ones  The ravages of disease caused by asbestos have affected tens      of thousands of American families    The economic harm caused by asbestos      is also real  and the bankruptcies that have resulted are a      different kind of tragedy for everyone    for workers and retirees       for shareholders  and for the families that built these companies       In my home State of Vermont  the Rutland Fire Clay      Company is among the more than 70 companies nationwide to have      declared bankruptcy    As Chief Justice Rehnquist noted      several years ago  the elephantine mass of asbestos cases cries out      for a legislative solution  In another Supreme Court opinion       Justice Ginsburg declared that a nationwide administrative claims      processing regime would provide the most secure  fair  and efficient      means of compensating victims of asbestos exposure  I agree  the      Chairman agrees  Senator Feinstein agrees  Senator Hatch  who I      worked with earlier in formulating some of the initial elements of      this bill    agrees  and we hope that many others in this Committee      and in the Senate will agree   We are encouraged by the favorable      reception that this bill has already generated from a wide array of      interested parties  In the past week  I have received letters of      support from the United Automobile Workers  UAW   the Asbestos      Workers Union  the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States       VFW   the Asbestos Study Group  Blinded Veterans Association and      others  I ask unanimous consent that the texts of these letters be      printed in the record   The UAW notes in its April 13th      letter   The Specter Leahy Proposal  will provide more equitable       timely and certain compensation to the victims of asbestos related      disease  I am pleased that Alan Reuther  the Legislative Director      of the UAW  is testifying today    The VFW letter of April 14 says this       The national trust fund that you are proposing offers our members      who are sick and dying the opportunity to secure timely and fair      compensation for the injury they suffered in the course of serving      their country  I look forward to the testimony of Hershel Gober       the former Acting Secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs      and the current National Director of the Military Order of the      Purple Heart on the benefits of our bipartisan legislation for      veterans exposed to asbestos    The National Association of      Manufacturers also released a statement expressing their hope that      this legislation will engender broad support  I thank Governor      Engler for NAMs support and look forward to his      testimony today    These statements in many ways tell the      story of what we have already accomplished  the bipartisan efforts      of the last two years have been productive  With the dedicated      efforts of Judge Edward Becker and under the Chairmans leadership       the disparate interests have reached consensus on many issues such      as overall funding of  140 billion and a streamlined administrative      process within the Department of Labor  I look forward to Judge      Beckers expert testimony today on our bipartisan legislation         Last Congress I was disappointed by      the bill reported by the Judiciary Committee and by the partisan      bill  S 2290  that was subsequently introduced as a substitute for      that legislation  As compared to those efforts  our bipartisan bill      includes significant and necessary improvements  Our bill provides      higher compensation awards for victims  with  1 1 million for      victims of mesothelioma   300 000 to  1 1 million for lung cancer      victims   200 000 for victims of other cancers caused by asbestos        100 000 to  850 000 for asbestosis  and  25 000 for what we call      mixed disease cases    All unimpaired asbestos victims are      eligible for medical monitoring  and  unlike last years bills  this      bill provides for medical screening for high risk workers  a      relatively low cost way to help make sure that those most likely to      be harmed are properly diagnosed and treated  I want to thank the      hard working staff of the AFL CIO for their expertise in drafting      this medical screening program  I look forward to the testimony of      Peg Seminario from the AFL CIO on the improvements we have made and      on their suggestions for further refinements to this bipartisan      legislation    Another essential improvement  and one      strongly supported by organized labor  is the provision ensuring      that victims awards under the new trust fund will not be subject to      subrogation by insurance companies  This means that victims will      not have to give up any of their much deserved compensation just      because they received workers compensation or other insurance      benefits in the past    The initial funding of this trust is      both more realistic and more substantial than the partisan bill from      the last Congress  providing for almost  43 billion of the total       140 billion in the first five years  And  unlike the earlier bill       this bill ensures that the contributors into the fund will be a      matter of public record  as are their obligations to the fund        Our bill also guarantees that court      cases that have reached judgment or obtained verdicts will not be      upset by the new trust fund  unlike last years legislation       Similarly  last years bill would also have overridden all civil      settlements that had any remaining conduct outstanding  Our      bipartisan asbestos bill protects those settlements between named      defendants and named victims  and also protects settlements that      provide for health insurance or health care    In improving the way the asbestos      legislation handles exigent claims    those victims who are sickest      and may not have long to live    Senator Feinstein was instrumental      in developing a creative solution  I thank the senior Senator from     California for her tireless efforts on behalf of sick      and dying asbestos victims Under Senator Feinsteins approach       which we adopted  exigent cases may receive an immediate lump sum      payment  and  if the fund is not operational in nine months  these      sickest victims will be able to continue their cases in court    The problems we are addressing are      complex  this bill necessarily reflects these complexities  and its      drafting was not easy  The compromises we forged were difficult but      necessary to ensure that we created a trust fund that would provide      adequate compensation to the thousands of workers who have suffered       and continue to suffer  the devastating health effect of asbestos   The history of asbestos use in our      country must come to an end  Under a provision authored by Senator      Murray that we have included  this bill will ban its use  We must      halt the harm asbestos creates  and ameliorate the harm it has      already caused  The industrial and insurer participants in the      trust fund will gain the benefits of financial certainty and relief      from the stresses of litigation in the tort system  and the victims      will have a quicker and more efficient path to recovery   Through years of coping with and      examining this problem  there now is general consensus that a remedy      is needed  Those who have been coping directly with these complex      problems know this  and those of us in Congress who have spent      nearly three years examining these issues and forging solutions know      it  as well  We also know that the legislative terrain that lies      ahead for such a bold and complex initiative as this bill      exemplifies is fraught with obstacles  As legislators with more      than half a century of experience between us  Chairman Specter and I      know that what we are attempting here rates off the charts in      legislative degree of difficulty  and neither of us was born      yesterday  But all of us who have worked long and hard in reaching      this point also believe that this is not only worth doing  it also      needs to be done    I thank Chairman Specter  Senator      Feinstein  Senator Hatch  and others for working so hard with me on      this bipartisan legislation  I look forward to the testimony today      on our compromise legislation which will  at long last  help solve      the asbestos problem by providing fair compensation to victims of      asbestos exposure
