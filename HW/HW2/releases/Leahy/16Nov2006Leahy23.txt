       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Department Of Justice Civil Rights   Division Oversight                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             The Senate Judiciary Committee      today held an oversight hearing on the Department of Justices Civil      Rights Division  Below is Senator Leahys statement from the      hearing  followed by the list of witnesses who appeared before the      panel    Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Department Of Justice Civil Rights Division Oversight     November 16  2006  Today  the Committee is holding a      long awaited oversight hearing on the Civil Rights Division of the      Justice Department  More than a year ago  the  Washington Post ran two      front page articles detailing how President Bushs political      appointees within the Division were overriding career litigators      recommendations on crucial voting rights cases  Other newspapers      like the Boston Globe      have been investigating related issues  as well  A number of us      have raised concerns for some time  I regret that it has taken so      many months to schedule this hearing with the Assistant Attorney      General of the Civil Rights Division  and that it has been delayed      until this lame duck session    For almost 50 years  the Civil Rights      Division has stood at the forefront of Americas march toward      equality  Founded in 1957  the Division vigorously implemented      civil rights laws during the turbulent era of the Civil Rights      Movement  Its attorneys participated in landmark cases that helped      transform the legal landscape of our country and brought us closer      to the ideal of a more perfect union  These cases included      successfully prosecuting the murderers of civil rights workers       eliminating voter disenfranchisement laws  and battling      discrimination in education and government services throughout the      nation    There are several reports from former      career attorneys that under the current Administration the Civil      Rights Division is retreating from its historic roots  I am      concerned that President Bushs political appointees have reversed      longstanding civil rights policies and impeded civil rights      progress  There are disturbing reports that career lawyers have      been shut out of the Divisions decision making process  that the      Divisions civil rights enforcement on behalf of racial minorities      has sharply declined  and that the Department has packed the      Division with attorneys who have no background in civil rights      litigation    UNDUE POLITICAL      INFLUENCE  Just a few months ago  President Bush      signed into law the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act  VRA        He proudly declared that  m y administration will vigorously      enforce the provisions of this law  and we will defend it in      court  We need to ensure that is so    I fear that the Bush Administration      may  in this instance as in so many other instances  be saying one      thing  but doing another  Press accounts      indicate that this Administration used weak enforcement and partisan      manipulation to undermine the VRA in connection with last weeks      election  The Associated Press reports that the FBI      is looking into complaints that callers tried to intimidate or      confuse Democratic voters in the bitter contest between GOP Sen       George Allen and Democratic challenger Jim Webb  In Maryland  a      state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by nearly 2 to 1  sample      ballots suggesting Republican Gov  Robert L  Ehrlich and Senate      candidate Michael Steele were Democrats were handed out by people      bused in from out of state  The Associated Press reports that the      ballots were paid for by the campaigns of Mr  Ehrlich  Mr  Steele      and the Republican Party  Perhaps most disturbing  the  Arizona Republic reports      that in Tucson  three vigilantes  one  man carrying a camcorder  one holding a      clipboard  and one a holstered gun  stopped Hispanic      voters and questioned them outside a Tucson polling place    This      manipulation has been most evident in Section 5 preclearance  The      Supreme Court repeatedly has held that covered jurisdictions have      the burden to prove that voting changes will not harm minority      voters  If the jurisdiction failed to meet that burden       preclearance of the proposed electoral changes must be denied       Press reports indicate that contrary to the law  the Bush      Administration has turned this principle on its head  Political      appointees endorsed redistricting plans or restrictions on the      franchise  in Arizona  Georgia  Texas  and Mississippi  despite      the strong objections of career lawyers who expressed concerns about      the potential for those plans to discriminate against minority      voters    Career attorneys in the Voting Section      recommended that a Georgia law requiring a photo identification to      vote not be precleared because it would reduce black voters access      to the polls and therefore harm minority voters  The career      attorneys also found that  state officials in Georgia failed to      introduce key evidence regarding the racial impact of the law  Yet       political appointees overruled the career attorneys and approved the      law  The Dallas Morning News      broke a story that the Department adopted a new policy banning staff      attorneys opinions in voting rights cases  Under the new policy      the career attorneys recommendation was stripped out of that      document and was not forwarded to higher level officials in the      Division  This      marked a significant change in an institution that once took pride      in insulating itself from politics  I note that a majority of      Republican appointed judges on a federal appellate court agreed with      the career attorneys in this case when they later enjoined Georgia      from enforcing the law  labeling it a poll tax     There is also evidence that the Bush      Justice Department exerted undue political influence in cases that      consistently favored Republicans  In a 2002 Mississippi      redistricting case  the Voting Section stalled the redistricting      process for so long that a pro Republican redistricting plan went      into effect by default  In the recent Texas redistricting case  the     Washington Post noted      how highly unusual it was for political appointees to overrule      career attorneys unanimous finding that a redistricting plan put      the voting rights of minority citizens at risk  The      Supreme Court recently agreed with the career attorney      recommendation that the redistricting plan approved by the political      appointees in the Division hurt Hispanic voters in Texas  and      ordered Texas to redraw its plan   All of these cases demonstrate the      need for oversight at the Civil Rights Division  and the restoration      of the principle that partisan politics has no place in the      administration of justice     DISMAL ENFORCEMENT      RECORD  The Bush Administration has compiled      one of the worst civil rights records in modern American history       Over the last five years  the Civil Rights Division has filed only      two disparate impact cases under Title VII  Vote dilution claims      have come to a grinding halt  Only      four Section 2 VRA suits have been filed by this Administration on      behalf of any      minority group  The Divisions Appellate Section       which historically has intervened in key discrimination cases       filed only six amicus briefs in the courts of appeal in 2004  a      number that represents less than a third of the 22 briefs that were      filed in 1999  Even the number of criminal prosecutions brought by      the Justice Department for violations of civil rights laws      diminished from 83 in 2000 to 51 in 2003    The lack of cases filed by the Bush      Administration falsely gives the impression that overt      discrimination against minorities is a thing of the past  In nearly      six years of power  the Bush Administration has filed only     one suit on      behalf of African American voters  Until July of      2006  the Divisions only case alleging racial discrimination in      voting sought to protect white voters in Mississippi  During the      entire tenure of the Bush Administration  the Division has brought      only seven pattern or practice employment discrimination cases       only three of which alleged claims of racial or national origin      discrimination        and one of those was a case challenging the affirmative action      policies of Southern Illinois University as discriminatory       Regrettably discrimination against racial and ethnic minorities      persists  The Department must fulfill its duty to enforce the law      in these cases as well    POLITICS IN HIRING      AND FIRING   I am also concerned      about reports that political ideology has harmed the Civil Rights      Divisions hiring practices and ability to retain experienced      litigators  In the Voting Section alone  more than 20 attorneys       representing about two thirds of the lawyers in the section  have      left in the last few years  over a dozen have left the section in      the last 15 months  Included in this talent drain were the chief of      the section  three deputy chiefs  and many experienced trial      lawyers  representing almost 150 years of cumulative experience in      civil rights enforcement     The departures are not      my only cause for concern  The Bush Administrations political      appointees implemented a major policy change in its hiring process       Until 2002  hiring for career jobs in the Civil Rights Division      under all administrations  Democratic and Republican  had been      handled by civil servants  not political appointees  After the Bush      Administration disbanded the hiring committees  comprised of      veteran career lawyers  a noticeable shift in backgrounds of its      attorneys emerged  According to internal documents obtained by the     Boston Globe  only      42 percent of the lawyers hired since 2003       have civil rights      experience which is a downward turn as compared to two years before      the change where 77 percent of those    hired had civil rights      backgrounds  The Civil Rights Division apparently hired lawyers      with strong conservative credentials but little experience in civil      rights  Sound familiar  It should  this is the same hiring      philosophy that brought us the disastrous aftermath of Katrina        Over the past couple of years  we have      witnessed a radical assault by the Bush Administration on      fundamental assumptions about the exercise of power in our      constitutional system  Neither Congress nor a majority of the      American people favor radical departures from our nations      time honored tradition of civil rights enforcement      A TIME FOR      ACCOUNTABILITY  As the Committee responsible for      overseeing the Justice Department  we must ensure that the      Department is upholding its duty to protect the American people         all the people    from discrimination  Our civil rights laws      provide our Federal Government with the authority to impose criminal      and civil sanctions against individuals and institutions that      violate our peoples civil rights  They provide meaning to our      constitutional guarantees  If civil rights laws are ignored       particularly by the federal agency charged with their enforcement       discrimination will flourish  and the consequences for our nation      will be great  The great civil rights champion Representative John      Lewis rightly noted that American citizens have a right to know      whether the Justice Department is ignoring the law and bending to      the will of politics  Accountability is overdue    CONCLUSION  We welcome Assistant Attorney General      Wan Kim  We are glad to have you back before this Committee so that      we may more fully explore these issues with you    We also welcome the testimony of      several practitioners who have served in the Civil Rights Division       We will hear from Joe Rich  a well respected civil rights attorney       who worked in the Justice Department for 37 years and  until last      year  served as Chief of the Voting Section  We are also pleased to      hear from Ted Shaw  the current Director Counsel and President of      the NAACP Legal Defense Fund  who began his career as a trial      attorney in the Civil Rights Division
