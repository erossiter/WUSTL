Vermont    Economic and Community Development     Community Development Block Grants  CDBG            Used by states to help towns and cities promote community and economic          development and build affordable housing     FY 2005 Vermont Allocation   9 73            million this year statewide     1 04 million for            Burlington and  8 69 million for the rest of the state    FY 2006 Bush Request  The President            proposed eliminating the CDBG program  in its place combining 18            federal programs into a consolidated community development initiative            with a 40 percent cut in total funding  If the CDBG distribution            criteria are retained  Vermont will lose  3 9 million in            funding  However  if new criteria are developed all of the  9 73 million            in funding to Vermont is in jeopardy        Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP            A nationwide network of not for profit centers in nearly 350 locations

109 million   Vermont Manufacturing            Extension Center received about  400 000   President called for a 57 percent cut  to             46 8 million  for MEP in his FY 2006 budget        Amtrak  The backbone of national passenger          rail service  There are two lines running to Vermont  the          Ethan Allen Express and the Vermonter            FY 2005  Congress appropriated

to New York to Boston               For Vermont  this would            mean the Vermonter  with 252 238 passengers last year  and the Ethan            Allen Express  with 108 192 passengers last year  would cease            operations  cutting off transportation options for Vermonters and            reducing the number of tourists able to visit the Green Mountain State                 First

first          responders and citizens  public health  infrastructure security and other          public safety activities  While these programs vary considerably in          their size and scope  they all contribute to making the nation more          secure against the threat of terrorism  as well as other natural and          man made hazards     FY 2005        National Allocations   1 695

500 million        Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance          Grants Program  This program consolidates the old Local Law          Enforcement Block Grant program and the Byrne Formula program  Funding          under this program is available for  law enforcement programs           prosecution and court programs  prevention and education programs           corrections and community corrections programs  drug treatment programs           and planning  evaluation  and technology improvement programs  The          formula used for distributing funds under this program allocates 50          percent of funding based on population  and 50 percent based on violent          crime rates  The formula allocates 60 percent of funding to states and          40 percent to local governments    FY 2005 Allocation              634 000 000   Vermont  FY 2004               2 067 462   Presidents FY 2006 Request  Elimination      Agriculture  Environment  and Energy   Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC           Program  The Bush Administrations budget extends the MILC          program for two years while not making any changes in the current          formula  The program will continue to pay out when the price of milk          falls below  16 94 in Boston and payments will be made on the          first 2 4 million pounds of production            However  as is the case with every other USDA program that directly        pays producers for commodities  there would be a 5 percent reduction in        checks that go to the producers  If  for example  a producer is eligible        for a MILC check of  100 under the current formula  the farmer would then        get a check for  95 00 after the 5 percent reduction    Over        the past three years   Vermont has received  45 223 800 through the        MILC program  Under the Presidents proposal Vermont would have received         2 261 190 less in MILC payments since the program began in the 2002 Farm        Bill  Based on a projection of MILC payments done by the Food and        Agriculture Policy Research Institute  a 5 percent reduction in MILC        payments would mean approximately  1 560 000 less for Vermont dairies in        2006 2007      Environment  The Environmental Protection           Agency  Forest Service  Interior Department and Army Corps of Engineers           all would see budget

Champlain  The Presidents budget           for Lake Champlain falls far short of what is needed to protect and           restore the lake  including requests for only  955 000  which is much           less than the  11 million per year authorized by The Great Lakes and           Lake Champlain Act of 2002 and still considerably less than the  5           million the Vermont and New York delegation requested in FY06 in a           recent letter to EPA      Renewable Energy  The Presidents           budget also includes a  30 million dollar cut  38 percent  to research           for renewable bioenergy  an area of interest to Vermont farmers           and others in seeking to develop a biofuels industry for such things as           biodiesel      Conservation Programs  The Administration           has cut more than  500 million nationwide from working lands           conservation programs that help farmers affordably protect the           environment and work their land by promoting use of farmland for           agricultural production and habitat protection instead of development           and sprawl  All of these conservation programs were included in the           2002 Farm Bill            Specifically  the Bush budget cuts  200 million for the Environmental        Quality Incentives Program  EQIP   one of the primary federal programs        which farmers use to control phosphorus runoff going into Lake Champlain          Also        cut is  41 million from Senator Leahys Farmland Protection Program  which        helps landowners voluntarily protect their lands from development and which        was based on the Farms for the Future pilot program created by Leahy in         Vermont    The         Bush budget also proposes to eliminate funding for Senator Leahys         Agriculture Management Assistance program  AMA   which is a  20 million         dollar program that is targeted to help traditionally underserved states         by funding locally developed conservation programs  as well as by         providing organic certification cost share assistance     Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP            The Presidents budget proposes  1 8 billion for the regular LIHEAP          program and  200 million for contingency funding  For fiscal 2005           LIHEAP received  1 88 billion in regular funding and  297 6 million in          contingency funding  The Bush FY2006 budget proposes an  80 million  4 3          percent  decrease in regular funding and a  97 6 million  32 8 percent           decrease in contingency funding    Vermont  The state will            receive about  13 2 million in LIHEAP funding this year  Based on            Vermonts percentage of the FY 05 funds   63 percent   Vermont would            likely see approximately  1 26 million less next year         Education and Social Services   Education  One out of every three of the          programs targeted for reduction concerns education  The President has          proposed the elimination of 48 education programs  cutting  4 2 billion           while significantly under funding No Child Left Behind programs and Title          I funds for low income schools     Title I  Under the proposed Bush Budget            Vermont falls  24 million short of the level promised for Title I under            NCLB meaning that 7500 Vermont children

2006 Request             Elimination      Boys and Girls Clubs of   America     Congress has authorized and appropriated a           rising level of funding for the Boys  Girls Clubs of America in each of           the last eight years because of the clubs proven role in discouraging           youth gangs  drug abuse and youth violence  The Presidents budget plan           reduces funding for Boys and Girls Clubs by  15 million  from  85           million to  60 million  and completely ignores the five year           authorization for the Boys and Girls Club grant program enacted by           Congress under legislation co authored by Senator Leahy and signed by           the President in 2004  In Vermont and across the nation            Boys  Girls Clubs are a proven and growing success in preventing crime           and supporting children  In FY 2004  the Boys  Girls Clubs of Vermont           were awarded  1 185 000 in national grants        FY        2005 Allocation   85 000 000                President Bush called for a  15 million cut in Boys  Girls Clubs funding         in his FY 2006 budget  from  85 million to  60 million  30 percent     Veterans    The Administrations budget is            significantly less than what major veterans associations determined            would be a healthy funding level in their annual Independent Budget              The Presidents budget request also asks            some veterans to pay onerous enrollment fees and much higher            prescription drug costs
