       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fine s   Letter Reporting That His Inquiry Will Examine Attorney General Gonzales    Testimony                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On DOJ Inspector General Glenn Fines Letter     Reporting That His Inquiry Will Examine     Attorney General Gonzales Testimony     August 30  2007  I am pleased that Department of      Justice Inspector General Glenn Fine will look into my concerns      about potentially false  misleading or inappropriate testimony by      the Attorney General  I look forward to the Inspector Generals      findings on the unprecedented firings of nine United States      Attorneys  the improper political hiring of career officials within      the Justice Department  the misuse of National Security Letters  and      the efforts to bypass the Departments finding that a warrantless      surveillance program was without legal basis  These actions have      eroded the publics trust and undermined morale within our justice      system  from the top ranks to the cop on the beat  The current      Attorney General is leaving  but these questions remain  It is      appropriate that the Inspector General will examine whether the      Attorney General was honest with this and other Congressional      committees about these crucial issues  His investigations can help      restore independence and accountability  which have been sorely      lacking at the Justice Department                   A copy of      Inspector General Fines letter  delivered today         The text of      Chairman Leahys earlier letter    to Inspector General Fine is below                     August 16  2007   Honorable Glenn A  Fine     Inspector General     The Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW     Washington  D C  20530 0001   Dear Inspector General      Fine    I am writing to ask that      you investigate and evaluate potential misleading  evasive  or      dishonest testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales before the      Senate Judiciary Committee on July 24  2007  and in previous      hearings before this and other congressional Committees  I have      identified numerous instances in which the Attorney General appears      to have contradicted his own previous testimony or the statements or      testimony of other senior officials  or where he appears to have      engaged in efforts to mislead  I have given him an opportunity to      clarify and revise his testimony  but he has not meaningfully      addressed our significant concerns    I ask that you review      the Attorney Generals testimony and compare it with other testimony      and evidence to determine whether his testimony was in any instances      intentionally false  misleading  or inappropriate  Consistent with      your jurisdiction  please do not limit your inquiry to whether or      not the Attorney General has committed any criminal violations       Rather  I ask that you look into whether the Attorney General  in      the course of his testimony  engaged in any misconduct  engaged in      conduct inappropriate for a cabinet officer and the nations chief      law enforcement officer  or violated any duty  including the duty      set out in federal regulations for government officials to avoid any      conduct which gives the appearance of a violation of law or of      ethical standard  regardless of whether there is an actual violation      of law    Potential misleading      statements that you may wish to examine include  but are not limited      to the following instances    1           Attorney General Gonzales testified on July 24  2007  that the Gang      of Eight  consisting of members of Congress  told him that despite      the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney General  who as Acting      Attorney General had found a warrantless surveillance program to be      without legal basis  the government should go forward with these      very important intelligence activities  According to press      accounts  at least three members of Congress who were present for      the described meeting dispute the testimony that they recommended      proceeding with the program over the Acting Attorney Generals      objections    2           Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate Judiciary      Committee on February 6  2006  that neither former Deputy Attorney      General James Comey nor other officials had concerns about the      Terrorist Surveillance Program  TSP  that was confirmed by the      President  In a June 5  2007  press conference  Attorney General      Gonzales stated that a dispute with Mr  Comey concerned this very      program  though he later retracted that statement  At his July 24      hearing  Attorney General Gonzales said that there was no dissent      about the TSP  and that the disagreement concerned other      intelligence activities  Numerous officials  including members of      the Gang of Eight and FBI Director Robert Mueller have indicated      that the disputes did concern the TSP  and that there was only one      program  Attorney General Gonzales in an August 1  2007  letter to      me set out a legalistic explanation stating that the disputed      activities and the TSP were separate components of a single program    3           Attorney General Gonzales said in April 27  2005  testimony before      the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with regard to National      Security Letters  NSLs  and other information gathering techniques      that statutory civil liberties safeguards had been effective and      that  t here has not been one verified case of civil liberties      abuse  Similarly  his responses to written questions following his      April 19  2007  Senate Judiciary Committee hearing indicated that he      had not learned of problems with NSLs prior to your March 2007      report on the issue  Documents obtained in a Freedom of Information      Act lawsuit indicated that the Attorney General had in fact received      numerous reports in 2005 and 2006 of violations in connection with      NSLs and other surveillance tools  The Attorney General in his July      24 testimony suggested that his prior testimony and answers were      premised on the fact that he was not aware of any intentional      violations  The Washington Post      has reported that at least one intentional violation was reported in      the relevant time period    4      In      March press appearances  Attorney General Gonzales said that he had      not been involved in deliberations as to which United States      Attorneys should be fired  Documents and testimony obtained by the      Senate Judiciary Committee showed that the Attorney General attended      a November 27  2006  meeting at which the firings were approved  In      subsequent testimony  Attorney General Gonzales has taken      responsibility for the firings and said that he attended this      meeting  but he has maintained that he does not know who was      responsible for selecting the names of U S  Attorneys to be fired      and does not remember what was said at the November 27 meeting  He      has at times placed primary responsibility for which U S  Attorneys      were selected to be fired on his former Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson      and former Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty  each of whom denies      making the determinations    5      In his      April 19  2007  testimony  Attorney General Gonzales said  I      havent talked to witnesses because of the fact that I havent      wanted to interfere with this investigation  In May 23  2007       testimony to the House Judiciary Committee  former White House      liaison Monica Goodling testified that the Attorney General had a      discussion with her that made her uncomfortable in which he set      out his version of events regarding the process of firing U S       Attorneys and asked for her reaction  In his July 24 testimony       Attorney General Gonzales said he had a conversation with Goodling      to console and reassure an emotionally distraught woman and to      reassure her that as far as I knew  no one had done anything      intentionally wrong here    These and other examples      suggest a possible pattern of misleading answers and an effort to      avoid disclosing the full truth  I look forward to your review and      report as to the propriety of the Attorney Generals testimony       Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter    Sincerely    PATRICK      LEAHY      Chairman
