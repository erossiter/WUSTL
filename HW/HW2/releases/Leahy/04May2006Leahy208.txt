       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Medical Malpractice Debate                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Medical Malpractice Debate     Senate Floor     May 4  2006 Once again  the      Senate is being asked by the Majority Leader to consider legislation      designed to limit the rights of victims of medical malpractice to      achieve justice in their courts   Americas courts      belong to the American people  not to the special interests  Not      only are these bills bad public policy  but they are especially      ill timed in light of numerous pressing issues that face the country      today  We should be debating the priorities of the American people       including energy policy and skyrocketing gas prices  the war in      Iraq  the comprehensive immigration bill  stem cell research and the      horrific genocide in Darfur  I am disappointed that the Majority      Leader has decided instead that the Senates and publics valuable      time should be taken up with these bills  I am also disappointed      that the Majority Leader has decided to bypass any committee      consideration of these bills  They have failed in the past  and I      suspect they will fail this time around as well   This is a special      interest bill that benefits the insurance companies at the expense      of patients with legitimate injuries  This debate about medical      malpractice reform ignores the needs of victims whose lives have      been forever harmed in such ways as to require lifelong care    Let me give you a      real life example in my home state of Vermont to illustrate how this      cap can hurt victims of medical malpractice  On April 7  2000       Diana Winn Levine had a severe migraine headache and went to a      health center in Plainfield  Vermont  Ms  Levine  a musician       received a painkiller along with an injection of another sedative       and later complications caused two amputation surgeries of her left      arm   Ms  Levine sued      the corporate giant Wyeth for improper guidelines on the sedative       which did not warn of dangerous combinations with painkillers that      are commonly prescribed for emergency care  As Ms  Levine      explained  I never expected to sue anyone in my life  Sometimes      it takes something like this to make it known when a drug is not      being used right  After a full trial  a jury of her peers in      Vermont found that Ms  Levine deserved  2 4 million for her past and      future medical expenses and  5 million for the daily pain she does      suffer and for the lost of enjoyment of her life  This bill would      have arbitrarily slashed this jury verdict by at least  4 750 000       Such a flat cap is not fair or just  and is particularly cruel when      it applies to children who will require costly medical care for the      rest of their lives as the result of medical errors  To limit an      award to an arbitrary amount does not begin to take into account the      real needs of victims   One can only      think that this legislation is political  This legislation fails to      address the root cause of medical malpractice  and it does nothing      to provide incentives for members of the medical profession to work      collectively to prevent instances of medical error  As much as we      all recognize and value our medical professionals  we must also      acknowledge that medical errors kill up to 100 000 people each      year  One out of every 100 hospitalized patients suffers negligent      care  More people die as the result of medical errors than      automobile and workplace accidents combined  yet only 3 percent of      those injured file a claim  These statistics tell us there is not      so much a malpractice lawsuit problem as a medical safety problem        I fail to see how      arbitrarily limiting the rights of citizens addresses this serious      problem  particularly because in many cases the judicial system is      the only forum in which such an error is brought to light  Rather      than looking for ways to limit our citizens access to justice  we      should look for ways in which we can encourage the medical community      to strive for the highest standards in the delivery of its      services  It is in our interest as citizens  and it is certainly in      the interest of all the dedicated and caring people in the medical      profession whose oath commands them to do no harm  My wife Marcelle      dedicated her career to the care of others through nursing  and I      know how seriously those in the medical profession take their solemn      responsibilities  The best place for positive change to occur is      from within the medical profession  not from within our courtrooms       The bills on the      floor today favor the interests of insurance companies over      patients  the interests of profit over sound health care  and they      provide illusory promises of lower insurance rates for doctors       while addressing none of the underlying causes of medical      malpractice  This is not the fix that is needed   We hear numerous      complaints from politicians about the harm malpractice lawsuits      cause to patient access and the medical profession  We hear claims      about doctors practicing defensive medicine at the expense of      innovation and aggressive treatment  We hear claims about doctors      fleeing communities  We hear claims about the reluctance of our      young people to enter the medical professions  We hear claims about      pregnant women who cannot find obstetricians to provide care      throughout pregnancy and birth  There might be some merit to this      legislation if these claims we routinely hear were true  They are      not   The myths      associated with medical malpractice lawsuits have virtually all been      discredited  Two of the primary arguments in favor of capping      non economic damages are lowering insurance premiums and preventing      doctors from leaving their state or their profession  The available      data suggests that these arguments are unfounded  In my home state      of Vermont  the most recent data shows that the number of physicians      practicing in the state has risen steadily from 1 918 doctors in      1996  to 2 589 doctors in 2004  The number of OB GYNs in Vermont is      also higher today than it was in 2000  Today Vermont residents      benefit from 113 OB GYNs  compared with 91 in 2000   This trend exists      nationally as well  The number of physicians nationally has risen      between 1996 and 2004  We also now have more physicians under the      age of 35 today than we did in 1996  The number of doctors per      capita in this country has been steadily increasing since 1965  It      is hard to understand how these trends can be characterized as the      loss of people from the medical profession  There is also no      correlation between a state damages cap and the number of doctors      practicing in the state  Nationally  states without caps have 14      percent more practicing physicians   We also hear a      lot about increasingly burdensome medical malpractice premiums       There is no doubt that health care providers pay onerous amounts to      be insured  and I agree this needs to be addressed  I have      introduced a bill directed specifically toward medical malpractice      insurance reform  which I am confident will help solve this      apparently unjustified phenomenon  I hope the Judiciary Committee      has a chance to consider it   This chart      suggests that there is no correlation between malpractice claims and      rising insurance premiums  Between 2000 and 2004  based on data      from the 15 best rated medical malpractice insurers  premiums      increased 134 percent  despite the fact that claim payments remained      flat for the same period  I find it hard to see any proof in this      data that medical malpractice claims have driven the exorbitant      increases in malpractice premiums   Proponents of      this legislation also claim that it will drastically reduce      insurance costs  but even members of the insurance community have      disclaimed tort reform as the magic bullet to lower insurance      costs  The Chicago Tribune quoted Dennis Kelly  a      spokesman for the American Insurance Association  as saying  We      have not promised price reductions with tort reform  Sherman      Joyce  President of the American Tort Reform Association was quoted      as saying  We wouldnt tell you or anyone that the reason to pass      tort reform would be to reduce insurance rates  These statements      are supported by statistical evidence  The majority of states that      have enacted caps have seen no reduction in premiums  In fact  on      average  doctors in states with caps pay more for insurance than in      states without caps   This legislation      will have tangible benefits to one group  medical malpractice      insurance companies  whose profits in 2005 were more than twice that      of Fortune Five Hundred companies  Just as we have recently begun      to do with rising gas prices and record oil company profits  perhaps      Congress should be asking medical malpractice insurers exactly why      their premiums are so exorbitant    if its not medical malpractice      claims  what is it  A soft stock market  Bad investments  Greed       If we remove the fallacy of the premium lawsuit connection  what is      left  I think this is a question that needs to be asked  Our      doctors  like all American consumers  deserve fairness and honesty      in the marketplace   As we consider      the Majority Leaders bills  I urge other senators to help expose      the myths associated with the legislation we address today  In      fairness to the American people  we should be debating the facts       not the myths  If we acknowledge that the real problem is medical      malpractice and the injuries and deaths that result  and not the      lawsuits that seek to remedy these harms  I know we can go a long      way to helping the medical profession work from within to assure      that doctors meet the highest possible standards and strive to      prevent medical errors  After all  those in the medical profession      are in the best position to understand what changes must occur  and      how best to make sure that needed changes occur  As an example of      this I want to highlight the efforts of anesthesiologists  who      accomplished a nearly seven fold reduction in anesthesia related      errors through cooperative changes to their systems and practices       Not surprisingly  when anesthesia related errors decreased  so did      insurance premiums  This should be our model of how to effectively      address medical malpractice  If we work together  between needed      reforms in the insurance industry  and by supporting medical      professionals in improving the critical work they do  I know we can      tackle this problem effectively   I know that no      doctor wants to harm a patient  but the solution is not to take away      the rights of those who are harmed  Let us not chase a partisan       myth laden solution to a non existent problem  Let us direct our      energies toward making American health care better by finding cures      to diseases  getting more Americans insured and investing in health      care prevention
