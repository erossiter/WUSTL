       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Human Rights Violations In Nepal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Human Rights Violations In Nepal      June 29  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I want       to make the Senate aware of a report I recently became aware of       by the Advocacy Forum  a respected organization which documents       human rights violations in Nepal by both government security       forces and the Maoists    The Forum s latest report        released this week  describes the widespread use of torture on       persons in custody  The overwhelming majority of documented       cases are attributed to the Nepalese police  military and armed       police  There are also cases attributed to the Maoists     The descriptions of the use of       torture in this report are difficult to read  It is appalling       that such barbaric acts of cruelty occur in the 21st century        Unfortunately  we know that this is not unique to Nepal  Torture       is routine in dozens of countries    Nepal today is at a crossroads        Since popular demonstrations forced King Gyanendra to back away       from his foolhardy power grab last February 1  there has been       progress towards strengthening Nepal s fledgling democratic       institutions and beginning a dialog to resolve the conflict  The       future is unpredictable  however  and we continue to receive       disturbing reports of extortion and abductions by the Maoists        and of resistance by the Nepalese military to much needed       reform    Addressing these issues  and       ending the use of torture and other human rights violations        will require new laws to protect the rights of detainees in       accordance with international norms  reform of the judiciary so       it is fully independent and has the resources to effectively       carry out its responsibilities  reform of the military and       police so they are placed fully under civilian authority and       subject to the rule of law  and prosecutions of those       responsible for violations  The international community can and       should help support Nepal in taking these difficult  essential       steps    All Senators should be aware of       the cases documented by the Advocacy Forum  and I ask unanimous       consent that a summary of the report be printed in the Record         There being no objection  the       material was ordered to be printed in the Record  as       follows      Advocacy Forum  Nepal   Sharing Experiences of Torture       Survivors  Summary of Data   Advocacy Forum is a non profit       making non governmental organization working to promote the rule       of law and human rights in Nepal  Our core activities are       documentation of cases of human rights violations  monitoring of       detention centres  providing legal aid to the victims of human       rights violations and involving advocacy in contesting impunity        As part of our on going work to address human rights violations       and denials of access to justice  through our central  regional       and district based offices  we make daily visits to a number of       police detention centres in 9 districts and document and monitor       human rights violations  We do not have access to military       detention centres  but victims of torture at these centres have       contacted us to report their experiences  as have victims of the       Maoists  Evidence of human rights  abuse is systematically and       thoroughly documented    Over a period of five years  July       2001 to April 2006  Advocacy Forum documented 5682 cases of       human rights violations focusing on extra judicial killings        198   forced disappearances  335   torture  2 271   rape of       women  41   and illegal detention  2 837  committed by the state       security forces and the Maoists  During this period we were put       under extreme threatening pressure by the State  Maoist and       vigilantes in carrying out our activities  Similarly we observed       the great security risk experienced by victims and witnesses         Last year Advocacy Forum issued a       press statement on 26 June covering the cases that we had       documented up to March 2005  Because of the political situation       we could not provide details of the torture and experiences of       the victims  Between March 2005 to April 2006  we documented 951       cases of torture and 17 cases of rape committed by the State and       Maoists  This report sets out some of the experiences of those       torture victims who managed to survive and want to share their       experiences  Some of the victims  names have been changed to       protect their safety    When Advocacy Forum intensified       the challenge against illegal detention  last year alone  March       05 April 06  through habeas corpus  418 people who had been       detained illegally for a prolonged period of time were released       from different detention centres  We were shocked to learn that       every single person arrested by army soldiers and held in       military detention reported that they had been severely       tortured  Their torture experiences varied from deprivation of       food to electric shock and rape of women  We do not have the       capacity to measure the psychological torture and its effect on       the victims and their families  Many of the victims reported       that they were threatened not to share their experiences with       anyone  in particular human rights groups  Many said that they       were ordered to report to the barracks regularly  There was a       complete absence of any protection for the victims  So  they       were forced into silence  and no survivor could dare to       challenge these atrocities    Despite all these difficulties        even putting their lives at risk  some victims who had been       released from detention played a significant role in the release       of others who were languishing in different detention centres       undergoing severe torture for a prolonged period of time  By       sharing their experiences as to how other fellow detainees were       treated in detention and their conditions  they helped us to       coordinate our efforts and publicize the whereabouts of some       missing people and to release many others    From July 2001 to April 2006       Advocacy Forum documented 2271 cases of torture  Last year alone        March 2005 April 2006   we documented 951 cases of torture and       17 rape cases  Out of these 951 torture cases  511 were       committed by the police  371 by the military and 11 by the armed       police  We also documented 12 cases of torture by the state       sponsored vigilantes and 46 cases of torture inflicted by the       Maoists  Because of the security risk  177 survivors released       from military detention did not want to share the full details       of their torture with us  Excluding those cases  we have       thoroughly documented the details of torture in 774 cases        Children as young as 14 years old were also arrested and       detained  Out of 951 torture survivors 349  37   were juveniles        below the age of 18 years old     It should be borne in mind that        due to the limitations on our access to victims  our records       only cover a small proportion of the victims of torture  It is       impossible to estimate how many victims of torture there are in       total in Nepal  but we would guess that we have recorded only       10  of the current cases    Analyzing the 774 cases documented       last year  we have found that the commonly used methods of       torture in barracks include blindfolding for a prolonged period       of time  up to 21 months   electric shocks  suffocating the       victims by pouring water into the nose and mouth  hanging upside       down  rape and sexual abuse  piercing under nails  burying        keeping in an abnormal position  tying hands and feet around a       stick and swinging the body around  random beatings  fake       executions and threats of killing    The commonly practiced methods of       torture in police detention centers are beatings on soles by       plastic pipes  rolling the muscles of thighs  random beatings       and forcing victims to sit in an abnormal position     We also documented 46 cases of       torture inflicted by the Maoists  They have also been practicing       torture systematically to punish and to terrorize people  The       commonly used methods of the Maoists are breaking the legs and       bones of different parts of the body by hitting with heavy       objects  wounding and random beatings  They have also put people       for a prolonged period of time in   labor camps       Out of 371 reported cases of       torture in the barracks  Bhairabnath Battalion  Maharajgunj       Barracks  Kathmandu  Youdha Bhairab Battalion  Maharajgunj       Barracks  Kathmandu  Jagadal Battalion  Chauni Barracks        Kathmandu  Mahabirgan Battalion  Chauni Barracks  Kathmandu        Bhimkali Battalion  Chisapani Barracks  Banke  Rajdal Barracks        Lalitpur  Fulbari Barracks  Pokhara  Kaski  Bijaypur Barracks        Kaski  Shivadal Battalion  Gorusinghe Barracks  Kapilvastu        Dhulikhel Barracks in Kavre  Devi Dutta Battalion  Suparitar       Barracks in Makawanpur  and Bhawani Box Battalion  Dailekh       Barracks in Dailekh are the ones where most of the victims were       tortured    Out of 511 torture cases by the       police  Valley Crime Investigation Branch  Hanumandhoka  Gausala       Ward Police Station  Boudha Ward Police Stations  Kalimati Ward       Police Stations  Balaju Ward Police Stations  District Police       Office Morang  District Police Office Banke  District Police       Office Kanchanpur  District Police Office Udapur  District       Police Office  Kapilbastu  District Police Office  Kaski are the       police stations where most of the victims were tortured  Of       those people we interviewed in police detention centres  35 5        in Nepal  43 8  in Kathmandu said that they had been tortured        However  Advocacy Forum only has access to those people detained       by the police who are then taken to Court for remand  If       statistics for people released before being taken to Court were       included  we consider the percentage of those who have been       tortured by the police may be considerably higher     Torture is also a result of the       failure of the criminal justice system  Though the political       context of the country has been changed  the practice of torture       has not  Torture is routinely practiced in detention even today        In May 2006 alone we documented 72 cases of torture in 21       different police detention centers  The pattern  ways and       techniques of the police remain the same as before  Likewise        the judges and the prosecutors continue with their previous       prejudices and practices  Neither the judges nor the public       prosecutors are adequately sensitized on the issue     The existing system forces victims       of torture to remain silent  What happens in practice is that if       a person is arrested  generally that person will be detained for       some days without any custody record  the authority does not       even acknowledge the detention of that person  and there is no       mechanism that allows inspection or scrutiny of the detention       records of the police  During this period the detainee is       tortured  When his or her wounds and bruises are healed  the       police prepare a paper that shows that the detainee was arrested       less than 24 hours previously  24 hours being the legal limit       within which a detainee should be presented to a judge  The       detainee is then escorted by the police from the same office to       the court  In the presence of the police the judge extends the       remand  During this period  detainees are rarely given access to       medical services or lawyers  When a detainee goes to prison or       comes out of custody only then does he or she share the       incidences of torture with others  If a case for compensation is       filed  the victim is likely to lose the case as he or she will       be fail to prove evidence of torture  In the absence of medical       reports  it is hard to convince a judge    The whole issue of torture is also       related to the issues of an independent and professional police       system  independent judiciary and the office of the Attorney       Generals  So  it is important that we have a wider discussion       about making the criminal justice system more functional and       efficient in eliminating torture and for the promotion of rule       of law and fair trial    Since 2001  Advocacy forum has       helped 40 torture victims to bring a case challenging their       torture and demanding compensation  Out of 40 cases  11 have       been already been quashed as the victims were unable to provide       sufficient evidence of torture  in particular any medical report       proving the claim  Victims have also lost their cases because       they were unable to establish that they were in custody when       they were tortured  For example  Mainya Tamang was arrested on 7       November 2004 by the police of Ward Police Station  Bouddha        Following her arrest  she was then taken to the same ward police       station where she was detained for two days illegally and for       two days she was severely beaten and tortured  On 9 November       2004 she was transferred to Kalimati Women s Cell where she was       again beaten  On 11 November 2004 the police prepared a paper       showing that she was arrested that day and produced her to the       District Court of Kathmandu for remand  On 27 December 2004        Advocacy Forum filed a case on her behalf demanding compensation       for the torture inflicted upon her while she was in detention        Her case was quashed both in the District Court and on appeal in       the Appellate Court as both Courts said that at the time when       she claims that she was tortured  there was no evidence to prove       that she was in detention    Out of the 40 cases that we have       represented  only 4 victims of torture by the police have so far       been awarded compensation of 10 000 Nepali Rupees  approximately       US  135   but they still have not received this compensation        Other cases are still sub judice of the court     Advocacy Forum has faced a number       of difficulties in bringing cases of torture  In the beginning        the Court would not even let us register a complaint where       military were the accused  The Court asks a victim to prove that       he or she was tortured rather than the accused having to prove       that the victim was not tortured while in their custody  Those       people who remained in custody for many weeks and months without       any records of their detention  without access to medical       services  lawyers or families have very little chance of proving       that they were tortured  In addition  the Torture Compensation       Act provides that if the complaint is filed with   malafide         intention  the victim will be fined up to 5 000 Nepali Rupees        As it is very difficult to prove the case of torture  many       victims are discouraged from doing so as the chances of being       found guilty of bringing the case with malafide intention and       being fined are very high  Thus  the victims have no protection        In many incidents they reported to us that they were put under       pressure to retract their complaint  No witness could dare to       testify in their favor as they also have no protection  Thus        the whole system is hostile against the victims and favors the       perpetrators    One of the major problems in the       case of torture is the failure of the State to criminalize the       act of torture  Since 1996 the UN Committee against Torture has       been asking the Government of Nepal to criminalize the act of       torture  but the State has failed to do so  Furthermore  the       existing Torture Compensation Act does not comply with Nepal s       international obligations  To make it compatible with Nepal s       international obligations  the Torture Compensation Act of Nepal       has to be amended in such a way that criminalizes the act of       torture  puts the burden of proof on the custody taking       officers  includes provisions for the protection of victims and       witnesses  ensures lawyers and families have access to detainees       right from the beginning of arrest  makes it mandatory for the       list of detainees to be made public and put under public       scrutiny  if anyone is found to be detained without record  the       officer in charge is accountable  makes provision that ensures       perpetrators of torture from other countries are extradited or       prosecuted  and ensures that no one will be extradited to any       country if there is a risk of torture in that country     In addition  the following changes       to the law are necessary    Mechanisms of transitional justice       to deal with past cases of human rights violations including       torture    An increase in the current maximum       amount of compensation  which is currently 100 000 Nepali Rupees        approximately US  1 350  plus a change to allow the recovery of       medical expenses  and   Changes to the laws of evidence to       ensure that evidence produced under torture or duress is       inadmissible by making prosecutors provide proof that evidence       was voluntary    In conclusion  the State has the       obligation to investigate all past cases of human rights       violations including torture and to prevent violations in the       future  A functional mechanism has to be set up to address past       violations of human rights including torture and to take       measures to prevent such occurring in the future  One way to       prevent the future occurrence of such violations is to prosecute       those responsible for violations committed in the past  It is       also urgent to amend the existing Torture Compensation Act to       make it compatible with the provisions of the U N  conventions       against torture
