       White House response To Leahy s Letter On Reagan Library Documents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           White      House Response To Leahy s Letter On Reagan Library Documents  Following is the text of a letter from      WH Counsel Harriet Miers to Senate Judiciary Committee Ranking      Member Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    delivered late Thursday  in which      Miers guarantees dates by which the Senate Judiciary Committee will      receive Reagan Library documents that have been promised to the      committee  The letter responds to Leahys letter to the President      of Aug  9    Responding to the Miers letter  Leahy      said  I welcome these assurances  Senators need sufficient time      to evaluate Judge Robertss record in order to make informed      judgments about this nomination  But I hope that no records will be      withheld from the Senate under the broad and undefined      constitutionally based privilege cited in the White House letter                   August 11  2005  Dear Senator Leahy   I am responding on behalf of President      Bush to your letter of August 9 2005  inquiring about the status of      the availability for review of records at the Ronald Reagan Library       I am sending a similar response to Senator Schumer today   As you most likely are aware  we      requested expedited opening of the records in Judge Roberts  staff      files at the Ronald Reagan Library  As a result  I am very pleased      to report that the files of particular interest identified in your      letter of July 26  2005  should be opened no later than Monday       August 15 2005  With respect to the remainder of the available      records at the Reagan Library  we expect the opening process to be      complete no later than August 22  2005  We are grateful to the staff      of both the Reagan Library and the National Archives and Records      Administration  NARA   whose efforts have made it possible to      significantly compress a time consuming process that ordinarily      takes many months   As I am sure you are aware  prior to      the opening of records such as those you have requested from the      Ronald Reagan Library  certain reviews must be completed  First       NARA staff must review every page to determine whether      any records must be withheld  under law due to concerns such as      national security or personal privacy  Then the representative for      former President Ronald Reagan and the White House Counsel s Office      review the records for possible assertions of Constitutionally based      privilege  Although Constitutionally based privilege may be asserted      to protect records reflecting deliberative processes  we have      determined that as a general matter records will not be withheld on      that basis  This decision will make available thousands of pages of      records related to Judge Roberts  work in the White House Counsel s      Office that clearly fall within and could be withheld pursuant to      that Constitutionally based privilege       We look forward to working with you     Harriet Miers     Counsel to the President     The Honorable Patrick Leahy     United States Senate      Washington  DC 20510                For reference  below is Leahys Aug       9 letter to which the Miers letter responds     Leahy Asks Greater      White House Cooperation     On Reagan Library Documents     August 9  2005   Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt   ranking member  Senate Judiciary Committee       late Tuesday sent a letter to President Bush requesting greater      White House cooperation in supplying documents the White House      already has agreed to provide to the panel  Leahy  writing on      behalf of all eight Democratic members of the committee  noted that      White House cooperation is essential to the Senate Judiciary      Committees preparation for the confirmation hearings that will      begin Sept  6         Leahys letter follows up a White House letter delivered last Friday      night which responds to the Judiciary Democrats request for      prioritizing documents from the Reagan Library  The Friday White      House letter reports that Reagan Library officials are prioritizing      files on the basis of highest usefulness to the Judiciary Committee      before forwarding them to the White House  but the letter does not      indicate that the White House is doing the same after its      file by file reviews are completed  The new Leahy letter asks that      the White House  like the Reagan Library  also focus on priority      documents first  Leahy further asks that documents  once White      House reviews are finished  be provided to the committee on a      rolling basis to speed the process  Leahy noted that some of these      documents have been selectively provided to the press but not yet to      the Judiciary Committee  Leahy  on behalf of the committees      Democratic members  also asks the White House for a progress report      and timetable on its handling of the Reagan Library documents     The      text of the letter follows          CONTACT  David Carle  202 224 3693                               August 9  2005   President George W  Bush     The White House     Washington  D C  20500   Dear Mr  President     I write on      behalf of Democratic Members of the Committee on the Judiciary to      thank you for your response last Friday to our July 26  2005       letter  Our letter had requested that the White House prioritize      and provide on a rolling basis selected files relating to the work      of John G  Roberts  Jr   in the Department of Justice and in the      Office of White House Counsel  I also write to inquire about      numerous pending questions from our earlier correspondence that were      not answered in your letter last Friday  While the information we      received from your Office of Legislative Affairs was useful  it did      not address many of our questions about the handling  processing       and delivery of those documents to the Committee in time for Judge      Robertss confirmation hearing  Timely cooperation from the      Administration is essential to the Committees preparations for the      upcoming hearings      We      understand that the process of reviewing the approximately 50 000      pages of relevant papers housed in the Reagan Library in Simi      Valley  California  is well underway  Published reports state that      the head of the Library has estimated that such a review would take      three weeks  and the National Archives website estimates the      documents will be made public by mid August  Nonetheless  on August      5  2005  it was reported in the      Washington Post that the White House already has      possession of some of those Reagan era documents  and that someone      in the White House had provided at least two of them to the      newspaper     In our      previous letter  we asked that certain of the files relating to      Judge Roberts in the Reagan Library be processed first  because they      were of the greatest interest to us and possibly are the most      relevant to the confirmation process  While your letter of last      Friday indicates that you have requested that the Reagan Library      prioritize the files in which we are particularly interested  we      would appreciate a similar assurance that the White House itself      will do the same  We also asked that the documents be produced to      us on a rolling basis  as various documents have already been      reviewed as required by the Presidential Records Act  With the  Washington Posts      disclosure that the White House is in possession of some of these      documents  it appears that this request has also been ignored or      rejected     We renew      those requests and also request a progress report on the work of      reviewing the documents in general and the priority files in      particular  and a timetable for giving us the priority documents  as      well as the remainder of the documents  We certainly believe that      making the documents available to the Senate Judiciary Committee in      small batches as they are processed will be easier for all those      involved in reviewing the documents than having to copy  read  and      analyze 50 000 or more documents at once  We recognize that the      White House must complete its own review after receiving documents      from the Reagan Library or the National Archives  but it is clear      from press reports that such a review has already begun  We are      especially concerned that upon reviewing these documents someone in      the White House provided them to the press but not to the Committee       if there are any other such documents we should receive them      immediately     Senator      Kennedy and Senator Schumer separately wrote to you late last week      with their concern that the documents will not be made available to      us in time for a meaningful review before the hearing begins on      September 6th  We all share that concern and hope that with your      cooperation the Senate Judiciary Committee can begin reviewing those      documents that have been processed  and any other documents that      have been provided to the press  as they become available      Respectfully      PATRICK LEAHY     Ranking Democratic Member   cc  Andrew H  Card  Jr
