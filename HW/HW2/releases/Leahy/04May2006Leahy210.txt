       Statement Of Sen  Patrick LEahy On The Nomination Of Norman Randy Smith                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Nomination Of Norman Randy Smith      Executive Business Meeting      May 4  2006 In nominating      Judge Norman Randy Smith of Idaho for a lifetime appointment to the      Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit  President Bush broke with      the longstanding precedent of filling circuit court vacancies with a      nominee from the same State as the judge who created the vacancy       This President      has tried this maneuver before when he nominated Claude Allen of      Virginia to fill a Maryland vacancy on the Fourth Circuit  The      Senators from Maryland objected  That nomination should not have      gone forward but the previous Republican Chairman insisted on      proceeding with a hearing and required the Senators from Maryland      and Virginia to engage in a public conflict and confrontation       In that case      Senators respected the objection of the Maryland Senators and Mr       Allen was not confirmed to a lifetime appointment on the Fourth      Circuit  The President made him his domestic policy adviser at the      White House  Earlier this year Mr  Allen resigned from his senior      position at the White House  Last month we learned the reason why      when he was arrested for fraudulent conduct over an extended period      of time  Had Democratic Senators not objected  the Republican      Senate would have rubberstamped the lifetime appointment to the      federal courts of someone who is now the subject of a criminal      prosecution for the equivalent of stealing from retail stores       I remind Senators      that we recognized the validity of the objection of the Senators      from Maryland when the President tried to shift a Maryland Fourth      Circuit seat to Virginia  We should do so again in this case in      which the President is trying to take a California judgeship and      turn it into an Idaho seat  I intend to support the Senators from      California in their understandable objection to this maneuver  It      is no coincidence that both times this White House has taken this      action  it has sought to shift a judgeship from a State represented      by two Democratic Senators to a State represented by two Republican      Senators   There are two      Smiths on the agenda today who have been nominated to the Ninth      Circuit  I will support the Presidents nomination of Milan Smith      of California to a California vacancy on the court  I will not      support his nomination of Norman Randy Smith because it would      effectively transfer a judgeship from California to Idaho  violating      historical precedent  Norman Randy Smith has been nominated to fill      the seat last occupied by Judge Stephen Trott  an appointee from      California  Judge Trott was from California when appointed and had      practiced there for much of his career prior to becoming a judge       In fact  he was nominated to fill the seat of another Californian       Judge Joseph Sneed  At the time of his nomination  while he worked      at the Department of Justice  the Senators from California were      consulted and it was understood to be a California seat  While an      agreement can sometimes be worked out among Senators and the White      House to proceed with someone from another State within the circuit      first  so long as the subsequent nomination restores the balance of      judgeships  I know of no precedent for shifting a circuit seat based      on a judges personal decision to change his or her personal      residence   I strongly      support the notion  which I helped enact into law  that every State      within a circuit should have at least one judge on the federal      circuit court  I will defend Idahos right to a seat on the Ninth      Circuit and have defended Hawaiis right to a seat on the Ninth      Circuit  just as I defend Vermonts right to a seat on the Second      Circuit   Senators      Feinstein and Boxer reiterated their opposition to this nomination      in a January 30  2006  letter to Chairman Specter  In connection      with the Committee hearing on this nomination  I urged President      Bush to resolve this impasse by doing the right thing and nominating      Judge Smith for the vacancy created by the retirement of Judge      Thomas G  Nelson from Idaho  Regrettably  the White House is more      interested in picking fights on judicial nominations in this      election year than in filling vacancies  The President could easily      resolve this matter yet he refuses to act as a uniter
