                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy Sends Letter To Mukasey     Outlining Key Questions And Concerns     To Be Addressed In Confirmation Hearings  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Oct  3   In preparation for     their upcoming meeting and the confirmation hearing for Attorney General     nominee Judge Michael Mukasey  Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman     Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has written the nominee a letter with several     areas of concern  In his letter  which was sent Tuesday morning      Leahy provided Judge Mukasey with questions on the mass firings of U S      Attorneys and the politicization of the Department of Justice  on the     legal justification of the warrantless wiretapping program  on concerns     about the expansion of government secrecy and Executive power  and on     the importance of ensuring that the Department of Justice performs its     federal law enforcement role independently  Leahy wrote  We will need to explore with you how     you would ensure the independence of federal law enforcement from     political pressure  what steps you would take to restore morale at the     Department and the publics trust in the Department  and whether you     would uphold constitutional checks on Executive power  Leahy is scheduling a meeting with the nominee and     sent the letter to help ensure that the confirmation hearings will be     substantive  thorough and responsive on the key challenges the next     Attorney General will face in beginning to restore credibility to the     Justice Department    The Judiciary Committee received Mukaseys     completed questionnaire Tuesday evening  It is available online      The text of the letter is below       October 2  2007 Hon  Michael B  Mukasey    Patterson Belknap Webb  Tyler LLP     1133 Avenue of the Americas    New York  NY 10036 Dear Judge Mukasey  I look forward to scheduling and chairing the     confirmation hearing on your nomination to serve as the Attorney General     of the United States  I also look forward to your response to the     Judiciary Committees questionnaire  and we may have additional requests     for background information that would be helpful to the Committee in     preparation for the hearing   As I told you when we met the day after your     designation  I look forward to meeting with you and having a substantive     discussion before the hearing  I propose that we meet on Tuesday      October 16  at 10 a m   if that is convenient for you  I also mentioned when we first met that I would     provide you with some of the topics that concern me  Regrettably the     White House has chosen not to clear the decks of past concerns and not     to produce the information and material it should have and could have     about the ongoing scandals that have shaken the Department of Justice     and led to the exodus of its former leadership  Those matters now     encumber your nomination and  if confirmed  your tenure   We will need to explore with you how you would     ensure the independence of federal law enforcement from political     pressure  what steps you would take to restore morale at the Department     and the publics trust in the Department  and whether you would uphold     constitutional checks on Executive power   The mass firings of the U S  Attorneys appointed by     this President were unprecedented  I will inquire whether you share my     view that the integrity and independence of federal law enforcement     should not be compromised by political operatives from the White House      I will ask for your assurance that the Department of Justice and  in     particular  our U S  Attorneys  will not be employed in upcoming     elections to seek to affect the outcome  The Department of Justice     should be working to protect Americans right to vote and have their     vote count  not seeking to swing close elections into a partisan column     by leaking allegations of corruption or bringing last minute legal     actions alleging voter fraud  A related matter of significant concern to a number     of Members of the Committee is the recent rewriting of the Department of     Justices guidebook on Federal Prosecution of Election Offenses It     not only changed from the red book to the green book  but the     traditional practice of not bringing last minute investigations and     actions was turned on its head  The traditional version of the     protocol  part of which I read to former Department of Justice official     Bradley Schlozman at our June 5 hearing  provided  In investigating     election fraud matters  the Justice Department must refrain from any     conduct which has the possibility of affecting the election itself          Thus  most  if not all  investigation of an alleged election crime must     await the end of the election to which the allegation relates  As     recently revised under the outgoing  discredited leadership group  it     provides great latitude for the Department of Justice to influence the     outcomes of elections  Will you reassure us that under your leadership     that these guidelines will be changed back to the time honored rules      That is a concrete step you can take at the outset to set a new tone      Another aspect of this concern is your close     association with a candidate for the Republican nomination for     President  Given that longstanding relationship  what assurances can     you give the Committee  the Senate and the American people  should he be     the Republican nominee  that you will not improperly use your position      The White House press operation suggested last weekend that you would     recuse yourself from matters involving Mr  Guiliani  Is that true  and     would that recusal include the Republican presidential campaign if he is     the Republican nominee   From our earlier meeting I know that you knew and     worked with Judge Harold Tyler  I have admired Judge Tyler  He  too      was faced with restoring the Department of Justice when he served as the     Deputy Attorney General in 1975  following the Watergate scandal and the     resignation of President Nixon  Likewise  I think we both view Attorney     General Robert Jacksons 1941 speech to U  S  Attorneys as striking the     right chord on the role of the Department of Justice and the     independence of federal prosecutors  If they  Elliot Richardson and     Edward Levi are your models  I will look forward to working with you to     restore the Department   In that connection  I note that as the House     Judiciary Committee was considering contempt citations for former White     House officials this summer  a senior Administration official said that     a U S  Attorney would not be permitted to bring contempt charges or     convene a grand jury in an executive privilege case and that a U S      Attorney would not be permitted to argue against the reasoned legal     opinion that Department of Justice provided   Under applicable statutes and practices  contempt     citations against Administration officials by the House and Senate would     be certified to the U S  Attorney for the District of Columbia to bring     before a grand jury for its action  If the House or Senate certified a     contempt citation against current or former White House officials     arising from the U S  Attorney investigation  would you permit the U S      Attorney to carry out the law and refer the matter to a grand jury as     required by 2 U S C     194  If the White House sought to prevent the     U S  Attorney from bringing contempt charges to a grand jury as required     by law  would you take any action to prevent the U S  Attorney from     doing so  More generally  what would you do as Attorney     General if you learned that a White House official had called a U S      Attorney asking for information about an on going criminal     investigation  What would you do as Attorney General if you learned     that a Member of Congress had called a U S  Attorney asking for     information about an on going criminal investigation  What will you do to ensure that legal advice from     the Departments Office of Legal Counsel  OLC  is independent and     protected from political influence   While you can set an example and a tone at the     Department of Justice  you cannot effectively manage it by yourself      Who will be the members of your team to help turn the Department     around   Other key issues arise from this Administrations     abuse of secrecy and expansion of executive power  Policies enacted by     this Administration have encouraged Department of Justice officers to     withhold information under the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA   the     bedrock statute that opens our government to its citizens  Will you     commit to review and consider overturning these policies  and supporting     legislation Senator Cornyn and I have sponsored to reform FOIA  so that     the presumption of openness which is at the heart of FOIA is restored     for the American people   The Attorney General who recently resigned     apparently believed that the President has a commander in chief override     of the laws of this country  which contributed to his violations of the     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA   his signing statement     reservations  and other overreaching  We must explore those topics      For example  do you believe that the President has authority to override     legal requirements and immunize acts of torture contrary to our treaty     obligations and laws  Do you believe that before Congress amended the     FISA this summer  the Authorization for the Use of Military Force passed     in the days following September 11  or Article II of the Constitution     gave this President authority to override the requirements of that law     with respect to wiretapping Americans   In connection with these matters the Judiciary     Committee has been seeking the historical legal analysis of the     Department of Justice and this Administration  We have made numerous     requests and have even had to subpoena the FISA documents  I want to     know whether you will work with us and provide those materials so that     we can examine the legal justifications that have been utilized by this     Administration to excuse its conduct   Similarly  in light of the failure of the White     House Counsel to provide even a privilege log to substantiate his     blanket claim of executive privilege for all information relating to the     U S  Attorney firing scandal  we need to consider that matter together      I want to know your view of executive privilege  Do you view it as a     communications privilege or something else  Do you think it extends to     the actions and emails of political operatives in matters in which the     President was not personally involved   With so much to do and so much damage that needs to     be repaired  I had hoped that the White House would have taken advantage     of the time since the resignations of Mr  Gonzales and Mr  Rove to work     with us to fulfill longstanding requests for information so that we     could all agree about what went so wrong at the Department of Justice     and work together to restore it  Instead  they have left you to answer     the unanswered questions and left longstanding disputes unresolved   Sincerely  PATRICK     LEAHY      Chairman
