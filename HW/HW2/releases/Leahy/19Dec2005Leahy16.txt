       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The President s FOIA Executive   Order                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Reaction Of Sen          Patrick Leahy          Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         To The Presidents News Conference Comments        About The USA PATRIOT Act        Monday  Dec  19          2005   Unfortunately  the         President persists in misstating the facts about the         effort to fix the problems in the PATRIOT Act  There is         no reason why the American people cannot have a PATRIOT         Act that is both effective and that adequately protects         their rights and their privacy     Instead of playing         partisan politics and setting up false attack ads  the         White House should join in trying to improve the PATRIOT         Act  Our goal is to mend it  not to end it  If the         White House is unwilling to fix it now  they should         support the Sununu Leahy three month extension  which 40         senators have cosponsored  to give us to time to make         this a better bill  We ask the President to reconsider         his opposition to briefly extending the expiring         provisions of the PATRIOT Act until these improvements         are made    The White Houses         domestic surveillance program also raises legitimate         concerns about accountability  A wiretap that         short circuits our laws and safeguards is no more         effective than a legal wiretap  It will not get you         better intelligence and it will not make us any safer as         a nation  It only excuses the government from having to         justify its conduct through constitutional checks and         balances    Our government must         follow the laws and respect the Constitution while it         protects Americans security and liberty  No         Administration should believe it is above the law  We         need to restore checks and balances in this country to         protect us all and all that we hold dear
