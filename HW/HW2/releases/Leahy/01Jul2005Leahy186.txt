       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Retirememnt Of Supreme Court   Justice Sandra Day O Connor                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Retirement Of Supreme Court Justice Sandra Day OConnor     July 1  2005 Twenty four years      ago  Sandra Day OConnor became a pioneer when she was unanimously      confirmed as the first female Justice to sit on the United States      Supreme Court  I am sorry to learn today that she has decided it is      time to retire  Until she was joined on the Court by Justice      Ginsburg in1993  Justice OConnor was the only woman serving on the      Court  and she wore her historic mantle with honor and grace  While I was      pleased to be able to vote for her confirmation to the Court in      1981  I have been even more privileged to watch her become a vital       often a critical    independent voice  Justice OConnor began her      career at a time when the legal profession was not friendly to      women  and she withstood the sting of early barriers to shatter the      glass ceiling  This alone would be worthy of the many accolades she      is sure to receive as we look back on her tenure  But it is how she      has accorded herself on the Court  how she has exemplified the best      of what it means to be a Justice  that will serve as her hallmark       Justice      OConnors distinguished tenure on the Nations highest court      resists easy labels  Rather than apply the litmus tests of any      particular group or a particular political philosophy  she has      approached each case with an interest in an open mind  For that       she is a role model not only to the many women who will follow her      on the Supreme Court  but also to jurists at every level of the      judiciary  For 24 years she has served a unique role as a pragmatic      centrist  often the bridge and the critical deciding vote  Justice      OConnor is a sterling example of what can happen when a President      nominates a Justice not from the right or the left wing of one of      the political parties  but an independent judge capable of making up      her own mind  While a life long Republican appointed by President      Reagan  Justice OConnor has been an independent thinker  From the      bench  she has not sought to impose her own views  but rather has      acted as I believe all judges should act by consistently applying      the law to the particular facts of each case  even when confronted      with some of the most difficult and controversial debates to ever      occur in this country on issues as important as the fundamental      rights of Americans   I imagine this      transition is a difficult one for Justice OConnor  and I wish her       her husband John  and the rest of her family all best wishes in the      days ahead  This is a public occasion but it is also a very      personal chapter for the OConnor family   The stakes are      high for all Americans  Consideration of Supreme Court nominations      is one of the most important responsibilities of the Senate  I      renew my call to the President to consult with Members of the Senate      from both sides of the aisle as he makes his decision about a      nominee  There is a rich history and tradition of consultation      between the President and the Senate on Supreme Court nominees  I      hope that the President will honor not only Justice OConnors      record of service  but also her judicial independence  by respecting      that tradition of meaningful consultation and in finding a nominee      who will unite and not further divide the Nation
