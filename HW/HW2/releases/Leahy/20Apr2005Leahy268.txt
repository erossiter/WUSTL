       Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Retirement Announcement Of   Senator Jim Jeffords                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Floor Remarks Of Senator      Patrick Leahy     On The Retirement Announcement     Of Senator Jim Jeffords     April 20  2005   It is with sadness and       appreciation that I come to the floor today to speak about the       announcement today by my colleague from Vermont  Senator       Jeffords  that he will retire from the Senate at the end of his       current term   Jim and I have known and worked       with each other since the days long ago when he was Attorney       General of Vermont  and I was prosecuting criminals as States       Attorney of Chittenden County   Our wives  Liz and Marcelle  knew       each other even before that  from their high school days  Both       Jim and I would have to admit that we married above ourselves        We both chose extremely well  Our thoughts and thanks today are       also with Liz and their children  Leonard and Laura   Jim Jeffords is beloved by the       people of Vermont  as well as by millions of Americans       nationwide who came to know him through the courage and       independence he showed in making the difficult decision to       become an Independent  Since then  Jim has also had a national       following  He has never had more public support and popularity       in Vermont than he does today   Though many Americans outside       Vermont only came to know of his independence in recent years        the truth is that  throughout his public service  Jim Jeffords       has shown that same streak of Vermont independence  and it is       deep  wide  and genuine   Jim has ably continued the Vermont       legacy of national leadership on the environment  in the       tradition of Senator Bob Stafford  from Jims days in the other       body  to his Chairmanship and now as Ranking Member on the       Environment and Public Works Committee   Vermonters  no matter what their       political affiliation  are good stewards of the gorgeous land       that surrounds us  and with our pristine mountains and lush       valleys  we have sometimes said that weve got air so clean that       its never been breathed  And so we consider the pollution that       creeps across our borders from dirty power plants upwind of our       state to be an offense not only against our health  but against       the natural environment that we want to enjoy and pass on to our       children and grandchildren  Jim Jeffords has been a stalwart       national leader in that fight   Jim also feels passionately about       improving education in America  and his imprint can be found on       innumerable laws and initiatives over the years in pursuit of       that goal  Children with disabilities  especially  have had a       champion in Senator Jeffords    Jim and I have also been partners       in defending the hard working dairy farmers of our state  and of       other states    Vermonters  and I  will also miss       the seniority that Jim has gained in this body  which he has put       to so many good purposes for our State and for our Nation   When the time comes for him to       carve his initials in his desk on this floor and retire from the       Senate  Jim Jeffords will leave with a legacy of principled       public service of which he  and Vermonters  can be proud     I know that  for Jim  nothing       compares to the scarce and precious days he has been able to       spend on his farm in Shrewsbury  Our colleagues will remember       the time  years ago  when he broke his leg doing farm chores        Down the road  Im sure that Jim looks forward to a time when       those precious days at home will be a little less scarce   And so  with fondness and with       appreciation  I will conclude with the phrase that was often       heard from Vermonters during Jims last re election campaign   Thanks  Jim
