       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Senate Debate Of Flag Desecration   Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK     LEAHY            VERMONT          Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      On Senate Debate Of Flag Desecration Amendment      Vermonters Honor The Bill Of Rights      June 26  2006    Mr  President  in 1791  the year       that the Bill of Rights became part of our Constitution  the       State of Vermont joined the Union  and then the       State of Kentucky followed  Then Congress saw fit to change the       design of the American flag to include 15 stars and 15 stripes        one for each State  In fact  it was this flag  the one       recognizing the addition of Vermont and Kentucky to the United       States  that flew over Fort McHenry in 1814 and that inspired       Francis Scott Key to write the   Star Spangled Banner          Fifty years after that famous       battle that inspired our National Anthem in       Baltimore s harbor  President Abraham Lincoln visited that city       as our country confronted its greatest test  It was a time in       which this Nation faced grave peril from a civil war whose       outcome could not yet be determined  Many flags flew over       various parts of the United States  and our existence as a       nation was in doubt  President Lincoln used the occasion to       reflect on a basic feature of American democracy  President       Lincoln observed   The       world has never had a good definition of the word liberty  The       American people just now are much in need of one  We all declare       for liberty  but using the same word we do not mean the same       thing    I would hope that all of us in       this Chamber champion liberty  If any of us were asked  we would       say  Of course we do  But when I hear some talk about the desire       to restrict our fundamental freedoms by cutting back on our       first amendment rights for the first time in our history  you       see why people wonder  The danger of this amendment is that it       would strike at the values the flag represents and the rights       that have made this Nation a vibrant democratic republic in       which we have enjoyed freedom of religion  freedom of the press        freedom of expression  and freedom to think as individuals         Along with Vermonters  I find the       American flag inspirational in all its incarnations  whether it       is the current flag with 50 stars that was carried in formation       at Parris Island when my youngest son Mark became a proud member       of the U S  Marine Corps  whether it is the American flag with       48 stars under which Vermonters joined in fighting World War II        including members of my family  the flag commemorating Vermont s       becoming a State  the Bennington flag that commemorated our       Declaration of Independence  or the revolutionary flag with 13       stars in a circle said to be designed by George Washington and       sewn by Betsy Ross    Ultimately  the debate over this       amendment turns on the scope we think proper to give to speech       which deeply offends us  For two thirds of the Senate to vote to       amend the Bill of Rights to amend the U S  Constitution because        as the Constitution requires  that we deem it   necessary   in       2006  strikes me as extraordinary  The Senate oath of office        which the people of Vermont have authorized me to       take six times  requires that we   support and defend the       Constitution    And I believe that doing so means opposing this       effort to cut back on Vermonters  constitutional rights and       freedoms    Regrettably  the Senate leadership       is returning again and again to using constitutional amendments       as election year rallying cries to excite the passion of voters        That is wrong  The Constitution is too important to be used for       partisan political purposes  and so  in my view  is our American       flag    With the rights of Americans being       threatened in so many ways today by this administration  this is       most especially not the time for the Senate to vote to limit       Americans  fundamental rights or to strike at the heart of the       First Amendment    The chairman has referred to       Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes  It was Justice Holmes who wrote       that the most imperative principle of our Constitution was it       protects not just freedom for the thought and expression we       agree with  but   freedom for the thought that we hate    He       also wrote that   we should be eternally vigilant against       attempts to check the expression of opinions that we loathe           We all know that the First       Amendment never requires people to defend it when it is       upholding popular speech  It needs defense when the speech is       unpopular    What is so distinctive about      America is that our Government does not endorse       religious or political orthodoxy  The price of our freedom of       expression is our willingness to protect the expression of those       with whom we disagree  America does not impose a state designed       dogma on its free people the way totalitarian regimes do  We       value our freedom and we protect the freedom of others    Justice Robert Jackson made this       point with unsurpassed eloquence in a Supreme Court decision       made during World War II  He did this in West Virginia State       Board of Education v  Barnette  His decision for the Supreme       Court upheld our fundamental tradition of tolerance  holding       that State school boards may not compel teachers and students to       salute the flag    Remember  Justice Jackson was       writing during World War II  during wartime  He wrote     F reedom       to differ is not limited to things that do not matter much  That       would be a mere shadow of freedom  The test of its substance is       the right to differ as to things that touch the heart of the       existing order  If there is any fixed star in our constitutional       constellation  it is that no official  high or petty  can       prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics  nationalism        religion or other matters of opinion or force citizens to       confess by word or act their faith therein   That was a powerful statement by       Justice Jackson  at a time when certainly the attention of this       country was focused on a real war effort  the effort of World       War II  But he knew what unifies our country is the voluntary       sharing of ideals and commitments  Americans are free  free to       offend but also free to respond to crude insults with       responsible action  the way many of us remember and       applaud  when that crowd at Dodger Stadium responded by       spontaneously singing   God Bless America   when a couple of       miscreants attempted to burn the American flag in the outfield       30 years ago  shortly after the end of the Vietnam war     When I am home in       Vermont  our family home  I fly the flag  not because the law       tells me to but because  as an American  I want to  I fly the       flag out of pride  I remember my parents  still alive  when they       used to look with pride to see that flag flying and they knew       their son was home from Washington  It is the same sense of       pride I felt when I saw my son march in uniform under that flag        our flag  our American flag  It is the same sense of pride I       feel when I see that flag flying over this Capitol Building when       I come to work each day  and I stop and look at it sometimes       when the Senate leaves at 2 or 3 o clock in the morning  I look       at the dome and I see that flag illuminated and flying there         One of my colleagues  former       Senator Bob Kerrey  a man of great bravery  who received the       Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in battle  said in       a recent opinion piece in the Washington Post    Real patriotism       cannot be coerced    It has to be a voluntary  unselfish  brave       act to sacrifice for others    I ask unanimous consent that a       copy of his op ed be printed in the Record    There being no objection  the       material was ordered to be printed in the Record as follows           From the washingtonpost com       June 15  2006    Our Flag and Our Freedom      By Bob Kerrey    With campaigns at full tilt and       the Fourth of July just around the comer  the Senate s new       priority is to debate and vote on yet another resolution to       amend our remarkable Constitution  This time it s an amendment       that would allow Congress to prohibit a form of protest that a       large majority of Americans do not like  the burning or       desecration of the American flag  Since 1989  when the Supreme       Court decided unanimously and correctly that these rare        unpleasant demonstrations are expressions of speech and       therefore protected by the First Amendment  there have been many       such attempts  Fortunately  all have failed    Unfortunately  enthusiasm for this       amendment appears to have grown even as flag burning incidents       have vanished as a means of political protest  The last time I       saw an image of the U S  flag being desecrated in       this way was nearly 20 years ago  when the court issued its       decision  Thus this amendment  never appropriate in the oldest       democracy on earth  has become even less necessary  But       necessity is not always the mother of legislation    In defense of speech I do not       like  I recall a ceremony I have come to love  a military       funeral  The finest of all is conducted at       Arlington National Cemetery  At graveside  an honor guard holds       the American flag while taps are played as a final farewell  The       guards then fold the flag into a triangle and deliver it to the       next of kin    It is as if the flag becomes the       fallen  In the hands of a widow or mother it is much more than a       symbol of the nation  At that moment the American flag is a       sacred object that holds the sweet memory of a life given to a       higher cause  Or so it seems to me each time I am witness to       these hallowed events    To others the ceremony may mean       something entirely different  I recall vividly one such       situation  A mother of a friend who was killed in       Vietnam recoiled when the flag was offered to her  She would not       take it  In her heart the American flag had become a symbol of       dishonor  treachery and betrayal  At the time  and perhaps to       her dying day  she wanted nothing to do with it    If our First Amendment is altered       to permit laws to be passed prohibiting flag desecration  would       we like to see our police powers used to arrest an angry mother       who burns a flag  Or a brother in arms whose disillusionment       leads him to defile this symbol of the nation  I hope the answer       is no  I hope we are strong enough to tolerate such rare and       wrenching moments  I hope our desire for calm and quiet does not       make it a crime for any to demonstrate in such a fashion  In       truth  if I know anything about the spirit of our compatriots        some Americans might even choose to burn their flag in protest       of such a law    No doubt the sponsors and       advocates of this amendment mean well  They believe it is a       reasonable and small sacrifice of our freedoms  They believe no       serious consequence will come of this change    No doubt  too  some of the       increasing interest in limiting free speech is a response to the       Sept  11 attacks on the United States  It was a       remarkable moment  when the hearts of most of us filled with a       kind of pure patriotism we had never felt before  It was a       patriotism that bound liberty to equality and fraternity  It was       a patriotism that brought us together  friend and stranger       alike  We discovered heroes who inspired us  No longer did we       say    It s good to see you    and not mean it    Most impressive to me was that the         we   included men and women of many nations  every religion       and every ethnic group  The   we   was global  The patriotism we       felt extended beyond our boundaries and beyond the cramped       spaces of ritual nationalistic fervor  We understood that the       vulnerability of our freedom bound us together more than any       symbol or slogan can  Millions of Americans  then and now        proudly flew their flags because they wanted to  not because any       law told them to    All the more reason  then  for       patriotism to turn aside the understandable impulse to protect       our flag by degrading the constitutional freedoms for which it       stands  Real patriotism cannot be coerced  Our freedom to speak       was attacked  not our flag  The former  not the latter  needs       the protection of our Constitution and our laws     Mr  LEAHY  The French philosopher       Voltaire once remarked that liberty is a guest who plants both       of his elbows on the table  I think what Voltaire meant by that       is that liberty is sometimes even an unmannerly  vulgar guest        yet liberty requires we tolerate rudeness even when admittedly       it is hard to do so  That is what allows us  in turn  the       individual freedoms that we cherish for ourselves     Despicable  outrageous gestures       like flag burning are hard to tolerate  but we do so because       political expression is so central as to what makes  America great and what protects the rights of each of us       to speak  or to worship as we choose  and to petition our       Government for redress  The flag is a symbol of the greatness       that the American ideals of freedom and liberty have helped       foster in this blessed land  The Constitution ultimately goes       beyond symbols  The Constitution is the real bedrock of our       rights    In a letter to me expressing his       opposition to the constitutional amendment  my friend General       Colin Powell said it very well  Let me quote Colin Powell in       this regard  He said    We are rightfully outraged when       anyone attacks or desecrates our flag  Few Americans do such       things and when they do they are subject to the rightful       condemnation of their fellow citizens  They may be destroying a       piece of cloth  but they do no damage to our system of freedom       which tolerates such desecration          I understand how strongly so many       of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag        I       feel the same sense of outrage  But I step back from amending       the Constitution to relieve that outrage  The First Amendment       exists to insure that freedom of speech and expression applies       not just to that with which we agree or disagree  but also that       which we find outrageous    I would not amend that great       shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants  The flag will       still be flying proudly  long after they have slunk away     What powerful  powerful words from       General Powell  I ask unanimous consent a copy of his letter be       printed in the Record    There being no objection  the       material was ordered to be printed in the Record  as follows        ALEXANDRIA  VA   May 18  1999        Hon  Patrick Leahy   U S  Senate   Washington  DC    Dear Senator Leahy   Thank you for your recent letter       asking my views on the proposed flag protection amendment         I love our flag  our Constitution       and our country with a love that has no bounds  I defended all       three for 35 years as a soldier and was willing to give my life       in their defense    Americans revere their flag as a       symbol of the Nation  Indeed  it is because of that reverence       that the amendment is under consideration  Few countries in the       world would think of amending their Constitution for the purpose       of protecting such a symbol    We are rightfully outraged when       anyone attacks or desecrates our flag  Few Americans do such       things and when they do they are subject to the rightful       condemnation of their fellow citizens  They may be destroying a       piece of cloth  but they do no damage to our system of freedom       which tolerates such desecration    If they are destroying a flag that       belongs to someone else  that s a prosecutable crime  If it is a       flag they own  I really don t want to amend the Constitution to       prosecute someone for foolishly desecrating their own property        We should condemn them and pity them instead    I understand how strongly so many       of my fellow veterans and citizens feel about the flag and I       understand the powerful sentiment in state legislatures for such       an amendment  I feel the same sense of outrage  But I step back       from amending the Constitution to relieve that outrage  The       First Amendment exists to insure that freedom of speech and       expression applies not just to that with which we agree or       disagree  but also that which we find outrageous     I would not amend that great       shield of democracy to hammer a few miscreants  The flag will be       flying proudly long after they have slunk away     Finally  I shudder to think of the       legal morass we will create trying to implement the body of law       that will emerge from such an amendment    If I were a member of Congress  I       would not vote for the proposed amendment and would fully       understand and respect the views of those who would  For or       against  we all love our flag with equal devotion     Sincerely        Colin Powell  P S  The attached 1989 article by       a Vietnam POW gave me further inspiration for my position           From the Retired Officer  Sept        1989   Thoughts of a Former POW  When       They Burned the Flag Back Home     By James H  Warner   In March of 1973  when we were       released from a prisoner of war camp in North       Vietnam  we were flown to Clark AB in the Philippines  As I       stepped out of the aircraft I looked up and saw the flag  I       caught my breath  then  as tears filled my eyes  I saluted it  I       never loved my country more than at that moment  Although I have       received the Silver Star Medal and two Purple Hearts  they were       nothing compared with the gratitude I felt then for having been       allowed to serve the cause of freedom    Because the mere sight of the flag       meant so much to me when I saw it for the first time after five       and a half years  it hurts me to see other Americans willfully       desecrate it  But I have been in a Communist prison where I       looked into the pit of hell  I cannot compromise on freedom  It       hurts to see the flag burned  but I part company with those who       want to punish the flag burners  Let me explain myself     Early in the imprisonment the       Communists told us that we did not have to stay there  If we       would only admit we were wrong  if we would only apologize  we       could be released early  If we did not  we would be punished  A       handful accepted  most did not  In our minds  early release       under those conditions would amount to a betrayal of our       comrades  of our country and of our flag    Because we would not say the words       they wanted us to say  they made our lives wretched  Most of use       were tortured  and some of my comrades died  I was tortured for       most of the summer of 1969  I developed beriberi from       malnutrition  I had long bouts of dysentery  I was infested with       intestinal parasites  I spent 13 months in solitary confinement        Was our cause worth all of this  Yes  it was worth all this and       more   Rose Wilder Lane  in her magnificent book The Discovery of       Freedom  said there are two fundamental truths that men must       know in order to be free  They must know that all men are       brothers  and they must know that all men are born free  Once       men accept these two ideas  they will never accept bondage  The       power of these ideas explains why it was illegal to teach slaves       to read    One can teach these ideas  even in       a Communist prison camp  Marxists believe that ideas are merely       the product of material conditions  change those material       conditions  and one will change the ideas they produce  They       tried to   re educate   us  If we could show them that we would       not abandon our beliefs in fundamental principles  then we could       prove the falseness of their doctrine  We could subvert them by       teaching them about freedom through our example  We could show       them the power of ideas    I did not appreciate this power       before I was a prisoner of war  I remember one interrogation       where I was shown a photograph of some Americans protesting the       war by burning a flag    There    the officer said    People in       your country protest against your cause  That proves that you       are wrong        No    I said    That proves that       I am right  In my country we are not afraid of freedom  even if       it means that people disagree with us    The officer was on his       feet in an instant  his face purple with rage  He smashed his       fist onto the table and screamed at me to shut up  While he was       ranting I was astonished to see pain  compounded by fear  in his       eyes  I have never forgotten that look  nor have I forgotten the       satisfaction I felt at using his tool  the picture of the       burning flag  against him    Aneurin Bevan  former official of       the British Labor Party  was once asked by Nikita Khrushchev how       the British definition of democracy differed from the Soviet       view  Bevan responded  forcefully  that if Khrushchev really       wanted to know the difference  he should read the funeral       oration of Pericles    In that speech  recorded in the       Second Book of Thucydides  History of the Peloponnesian War          Pericles contrasted democratic Athens with       totalitarian Sparta  Unlike the Spartans  he said  the Athenians       did not fear freedom  Rather  they viewed freedom as the very       source of their strength  As it was for Athens  so it is for       America  our freedom is not to be feared  for our freedom is our       strength    We don t need to amend the       Constitution in order to punish those who burn our flag  They       burn the flag because they hate America and they       are afraid of freedom  What better way to hurt them than with       the subversive idea of freedom  Spread freedom  The flag in       Dallas was burned to protest the nomination of Ronald Reagan        and he told us how to spread the idea of freedom when he said       that we should turn America into a   city shining on a hill  a       light to all nations    Don t be afraid of freedom  it is the       best weapon we have    Mr  LEAHY  Another American who       honorably served our country  Gary May  Chairman       of Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights  wrote in a letter    This country is unique and special       because the minority  the unpopular  the dissident also have a       voice  The freedom of expression  even when it hurts the most        is the truest test of our dedication to the principles that our       flag represents    I ask unanimous consent a copy of       his letter be printed in the Record    There being no objection  the       material was ordered to be printed in the Record  as follows         VETERANS DEFENDING    THE BILL OF RIGHTS    Newburgh  IN  May 4  2006   Re Oppose S J  Res  12  the       Flag Desecration Constitutional Amendment   Dear Senator   My name is Gary May        I am writing to you today as the chair of a group called       Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights to urge you to oppose S J        Res  12  the flag desecration constitutional amendment  I know       you hear from some who say veterans support this amendment  but       you should also know that there are many veterans that have       faithfully served our nation who strongly believe that amending       the Constitution to ban flag desecration is the antithesis of       freedoms they fought to preserve    I lost both my legs in combat       while serving in the U S  Marine Corps in Vietnam        I challenge anyone to find someone who loves this country  its       people and what it stands for more than I do  It offends me when       I see the flag burned or treated disrespectfully  But  as       offensive and painful as this is  I still believe that       dissenting voices need to be heard  even if their methods cause       offense    This country is unique and special       because the minority  the unpopular  the dissident also have a       voice  The freedom of expression  even when it hurts the most        is the truest test of our dedication to the principles that our       flag represents    In addition to my military combat       experience  I have been involved in veterans  affairs as a       clinical social worker  program manager  board member of       numerous veterans organizations  and advocated on their behalf       since 1974  Through all of my work in veterans  affairs  I have       yet to hear a veteran say that his or her service and sacrifice       was in pursuit of protecting the flag    When confronted with the horrific       demands of combat  the simple fact is that most of us fought to       stay alive  The pride and honor we feel is not in the flag per       se  It s in the principles for which it stands for and the       people who have defended them    I am grateful for the many heroes       of our country  All the sacrifices of those who served before us       would be for naught  if the Constitution were amended to cut       back on our First Amendment rights for the first time in the       history of our great nation  I write to you today to attest to       the fact that many veterans do not wish to exchange fought for       freedoms for protecting a tangible object that represents these       freedoms    To illustrate my point  here is       what some of the Veterans Defending the Bill of Rights have said       about this amendment      During the fighting in  Iraq  I saw friends of mine die in battle  Each of us       suffered and sacrificed to provide freedom to the Iraqi people        With this in mind  I am profoundly disturbed by the apparent       willingness of Congress to sacrifice our own freedoms here at       home by amending the First Amendment for the first time ever        When the coalition forces entered Iraq  it was to topple a       brutal and repressive dictatorship  one that did not hesitate to       jail and torture its own citizens who protested against it  By       amending the Constitution to ban a form of expression  Congress       dishonors the legacy of service members who fought and died in       defense of freedom     Jeremy Broussard  Bowie  MD  a combat       veteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom and a former Captain in the       U S  Army whose artillery unit was among the first to enter       Iraq      The proposed constitutional       amendment is in my eyes  and the eyes of countless other       veterans  a slap in the face to our service in combat  We       volunteered to go to war to protect the freedoms in this       country  not watch them be taken away by politicians who have       never been to the front lines  I consider myself an       independent minded conservative  and believe that creating       unnecessary amendments to the U S  Constitution is a betrayal of       conservative principles     Specialist Eric G Eliason        Englewood  CO  a combat veteran who served as an Infantryman in       the Army for three years  including one year overseas as part of       Operation Iraqi Freedom      It is a bad thing to burn the       flag  but it is a worse thing to damage the       Constitution     James Pryde  Tuskegee Airman  combat veteran of       the 477 Bomber Group in WWII      After devoting most of my career       to working in military intelligence  I was appointed Army Deputy       Chief of Staff for Intelligence in 1997  I served in that       position until my retirement in 2000  I am well acquainted with       the many threats facing the United States  and I       must say that flag burning does not begin to rise to a level of       threat justifying the attention of this distinguished body    I       served in the United States Army  like my father before me  to       defend fundamental American liberties  To begin the trend of       amending the First Amendment each time a particular form of       speech is found to be offensive sets a dangerous precedent  and       undermines the very freedoms for which I and my fellow       servicemembers served     Lt  General Claudia J  Kennedy  USA        Ret    Highest ranking woman to ever serve in the U S  Army      Like many of those who have       served in the armed forces  I am deeply concerned about this       proposed attempt to undermine free speech  While I do take       offense at disrespect to the flag  I nonetheless believe it my       duty to defend the constitutional right of protestors to use the       flag in nonviolent speech     Richard Olek  Fargo  ND  Army       veteran and past Commander of AMVETS Jon A  Greenley Memorial       Post 7 in Fargo      Today the U S  Senate is again       debating an amendment to the Constitution to ban desecration of       the flag  It s an issue on which I believe I can claim some       authority  I laid my life on the line and fought under the flag       of the United States during World War II  I watched some of my       closest friends fall during eight grueling campaigns  I was       awarded a Silver Star and Purple Heart  I m a disabled veteran       and long standing Republican since 1940  and nothing angers me       more than the desecration of the U S  flag  It is an abomination       to me and to other veterans  That said  though  I believe the       push to amend the Constitution to criminalize flag burning is       misguided  Our forefathers would spin in their graves to think        that our government would turn the established principle of free       speech on its end and consider persecuting people who disagree       with its actions     James Bird  Lumberton  NJ  is a decorated       veteran of World War II  where he survived eight campaigns in       combat and was a liberator of the Dachau concentration camp                 to undertake to carve out       an area of free speech and say that this or that is unpatriotic       because it is offensive is a movement that will unravel our       liberties and do grave damage to our nation s freedom  The       ability to say by speech or dramatic acts what we feel or think       is to be cherished not demeaned as unpatriotic     I hope you       will hear my plea  Please do not tinker with the First       Amendment     Reverend Edgar Lockwood  Falmouth  Massachusetts        served as a naval officer engaged in more than ten combat       campaigns in WWII      My military service was not       about protecting the flag  it was about protecting the freedoms       behind it  The flag amendment curtails free speech and       expression in a way that should frighten us all     Brady       Bustany  West Hollywood  California  served in the Air Force       during the Gulf War      The first amendment to our       constitution is the simplest and clearest official guarantee of       freedom ever made by a sovereign people to itself  The so called        flag protection amendment  would be a bureaucratic hamstringing       of a noble act  Let us reject in the name of liberty for which       so many have sacrificed  the call to ban flag desecration  Let       us  rather  allow the first amendment  untrammeled and       unfettered by this proposed constitutional red tape  to continue       be the same guarantor of our liberty for the next two centuries        at least  that is has been for the last two     State Delegate       John Doyle  Hampshire County  West Virginia served as an       infantry officer in Vietnam      As a twenty two year veteran        combat experience  shot up  shot down  hospitalized more than a       year  Purple Heart recipient  with all the proper medals and       badges I take very strong exception to anyone who says that       burning the flag isn t a way of expressing yourself  In my mind       this is clearly covered in Amendment I to the Constitution  and       should not be  abridged      Mr  Bob Cordes  Mason  Texas was an       Air Force fighter pilot shot down in Vietnam  He served for 22       years from 1956 to 1978      Service to our country  not flag       waving  is the best way to demonstrate patriotism     Mr  Jim       Lubbock  St  Louis  Missouri  served with the Army in the       Phillipines during WWII  His two sons fought in Vietnam  and       members of his family have volunteered for every United States       conflict from the American Revolution through Vietnam with the       exception of Korea  His direct ancestor  Stephen Hopkins  signed       the Declaration of Independence      The burning of our flag       thoroughly disgusts me  But a law banning the burning of the       flag plays right into the hands of the weirdoes who are doing       the burning        By banning the burning of the flag  we are       empowering them by giving significance to their stupid act  Let       them burn the flag and let us ignore them  Then their act       carries no significance     Mr  William Ragsdale  Titusville        Florida  an engineer who worked in the space industry for over       30 years  retired from the US Naval Reserve in 1984 with the       rank of Commander  having served in the Navy for over forty       years including active duty in both WWII and the Korean War  He       has two sons who served in Vietnam      I fought for freedom of       expression not for a symbol  I fought for freedom of Speech  I       did not fight for the flag  or motherhood  or apple pie  I       fought so that my mortal enemy could declare at the top of his       lungs that everything I held dear was utter drivel       I       fought for unfettered expression of ideas  Mine and everybody       else s     Mr  John Kelley  East Concord  Vermont  lost his leg       to a Viet Cong hand grenade while on Operation Sierra with the       Fox Company 2nd Battalion 7th Marines in 1967    I       hope you will join me and the Veterans Defending the Bill of       Rights in opposing S J  Res  12  the flag desecration       constitutional amendment  We must not allow this   feel good         measure to restrict freedoms for which so many veterans       sacrificed so much  I look forward to working with you     Sincerely        Gary E  May       Mr  LEAHY  I have been to countries  as have many of us        countries with dictators  countries like China and Cuba  the       former Soviet Union  They require a law to protect their flags       and their symbols  I have taken great pleasure in those       countries to point out that America does not need the kind of       laws they do  America protects our symbols  The American people       honor our national flag out of respect  not out of fear that       they may break a law  I point out to them what real freedom is        and it includes the freedom to dissent and to differ  even in       ways that I would find obnoxious and offensive     As the son of a printer  I was       brought up to know how important the First Amendment is to       maintaining our democracy  It allows us to practice any religion       we want  or no religion if we want  It allows us to think as we       choose and to express ourselves freely  even though others may       disagree    We do not have a state imposed       orthodoxy in this great and good country  Instead  we have       freedom and diversity  diversity in religion  diversity in       thought  diversity in speech  diversity that is guaranteed and       protected by our Constitution  our Bill of Rights  and       particularly the First Amendment  When you guarantee and protect       diversity  then you guarantee and protect democracy  When you       guarantee and protect diversity  by definition you are going to       have a democracy  No real democracy exists without diversity        But when you exclude and stamp out diversity and freedom of       thought and expression  you act to stamp out democracy     We have seen this in history  In       the former Soviet Union or other totalitarian governments of       history  when they wanted to destroy democracy they started        sometimes in little ways at first  but ultimately to stamp out       diversity in dissent    American democracy has succeeded       because we have fought to live with that unruly guest with his       elbows on our table of which Voltaire spoke  and to tolerate       speech and expressive conduct that probably virtually all of us       here would find disrespectful and crude    We protect dissent  not because we       oppose liberty but because we love liberty    Wendell Phillips  a great New       England abolitionist  wrote    The community which dares not to       protect its humblest and most hated member in the free utterance       of his opinion  no matter how false and hateful  is only a gang       of slaves    Probably no person disagreed more       vehemently with Wendell Phillips on the burning issues of their       day than Senator John C  Calhoun of South Carolina  Yet Senator       Calhoun came to much the same conclusion in a speech he gave on       the Senate floor  our Senate floor  in 1848  more than 150 years       ago  Senator Calhoun said    We have passed through so many       difficulties and dangers without the loss of liberty that we       have begun to think that we hold it by divine right from heaven       itself  But it is harder to preserve than it is to obtain       liberty  After years of prosperity the tenure by which it is       held is too often forgotten  and I fear  Senators  that such is       the case with us    This is what Senator Calhoun said       150 years ago    I am immensely proud to be given       the privilege to be one of the two Senators who have the       opportunity to represent the State of Vermont  Vermont has a       proud tradition defending liberty and encouraging open debate        We are the State of the town meeting  If you want to experience       open debate  I urge you to attend a Vermont town meeting        Everybody gets heard  Everybody gets heard about every       disagreement  every differing view  A Vermont town meeting is as       democratic as you can get  There is debate  There is expression        There is disagreement and agreement  There is freedom and       democracy being lived    In fact  Vermont for many years       engaged in such a great and open debate on this very issue of       how best to approach protection of our flag  For years the       Vermont General Assembly remained the only State legislature not       to have passed a resolution in favor of a constitutional       amendment  In January 2002 the Vermont Legislature passed a       resolution  but it was written  interestingly  in a manner that       shows Vermont s respect for the Constitution  It concludes that       the Congress should take steps to   ensure that proper respect       and treatment       always be afforded to the flag    but in       ways consistent with the principles that the flag represents        foremost among these being    the protection of individual       freedoms enumerated in the First Amendment to the United States       Constitution  including free speech      Our Legislature stopped short of       taking the easy way out and simply parroting a politically       popular demand to amend the Constitution  Rather  Vermont       remained true to its proud tradition of encouraging open debate       and called on Congress to   explore all avenues available   to       protect the flag from desecration    Vermont s actions are consistent       with our strong tradition of independence and commitment to the       Bill of Rights  Indeed  Vermont s own Constitution is based on       our commitment to freedom and our belief it is best protected by       open debate    At one time  when we were afraid       we might not have that chance for open debate  Vermont declared       itself an independent republic  In fact  Vermont did not and       would not become a State until 1791  That was the year the Bill       of Rights was ratified  Following that tradition  this Vermonter       is not going to vote to cut back on the First Amendment of the       Bill of Rights for the first time since its adoption     Vermont sent Matthew Lyon to       Congress  He  incidentally  cast the decisive vote  Vermont s       vote  for the election of Thomas Jefferson  That election was       thrown into the House of Representatives  Had Matthew Lyon voted       otherwise  Thomas Jefferson would not have become President        Matthew Lyon was the same House Member who was a target of a       shameful prosecution under the Sedition Act in 1789  Why  For       comments he made in a private letter  And the power of the U S        Government  under that horrible act  came down on Matthew Lyon        He was locked up for daring to be so critical in a letter         Vermonters showed what they       thought of the Sedition Act and what they thought of trying to       stifle free speech  While Matthew Lyon was in jail  Vermonters       reelected him and sent him back to Congress  Along with our own       lone Congressman  Congressman  Sanders  I am       working on that commitment to having a post office named for       Matthew Lyon in Vermont    Vermont has stood up for the       rights of free speech before and since  Vermont served the       Nation during the dark days of McCarthyism  In one of the most       remarkable and praise worthy actions of any Senator from any       State  Vermont Senator Ralph Flanders stood up for democracy in       opposition to the repressive tactics of Senator Joseph McCarthy        When so many others  both Republicans and Democrats  ran for       cover  Senator Ralph Flanders of Vermont  a Republican  a       conservative  a businessman  came to the Senate floor and said        Enough is enough  He asked for the censure of Senator McCarthy       and allowed people once more in this country to speak freely         Vermont has a great tradition we       cherish  It is one I intend to uphold  I honor the Vermont       tradition that includes Senator Flanders when I oppose cutting       back the First Amendment and the Bill of Rights     I know there is an impulse  a       natural impulse  to restrict speech with which we disapprove        But America is strong because we do not fear freedom  we do not       restrict freedom of speech  We should have confidence our       institutions are stronger than a bunch of hooligans and that       their ideas are better than those of cranks and crackpots         We know the vast majority of the       people in this great country are patriotic  especially thinking       of September 11 the way the American people have demonstrated       patriotism  as rarely in our history  I can never remember a       time in our history when I have seen more people fly more flags        and proudly    The crisis confronting America is       not flag burning  Americans honor flags as a symbol of our       country  Americans also know we face real challenges  The       confidence of the American people and this Government and       institutions is quite low  But even though confidence in the       institutions of our Government may be low  Americans love their       country  They respect the flag  It is the misuse of their       Government for partisanship  the corruption of the Government       and its processes  it is a lack of credibility and competence       that they see in their Government that concerns Americans in the       face of real threats and real problems    Mark Twain said  Honor your       country  question your Government  That is what is happening       today    I see respect for our flag in the       actions and attitudes of the citizens of America  I see it in       the dedication of Don Villemaire and his friends of Essex       Junction  VT  who stood and proudly waved American flags every       single night after the horrible tragedy of September 11  2001        until the search for remains officially ended  That was a vigil       every single night in Essex Junction  VT  longer than 8 months        That is showing respect    I see in Montpelier  my       birthplace  in their annual Independence Day parade  where flags       are waved in support of our country and our soldiers  I see it       in the memorial of American flags planted along the paths of       funeral processions of Vermonters killed serving their country       in Iraq and Afghanistan  Vermonters  respect for the flag is       born from respect for this country and the values it protects        Our patriotism is felt  it is willful  It is not forced on us         Instead of telling the American       people  the people beyond the 100 who have the privilege of       serving here  what they can and cannot do  maybe we should talk       about what we 100 do and how we do it  We honor America when we       in the Senate do our jobs  when and if we work on the matters       that can improve the lives of ordinary Americans  Let the 100       Members of the Senate work to raise the minimum wage  lower gas       prices  provide better health care and health insurance for more       Americans  Let the 100 Senators act to fund the promise of stem       cell research that could end the suffering of so many Americans         The proposed amendment to the       Constitution would do harm to the First Amendment protections       that bind us all against oppression  especially the oppression       of momentary majority thought  The amendment violates the       precept laid down more than 200 years ago that   he that would       make his own liberty secure must guard even his enemy from       oppression      It undercuts the principle that a       free society is a society where it is safe to say and do the       unpopular  Let us not give away our liberties in order to impose       orthodoxy so others cannot offend    Let me be clear  I am deeply       offended when anyone defiles the American flag  I expect one       thing that unites all 100 Senators is that every one of us is       deeply offended when the flag is defiled  Two years ago  a flag       incident occurred in Vermont outside St  Augustine s Church in       Montpelier  Someone wrapped a statue of the Virgin Mary in the       American flag and set it on fire  This is a church in which I       have been baptized  When this act was first reported  I called       it an act intended to outrage  an attack on the religious       community  and a gross show of disrespect for the flag  We also       know acts like these can and should be prosecuted under       Vermont s law  as I suspect they should be under all of the laws       of any of the 50 States  Laws prohibit such damage to property         If someone seeks to do harm to the       flag I proudly fly in my home when I am there  they  too  would       be prosecuted under Vermont law  In fact  having been a       prosecutor in Vermont  knowing what I know of Vermont juries        they would be convicted  but I can replace a flag of mine that       was destroyed  and would  I can buy another flag  But if we act       to diminish the Bill of Rights that protect our rights and       freedoms of a quarter billion Americans and of generations to       come  we cannot replace that  We cannot go to the store and buy       a new Bill of Rights once it is diminished    Ours is a powerful Constitution        all the more inspiring because of what it allows and because we       protect each other s liberty  Let us be good stewards  Let us       preserve and protect for our children and our children s       children a Constitution with the freedoms we were bequeathed by       the founding patriots and by the sacrifice of generation after       generation of Americans    I urge Senators to think about       this vote  Do not diminish that pillar on which our democracy       and our freedoms depend  Do not cut back on the First Amendment       of our Bill of Rights for the first time in American history         I yield the floor
