       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Prscilla Owen                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of Priscilla Owen      To The United States Court Of Appeals For The      Fifth Circuit As Inserted In The      Congressional Record      May 18  2005   The Compelling      Case Against Her Confirmation   Three years ago I first considered the      nomination of Priscilla Owen to be a judge on the United States      Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  After reviewing her record       hearing her testimony and evaluating her answers I voted against her      confirmation and explained at length the strong case against      confirmation of this nomination  Nothing about her record or the      reasons that led me then to vote against confirmation has changed      since then  Unlike the consideration of the nomination of William      Myers  on which the Judiciary Committee held another hearing this      year before seeking reconsideration  there has been no effort to      supplement the record on this nomination  Justice Owens record      failed to justify a favorable reporting of the nomination in 2002      and was inadequate to gain the consent of the Senate during the last      two years     Committee      Consideration Of Justice Owens Nomination  In 2001  Justice Owen was nominated to      fill a vacancy that had by that time existed for more than four      years  since January 1997  In the intervening five years  President      Clinton nominated Jorge Rangel  a distinguished Hispanic attorney      from Corpus Christi  to fill that vacancy  Despite      his qualifications  and his unanimous rating of Well Qualified by      the ABA  Mr  Rangel never received a hearing from the Judiciary      Committee  and his nomination was returned to the President without      Senate action at the end of 1998  after a fruitless wait of 15      months    On September 16  1999       President Clinton nominated Enrique Moreno  another outstanding      Hispanic attorney  to fill that same vacancy  Mr  Moreno did not      receive a hearing on his nomination either  over a span of more      than 17 months  President Bush withdrew the nomination of Enrique      Moreno to the Fifth Circuit and later sent Justice Owens name in      its place  It was not until May of 2002  at a hearing presided over      by Senator Schumer  that the Judiciary Committee heard from any of      President Clintons three unsuccessful nominees to the Fifth      Circuit  At that time  Mr  Moreno and Mr  Rangel  joined by a      number of other Clinton nominees  testified about their treatment by      the Republican majority  Thus  Justice Owens was the third      nomination to this vacancy and the first to be accorded a hearing      before the Committee    In fact  when the Judiciary Committee      held its hearing on the nomination of Judge Edith Clement to the      Fifth Circuit in 2001  during the most recent period of Democratic      control of the Senate  it was the first hearing on a Fifth Circuit      nominee in seven years  By contrast  Justice Owen was the third      nomination to the Fifth Circuit on which the Judiciary Committee      held a hearing in less than one year  In spite of the treatment by      the former Republican majority of so many moderate judicial nominees      of the previous President  we proceeded in July of 2001    as I said      that we would    with a hearing on Justice Owen    Justice Owen is one of among 20  Texas nominees who were considered by the Judiciary Committee      while I was Chairman  That included nine District Court judges       four United States Attorneys  three United States Marshals  and      three Executive Branch appointees from Texas who moved swiftly      through the Judiciary Committee   When Justice Owen was initially      nominated  the President changed the confirmation process from that      used by Republican and Democratic Presidents for more than  50 years  That resulted in her ABA peer review not being      received until later that summer  As a result of a Republican      objection to the Democratic leaderships request to retain all      judicial nominations pending before the Senate through the August      recess in 2001  the initial nomination of Justice Owen was required      by Senate rules to be returned to the President without action  The      Committee nonetheless took the unprecedented action of proceeding      during the August recess to hold two hearings involving judicial      nominations  including a nominee to the Court of Appeals for the      Federal Circuit    In my efforts to accommodate a number      of Republican Senators    including the Republican Leader  the      Judiciary Committees ranking member  and at least four other      Republican members of the Committee    I scheduled hearings for      nominees out of the order in which they were received that year  in      accordance with longstanding practice of the Committee     As I consistently indicated  and as      any Chairman can explain  less controversial nominations are easier      to consider and are  by and large  able to be scheduled sooner than      more controversial nominations  This is especially important in the      circumstances that existed at the time of the change in majority in      2001  At that time we faced what Republicans have now admitted had      become a vacancy crisis in the federal courts  From January 1995       when the Republican majority assumed control of the confirmation      process in the Senate  until the shift in majority  vacancies rose      from 65 to 110 and vacancies on the Courts of Appeals more than      doubled from 16 to 33  I thought it important to make as much      progress as quickly as we could in the time available to us that      year  and we did  In fact  through the end of President Bushs      first term  we saw those 110 vacancies plummet to 27  the lowest      vacancy rate since the Reagan Administration    The responsibility to advise and      consent on the President s      nominees is one that I take seriously and that the Judiciary      Committee takes seriously  Justice Owen s      nomination to the Court of Appeals has been given a fair hearing and      a fair process before the Judiciary Committee  I thank all Members      of the Committee for being fair  Those who had concerns had the      opportunity to raise them and heard the nominees response  in      private meetings  at her public hearing and in written follow up      questions    I would particularly like to commend      Senator Feinstein  who chaired the hearing for Justice Owen  for      managing that hearing so fairly and evenhandedly  It was a long      day  where nearly every Senator who is a member of the Committee      came to question Justice Owen  and Senator Feinstein handled it with      patience and equanimity    After that hearing  I brought Justice      Owens nomination up for a vote  and following an open debate where      her opponents discussed her record and their objections on the      merits  the nomination was rejected  Her nomination was fully and      openly debated  and it was rejected  That fair treatment stands in      sharp contrast to the way Republicans had treated President      Clintons nominees  including several to the Fifth Circuit     That should have ended things right      there  But looking back  we now see that this nomination is      emblematic of the ways the White House and Senate Republicans will      trample on precedent and do whatever is necessary in order to get      every last nominee of this Presidents confirmed  no matter how      extreme he or she may be  Priscilla Owens nomination was the first      judicial nomination ever to be resubmitted after already being      debated  voted upon and rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee        When the Senate majority shifted       Republicans reconsidered this nomination and sent it to the Senate      on a straight  party line vote  Never      before had a President  resubmitted a circuit court nominee already      rejected by the Senate Judiciary Committee  for the same vacancy       And until Senator Hatch gave Justice Owen a second hearing in 2003       never before had the Judiciary Committee rejected its own decision      on such a nominee and granted a second hearing  And at that second      hearing we did not learn much more than the obvious fact that  given      some time  Justice Owen was able to enlist the help of the talented      lawyers working at the White House and the Department of Justice to      come up with some new justifications for her record of activism  We      learned that given six months to reconsider the severe criticism      directed at her by her Republican colleagues  she still admitted no      error  Mostly  we learned that the objections expressed originally      by the Democrats on the Judiciary Committee were sincerely held when      they were made  and no less valid after a second hearing  Nothing      Justice Owen said about her record    indeed  nothing anyone else      tried to explain about her record  was able to actually change her      record  That was true then  and that is true today    Senators who opposed this nomination      did so because Priscilla Owens record shows her to be an      ends oriented activist judge  I have previously explained my      conclusions about Justice Owens record  but I will summarize my      objections again today     The Conservative      Majoritys Criticism of Justice Owen  The first area of concern to me is      Justice Owens extremism even among a conservative Supreme Court of      Texas  The conservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme      Court has gone out of its way to criticize Justice Owen and the      dissents she joined in ways that are highly unusual  and in ways      which highlight her ends oriented activism  A number of Texas      Supreme Court Justices have pointed out how far from the language of      statute she strays in her attempts to push the law beyond what the      legislature intended   One example is the majority opinion in     Weiner v  Wasson  900 S W 2d 316  Tex  1995        In this case  Justice Owen wrote a dissent advocating a ruling      against a medical malpractice plaintiff injured while he was still a      teenager  The issue was the constitutionality of a State law      requiring minors to file medical malpractice actions before reaching      the age of majority  or risk being outside the statute of      limitations  Of interest is the majoritys discussion of the      importance of abiding by a prior Texas Supreme Court decision      unanimously striking down a previous version of the statute  In      what reads as a lecture to the dissent  then Justice John Cornyn      explains on behalf of the majority        Generally  we adhere to our precedents for reasons of efficiency       fairness  and legitimacy  First  if we did not follow our own      decisions  no issue could ever be considered resolved  The      potential volume of speculative relitigation under such      circumstances alone ought to persuade us that stare decisis is a      sound policy  Secondly  we should give due consideration to the      settled expectations of litigants like Emmanuel Wasson  who have      justifiably relied on the principles articulated in  the previous      case         Finally  under our form of government  the legitimacy      of the judiciary rests in large part upon a stable and predictable      decisionmaking process that differs dramatically from that properly      employed by the political branches of government       Id  at 12 13   Citations omitted    According to the conservative majority      on the Texas Supreme Court  Justice Owen went out of her way to      ignore precedent and would have ruled for the defendants  The      conservative Republican majority  in contrast to Justice Owen       followed precedent and the doctrine of stare decisis  A clear      example of Justice Owens judicial activism   In Montgomery      Independent School District v  Davis  34 S W  3d 559  Tex       2000   Justice Owen wrote another dissent which drew fire from a      conservative Republican majority  this time for her disregard for      legislative language  In a challenge by a teacher who did not      receive reappointment to her position  the majority found that the      school board had exceeded its authority when it disregarded the      Texas Education Code and tried to overrule a hearing examiners      decision on the matter  Justice Owens dissent advocated for an      interpretation contrary to the language of the applicable statute       The majority  which included Alberto Gonzales and two other      appointees of then Governor Bush  was quite explicit about its view      that Justice Owens position disregarded the law        The dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing examiners role in      the       process by stating that the hearing examiner refused to      make findings on the evidence the Board relies on to support its      additional findings  As we explained above  nothing in the statute      requires the hearing examiner to make findings on matters of which      he is unpersuaded        Id  at 25 26        Emphasis added    The majority also noted that       The dissenting opinions misconception of the hearing examiners      role stems from its disregard of the procedural elements the      Legislature established in subchapter F to ensure that the      hearing examiner process is fair and efficient for both teachers and      school boards  The Legislature maintained local control by giving      school boards alone the option to choose the hearing examiner      process in nonrenewal proceedings        By resolving conflicts in      disputed evidence  ignoring credibility issues  and essentially      stepping into the shoes of the factfinder to reach a specific      result  the dissenting opinion not only disregards the procedural      limitations in the statute but takes a position even more extreme      than that argued for by the board       Id  at      28   Emphasis added    Another clear example of Justice      Owens judicial activism   Collins v  Ison Newsome       73 S W 3d 178  Tex  2001   is yet another case where a dissent       joined by Justice Owen  was roundly criticized by the Republican      majority of the Texas Supreme Court  The Court cogently stated the      legal basis for its conclusion that it had no jurisdiction to decide      the matter before it  and as in other opinions where Justice Owen      was in dissent  took time to explicitly criticize the dissents      positions as contrary to the clear letter of the law   At issue was whether the Supreme Court      had the proper conflicts jurisdiction to hear the interlocutory      appeal of school officials being sued for defamation  The majority      explained that it did not because published lower court decisions do      not create the necessary conflict between themselves  The arguments      put forth by the dissent  in which Justice Owen joined  offended the      majority  and they made their views known  writing        The dissenting opinion agrees that because this is an interlocutory      appeal       this Courts jurisdiction is limited  but then argues      for the exact opposite proposition       This argument defies the      Legislatures clear and express limits on our jurisdiction             The author of the dissenting opinion has written previously that we      should take a broader approach to the conflicts jurisdiction      standard  But a majority of the Court continues to abide by the      Legislatures clear limits on our interlocutory appeal      jurisdiction  Id  at 182   Emphasis added    They continue         T he dissenting opinions reading of Government Code sec  22 225 c       conflates conflicts jurisdiction with dissent jurisdiction  thereby      erasing any distinction between these two separate bases for      jurisdiction  The Legislature identified them as distinct bases for      jurisdiction in sections 22 001 a  1  and  a  2   and section      22 225 c  refers specifically to the two separate provisionsn of      section 22 001 a  providing for conflicts and dissent jurisdiction              W e cannot simply ignore the legislative limits on our      jurisdiction  and not even Petitioners argue that we should do so on      this basis  Id  at 183   Emphasis added    Again  Justice Owen joined a dissent      that the Republican majority described as defiant of legislative      intent and in disregard of legislatively drawn limits  Yet another      clear example of Justice Owens judicial activism   Some of the most striking examples of      criticism of Justice Owens writings  or the dissents and      concurrences she joins  come in a series of parental notification      cases heard in 2000  They include   In In re Jane Doe 1 19 S W 3d      346  Tex  2000   where the majority included an extremely unusual      section explaining its view of the proper role of judges       admonishing the dissent  joined by Justice Owen  for going beyond      its duty to interpret the law in an attempt to fashion policy        Giving a pointed critique of the      dissenters  the majority explained that  In reaching the decision      to grant Jane Does application  we have put aside our personal      viewpoints and endeavored to do our job as judges  that is  to      interpret and apply the Legislatures will as it has been expressed      in the statute  Id  at 350    In a separate concurrence  Justice      Alberto Gonzales wrote that to construe the law as the dissent did       would be an unconscionable act of judicial activism     A conservative Republican colleague of      Justice Owens  pointing squarely to her judicial activism   In In re Jane Doe 3  19 S W  3d      300  Tex  2000   Justice Enoch writes specifically to rebuke Justice      Owen and her follow dissenters for misconstruing the legislatures      definition of the sort of abuse that may occur when parents are      notified of a minors intent to have an abortion  saying  abuse is      abuse  it is neither to be trifled with nor its severity to be      second guessed  Id  at 307   In one case that is perhaps the      exception that proves the rule  Justice Owen wrote a majority that      was bitterly criticized by the dissent for its activism  In In      re City of Georgetown  53 S W  3d 328   Tex       2001   Justice Owen wrote a majority opinion finding that the city      did not have to give the Austin      American Statesman a report prepared by a consulting      expert in connection with pending and anticipated litigation because      such information was expressly made confidential under other law       namely  the Texas Rules of Civil Procedure    The dissent is extremely critical of      Justice Owens opinion  citing the Texas law s strong      preference for disclosure and liberal construction  Accusing her of      activism  Justice Abbott  joined by Chief Justice Phillips and      Justice Baker  notes that the legislature  expressly identified      eighteen categories of information that are public information and      that must be disclosed upon request        sec   a   The Legislature      attempted to safeguard its policy of open records by adding      subsection  b   which limits courts encroachment on its      legislatively established policy decisions  Id  at 338  The      dissent further protests         b ut if this Court has the power to broaden by judicial rule the      categories of information that are confidential under other law       then subsection  b  is eviscerated from the statute  By determining      what information falls outside subsection  a s scope  this Court      may evade the mandates of subsection  b  and order information      withheld whenever it sees fit  This not only contradicts the spirit      and language of subsection  b   it guts it  Id    Finally  the opinion concluded by      asserting that Justice Owens interpretation  abandons strict      construction and rewrites the statute to eliminate subsection  b  s      restrictions  Id  at 343   Yet again  her colleagues on the     Texas court  citing Justice Owens judicial activism   These examples  together with the      unusually harsh language directed at Justice Owens position by the      majority in the Doe cases  show a judge out of step with the      conservative Republican majority of the Texas Supreme Court  a      majority not afraid to explain the danger of her activist views    A Judicial Activist      Showing Bias Against Consumers  Victims  Ordinary People  I am also greatly concerned about      Justice Owens record of ends oriented decision making as a Justice      on the Texas Supreme Court  As one reads case after case       particularly those in which she was the sole dissenter or dissented      with the extreme right wing of the Court  her pattern of activism      becomes clear  Her legal views in so many cases involving statutory      interpretation simply cannot be reconciled with the plain meaning of      the statute  the legislative intent  or the majoritys      interpretation  leading to the conclusion that she sets out to      justify some pre conceived idea of what the law ought to mean  This      is not an appropriate way for a judge to make decisions  This is a      judge whose record reflects that she is willing and sometimes eager      to make law from the bench    Justice Owens activism and extremism      is noteworthy in a variety of cases  including those dealing with      business interests  malpractice  access to public information       employment discrimination and Texas Supreme Court jurisdiction  in      which she writes against individual plaintiffs time and time again       in seeming contradiction of the law as written   One of the cases where this trend is      evident is FM Properties v  City of Austin  22 S W  3d 868  Tex       1998   I asked Justice Owen about this 1998 environmental case at      her hearing  In her   dissent from a 6 3 ruling  in which      Justice Alberto Gonzales was among the majority  Justice Owen showed      her willingness to rule in favor of large private landowners against      the clear public interest in maintaining a fair regulatory process      and clean water  Her dissent  which the majority characterized as      nothing more than inflammatory rhetoric  was an attempt to favor      big landowners    In this case  the Texas Supreme Court      found that a section of the Texas Water Code allowing certain      private owners of large tracts of land to create water quality      zones  and write their own water quality regulations and plans       violated the Texas Constitution because it improperly delegated      legislative power to private entities  The Court found that the      Water Code section gave the private landowners  legislative duties      and powers  the exercise of which may adversely affect public      interests  including the constitutionally protected public interest      in water quality  Id  at 876 77  The Court      also found that certain aspects of the Code and the factors      surrounding its implementation weighed against the delegation of      power  including the lack of meaningful government review  the lack      of adequate representation of citizens affected by the private      owners actions  the breadth of the delegation  and the big      landowners obvious interest in maximizing their own profits and      minimizing their own costs   The majority offered a strong opinion       detailing its legal reasoning and explaining the dangers of offering      too much legislative power to private entities  By contrast  in her      dissent  Justice Owen argued that   w hile the Constitution      certainly permits the Legislature to enact laws that preserve and      conserve the States natural resources  there is nothing in the      Constitution that requires the Legislature to exercise that power in      any particular manner  ignoring entirely the possibility of an      unconstitutional delegation of power  Id  at      889  Her view strongly favored large business interests to the      clear detriment of the public interest  and against the persuasive      legal arguments of a majority of the Court    When I asked her about this case at      her hearing  I found her answer perplexing  In a way that she did      not argue in her written dissent  at her hearing Justice Owen      attempted to cast the FM Properties case not as  a fight between      and City of Austin and big business  but in all honesty             really a fight about       the State of Texas versus the City of      Austin   Transcript at 69   In the written dissent however  she      began by stating the  importance of this case to private property      rights and the separation of powers between the judicial and      legislative branches       and went on to decry the Courts      decision as one that  will impair all manner of property rights       22 S W  3d at 889  At the time she wrote her dissent  Justice Owen      was certainly clear about the meaning of this case  property rights      for corporations   Another case that concerned me is      GTE Southwest  Inc  v  Bruce  990 S W 2d      605  where Justice Owen wrote in favor of GTE in a lawsuit by      employees for intentional infliction of emotional distress  The      rest of the Court held that three employees subjected to what the      majority characterized as constant humiliating and abusive behavior      of their supervisor were entitled to the jury verdict in their      favor  Despite the Courts recitation of an exhaustive list of      sickening behavior by the supervisor  and its clear application of      Texas law to those facts  Justice Owen wrote a concurring opinion to      explain her difference of opinion on the key legal issue in the case       whether the behavior in evidence met the legal standard for      intentional infliction of emotional distress    Justice Owen contended that the      conduct was not  as the standard requires  so outrageous in      character  and so extreme in degree  as to go beyond all possible      bounds of decency Id  at 621  The majority      opinion shows Justice Owens concurrence advocating an inexplicable      point of view that ignores the facts in evidence in order to reach a      predetermined outcome in the corporations favor   Justice Owens recitation of facts in      her concurrence significantly minimizes the evidence as presented by      the majority  Among the kinds of behavior to which the employees      were subjected  according to the majority opinion  are  Upon his      arrival the supervisor  began regularly using the harshest      vulgarity      continued to use the word f___ and motherf    r      frequently when speaking with the employees      repeatedly      physically and verbally threatened and terrorized them      would      frequently assault each of the employees by physically charging at      them       come up fast       and get up over  the employee             and yell and scream in her face       called  an employee  into his      office every day and       have her stand in from of him  sometimes      for as long as thirty minutes  while  the supervisor  simply stared      at her       made  an employee  get on her hands and knees and clean      the spots  on the carpet  while he stood over her yelling   Id       at 613 614  Justice Owen did not believe that such conduct was      outrageous or outside the bounds of decency under state law   At her hearing  in answer to Senator      Edwardss questions about this case  Justice Owen again gave an      explanation not to be found in her written views  She told him that      she agreed with the majoritys holding  and wrote separately only to      make sure that future litigants would not be confused and think that      out of context  any one of the outrages suffered by the plaintiffs      would not support a judgment  Looking again at her dissent  I do      not see why  if that was what she truly intended  she did not say so      in language plain enough to be understood  or why she thought it      necessary to write and say it in the first place  It is a somewhat      curious distinction to make  to advocate that in a tort case a      judge should write a separate concurrence to explain which part of      the plaintiffs case  standing alone  would not support a finding of      liability  Neither her written concurrence  nor her answers in      explanation after the fact  is satisfactory explanation of her      position in this case   In City of Garland v  Dallas      Morning News  22 S W  3d 351  Tex  2000   Justice      Owen dissented from a majority opinion and  again  it is difficult      to justify her views other than as being based on a desire to reach      a particular outcome  The majority upheld a decision giving the      newspaper access to a document outlining the reasons why the citys      finance director was going to be fired  Justice Owen made two      arguments  that because the document was considered a draft it was      not subject to disclosure  and that the document was exempt from      disclosure because it was part of policy making  Both of these      exceptions were so large as to swallow the rule requiring      disclosure  The majority rightly points out that if Justice Owens      views prevailed  almost any document could be labeled draft to      shield it from public view  Moreover  to call a personnel decision      a part of policy making is such an expansive interpretation it would      leave little that would not be policy   Quantum Chemical v  Toennies       47 S W  3d 473  Tex  2001   is another troubling case where Justice      Owen joined a dissent advocating an activist interpretation of a      clearly written statute  In this age discrimination suit brought      under the Texas civil rights statute  the relevant parts of which      were modeled on Title VII of the federal Civil Rights Act  and its      amendments   the appeal to the Texas Supreme Court centered on the      standard of causation necessary for a finding for the plaintiff       The plaintiff argued  and the five justices in the majority agreed       that the plain meaning of the statute must be followed  and that the      plaintiff could prove an unlawful employment practice by showing      that discrimination was a motivating factor  The employer      corporation argued  and Justices Hecht and Owen agreed  that the      plain meaning could be discarded in favor of a more tortured and      unnecessary reading of the statute  and that the plaintiff must show      that discrimination was the motivating factor  in order to recover      damages   The portion of Title VII on which the      majority relies for its interpretation was part of Congresss 1991      fix to the United States Supreme Courts opinion in the Price      Waterhouse case  which held that an employer could avoid liability      if the plaintiff could not show discrimination was the motivating      factor  Congresss fix  in Section 107 of the Civil Rights Act of      1991  does not specify whether the motivating factor standard      applies to both sorts of discrimination cases  the so called mixed      motive cases as well as the pretext cases    The Texas majority      concluded that they must rely on the plain language of the statute      as amended  which could not be any clearer that under Title VII      discrimination can be shown to be a motivating factor  Justice      Owen joined Justice Hecht in claiming that federal case law is clear       in favor of their view   and opted for a reading of the statute      that would turn it into its polar opposite  forcing plaintiffs into      just the situation legislators were trying to avoid  This example      of Justice Owens desire to change the law from the bench  instead      of interpret it  fits President Bushs definition of activism to a      T    Notification Cases  Justice Owen has also demonstrated her      tendency toward ends oriented decision making quite clearly in a      series of dissents and concurrences in cases involving a  Texas law providing for a judicial bypass of parental      notification requirements for minors seeking abortions    The most striking example is Justice      Owens expression of disagreement with the majoritys decision on      key legal issues in Doe 1  She strongly disagreed with the      majoritys holding on what a minor would have to show in order to      establish that she was  as the statute requires  sufficiently well      informed to make the decision on her own  While the conservative      Republican majority laid out a well reasoned test for this element      of the law  based on the plain meaning of the statute and well cited      case law  Justice Owen inserted elements found in neither      authority  Specifically  Justice Owen insisted that the majoritys      requirement that the minor be aware of the emotional and      psychological aspects of undergoing an abortion was not sufficient      and that among other requirements with no basis in the law  she       would require       that the minor  should       indicate to the      court that she is aware of and has considered that there are      philosophic  social  moral  and religious arguments that can be      brought to bear when considering abortion  In re Jane Doe 1       19 S W 3d 249  256  Tex  2000    In her written concurrence  Justice      Owen indicated  through legal citation  that support for this      proposition could be found in a particular page of the Supreme      Courts opinion in Planned Parenthood v  Casey  However       when one looks at that portion of the Casey decision  one finds no      mention of requiring a minor to acknowledge religious or moral      arguments  The passage talks instead about the ability of a State      to enact rules and regulations designed to encourage her to know      that there are philosophic and social arguments of great weight that      can be brought to bear  Casey at 872  Justice Owens      reliance on this portion of a United States Supreme Court opinion to      rewrite Texas law was simply wrong   As she did in answer to questions      about a couple of other cases at her hearing  Justice Owen tried to      explain away this problem with an after the fact justification  She      told Senator Cantwell that the reference to religion was not to be      found in Casey after all  but in another U S  Supreme Court case       H L  v  Matheson  She explained that in Matheson they talk      about that for some people it raises profound moral and religious      concerns  and theyre talking about the desirability or the States      interest in these kinds of considerations in making an informed      decision  Transcript at 172  But again  on reading Matheson  one      sees that the only mention of religion comes in a quotation meant to      explain why the parents of the minor are due notification  not about      the contours of what the government may require someone to prove to      show she was fully well informed  Her reliance on Matheson for her      proposed rewrite of the law is just as faulty as her reliance on      Casey  Neither one supports her reading of the law  She simply      tries a little bit of legal smoke and mirrors to make it appear as      if they did  This is the sort of ends oriented decision making that      destroys the belief of a citizen in a fair legal system  And most      troubling of all was her indication to Senator Feinstein that she      still views her dissents in the Doe cases as the proper      reading and construction of the Texas statute          A Second Review By Judiciary Committee  At      her second  unprecedented hearing in 2003  Justice Owen and her      defenders tried hard to recast her record and others criticism of      it  I went to that hearing  I listened to her testimony  and I read      her written answers  many newly formulated  that attempt to explain      away her very disturbing opinions in the   Texas parental      notification cases  But her record is still her record  and the      record is clear  She did not satisfactorily explain why she infused      the words of the Texas legislature with so much more meaning than      she can be sure they intended  She adequately describes the      precedents of the Supreme Court of the United States  to be sure       but she simply did not justify the leaps in logic and plain meaning      she attempted in those decisions    I      read her responses to Senator Hatchs remarks at that second      hearing  where he attempted to explain away cases about which I had      expressed concern at her first hearing  For example  I heard him      explain the opinion she wrote in F M  Properties v  City of      Austin  I read how he recharacterized the dispute in an effort      to make it sound innocuous  just a struggle between two      jurisdictions over some unimportant regulations  I know how       through a choreographed exchange of leading questions and short      answers  they tried to respond to my question from the original      hearing  which was never really answered  about why      Justice Owen thought it was proper for the legislature to grant      large corporate landowners the power to regulate themselves  I      remained unconvinced  The majority in this case  which invalidated      a state statute favoring corporations  did not describe the case or      the issues as Senator Hatch and Justice Owen did  A fair reading of      the case shows no evidence of a struggle between governments  This      is all an attempt at after the fact  revisionist justification where      there really is none to be found    Justice Owen and Chairman Hatchs      explanation of the case also lacked even the weakest effort at      rebutting the criticism of her by the F M  Properties      majority  In its opinion  the six justice majority said  and I am      quoting  that Justice Owens dissent was nothing more than      inflammatory rhetoric  They explained why her legal objections      were mistaken  saying that no matter what the state legislature had      the power to do on its own  it was simply unconstitutional to give      the big landowners the power they were given  No talk of the      City of Austin v  the State of Texas  Just the facts          Likewise  the few explanations offered for the many other examples      of the times her Republican colleagues criticized her were      unavailing  The tortured reading of Justice Gonzales remarks in      the Doe case were unconvincing  He clearly said that to      construe the law in the way that Justice Owens dissent construed      the law would be activism  Any other interpretation is just not      credible    And      no reasons were offered for why her then colleague  now ours       Justice Cornyn  thought it necessary to explain the principle of      stare decisis to her in his opinion in Weiner v  Wasson  Or      why in Montgomery Independent School District v  Davis  the      majority criticized her for her disregard for legislative language       saying that  the dissenting opinion misconceives the hearing      examiner s role in the       process  which it said stemmed from       its disregard of the procedural elements the Legislature      established       to ensure that the hearing examiner process is      fair and efficient for both teachers and school boards  Or why  in     Collins v  Ison Newsome  a dissent joined by Justice Owen was      so roundly criticized by the Republican majority  which said the      dissent agrees with one proposition but then argues for the exact      opposite proposition        defying  the Legislatures clear and      express limits on our jurisdiction    I      have said it before  but I am forced to say it again  These      examples  together with the unusually harsh language directed at      Justice Owen s position by the majority in the Doe cases       show a judge out of step with the conservative Republican majority      of the Texas Supreme Court  a majority not afraid to explain the      danger of her activist views  No good explanation was offered for      these critical statements last year  and no good explanation was      offered two weeks ago  Politically motivated rationalizations do      not negate the plain language used to describe her activism at the      time    Conclusion  When he nominated Priscilla Owen       President Bush said that his standard for judging judicial nominees      would be that they  Ashare      a commitment to follow and apply the law  not to make law from the      bench        He said he is against judicial activism  Yet he has appointed      judicial activists like Priscilla Owen and Janice Rogers Brown    Under President Bushs own standards       Justice Owen s record of ends oriented judicial activism does not      qualify her for a lifetime appointment to the federal bench     The President has often spoken of      judicial activism without acknowledging that ends oriented      decision making can come easily to extreme ideological nominees  In      the case of Priscilla Owen  we see a perfect example of such an      approach to the law  and I cannot support it  The oath taken by      federal judges affirms their commitment to   Aadminister      justice without respect to persons  and do equal right to the poor      and to the rich        No one who enters a federal courtroom should have to wonder whether      he or she will be fairly heard by the judge    Justice Priscilla Owen s record of      judicial activism and ends oriented decision making leaves me with      grave doubt about her ability to be a fair judge  The President      says he opposes putting judicial activists on the federal bench  yet      Justice Priscilla Owen unquestionably is a judicial activist  I      cannot vote to confirm her for this appointment to one of the      highest courts in the land
