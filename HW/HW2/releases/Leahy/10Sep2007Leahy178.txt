       Guest Column And Blog Entry By Senator Patrick Leahy  A Checklist For   Choosing The Next Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Guest Column And          By Senator Leahy      A Checklist For Choosing The Next Attorney General For the next Attorney General of the United States  a big job becomes     even bigger  Along with helping keep Americans safe  protecting their     rights  combating crime and enforcing the law  and managing more than     100 000 employees and a budget extending into the tens of billions of     dollars  the next Attorney General must regain public trust and begin     the process of restoring the Department of Justice to be worthy of its     name    At a department that has been needlessly and disastrously run into     the ditch  he or she will have the challenge of repairing damage     inflicted by a White House that injected politics into every level of     the agency    As a former prosecutor I know how disappointed the dedicated men and     women of law enforcement are about the abuses that congressional     investigations have uncovered  many have described their feelings to me      The dismay runs deep  from the career attorneys at Justice and in our     U S  Attorney offices  to the police officers on the beat    I hope the President will choose wisely in filling this important     vacancy at this important time  There is no shortage of talented leaders     who could unite the American people and the Senate and start to rebuild     the Departments rock bottom morale  The Constitution prescribes that     Presidents seek the advice and the consent of the Senate in filling such     vacancies  and senators of both political parties want to help the     President get this right  He should accept our offer    The Justice Department is different from other cabinet departments      It is the heart of a justice system that is the envy of the world  The     Founders wanted to buffer law enforcement and the justice system from     political influence because in America  no one  not even the President      is supposed to be above the law  In North Carolina s 1776     constitution  the attorney general was given the same life tenure as the     judges  while its governors were elected for one year terms  And in its     earliest days  the precursor of todays Justice Department offered legal     advice both to Congress and to the President  In recent years  some have     even suggested 10 year terms for our attorneys general to further shield     them from White House interference    It is deeply saddening and infuriating that this history and these     standards have been ignored  Considering the evasive testimony Congress     has heard time and again from various Justice Department witnesses  one     would almost think the Departments motto had changed to I dont     recall    The troubling evidence revealed through our hearings needs to be a     lesson to those who hold these high offices in the future  so that our     Justice Department is never subverted in this way again  No Justice     Department should be manipulated into a political arm of the White     House  whether occupied by a Republican or a Democrat    The Department needs strong  clear eyed leadership  This is not a     time for cronyism  and this is not a time for a placeholder  Here is a     checklist of qualities that help define the kind of leader the     Department of Justice needs right now       Experience and sound judgment grounded in respect for the law and     for the vibrant framework of checks and balances among co equal branches     of government that gives our system accountability and responsiveness to     the will of the people       A proven track record of independence to ensure that he or she     will act as an independent check on this Administrations expansive     claims of virtually unlimited Executive power       The commitment and the personal attributes needed to regain     credibility and the respect of the public  the Congress  and the Justice     Departments workforce  credibility and respect that have been     frittered away       A willingness to apply the law without fear or favor  without     regard to partisan politics  and to stand up to the White House when     necessary  The attorney general is the peoples lawyer  not the     Presidents  He or she is not the secretary of a department but the     Attorney General of the United States       A commitment to restore vigilance and vitality to a Civil Rights     Division that has been run onto the rocks by misdirection and by     shameful efforts  possibly even illegal efforts  to replace dedicated     career attorneys with applicants who were improperly hired for their     political loyalty to the Bush Administration       A respect for Congresss oversight role  At its best  the     confirmation process can be a clarifying moment  It can also be a     catalyst for resolving problems like the White Houses refusal to     provide witnesses and documents that are needed to answer questions     about the mass firing of U S  attorneys and about the legal basis for     the warrantless wiretapping program    An earlier Attorney General appointed by the Presidents father     remarked  Nothing would be so destructive to the rule of law as to     permit purely political considerations to overrun sound legal judgment      The departing Attorney General showed a lack of independence from the     President and White House  We have seen the disastrous consequences    The new Attorney General cannot interpret our laws to mean whatever     the President wants them to mean  The Attorney General is supposed to     uphold the rule of law on behalf of all of the American people    The President begins this process  Through his choice for Attorney     General he can be a uniter or a divider  For the sake of the Department     of Justice and its vital missions on behalf of the American people  this     would be an excellent time to work with us to unite the nation                 U S  Sen  Patrick Leahy
