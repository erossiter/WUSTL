       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Bush Administration s Poor Record   On Data Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Bush Administrations Poor Record On Data Security     News Conference  Capitol Hill     Thursday  July 13  2006 It is becoming      an all too familiar story in the lives of Americans  the escalating      reports of the unauthorized disclosure or theft of sensitive       personal information  And in too many of these cases  the breaches      are occurring within the federal government  highlighting the      Bush Cheney Administrations abysmal record on combating and      protecting Americans from identity theft  Because of this      Administrations recklessness and incompetence when it comes to data      security and its refusal to admit and learn from its mistakes       millions of Americans  including our veterans and our active duty      service members who  at this very moment  are risking their lives in      Iraq  Afghanistan and elsewhere  now have to worry about whether      their personal information and the personal information of their      loved ones is safe in the hands of the Bush Cheney Administration       That is not something they should have to worry about  Last year alone       there were 151 incidents of identity theft  affecting more than 57      million people  according to a study by the non partisan Identity      Theft Resource Center  whose representatives join us here today       And  since the beginning of 2005  there have been at least 93 data      breaches  many involving our governmental or military agencies       potentially affecting more than 32 million individuals  That is      unacceptable  and it is wrong   Just yesterday       news outlets were reporting a security breach at the State      Department  Regrettably  it comes on the heels of other government      breaches including              The posting of sensitive personal records for more than 100 000 Navy      and Marine Corps aviators and air crew members  including names and      Social Security numbers on the Navys Safety Center website  a      website that is available to the general public  according to      reports in the Washington Post            The posting on another public web site of the personal information      of at least 28 000 U S  sailors and their family members           The report by the Agriculture Department that a contractor for its      Farm Service Agency inadvertently released the Social Security and      tax identification numbers of about 350 000 tobacco farmers and      landowners    All of these      unfortunate disclosures follow the theft of the personal data of      26 5 million of our veterans and active duty personnel at the      Veterans Administration  Fortunately  the FBI was able to recover      the stolen laptop  but we cannot be certain that the sensitive      information stored on this lap top was not compromised   A report issued      by the VA Inspector General this week also found that the VA has      still not done enough to protect the agency s data or to hold      officials responsible for its data breach accountable  While it may be      impossible to stop all breaches of personal data  most if not all of      these breaches could have been avoided if the Administration had      simply followed safe and well established information handling      practices  These data      security breaches illustrate why we need strong federal data privacy      and security laws  Last year  Senator Specter and I introduced the      Personal Data Privacy and Security Act  which requires federal      agencies and private data brokers to give prompt notice when      sensitive personal information has been breached or stolen  The      Judiciary Committee overwhelmingly approved this bill last fall  but      almost a year later  the Senate has still not acted on this      legislation   Had this bill      been in enacted  it would have required the VA and other federal      agencies to promptly notify the millions of Veterans and service      members now at risk of identity theft about the theft or disclosure      of their personal data  Our bill also      addresses the governments use of personal data by putting privacy      and security front and center in evaluating whether data brokers can      be trusted with government contracts that involve sensitive      information about the American people  For the sake of      all Americans  and especially our veterans and men and women in      uniform  Congress needs to make data security and privacy a      priority in the remaining weeks of this session and act now to pass      comprehensive data privacy and security legislation   The Republican      leadership of Congress so far has chosen not to make this bill a      high priority  The American people have had enough of this      recklessness with their personal information  Its past time to put      the publics concerns about data security on Congresss to do list      for the few remaining weeks left in this session
