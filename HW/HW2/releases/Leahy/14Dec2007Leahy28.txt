       Senate Unanimously Passes Revised OPEN Government Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Senate Unanimously Passes       Revised OPEN Government Bill      Leahy  Cornyn  Kyl Call On       House       To Swiftly Pass FOIA Reform Legislation     WASHINGTON  Friday  Dec  14  2007         The Senate Friday unanimously passed revised legislation to       improve and strengthen the Freedom of Information Act  the law       that protects the publics right to know what their government       is doing  The Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National        OPEN  Government Act was reintroduced by Sens  Patrick Leahy        D Vt    John Cornyn  R Texas   and Jon Kyl  R Ariz   and passed       by the Senate       Leahy and Cornyn originally       introduced bipartisan legislation in March to make meaningful       reforms to FOIA  and the legislation was unanimously passed by       the Senate before the congressional August recess  While the       House passed a similar measure  efforts to move the legislation       forward were stalled over concerns about pay go issues  The       Leahy Cornyn Kyl legislation addresses the House concerns  while       preserving the key elements of the Senate passed bill  Leahy       and Cornyn have been longtime advocates of implementing FOIA       reforms to address agency delays and litigation concerns under       the Freedom of Information Act  House Oversight and Government       Reform Chairman Henry Waxman  D Calif   has been leading efforts       in the House to pass FOIA reform       Senator Cornyn and I have worked       with our partners in the House for months in our joint efforts       to make important reforms to the Freedom of Information Act       before the end of this year  said Leahy  Chairman Waxman has       been an important part of these efforts  and Congress is now       poised put a final bill on the Presidents desk before the       December recess  I hope the House will pass this legislation       next week        Its encouraging to see this       important effort to expand open government move another step       forward  Cornyn said  Ill continue working with Chairman       Leahy and our colleagues until these reforms are enacted into       law        The OPEN Government Act would       Restore meaningful deadlines        for agency action under FOIA    Impose real consequences on        federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day statutory        deadline    Clarify that FOIA applies to        government records held by outside private contractors          Establish a FOIA hotline        service for all federal agencies  and   Create a FOIA Ombudsman to        provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a        meaningful alternative to costly litigation          The legislation will now be sent       to the House for consideration                            For Background Purposes            Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act       of 2007          OPEN Government Act of 2007   Cornyn Leahy Kyl          Section by Section Analysis      Sec  1  Short       Title  The Open Government Act of 2007       Sec  2        Findings  The findings reiterate the intent       of Congress upon enacting the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA         5 U S C  552 as amended  and restate FOIAs presumption in favor       of disclosure       Sec  3        Protection of Fee Status for News Media  This       section amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  A  ii  to make clear that       independent journalists are not barred from obtaining fee       waivers solely because they lack an institutional affiliation       with a recognized news media entity  In determining whether to       grant a fee waiver  an agency shall consider the prior       publication history of the requestor  If the requestor has no       prior publication history and no current affiliation with a news       organization  the agency shall review the requestors plans for       disseminating the requested material and whether those plans       include distributing the material to a reasonably broad       audience        Sec  4        Recovery of Attorney Fees and Litigation Costs   This section  the so called  Buckhannon fix        amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  E  to clarify that a complainant has       substantially prevailed in a FOIA lawsuit  and is eligible to       recover attorney fees  if the complainant has obtained relief       through a judicial or administrative order or if the pursuit of       a claim was the catalyst for the voluntary or unilateral change       in position by the opposing party  The section responds to the       Supreme Courts ruling in       Buckhannon Board and Care Home  Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of       Health and Human Resources  532 U S  598  2001         which eliminated the catalyst theory of attorney fee recovery       under certain Federal civil rights laws  FOIA requestors have       raised concerns that the holding in  Buckhannon could be       extended to FOIA cases  This section preserves the catalyst       theory in FOIA litigation   Adds House       pay go language to require that any attorneys fees be paid from       any annually appropriated agency funds       Sec  5        Disciplinary Actions for Arbitrary and Capricious Rejections of       Requests  FOIA currently requires that when a       court finds that agency personnel have acted arbitrarily or       capriciously with respect to withholding documents  the Office       of Special Counsel shall determine whether disciplinary action       against the involved personnel is warranted   See 5 U S C        552 a  4  F   This section of the bill amends FOIA to require       the Attorney General to notify the Office of Special Counsel of       any such court finding and to report the same to Congress  It       further requires the Office of Special Counsel to report       annually to Congress on any actions taken by the Special Counsel       to investigate cases of this type        Sec  6  Time       Limits for Agencies to Act on Requests  The       section clarifies that the 20 day time limit on responding to a       FOIA request commences on the date on which the request is first       received by the appropriate agency component       Further  the section states       that if the agency fails to respond within the 20 day limit  the       agency may not assess the FOIA search fees  and duplication fees       in the case of non commercial requestors  collected in       connection with that FOIA request   Also adds duplication fees for       non commercial requestors to the penalty for untimeliness       Sec  7        Individualized Tracking Numbers for Requests and Status       Information  Requires agencies to establish       tracking systems by assigning a tracking number to each FOIA       request  notifying a requestor of the tracking number within ten       days of receiving a request  and establishing a telephone or       Internet tracking system to allow requestors to easily obtain       information on the status of their individual requests        including an estimated date on which the agency will complete       action on the request       Sec  8        Reporting Requirements  This section adds to       current reporting requirements by mandating disclosure of data       on the 10 oldest active requests pending at each agency        including the amount of time elapsed since each request was       originally filed  and requires additional breakdowns depending       on the length of delay  This section further requires agencies       to calculate and report on the average response times and range       of response times of FOIA requests   Current requirements       mandate reporting on the median response time   Finally  this       section requires reports on the number of fee status requests       that are granted and denied and the average number of days for       adjudicating fee status determinations by individual agencies       The       bill does not include the Specific Citations in Exemptions       provision that was set forth in Section 8 of S  849       Sec  9        Openness of Agency Records Maintained by a Private Entity       This section clarifies that agency records       kept by private contractors licensed by the government to       undertake recordkeeping functions remain subject to FOIA just as       if those records were maintained by the relevant government       agency       Sec  10        Office of Government Services  This section       establishes an Office of Government Information Services within       the National Archives and Records Administration  Within that       office will be appointed a FOIA ombudsman to review agency       policies and procedures  audit agency performance  recommend       policy changes  and mediate disputes between FOIA requestors and       agencies  The establishment of an ombudsman will not impact the       ability of requestors to litigate FOIA claims  but rather will       serve to alleviate the need for litigation whenever possible             Sec  11        Report on Personnel Policies Related to FOIA   This section requires the Office of Personnel Management to       examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency level        including an assessment of whether FOIA performance should be       considered as a factor in personnel performance reviews  whether       a job classification series specific to FOIA and the Privacy Act       should be considered  and whether FOIA awareness training should       be provided to federal employees       Sec 12       Requirement to Describe       Exemptions Authorizing Deletions of Material Provided Under FOIA       This       section requires that agencies describe the FOIA exemptions that       they are relying upon to redact material from information that       is provided under FOIA                     Statement Of Senator       Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee   On Passage Of The OPEN       Government Act   And Urging Prompt       Enactment By The House Of Representatives  December 14  2007     Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I am       pleased that    once again    the Senate has reaffirmed its       bipartisan commitment to open and transparent government by       unanimously passing the Openness       Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act   the OPEN Government Act     the first major reform to the       Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  in  more than a decade        I commend the bills chief Republican cosponsor  Senator John       Cornyn  for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform       legislation this year  I am also appreciative of the efforts of       Senator Jon Kyl for cosponsoring this bill and helping us to       reach a compromise on this legislation  so that the Senate could       consider and pass meaningful FOIA reform legislation this year       Earlier this year  the Senate       passed this historic FOIA reform legislation  S  849  before       adjourning for the August recess  Now that the Senate has       unanimously passed a modified bill  to ensure that pay go and       other concerns of the House are adequately addressed  I hope       that the House will promptly enact this bill and send it to the       President without further delay        I have very worked hard to address       the concerns of the House Oversight and Government Reform       Committee  to ensure that the Congress can enact meaningful FOIA       reform legislation this year  I commend Congressman Waxman  the       distinguished Chairman of that Committee  for his commitment to       FOIA reform and I thank him and his staff for all of their hard       work on this legislation       The bill that the Senate passed       today includes pay go language that has been requested by the       House and it also eliminates a provision on citations to FOIA       exemptions in legislation that was in the previous bill  To       accommodate other concerns of the House  the bill also includes       a new provision that requires federal agencies to disclose the       FOIA exemptions that they rely upon when redacting information       from documents released under FOIA  In addition  the bill adds       FOIA duplication fees for non commercial requestors to the fee       waiver penalty that will be imposed when an agency fails to meet       the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA  While I will continue to       work with the House and others to further strengthen this       critical open government law  I hope that the House will       promptly take up the bipartisan FOIA compromise bill that we       have been able to pass so that it may be signed into law before       the end of the year       The First FOIA Reforms in More       Than a Decade      As the first major reform to FOIA       in more than a decade  the OPEN Government Act will help to       reverse the troubling trends of excessive delays and lax FOIA       compliance in our government and help to restore the publics       trust in their government  This bill will also improve       transparency in the Federal Governments FOIA process by        Restoring        meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA      Imposing        real consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIAs        20 day statutory deadline     Clarifying        that FOIA applies to government records held by outside        private contractors            Establishing a FOIA hotline service for all federal        agencies  and    Creating a        FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and federal        agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation              Specifically  the OPEN Government       Act will protect the publics right to know  by ensuring that       anyone who gathers information to inform the public  including       freelance journalists and bloggers  may seek a fee waiver when       they request information under FOIA  The bill ensures that       federal agencies will not automatically exclude Internet blogs       and other Web based forms of media when deciding whether to       waive FOIA fees  In addition  the bill also clarifies that the       definition of news media  for purposes of FOIA fee waivers        includes free newspapers and individuals performing a media       function who do not necessarily have a prior history of       publication             The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action        by ensuring that the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA starts       when a request is received by the appropriate component of the       agency and requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests       to the appropriate agency component within 10 days of the       receipt of such requests  To ensure accuracy in FOIA responses        the bill allows federal agencies to toll the 20 day clock while       they are awaiting a response to a reasonable request for       information from a FOIA requester on one occasion  or while the       agency is awaiting clarification regarding a FOIA fee       assessment  In addition  to encourage agencies to meet the       20 day time limit  the bill requires that an agency refund FOIA       search fees  and duplication fees for non commercial requestors          if it fails to meet the 20 day deadline  except in the case       of exceptional circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute                   The bill also addresses a relatively         new concern that  under current law  federal agencies have an       incentive to delay compliance with FOIA requests until just       before a court decision is made that is favorable to a FOIA       requestor  The Supreme Courts decision in  Buckhannon Board and Care Home        Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of Health and Human Resources        532 U S  598  2001   eliminated the catalyst theory for       attorneys fees recovery under certain federal civil rights       laws  When applied to FOIA cases   Buckhannon precludes       FOIA requesters from ever being eligible to recover attorneys       fees under circumstances where an agency provides the records       requested in the litigation just prior to a court decision that       would have been favorable to the FOIA requestor  The bill       clarifies that Buckhannon      does not apply to FOIA cases  Under the bill  a FOIA       requester can obtain attorneys fees when he or she files a       lawsuit to obtain records from the government and the government       releases those records before the court orders them to do so        But  this provision would not allow the requester to recover       attorneys fees if the requesters claim is wholly       insubstantial  To address House pay go concerns  the bill       also requires that any attorneys fees assessed under this       provision be paid from any annually appropriated agency funds                   To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation        the bill also creates       an Office of Government Information Services in the National       Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency level FOIA       disputes  In addition the bill ensures that each federal agency       will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer  who will monitor the agencys       compliance with FOIA requests  and a FOIA Public Liaison who       will be available to resolve FOIA related disputes               Finally  the bill does several things to enhance the agency       reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA  The bill       creates a tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of       the public and the media  The bill also establishes a FOIA       hotline service for all federal agencies  either by telephone or       on the Internet  to enable requestors to track the status of       their FOIA requests  And  the       bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are       held by outside private contractors  no matter where these       records are located              OPEN Government is an American Value      The Freedom of Information Act is       an essential tool to ensure that all Americans can access       information about the workings of their government  But  after       four decades  this open government law needs to be       strengthened  I am pleased that the reforms contained in the       OPEN Government Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated    so       that it works more effectively for the American people       Again  I commend Senators Cornyn       and Kyl and the many other cosponsors of this legislation for       their dedication to open government  But  most importantly  I       especially want to thank the many concerned citizens who        knowing the importance of this measure to the American peoples       right to know  have demanded action on this bill  This bill is       endorsed by more than 115 business  public interest  and news       organizations from across the political and ideological       spectrum  including the American Library Association  the U S        Chamber of Commerce  OpenTheGovernment org  Public Citizen  the       Republican Liberty Caucus  the Sunshine in Government Initiative       and the Vermont Press Association  The invaluable support of       these and many other organizations is what led the opponents of       this bill to come around and support this legislation       By passing this       important FOIA reform legislation  the Senate has reaffirmed the       principle that open government is not a Democratic issue or a       Republican issue  But  rather  it is an American issue and an       American value  I strongly encourage the House of       Representatives  which overwhelmingly passed a similar measure       earlier this year  to promptly take up and enact this bill       before adjourning for the year       I request that a       copy of my statement be printed in the Record
