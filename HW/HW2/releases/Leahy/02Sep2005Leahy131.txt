       Leahy Welcomes White House Move To Tap Petroleum Reserve To Ease Fuel   Crisis                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   Leahy Welcomes White House Move      To Tap Petroleum Reserve To Ease Fuel Crisis       Urges Monitoring Of Profiteering And Price Gouging         Leahy        Before Katrina  Had Written President Asking For This Step   Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt   last week  before Hurricane Katrina landed          wrote to President Bush urging use of oil from the Strategic       Petroleum Reserve  SPR  for an oil swap to help break the back       of the upward spiral in gasoline and home heating fuel prices        Leahy pointed to the successful precedent of President Clintons       use of a 30 m  barrels oil swap  which drove oil prices down 14       cents overnight  The Bush Administration Friday finally agreed       to use 30 m  barrels of oil from the SPR to help relieve market       pressures  Another 30 million will be released from       international sources under authority of the International       Energy Agency  Leahy is the ranking member of the Senate       Judiciary Committee  which oversees the Justice Department and       its Antitrust Division    The Administration has finally       taken the constructive step of substantially increasing fuel       supplies by tapping the SPR  and I commend President Bush for       it  It is regrettable that it has taken them so long to act        Since we urged this step  the price has rocketed even higher        creating new record prices that are hurting consumers and       businesses and making it tougher now to break the back of the       price spiral  The coming days will tell if this step will be       sufficient  or if more may be needed   Meanwhile the concerns and       charges of price gouging are mounting  involving the fuel that       was already in stock by the time that Hurricane Katrina hit        making things even worse  Theres been a vacuum of leadership       from this Administration that has now created conditions that       are ripe for profiteering and price gouging  I am asking       federal regulators in the FTC and the Justice Department to       investigate charges of price gouging and profiteering and to       take action wherever they find it
