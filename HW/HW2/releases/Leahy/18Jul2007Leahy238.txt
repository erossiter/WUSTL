       Leahy Sends Attorney General Questions In Advance Of Judiciary Panel s   Oversight Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy Sends Attorney General      Questions In Advance      Of Judiciary Panels Oversight Hearing   Judiciary Chairman Seeks Answers      On U S  Attorney Firings       NSL Abuses  Domestic Surveillance Program       Internal DOJ Probes  Among Other Matters WASHINGTON       Wednesday  July 18   Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy       D Vt   has sent Attorney General Alberto Gonzales a list of      questions he expects the top Justice Department official to be      prepared to answer at the panels upcoming oversight hearing on July      24   In a letter to the      Attorney General a week before the Committees hearing  Leahy took      the unusual step of sending  the list of questions       to give the Attorney General time to prepare adequate responses  In      his letter  Leahy put the Attorney General on notice that the      Committee would expect answers on inconsistencies in the Attorney      Generals public statements and testimony involving the firing of      several U S  Attorneys as well as the Presidents warrantless      wiretapping program      Leahy also posed questions about recent revelations of      widespread abuse of the use of National Security Letters  NSLs  and      the Attorney Generals knowledge of that abuse as well as several      ongoing internal Justice Department investigations involving      high ranking officials  The Attorney      General is scheduled to appear before the Judiciary Committee on      Tuesday  July 24       at 9 30 a m    The text of the letter is below         July 17  2007  The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W        Washington  DC 20530  Dear Attorney General Gonzales   When you last testified before the      Senate Judiciary Committee on April 19  2007  you often responded to      questions from Senators on both sides of the aisle that you could      not recall  By some counts  you failed to answer more than 100      questions  by other counts more than 70  and the most conservative      count had you failing to provide answers well over 60 times  As a      result  the Committees efforts to conduct oversight were      hampered  Senator Specter and I wrote to you after that hearing to      ask you promptly to supplement your testimony on April 19 with      answers to those questions for which you responded that you could      not recall or did not know  In your cursory response  you did not      supplement any of your answers   I would like to avoid a repeat of that      performance  In order to assist you in your preparation  I send you      the following questions in advance of your July 24 appearance before      the Senate Judiciary Committee     On April 19  you testified to the       Senate Judiciary Committee that you had not spoken with anyone       involved in the firings about that process because you did not       want to interfere with the investigation  Again  on May 10  you       testified to the House Judiciary Committee that you had not       spoken with anyone involved in order to protect the integrity of       the investigation  Then on May 23  Monica Goodling testified       under oath before the House Judiciary Committee that she had an       uncomfortable conversation with you during which you outlined       your recollection of what happened and asked her for her       reaction to your version  Is Ms  Goodlings testimony accurate        and if so  how do you account for your previous  uncorrected       testimony to this Committee      On April 19 you testified before       this Committee       that your former Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson was responsible for       putting together the list of U S  Attorneys to be fired  But on       May 15  the day after Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty       announced his intention to resign  you said that the firings       were largely Mr  McNultys responsibility  Mr  McNulty has said       that he had very limited involvement in the decision of which       U S  Attorneys to fire  Please describe all of your       interactions with Mr  McNulty related to the replacement of the       nine U S  Attorneys and your understanding of his role in       deciding which U S  Attorneys would be fired  Why has your       description of who made the decisions  and who was most involved       in the decision making process  changed over time       While Bradley Schlozman was Acting       Attorney General for the Civil Rights Division at the Justice       Department  he approved pre clearance of a voter photo       identification provision from the state of Georgia that has       become the focus of extensive criticism about the management of       the Departments voting section  He authorized a National Voter       Registration Act suit against the State of Missouri  over the       reservations of Todd Graves  then U S  Attorney for the Western       District of Missouri  who argued that the case lacked merit        This case was later thrown out of court  Mr  Schlozman admitted       before this Committee that he had bragged about hiring       Republicans to the Civil Rights Division  and he reportedly       advised candidates with Republican political affiliations to       remove them from their resumes before applying to the division          Were you aware of these issues        when Mr  Schlozman was appointed interim United States        Attorney in the Western District of Missouri  How did they        affect your decision    After Mr  Schlozman was        appointed interim U S  Attorney in Missouri  he brought        indictments against people affiliated with ACORN  a group        that supported Democratic candidates and that registered        voters  on the eve of a closely contested midterm election        in Missouri  despite the contrary policy expressed in the        Justice Departments guidebook on Federal Prosecution of        Election Offenses  Were you aware of this pre election        indictment decision  What was your role in the decision             Recent documents obtained through       Freedom of Information Act lawsuits and reported in the       Washington Post indicate that you received reports in 2005 and       2006 of violations in connection with the PATRIOT Act and abuses       of National Security Letters  NSLs   These violations       apparently included unauthorized surveillance  illegal searches        and improper collection of data  These reports were significant       enough to prompt reports to the Intelligence Oversight Board        Yet  when you testified under oath before the Senate Select       Committee on Intelligence in April 2005  you sought to create       the impression that Americans civil liberties and privacy were       being effectively safeguarded and respected  saying  t he track record established over the       past 3 years has demonstrated the effectiveness of the       safeguards of civil liberties put in place when the Act was       passed  Earlier this month  in responses to written questions       I sent you on behalf of the Senate Judiciary Committee about       when you first learned of problems with NSLs  you  again  did       not mention these earlier reports of problems  Would you like to       revise or correct your misleading April 2005 testimony to the       Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  or your July 6  2007       response to this Committees written questions related to these       issues      According to news reports and       briefings provided by the FBI  the FBI has been conducting an       internal audit of its use of National Security Letters that has       confirmed the findings of the March 2007 Inspector General       report that there was widespread and serious misuse of the       FBIs national security letter authorities  Is it your view       that there has been widespread and serious misuse of the       National Security Letter authority      When you were asked on February 6        2006 if any senior Justice Department officials  including your       former deputy  James Comey  expressed concerns about the Bush       Administrations warrantless electronic surveillance program        you testified  I do not believe that these DOJ officials             had concerns about this program  Mr  Comey subsequently       testified on May 15  2007 that on March 9  2004  he informed       you  as White House counsel  and others including the Vice       President  that the Justice Department had concluded that the       Administrations warrantless electronic surveillance program did       not have a legal basis  He testified that you and former White       House Chief of Staff Andrew Card tried to circumvent him  in his       role as Acting Attorney General  by rushing to the hospital       bedside of ailing former Attorney General John Ashcroft to try       to persuade him to certify the program  Please provide a full       explanation for the legal authorization for the Presidents       warrantless electronic surveillance program in March and April       2004      Last year  the Iraq Study Group       found that the Iraqi police cannot control crime  and they       routinely engage in sectarian violence  including unnecessary       detention  torture  and targeted execution of Sunni Arabs       civilians         They also found evidence of serious police corruption  They       called for the Department of Justice to take the lead role in       training the Iraqi police force  In January of this year  you       reported to the Judiciary Committee that the Department was       overseeing hundreds of police trainers in Iraq and Jordan  Last       week  the President reported that the Iraqi police had failed        yet again  to meet the Administration s own benchmarks for       progress       On the same day as this report  U S  troops       engaged in a gun battle with Iraqi police on the streets of       Bagdad  where six Iraqi policemen and seven Shiite gunman were       killed defending an Iraqi police lieutenant  On July 13  USA       Today reported that a previously undisclosed investigation by       the army shows that Iraqi police were directly complicit in a       complex insurgent attack on a government compound in Karbala in       January that killed U S  soldiers  What have you  as Attorney       General  done to improve the Departments programs for training       Iraqi police over the last six months  what steps have you taken       to combat improper political and sectarian influences within the       Iraqi police  and what grade would you give yourself for this       effort      This Committee recently became       aware of a memorandum dated July 10  2007  and signed by Steven       G  Bradbury as Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney Generalfor       the Office of Legal Counsel  It contends that Harriet Miers        who is a former White House Counsel  is immune from compelled       congressional testimony  Pursuant to what legal authority did       Mr  Bradbury issue this memorandum  and how is Mr  Bradburys       issuance of this memorandum consistent with the Vacancies Act        At the end of the last Congress  Mr  Bradburys nomination to       serve as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal       Counsel was returned to the President      The Departments July 9  2007        report on its data mining activities raises many questions about       the impact of these programs on Americans privacy and civil       liberties  In the Judiciary Committees hearing earlier this       year on privacy and civil liberties implications of government       data mining programs  several witnesses concluded that data       mining programs are not effective tools for combating       terrorism  Has the Justice Department conducted audits or       studies demonstrating that its data mining programs  such as the       STAR program  are effective tools for identifying potential       terrorists      In 2003  Congress unanimously       passed the Hometown Heroes law to extend federal survivor       benefits to the families of firefighters  police officers  and       emergency workers who die of heart attack or stroke in the line       of duty  The legislation was intended to create a presumption       that the heart attack or stroke was caused by work in the line       of duty  unless there was clear evidence to the contrary        However  more than three and a half years after Hometown Heroes       became law  the Justice Department has approved only six claims       and denied 48 claims out of nearly 260 applications  Many       families have been waiting for a decision from the department on       their claims since the bill became law in December 2003  Why       has the Justice Department taken so long to decide Hometown       Heroes claims  Why is there only a three percent acceptance       rate for Hometown Heroes claims      Given the Administrations       resistance to congressional oversight  its misleading and       self serving statements  its having denied security clearances       to Office of Professional Responsibility investigators reviewing       actions taken in connection with the Presidents warrantless       electronic surveillance program  and the ineffectiveness of       other internal review mechanism  such as the Privacy and Civil       Liberties Oversight Board and the Intelligence Oversight Board        why should Congress or the American people have any confidence       in your recent announcement implementing a significant new       national security oversight and compliance effort       Other Inspectors General can       investigate misconduct throughout their agencies  Apparently        the Department of Justice Inspector General suffers under a       limitation that restricts his ability to investigation       misconduct by you  the Deputy Attorney General  and other senior       Department lawyers  Will you agree to the removal of this       limitation on the Department of Justice Inspector General so       that the Inspector General may investigate misconduct by you        other senior Department of Justice officials  lawyers  and law       enforcement agents     I remind you that any testimony you      wish to submit is due at least 48 hours before the hearing  I look      forward to your testifying on July 24    Sincerely   PATRICK LEAHY     Chairman
