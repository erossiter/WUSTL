       Statement Of Sen  leahy On The Legal Rights Of Guantanamo Detainees                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On The Legal Rights Of Guantanamo Detainees  December 11  2007        Today we consider our treatment of detainees at Guantanamo Bay and      how best to secure our nation while holding on to those rights and      values that make us American  I thank Senator Feinstein for holding      this important hearing              As todays testimony potently reminds us  the attack on America on      September 11  2001 was a devastating and tragic blow  and we must      take all possible steps to prevent such a tragedy from happening      again  But as so much of our history has shown  and as the events      of the last six years have again made clear  disregarding the rule      of law does not make us safer  it undermines our safety and our      place in the world             Over the last few years  Guantanamo has become for much of the world      a symbol of injustice and boundless exercise of power  As General      Colin Powell said  Essentially  we have shaken the belief that the      world had in America s justice system by keeping a place like      Guantanamo open         The Washington Post detailed last week the story of a man      whom United States and European intelligence services concluded was      innocent  but who is nonetheless still languishing years later in a      cell at Guantanamo  The flawed review process there found him to be      dangerous  contrary to the clear findings of the intelligence      community  These stories are too common  The administration likes      to call the detainees at Guantanamo the worst of the worst  but      military and government officials have told The New York Times      and others that many of the detainees appear to be people who were      in the wrong place at the wrong time  and do not pose a threat             Senator Specter and I have fought hard  and will continue fighting       to restore the great writ of habeas corpus  the legal doctrine that      allows someone detained by the government to at least go to a court      to say he or she is being held in error  The last Republican      Congress and this administration took away that right for any      non citizen held under mere suspicion of being an enemy combatant       or merely awaiting determination as to whether that status      applied  This is a change in the law that puts every one of the      millions of legal  permanent residents in this country at risk  and      Guantanamo is the ultimate illustration of the fate they risk      sharing  How many more people could end up sitting in cells  unable      even to challenge the basis for their detention  forever             This government has stumbled forward in its handling of the      Guantanamo detainees  apparently without rhyme or reason  Some      detainees may have been released without a sufficient assurance that      they are not dangerous  Others repeatedly found not to be dangerous      remain at Guantanamo with no end in sight  The cursory process      meant to review whether the detainees are being held properly has      been revealed again and again to be hopelessly flawed  We must      start over with a fair system based in our law  the kind of system      I proposed setting up soon after September 11 and the kind that      Senators Specter and Durbin likewise proposed              Nothing has done more  though  to damage Americas image and our      place in the world as a beacon of human rights than the revelations      that we have used cruel interrogation techniques and perhaps even      torture  We have just learned that the Central Intelligence Agency      destroyed videotapes of harsh interrogations  including the use of      waterboarding  One of the CIA employees who participated in      interrogating one of the detainees apparently appeared in the      videotapes  said that waterboarding was used  that it is torture       and that Americans are better than that  I agree       Senator Specter and I sent a letter yesterday to Attorney General      Mukasey asking a series of questions about the Justice Departments      knowledge of and involvement in the CIAs possession and subsequent destruction of these videotapes  We requested a complete      account of the Justice Departments own knowledge of and involvement      with these matters        America has always been a country that does not torture and one that      stands against torture  This administration has abandoned our      historic commitment to human rights by repeatedly stretching the law      and the bounds of executive power to authorize torture and cruel      treatment  All the while  it has tried to keep its policies and      actions secret  knowing that they could not withstand scrutiny in      the light of day  That is the real message coming out of the recent      revelation of the CIA tapes being destroyed  that their practices      could not stand up to scrutiny  That matter is not one in which to      scapegoat lower level officers but one that raised fundamental      questions about what this administration has allowed despite our      laws and treaties against torture and cruel and degrading      treatment  Until this administration finally comes clean with      Congress and the American people about its policy on torture and      cruel interrogation techniques  we cannot restore Americas standing      as the world leader in protecting and preserving human rights  and      only by doing so can we truly safeguard our national security             Closing the facility at Guantanamo Bay and restoring justice to the      way we treat detainees and the legal process we give them would be a      good start toward reaffirming the values for which America has      always stood
