       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Patent Reform  The Future   Of American Innovation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing On Patent Reform  The Future Of American Innovation   June 6  2007   On April 18th  we took a momentous step toward ensuring Americas    continued leadership in innovation and production  on a bipartisan and    bicameral basis  we introduced the Patent Reform Act of 2007  We left    partisanship at the door and simply focused on the promotion of American    innovation and ingenuity  I thank Senator Hatch  with whom I have worked on    patent issues for many years  Indeed  our work together spans more than a    decade  our last major patent bill was the American Inventors Act  which we    began in 1997 and passed in 1999  I thank the other cosponsors of this bill    as well  including Senators Cornyn  Schumer  and Whitehouse  who also serve    on this Committee   The issues we are discussing here rated a front page story in the Wall    Street Journal today  which noted that the Supreme Court has underscored    the patent systems disrepair in a series of rulings rejecting the way lower    courts have been interpreting existing law  The justices have declared   in    effect  that the patent system  as it has developed through the courts  has    deviated from the balance Congress set a half century ago between promoting    innovation and spreading the fruits of progress  In this  the Court is    exactly right   Over the years  our patent laws have served our inventors and our economy    well  but they were crafted for a different time when smokestacks  rather    than microchips  were the emblems of industry  It is far past time to update    our laws for the 21st Century and the future of American innovation  We have    spent several years working on just such legislation  Last year  Senator    Hatch and I introduced S  3818  which I said at the time was the first step    down a road to real  constructive patent reform  Since that bill was    introduced  we have spoken with all manner of interested parties and    incorporated many of their suggestions into this years bill  S  1145   the    Patent Reform Act of 2007   We are working to refine  and to finish  this bill  We continue our    collective effort to select just the right words to convey our agreed upon    meanings  Today  we focus on our overall effort but also on specific aspects    of the bill on which we have asked a distinguished group of witnesses to    share with us their views on the structure of post grant review  venue  and    interlocutory appeal of so called Markman hearings   We have already come a long way in each of these areas  and we have made    important modifications from last year to address concerns that were raised     I am hoping that we will make further progress  so that we are all    well prepared for our final drafting efforts  and then for marking up the    bill in the Judiciary Committee  As we move ever closer toward the finish    line to enact legislation that will create the landscape necessary that    American innovators need to flourish  we are focusing our debate on the    specifics  These matters may seem dry but they are important to getting our    work done and done right in order to enact meaningful reform   I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses today  and appreciate    the expertise they bring to bear on these important issues
