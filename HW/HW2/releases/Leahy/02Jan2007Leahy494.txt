       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Department Of Justice s Response to   Request For Documents Relating To Bush Administration s Interrogation Policies                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Comments      Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Department Of Justices Response To Request      For Documents Relating To Bush Administrations Interrogation      Policies      January 2  2007        It is disappointing that the      Department of Justice and the White House have squandered another      opportunity to work cooperatively with Congress  The Departments      decision to brush off my request for information about the      Administrations troubling interrogation policies is not the      constructive step toward bipartisanship that I had hoped for  given      President Bushs promise to work with us    I requested two documents concerning      CIA interrogation methods  which the Administration recently      acknowledged in a lawsuit  and other relevant information  The      Administrations refusal to provide any of this information other      than forwarding a couple of public documents suggests that the      Presidents offer to work with us may have been only political lip      service  I have advised the Attorney General that I plan to pursue      this matter further at the Committees first oversight hearing of      the Department of Justice    I hope the Department and the White      House will reconsider their response and work with the Judiciary      Committee to promptly share this information  with any appropriate      confidentiality safeguards  The Committee will continue its efforts      to obtain the information that it needs for meaningful oversight and      accountability on this and other issues of importance to the      American people                    A pdf version of      the Department of Justices response to Senator Leahy is       Below is the text of Senator Leahys November 16th      letter requesting the documents     November 16  2006   The Honorable Alberto      Gonzales     Attorney General     United States Department of Justice     950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW     Washington  D C  20530   Dear Attorney General      Gonzales     Recent press accounts      indicate that  after years of denials  the Central Intelligence      Agency has acknowledged the existence of additional documents      detailing the Bush Administrations interrogation and detention      policy for terrorism suspects  According to press reports  the CIA      recently disclosed the existence of two interrogation related      documents  a presidential directive regarding the CIAs      interrogation methods and detention facilities located outside of      the United States  and an August 2002 Department of Justice      Memorandum to the CIA General Counsel regarding CIA interrogation      methods  the 2nd Bybee memo   in connection with an      ongoing FOIA lawsuit brought by the American Civil Liberties Union         As you know  for more      than two years  I have repeatedly sought answers from the Department      of Justice  the FBI  the CIA  and the Department of Defense      regarding reported and  in some instances  documented cases of the      abuse of detainees in U S  custody  The photographs and reports of      prisoner abuse in Iraq  Guantanamo Bay and elsewhere that have      emerged during the past two years depict an interrogation and      detention system operating contrary to U S  law and the Geneva      Conventions     Prisoner abuse is one      aspect of a broader problem  which includes the use of so called      extraordinary renditions to send people to other countries where      they will be subject to torture  We diminish our own values as a      Nation  and lose credibility as an advocate of human rights around      the world  by engaging in  or outsourcing  torture    The American people      deserve to have detailed and accurate information about the role of      the Bush Administration in developing the interrogation policies and      practices that have engendered such deep criticism and concern at      home and around the world  I ask that you promptly respond to the      following questions and document requests    1  Please      produce any and all directives  memoranda  and or orders  including      any and all attachments to such documents  regarding CIA      interrogation methods or policies for the treatment of detainees       including but not limited to the directive signed by President Bush      governing CIA interrogation methods  or allowing the CIA to set up      detention centers located outside of the United States    2  Please      produce any and all Department of Justice directives  memoranda       and or guidance  including any and all attachments to such      documents  regarding CIA detention and or interrogation methods       including but not limited to the August 2002 Memorandum from the      Department of Justices Office of Legal Counsel to the CIA General      Counsel regarding CIA interrogation methods  the 2nd      Bybee memo      3  Please      produce any and all documents in the custody of the Department of      Justice regarding the legality of specific interrogation tactics      and or federal criminal prohibitions on torture and abuse that were      used in the preparation of the 2nd Bybee memo referenced      above    4  Please state      whether the 2nd Bybee memo was withdrawn  replaced  or      modified after the Administration withdrew the Office of Legal      Counsels memorandum regarding U S  obligations under anti torture      law  dated August 2002  the 1st Bybee Memo  in December      2004  If so  please produce any and all revisions  or modifications      of the 2nd Bybee memo    5  Please      produce any and all Department of Justice documents that interpret       or advise on  the scope of interrogation practices permitted and      prohibited by the Detainee Treatment Act or the Military Commissions      Act     6  Please      produce an index of any and all documents relating to investigations      and or reviews conducted by the Department of Justice into detainee      abuse by U S  military or civilian personnel in Guantanamo Bay  Abu      Ghraib prison  or elsewhere    I look forward to      comprehensive responses to the above questions and document      requests    Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY     United States
