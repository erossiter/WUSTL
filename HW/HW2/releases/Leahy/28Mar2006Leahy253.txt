       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  State Foreign Operations Subcommittee  Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          Statement Of Senator     Patrick Leahy    State  Foreign Operations Subcommittee    Secretary Of State Condoleezza Rice    March 28  2006       Madam Secretary  thank you for being here       This is be the first and last time we hear from you on your Fiscal     Year 2007 budget request  until after we receive our 302b allocation     and our bill is on the floor of the Senate  At that point the game     is pretty much over since we usually lose ground in conference with     House  when programs that are important to you and to us are cut     further      Hearings like this are useful  but they are far from sufficient      You need to mount a far more effective effort than you have in the     past to get the funding you need  because the party in the Majority     in Congress  with the exception of a few allies like Chairman     McConnell  will want to cut your budget      While I believe your transformational diplomacy initiative has much     to recommend it    and I commend you for it    I am afraid that the     amount of funds you are requesting falls far short of what you would     need to implement it effectively   It     is one thing if all you hope to do is deploy your staff more     strategically and plan and coordinate foreign aid programs     effectively  But to me  transformational suggests something     significantly more far reaching       This budget  contrary to the Presidents promise  cuts many of     USAIDs core programs to promote democracy and fight poverty  It is     true that in the aggregate what you propose represents an increase      but that is only because of funding for AIDS and the Millennium     Challenge Corporation       While we are providing hundreds of millions of dollars from the MCC     to tiny countries with little if any foreign policy or security     importance to the United States  you would cut funds for programs     that have bipartisan support  proven results  and that fund     everything from girls education to providing clean water and     improving agriculture       Chairman McConnell and I are among your strongest supporters here      but with the cuts the President is proposing to so many domestic     programs this is going to be a very difficult year for this     subcommittee   You     may have big plans  you may have great policies  But if you dont     have the funds to implement them they wont amount to much  They     certainly wont be transformational  Unless you can convince the     Chairmen and Ranking Members of the House and Senate Appropriations     Committees  much of what you hope to do will not be possible    I     want to mention a few issues of special concern to me  and I will     have questions on other topics as well         First  is the image and reputation of the United States  which has     obvious importance to our security  After 9 11 there was an     outpouring of sympathy from every corner of the globe  Today  we     are seen by alarming numbers of people as an aggressive  occupying     bully that locks up innocent people indefinitely  humiliates and     physically abuses them  and denies them the right to even know what     they are accused of  We     get regular reports of Iraqi civilians  including women and young     children  who have been mistakenly killed by U S  soldiers  We have     spent billions on grossly over priced reconstruction projects that     were poorly designed and may never get finished  but which made U S      contractors rich  This is not making us safer          Second  is UN peacekeeping  The UN is operating 18 different     peacekeeping missions  One of them  in the Democratic Republic of     the Congo  is trying to provide security for the first democratic     elections in half a century  while it copes with armed militias and     every possible logistical challenge in a destitute country the size     of Western Europe with virtually no infrastructure  This is just     one example  Darfur may be next  and it will involve similar     challenges and costs   Yet     while the Administration votes to send UN peacekeepers to some of     the worlds most dangerous places  we under fund these missions     which together cost in a year less than our military spends in a     week in Iraq  It is time for us and the other nations who dont     contribute any troops  to support these missions the way we would     expect our own soldiers to be supported  Yet  again  your budget     does not do that  and it is going to cause serious problems           Third  is Latin America  It has been sorely neglected by this     Administration  despite protestations by State Department and White     House officials to the contrary  Senator DeWine has noted it      Senator Coleman has noted it  There is no end to the interests we     share with our southern neighbors    immigration being just one        and yet your programs and policies are a mere shadow of what they     should be  It is a missed opportunity and this budget continues     business as usual      Madam Secretary  I voted for you because I felt you have the     qualities to do a good job  I know you are trying and I think you     have outstanding people here and in our missions around the world      But I have to say I think the foreign policies of this     Administration have too often been misguided and harmful to our     national interests   I     am sure you disagree  but I do not believe this country is safer     because of these policies  and I do not believe the budget you are     here to support is nearly adequate to protect our interests in     todays increasingly divisive and dangerous world
