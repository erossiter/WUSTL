       Leading Members Of Senate Judiciary Panel Introduce Bipartisan Bill To   Stop Payoffs That Delay Generic Medicines                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Leading Members Of Senate      Judiciary Panel Introduce Bipartisan Bill     To Stop Payoffs That Delay Generic Medicines  Leading members of the Senate      Judiciary Committee on Wednesday took aim at the growing problem of      brand name drug manufacturers using pay off agreements to delay      access to generic medicines by introducing a bill to prohibit the      practice    Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt    the      chairman of the Committee  introduced a bipartisan bill along with     Senators Herb Kohl       D Wisc    Chuck Grassley  R Iowa   Russ Feingold  D Wisc    and      Charles Schumer  D NY   to prohibit pay off settlements aimed at      keeping cheaper  generic medicines off the market  The Committee      also held a hearing Paying Off Generics to Prevent      Competition with Brand Name Drugs  Should It Be Prohibited       on Wednesday to examine the issue and discuss the proposed      legislation     Below is a release on      the      Preserve Access to Affordable Generics Act       followed by Senator Leahys statement from the Committees hearing                        Kohl  Leahy  Grassley  Schumer  Feingold      Introduce Bill     To Stop Payoffs That Delay Generic Drugs   Washington  D C        Today  top Senate Judiciary Committee members Herb Kohl  D WI        Patrick Leahy  D VT   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Charles Schumer  D NY       and Russ Feingold  D WI  will introduce the Preserve      Access to Affordable Generics Act  in the 110th Congress to      explicitly prohibit brand name drug manufacturers from using pay off      agreements to keep cheaper generic equivalents off the market         Leahy  chairman of the      Judiciary Committee  held a hearing today to examine the issue       Federal Trade Commissioner Jon Leibowitz and former Congressman     Billy Tauzin  now CEO of Pharmaceutical Research and      Manufacturers of America  PhRMA   were on hand to discuss the impact      these agreements have on the pharmaceutical market    When big brand name      drug companies pay generic manufacturers      to stop generic drugs from reaching pharmacy shelves  consumers lose      big time  Kohl said  We cant say we care about the      high cost of prescription drugs while turning a blind eye to      backroom deals between brand and generic drug companies  This      practice has got to stop        Leahy said  Some drug firms have      colluded to pad their profits by forcing consumers to pay higher      prices than they would pay for lower cost generics  Now that this      sweetheart dealing has been uncovered  we owe it to consumers to end      it  Our bill is a clear cut opportunity to remove an impediment to      competition that prevents the marketplace from working as it should         to benefit consumers  and not just the drug companies    In 2005  two appellate      court decisions overturned Federal Trade Commissions  FTC       long standing position against this practice and upheld settlements      that include such pay offs  Last years Supreme Court dismissal of      the FTCs latest appeal prompted lawmakers to introduce this      important bill    Recently  the dramatic increase in      wheeling and dealing between brand name and generic pharmaceutical      manufacturers have only ended up delaying the entry of less costly      medicines in the marketplace  leaving the bill to the consumer       These deals also threaten the sustainability of federal health care      programs  such as Medicare and Medicaid  It s important that the      Federal Trade Commission have as many tools as possible in its      arsenal to protect the American public from these types of      anti competitive agreements  Grassley said   When consumers have access to      lower cost drugs  we all win  Schumer said  But as long as we let      stand the appellate court decisions that encourage brand and generic      companies to split up the pie between them and not give the consumer      a fork  we are accepting higher drug prices for the average      American   The current high prescription drug      prices take a particularly heavy toll on sick and low income      individuals who desperately need life saving medicines  It is time      for Congress to ensure that a truly competitive marketplace for      prescription drugs is in place    one that will help bring down the      skyrocketing prices in this country  Feingold said    A FTC report found that      in the six months following the 2005 court decisions  there were      three settlement agreements in which the generic company received      compensation and agreed to a restriction on its ability to market      the product  Additionally  the FTC found that at least seven      settlement agreements made in 2006 included a pay off from the brand      manufacturer in exchange for a promise by the generic company to      delay entry into the market    According to a study      released last year by Pharmaceutical Care Management Association  PCMA        health plans and consumers could save  26 4 billion over the next      five years by using the generic versions of 14 popular drugs that      are scheduled to lose their patent protections before 2010     Kohl and Leahy have also introduced S       25  Citizen Petition Fairness and Accuracy Act of 2007  legislation      that prohibits brand name drug companies from abusing the Food and      Drug Administrations  FDA  citizen petition review process    In 2003  Senators      Grassley and Leahy were able to include their Drug Competition Act      in the Medicare Modernization Act  The Drug Act required companies      such as Schering Plough to report all proposed deals with potential      generic competitors  which were often previously worked out in      secret  to the federal antitrust law enforcers  the FTC and the      Justice Department    Sen  Schumer is also the      author of the Greater Access to Affordable Pharmaceuticals Act with      Senator John McCain  R AZ   The Schumer McCain law  which was      enacted in 2003  shut down loopholes that drug companies created in      Hatch Waxman law  enabling generic drugs to be brought to market      sooner  and lowering the cost of prescriptions for millions of      Americans                    Leahy Statement      from Hearing     Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Paying Off Generics To Prevent Competition With      Brand Name Drugs      Should It Be Prohibited      January 17  2007  This hearing today is a continuation      of a longstanding  bipartisan effort by several members of this      Committee to provide consumers more choices and lower cost      medicines  My focus in this hearing is on making lower cost generic      medicines available to our seniors and families  based on provisions      of existing law which I think are being misused by some brand name      and generic drug companies  The fact that we have scheduled this      hearing so early in this new Congress is a sign that solving this      problem will be the high priority for this Committee that it      deserves to be  and that consumers want it to be    We will be examining the harmful      effects of a type of collusion that limits consumer choices and that      keeps consumer prices artificially high  Rarely do we have such a      clear cut opportunity as this to remove impediments that prevent      competition and the marketplace from working as they should  to      benefit consumers   The basics of this issue are very      simple  Congress never intended for brand name drug companies to be      able to pay off generic companies NOT to produce generic      medicines  That would be a shame  harmful to consumers  and a      crime   In fact  the history and text of the      Hatch Waxman laws make it clear that the OPPOSITE of delay was the      goal     It is no secret that      prescription drug prices are rising and are a source of considerable      concern to many Americans  especially senior citizens and working      families  In a marketplace free of manipulation  generic drug      prices can be as much as 80 percent lower than the comparable brand      name version     In June of last year I      sponsored a bill  introduced by Senator Kohl  and also sponsored by      Senators Grassley  Schumer  Feingold and Johnson  which would have      stopped these payoffs to delay access to generic medicines  Working      with Senators Kohl and Grassley and with many others  we will try to      enact a new version of that      bill      It is unfortunate that      we even have to do this  However  as I said in June  there are      still some companies driven by greed that may be keeping low cost       life saving generic drugs off the marketplace  off pharmacy shelves       and out of the hands of consumers  by carefully crafted      anti competitive agreements    Since some of these      deals used to be done in secret  I am glad that because of a bill      that was reported out of this Committee  Congress is now aware of      this problem  In 2001  I worked with Chairman Hatch and later with      Senator Grassley to make sure that our law enforcement agencies       the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice  at      least were made aware of these secret  and potentially criminal       deals    The New York Times     and others published major investigative stories      on how the manufacturer of a hypertension drug to help prevent      strokes and heart attacks    Cardizem CD    had made deals to pay a      potential generic competitor  10 million every three months to stop      it from developing a generic version of Cardizem  This led to my      introduction of S  754  the Drug Competition Act    which was      reported out of this Committee and was finally passed as part of the      Medicare Modernization Act Amendments with significant assistance      from Senator Grassley    The concept of that law is simple  It      requires that if a brand name company and a generic firm enter into      an agreement that is related to the sale of either the brand named      drug or its generic version  then both companies must file copies of      any agreements with the FTC and the DOJ so those agencies can      enforce the law  Incidentally  once the Cardizem deal was exposed      and challenged  the U S  Circuit Court held that the the horizontal      market allocation agreement        was   per se illegal under the      Sherman Act    Today  Commissioner Leibowitz will      testify about what the FTC has found regarding these deals between      brand name companies and generic competitors  as revealed through      the provisions of the Drug Competition Act  and the harm done to the      public    I will once again strongly support an      effort by Senators Kohl and Grassley to allow the FTC to do its      job  Two subsequent Circuit Court decisions have undermined the      Cardizem approach and relied on the general rule favoring      settlements between private litigants  The problem    with respect      to deals not to compete    is that the interests of millions of      senior citizens  millions of children  and millions of others  are      not taken into account  Those cases ignore the decision in  Associated General in      which the U  S  Supreme Court noted that the Sherman Act was      enacted to assure our customers the benefits of price competition              Note the focus is on consumers  not on whether private      companies should be able to make back room deals that harm consumers      as part of a settlement of a lawsuit    Our bipartisan bill will solve that      problem by making payments by brand name companies  to delay      introduction of a generic drug  unlawful  My initial position is to      follow this bright line approach to avoid endless litigation and set      forth a clear standard  I will be interested in hearing from others      on possible solutions  so long as the interest of the public in      accessing these life saving medicines is paramount  That has been       and will continue to be  my top priority
