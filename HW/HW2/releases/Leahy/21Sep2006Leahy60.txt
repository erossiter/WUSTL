       Judiciary Panel Approves Cornyn Leahy OPEN Government Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Judiciary Panel Approves     Cornyn Leahy OPEN Government Bill  Bipartisan Legislation     Improves  Strengthens FOIA  WASHINGTON  Thursday  Sept  21   The     Senate Judiciary Committee Thursday unanimously approved a bill aimed at     substantially enhancing and expanding the accessibility  accountability      and openness of the federal government    The Openness Promotes Effectiveness in     our National Government Act of 2005  or the OPEN Government Act  S      394   was authored by Senators Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking     Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  and John Cornyn      R Texas   a member of the panel  The bill  introduced in 2005  would     make meaningful reforms to federal government information laws  most     notably the Freedom of Information Act of 1966  FOIA     This bill advances one of the most     fundamental rights of Americans  the publics right to know what its     government is doing  said Leahy  who has been a longtime champion of     FOIA in Congress  Leahy sponsored the Electronic Freedom of Information     Act Amendments  which updated FOIA for the Internet age  and in 1996 he     was installed in the Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame     Leahy said the bill is more than just     pro openness  pro accountability  and pro accessibility    it s also     pro Internet  It includes a hotline enabling citizens to track their     requests  including Internet tracking  and extends the waiver of FOIA     search fees for the media to bloggers and writers for Internet outlets      providing the same status as traditional media    Senators Leahy and Cornyn have also teamed     up on the Faster FOIA Act   S 589   The bill would create an advisory     commission to recommend steps to reduce processing delays in response to     the Freedom of Information Act  That bill was favorably reported out of     the Judiciary Committee last year   The last time Congress approved major     reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade ago  and the Senate Judiciary     Committee has not convened an oversight hearing on compliance issues     since April 30  1992  The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental     Affairs Committee  which shares jurisdiction over federal government     information  has not held a FOIA oversight hearing since 1980    Below is Senator Leahys statement from     the Committees meeting  earlier today  as well as a summary of what the     bill does    Statement of Senator Patrick     Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee  On OPEN Government Act of 2005    September 21  2006 Mr  Chairman  I am     pleased that today the Committee is taking up the OPEN Government Act      I want to commend Senator Cornyn for his leadership on strengthening our     open government laws  I have devoted a     considerable portion of my work in the Senate to improving government     openness  to make our government work better for the American people      At times  this has been a lonely battle and I am delighted to have     Senator Cornyn as a partner on this issue  This bill is a     collection of commonsense modifications designed to update FOIA and to     improve the timely processing of FOIA requests by Federal agencies  The     bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records that are held by     outside private contractors  no matter where these records are located  This bill was drafted     after a long and thoughtful process of consultation with individuals and     organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain information and share it with     the public  including the news media  librarians  and public interest     organizations representing all facets of the political spectrum  I     believe that it reaffirms the fundamental premise of FOIA  government     information belongs to all Americans   As we celebrate the     40th anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act this year  I hope     that this Committee will do its part to reinvigorate this important law     and favorably report the OPEN Government Act by unanimous consent   Again  I thank Senator     Cornyn for the time and effort he has devoted to protecting the publics     right to know  and I urge all members of the Committee join us in     supporting this important legislation                 The OPEN Government Act contains more than     a dozen substantive provisions  designed to achieve the following FOUR     objectives    1  Strengthen FOIA and close loopholes     2  Help FOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their requests     3  Ensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on FOIA requests     in a timely manner     4  Provide FOIA officials with all of the tools they need to ensure     that our government remains open and accessible  STRENGTHEN FOIA AND CLOSE LOOPHOLES         Ensure that FOIA applies

expressly stated within text of     bill        Impose annual reporting     requirement on usage of the DHS disclosure exemption for critical     infrastructure information       Protect access to FOIA fee     waivers for legitimate journalists  regardless of institutional     association  including bloggers and other Internet based journalists       Provide reliable reporting     of FOIA performance  by requiring agencies to distinguish between first     person requests for personal information and other kinds of requests  HELP FOIA REQUESTORS OBTAIN TIMELY     RESPONSES         Establish FOIA hotline services  either by telephone or on the Internet      to enable requestors to track the status of their requests       Create a new FOIA     ombudsman  located at the Administrative Conference of the United     States  to review agency FOIA compliance and provide alternatives to     litigation       Authorize reasonable     recovery of attorney fees when litigation is inevitable  ENSURE THAT AGENCIES HAVE STRONG     INCENTIVES TO ACT ON FOIA REQUESTS IN TIMELY FASHION         Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action by ensuring that the     20 day statutory clock runs immediately upon the receipt of the request       Impose real consequences     on federal agencies for missing statutory deadlines       Enhance authority of the     Office of Special Counsel to take disciplinary action against government     officials who arbitrarily and capriciously deny disclosure       Strengthen reporting     requirements on FOIA compliance to identify agencies plagued by     excessive delay  and to identify excessive delays in fee status     determinations  PROVIDE FOIA OFFICIALS WITH THE TOOLS THEY     NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT REMAINS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE         Improve personnel policies for FOIA officials to enhance agency FOIA     performance       Examine the need for FOIA     awareness training for federal employees
