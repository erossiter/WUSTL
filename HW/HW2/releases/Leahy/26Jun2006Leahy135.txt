       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The Supreme Court s Decision In   Vermont Campaign Finance Cases                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     To The Supreme Courts Decision In Vermont Campaign Finance Cases     June 26  2006 As a Vermonter I am disappointed by the Supreme      Courts decision striking down Vermonts landmark campaign finance      law  This law has been reviewed and upheld by the federal courts      and I had hoped it would have survived the Supreme Courts scrutiny      as well   I hope that this decision does not upset the      careful balance struck by the Supreme Court in the 1976 case of      Buckley v  Valeo between the need to protect the right to free      speech as guaranteed by the First Amendment and the need to protect      the integrity of our system of representative democracy  In      Buckley  the Court ruled that limits on contributions were      justified as a protection of the political system  We should      continue to work toward ways to protect both freedom of speech and      the ability of all Vermonters and all Americans to participate in      the political process  Carefully written campaign finance reforms can      strengthen our democracy by protecting the ability of ordinary      Americans  not just well heeled special interests    to fully      participate in public debate  while also helping to restore the      public s faith in our system of government
