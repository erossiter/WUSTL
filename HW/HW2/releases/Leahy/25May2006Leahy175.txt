       Closing Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Passage Of S  2611    Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                   The Senate on Thursday evening passed a comprehensive       immigration reform bill by a vote of 62 36  Senator Patrick       Leahy  D Vt   the Ranking Member of the Senate Judiciary       Committee  supported the bill  Below is Leahys Statement     Closing Statement Of       Sen  Patrick Leahy      On Passage Of S 2611  Comprehensive Immigration Reform      Senate Floor  May 25  2006   When the Senate       resumed its consideration of comprehensive immigration reform       last week I began by expressing my hope that we would finish the       job the Judiciary Committee started in March and the Senate       began in April  We need to fix the broken immigration system       with tough reforms that secure our borders and with reforms that       will bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the       shadows  I have said all along that Democratic Senators cannot       pass a fair and comprehensive bill alone  Over the last two       weeks we finally got some help  I would like to especially thank       Senators Kennedy and McCain  as well as Chairman Specter and the       Democratic Leader        for their tireless work on this bill     We got some words of       encouragement from President Bush last week when he began       speaking out more forcefully and in more specific terms about       all of the components needed for comprehensive legislation  For       the first time  he expressly endorsed a pathway to earned       citizenship for the millions of undocumented workers now here        I thank him for joining in this effort  But his work is far       from done  We will need his influence with the recalcitrant       members of his party here in the House if we are ultimately to       be successful in our legislative effort  Without effective       intervention of the President  this effort is unlikely to be       successful and the prospects for securing our borders and       dealing with the hopes of millions who now live in the shadows       of our society will be destroyed  Those who have peacefully       demonstrated their dedication to justice and comprehensive       immigration reform should not be relegated back into the       shadows     Yesterday we were       able to begin to draw to a close       the Republican filibuster against comprehensive immigration       reform  When Republicans filibustered two cloture votes last       month  including one on a motion by the Republican Leader  I was       disappointed  I had hoped we would recognize the lawful        heartfelt protests of millions against the harsh House passed       criminalization measures  While they waved American flags  some       of those fueling anti immigrant feelings burned flags of other       countries  I am encouraged that through the course of this       debate we have been able to convince enough Senate Republicans       to join us in our efforts and to appreciate the contributions of       immigrants to our economy and our nation      This bill is not all that it       should be in my view  By incorporating the Hagel Martinez       formulation we have compromised from the initial compromise  I       have made no secret that I preferred the better outline of the       Judiciary Committee bill  The bill the Senate is now       considering is a further compromise  Debate and amendments have       added some improvements as well as some significant steps in the       wrong direction  I thank Senators Bingaman  Kerry  Obama        Salazar and others for their important and constructive       amendments  I was delighted that after some initial opposition        working with Senator Stevens and others we were able to add       flexibility to the Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative by       extending its deadline another year and one half through our       amendment    The Senate unwisely rejected       efforts by some of us to make it more flexible for those       persecuted around the world  This country has had a history of       being welcoming to refugees and those seeking asylum from       persecution  The Senate turned its back on that history by       refusing to allow the Secretary of State the flexibility needed       after restrictive language was added to our laws by the REAL ID       Act  I remain hopeful that Senators will reconsider these       issues with more open minds and hearts and a fully understanding       of the lives being affected  Sadly  too many were spooked by       false arguments   Besides the Senates failure to       readjust asylum provisions to take into account the realities of       oppressive forces in many parts of the world  I was most       disappointed that the Senate appeared to be so anti Hispanic in       its adoption of the Inhofe English language amendment  Senator       Salazar and I wrote to the President following up on this       provision and the comments of the Attorney General last week and       weekend  We asked whether the President will continue to       implement the language outreach policies of President Clinton s       Executive Order 13166  A prompt and straightforward affirmative       answer can go a long way toward rendering the Inhofe English       amendment a symbolic stain rather than a serious impediment to       immigrants and Americans for whom English at this moment in       their lives is a second language    I deeply regret that the Senate       took such a divisive act  Over my strong objection and that of       the Democratic Leader  Senator Salazar and others  a modified       version of the Inhofe amendment was adopted  I understand why       this amendment provoked a reaction from the Latino community as       exemplified by the May 19 letter from the League of United Latin       American Citizens  the Mexican American Legal Defense and       Educational Fund  the National Association of Latino Elected       Officials Educational Fund  the National Council of La Raza and       the National Puerto Rican Coalition and from a larger coalition       of interested parties from 96 national and local organizations         Until this week  in our previous       230 years we have not found it necessary or wise to adopt       English as our official or national language  I believe it was       in the Commonwealth       of Pennsylvania that the state legislature shortly       after the Revolutionary War authorized official publication of       Pennsylvanias laws in German as well as English to serve the       German speaking population of that state  We have       been a confident nation unafraid to hear expressions in a       variety of languages and willing to reach out to all within our       borders  That tradition is reflected in President Clintons       Executive Order 13166    We demean our history and our       welcoming tradition when we disparage Spanish and those who come       to us speaking Spanish  I have spoken about our including Latin       phrases on our official seal and the many States that include       mottos and phrases in Latin  French and Spanish on their State       flags  We need not fear other languages  We would do better to       do more to encourage and assist those who wish to be citizens to       learn English  but we should recognize English  as Senator       Salazars amendment suggested  as our common and unifying       language    Yesterday  once we had overcome       the previous Republican filibuster we were faced with a budget       point of order supported by some Senators who oppose the bill       and who added significantly to the costs of the bill through       their amendments  Rather than continue their efforts to delay       or derail Senate action on comprehensive immigration reform  I       had hoped that they would join with us in a constructive way to       enact comprehensive immigration reform  We do not need more       divisiveness  derision and obstruction    This bill is not the bill I would       have designed  It includes many features I do not support and       fails to include many that I do   The bill that won the bipartisan       support of a majority of the Judiciary Committee was a       compromise that contained the essential components that are       required for comprehensive immigration reform  Before the last       recess I was willing to support a further compromise that       incorporated the principles of the Hagel Martinez bill because       it was proposed by the majority leader as a breakthrough that       would allow us to pass immigration reform   I want to express my appreciation       to the Democratic Leader  Senator Reid  He was right to insist       that the original version of the Kyl Cornyn amendment and the       Isakson amendment not be rushed through the Senate to score       political points  As the significantly revised version of the       Kyl Cornyn amendment attests  the Democratic Leader was right        With a little time  and thanks to a lot of hard work  the       amendment has been significantly changed  narrowed and       accepted  With a little time and bipartisan commitment the       Isakson amendment was defeated    We have proceeded to consider       dozens of amendments  Most have been offered by Republican       Senators  Some have been approved  some have been tabled or       rejected  The Senate has worked its will     Immigration reform       must be comprehensive if it is to lead to real security and real       reform  Enforcement only measures may sound tough but they are       insufficient  The Senate has a responsibility to pass a bill       that addresses our broken system with comprehensive reform and       puts the pieces in place to secure the nation      Just a few weeks ago       I went to the White House with a bipartisan delegation of       Senators to speak with the President  The need for a fair and       comprehensive immigration bill was the consensus at that       meeting  and I believe the President was sincere when he told us       that we had his support  I trust that he will urge       comprehensive immigration reform on the Republican House       leadership who has yet to endorse our bipartisan comprehensive       approach  Without the President following through on his words       with actions  the effort for comprehensive immigration reform is       unlikely to be successful    Last week the Senate       made progress  We made progress because Democratic and       Republican Senators working together rejected the most strident       attacks on the comprehensive bill  We joined together in a       bipartisan coalition in the Judiciary Committee when we reported       the Judiciary Committee bill  Democratic Senators were ready to       join together in April and supported the Republican Leader s       motion that would have resulted in incorporating features from       the Hagel Martinez bill  but Republicans balked at that time and       continued to filibuster action  Last week  Republicans joined       with us to defend the core provisions of that bill  and we       defeated efforts by Senators Kyl and Cornyn to gut the guest       worker provisions and to undermine the pathway to earned       citizenship  Instead  we adopted the Bingaman amendment to cap       the annual guest worker program at 200 000 and the Obama       amendment regarding prevailing wages in order to better protect       the opportunities and wages of American workers      I spoke last week       about the need to strengthen our border security after more than       5 years of neglect and failure by the Bush Cheney       Administration  A recent report concluded that the number of       people apprehended at our borders for illegal entry fell 31       percent on President Bushs watch  from a yearly average of 1 52       million between 1996 and 2000  to 1 05 million between 2001 and       2004  The number of illegal immigrants apprehended while in the       interior of the country declined 36 percent  from a yearly       average of roughly 40 000 between 1996 and 2000  to 25 901       between 2001 and 2004  Audits and fines against employers of       illegal immigrants have also fallen significantly since       President Bush took office  Given the vast increases in the       number of Border Patrol Agents  the decline in enforcement can       only be explained by a failure of leadership      Meanwhile  once       again the Administration is turning to the fine men and women of       National Guard  After our intervention turned sour in   Iraq  the Pentagon turned to the       Guard  After the government wide failure in responding to       Hurricane Katrina  we turned to the Guard  Now  the       Administration s longstanding lack of focus on our porous       Southern border and failure to develop a comprehensive       immigration policy has prompted the Administration to turn once       again to the Guard  I remain puzzled that this Administration        which seems so ready to take advantage of the Guard  fights so       vigorously against providing this essential force with adequate       equipment  a seat at the table in policy debates  or even       adequate health insurance for the men and women of the Guard    I have cautioned       that any Guard units should operate under the authority of State       governors  In addition  the Federal Government should pick up       the full costs of such a deployment  Those costs should not be       foisted onto the States and their already overtaxed Guard units          Controlling our       borders is a national responsibility  and it is regrettable that       so much of this duty has been punted to the States and now to       the Guard  The Guard is pitching in above and beyond  balancing       its already demanding responsibilities to the States  while       sending troops who have been deployed to   Iraq  The Guard served admirably in       response to Hurricane Katrina when the Federal Government failed       to prepare or respond in a timely or sufficient manner  The       Vermont Guard and others have been contributing to our national       security since the immediate aftermath of 9 11  After 5 years       of failing to utilize the authority and funding Congress has       provided to strengthen the Border Patrol and our border       security  the Administration is  once again  turning to the       National Guard     It was instructive       that last week President Bush and congressional Republicans       staged a bill signing for legislation that continues billions of       dollars of tax cuts for the wealthy  Instead of a budget with       robust and complete funding for our Border Patrol and border       security  the President has focused on providing tax cuts for       the wealthiest among us  Congress has had to step in time and       again to create new Border Agent positions and direct that they       be filled  Instead of urging his party to take early and       decisive action to pass comprehensive immigration reform  as he       signaled he would in February 2001  the President began his       second term campaigning to undercut the protections of our       Social Security system  and the American people signaled their       opposition to those undermining steps  While the President       talks about the importance of our first responders  he has       proposed 67 percent cuts in the grant program that supplies       bulletproof vests to police officers     Five years of the       Bush Cheney Administrations inaction and misplaced priorities       have done nothing to improve our immigration situation  The       Senate just passed an emergency supplemental appropriations bill       that allocated nearly  2 billion from military accounts to       border security  The Democratic Leader had proposed that the       funds not be taken from the troops  But last week the President       sent a request for diverting a like amount of funding  intended       for capital improvements for border security  into operations       and deployment of the National Guard  The Republican Chairman       of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security       came to the Senate Floor last week to give an extraordinary       speech in this regard     Border security       alone is not enough to solve our immigration problems  We must       pass a bill  and enact a law    that will not only strengthen       the security along our borders  but that will also encourage       millions of people to come out of the shadows  When this is       accomplished we will be more secure because we will know who is       living and working in the   United States  We must encourage the       undocumented to come forward  undergo background checks  and pay       taxes to earn a place on the path to citizenship      In addition  last       week the Senate adopted a billion dollar amendment to build       fencing along the Southern border without saying how it would be       funded  We also adopted amendments by Senators Bingaman  Kerry       and Nelson of Florida to strengthen our enforcement efforts          Last week we       defeated an Ensign amendment to deny persons in legal status the       Social Security benefits to which they are fairly entitled  I       believe that most Americans will agree with that decision as       fair and just  It maintains the trust of the Social Security       Trust fund for those workers who contribute to the fund  This       week we defeated a Sessions amendment that would have unfairly       stripped immigrants of Earned Income Tax Credits  I am pleased       that in both cases the Senate agreed not to unfairly withhold       these benefits from hardworking immigrants who will benefit       immensely from them     The opponents of our       bipartisan bill have made a number of assaults on our       comprehensive approach  Senators Kyl  Sessions  and Cornyn       opposed the Judiciary Committee bill  Senators Vitter  Ensign        Chambliss and Inhofe have been very active in the amendment       process  as well  I hope that they recognize how fairly they       have been treated and the time they have been given to argue       their case against the bill and offer amendments  We have       adopted their amendments where possible  A narrowed version of       the Kyl Cornyn amendment disqualifying some from seeking       legalization was adopted  The Sessions amendment on fencing was       adopted  The Vitter amendment on documents was adopted  The       Ensign amendment on the National Guard was adopted  The Cornyn       amendment imposing additional costs on immigrants was adopted           I trust that with so       many of their amendments having been fairly considered and some       having been adopted  those in the opposition to this measure       will reevaluate their previous filibuster  It may be too much       to think that they will support the bill as amended
