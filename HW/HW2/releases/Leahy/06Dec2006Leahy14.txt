       Leahy Pressures Fo Answers On Data Mining  Troubled Sentinel Project                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             FBI Oversight  Leahy Presses      For Answers On Data Mining      Troubled Sentinel Project      Promises Stronger Oversight In 110th Congress      Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      Hearing On FBI Oversight     December 6  2006  Mr  Chairman  thank you for convening      todays FBI oversight hearing  This is another opportunity to      continue our efforts to remake the FBI into a modern domestic      intelligence and law enforcement agency   Once again we commend the Bureaus      skilled workforce  the agents  the technicians and all the other      men and women on the front lines and behind the scenes who have been      working long days  year after year  to help keep our citizens and      communities safe     The Importance Of      Oversight  As the peoples elective      representatives  we in Congress have a solemn duty to conduct      meaningful oversight of the Executive Branch  Constructive      congressional oversight of the FBIs work is an invaluable tool to      help make the FBI as good as the American people need it to be in      countering terrorism and in strengthening law enforcement     I take the responsibility to conduct      oversight seriously  For this reason  oversight of the FBI and the      Department of Justice will again be one of my highest priorities as      Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee during the next Congress       as it was when I last had the privilege of chairing this Committee        The recent revelation that the Bush      Administration  since 9 11  has been compiling secret dossiers on      millions of unwitting  law abiding Americans who travel across our      borders  highlights the importance of diligent congressional      oversight  It is simply incredible that the Administration is      willing to share this sensitive information with foreign governments      and even private employers  while refusing to allow U S  citizens to      see or challenge the so called terror score that the government has      assigned them based on their travel habits and schedules        When done poorly or without proper safeguards and oversight  data      banks do not make us safer  they just further erode Americans      privacy and civil liberties  This Administration has gone to      unprecedented lengths to hide its own activities from the public       while at the same time collecting and compiling unprecedented      amounts of information about every citizen        New technologies make data banks more powerful and more useful than      they have ever been before  They have a place in our security      regimen  But powerful tools like this are easy to abuse and are      prone to mistakes  A mistake can cost Americans their jobs and      wreak havoc in their lives  Mistakes on government watch lists have      become legendary in recent years  We need checks and balances to      keep government data bases from being misused against the American      people         Data banks like this are overdue for meaningful oversight  and that      is going to change in the new Congress    Detainee Treatment  One of the greatest challenges facing      the FBI today is striking the successful balance between fulfilling      its core counterterrorism mission  while respecting and preserving      the democratic principals and freedoms that make America such a      great and resilient Nation  For more than two years  I have      repeatedly sought answers from the FBI  and from others  regarding      reported and  in some instances  documented cases of the abuse of      detainees in U S  custody  Just recently  I wrote to the Attorney      General about press reports that after years of denials the Central      Intelligence Agency has acknowledged the existence of additional      classified documents detailing the Bush Administrations      interrogation and detention policy for terrorism suspects   When Director Mueller appeared before      this Committee in May 2004  I asked him if FBI agents had witnessed      objectionable interrogation practices in Iraq  Afghanistan or      Guantanamo Bay  and he gave a purposefully narrow answer  saying      that no FBI agents had witnessed abuses in Iraq  Documents      released by the FBI in December 2004 made clear that FBI agents      witnessed abusive treatment of prisoners at least at Guantanamo Bay       and Director Muellers own answers to subsequent questions have shed      some more light on the subject than his original answer  The      Congress and the American people deserve to know the truth about the      Bush Administrations interrogation policies and practices  I hope      that Director Mueller will continue moving away from the Bush      Administrations policy of secrecy and concealment on this issue and      toward the responsiveness that the American people deserve    Counterterrorism  It also troubles me deeply that  five      years after 9 11  the FBI is still not as strong and as equipped as      it must be to fulfill its counterterrorism mission  After the 9 11      terrorists attacks  I authored the USA Patriot Act provision aimed      at facilitating the hiring of more translators at the FBI  To its      credit  the Bureau has made some progress in this area  The number      of FBI translators proficient in Arabic has increased almost 300      percent since 9 11  and the FBI has significantly increased its      overall number of linguists  But the FBI still lags far behind when      it comes to the number of agents who are proficient in Arabic       Recently  The Washington Post      reported that only 33 FBI agents have at least a limited      proficiency in Arabic and that only 1 percent of FBI agents      have any familiarity with the language at all  If the FBI is to be      a world class intelligence agency  this is a serious problem that it      must promptly and adequately address    Information Sharing      And Sentinel  I also remain greatly concerned about      the FBIs new paperless case management system  Sentinel  We have      been told that Sentinel will cost the American taxpayers  425      million to complete and that this system will not be fully      operational until 2009  On Monday  the Department of Justice Office      of Inspector General issued a report finding that the FBI will need      an addition  56 7 million to just to pay for Phase II of      Sentinel and that there are serious concerns about the adverse      impact that these additional costs could have on the FBIs non IT      programs  There have also been rumors about growing concern within      the FBI that the Bureau will cut other mission critical programs to      pay for this program for several months  In addition  in October       the GAO issued a report that found that the FBI has no plan in place      to address future staffing and human capital needs for Sentinel       After watching the FBI waste five years and millions of taxpayer      dollars on the Trilogy program  I remain seriously concerned about      this project  The American people cannot afford another fiasco    Conclusion  Since 9 11  the FBI has made      significant strides to adjust to the threats and challenges of our      time  I commend these accomplishments  and especially the      hardworking men and women of the FBI   But there is much more to do  The      Bureau must also acknowledge and learn from its mistakes to become a      world class intelligence and law enforcement agency intelligence       Director Mueller  I look forward to hearing your views on how best      to move the Bureau forward
