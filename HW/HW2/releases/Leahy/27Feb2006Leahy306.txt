       Statement Of Senator Patfick Leahy  PATRIOT Act Reauthorization                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      PATRIOT Act Reauthorization     February 27  2006  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  the      Republican leadership has made a mistake and is abusing its power by      choking off debate on this important bill  Regrettably the Majority      Leader has chosen to prevent any effort to offer amendments to the      bill and has effectively stifled open debate  While I voted to      proceed to consideration of the bill  I do not condone the      Republican leaderships current abuse    I have filed an amendment that would      improve the bill by correcting one of the most egregious police      state provisions regarding gag orders  The Bush Cheney      Administration used the last round of discussions with Republican      Senators to make the gag order provisions worse  in my view  by      forbidding any court challenge for one year  The conference report      places no similar restriction on recipients of National Security      Letters  and there is no justification for its inclusion here        In addition  the bill continues and      cements into law procedures that  in my view  unfairly determine      legitimate challenges to gag orders  It allows the Government to      ensure itself of victory by certifying that  in its view  disclosure      may endanger national security or may interfere with diplomatic      relations  Unless the government is acting in bad faith  the court      must accept the certification as conclusive and must rule in favor      of the Government    This is the type of provision to which      I have never agreed  The conference report uses identical language      in connection with NSL gag orders  and I resisted it in that      context  I agreed with Senator Sununu  who said in December that it      would prevent meaningful judicial review because NSL recipients      would never be able to show bad faith on the part of the Federal      Government  Senator Specter has also been critical of this      provision   My amendment would have corrected      these unnecessary excesses  It struck both the one year waiting      period for challenging a gag order and the conclusive presumption      in favor of the Government  These changes are simple but they are      essential if we are to avoid creating rigged procedures where the      government always wins  regardless of the merits   By its abuse of the rules  the      Republican leadership is preventing any opportunity to correct these      matters  That is wrong  The Senate may have accepted or rejected      my effort to remove this un American restraint on meaningful      judicial review of gag orders  but I should have had the opportunity      to offer it    In the weeks following 9 11  some of      us worked hard in cooperation with the Bush Cheney Administration on      what came to be the USA PATRIOT Act  I remind the current      Republican leadership that even then  in those extraordinary times       we allowed Senators to offer amendments  We took difficult votes       I would have liked to have supported some of those amendments but       in my role as the Chair of the Judiciary Committee  I felt that I      could not at that time  But I did not and the majority leader       Senator Daschle  did not fill the amendment tree with sham      amendments  Instead  we worked out an agreement to proceed with      amendments and votes on those amendments    In 2001  I fought for time to provide      some balance to Attorney General Ashcrofts demands that the      Bush Cheney Administrations anti terrorism bill be enacted in a      week  We worked hard for six weeks to make that bill better and      were able to include the sunset provisions that contributed to      reconsideration of several provisions over the last several months       Last year I worked with Chairman Specter and all the Members of the      Judiciary Committee and the Senate to pass a reauthorization bill in      July  As we proceeded in House Senate conference on the measure       the Bush Cheney Administration and congressional Republicans locked      Democratic conferees out of their deliberations and wrote the final      bill  That was wrong   Last December  working with a      bipartisan group of Senators  we were able to urge reconsideration      of that final bill  Senators Sununu and Craig were able to use that      opportunity to make some improvements  I commend them for what they      were able to achieve and hope that my support for their efforts has      been helpful  I wish that along the way the Bush Cheney      Administration had shown interest in working together to get to the      best law we could for the American people    Since the House Senate conference was      hijacked  I have tried to get this measure back on the right track       We have been able to achieve some improvements  I regret that this      bill is not better and that the intransigence of the Bush Cheney      Administration has prevented a better balance and better protections      for the American people  Just as I worked for an opportunity for      Senator Sununu to seek improvements to the conference report  I will      now vote against these unfair efforts to forestall any amendments to      this measure  I remain committed to working to provide the tools      that we need to protect the American people  That includes working      to provide the oversight and checks needed on the uses of Government      power and to improve the reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act   In light of the abuse being      perpetrated by the Republican leadership  I will vote against their      stifling of meaningful debate and their obstruction of efforts to      improve the bill  the conference report and the PATRIOT Act  I will      vote against cloture on the bill without any opportunity to offer      amendments  I urge the Republican leadership to reconsider its      actions and allow a few amendments to be offered to the bill so that      we can seek to improve it before final passage by the Senate
