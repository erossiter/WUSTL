       Leahy Pushes For Passage Of Bipartisan Bill  Republicans Block Latest   Attempt                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leahy Pushes For Passage Of Bipartisan     Bill  Republicans Block Latest Attempt  WASHINGTON  Friday  July 27     Republican objections continue to     stall efforts to pass a bipartisan bill that would strengthen open     government laws  with the latest example occurring late Thursday evening     before the Senate adjourned for the week  An attempt by Democratic     senators to bring the bill up for debate was blocked by Republicans      This was one of several attempts in recent months by the Democratic     leadership to pass the bill  which is cosponsored by Senators Patrick     Leahy  D Vt   and John Cornyn  R Texas  Below is Senator Leahys     comment  followed by the unofficial transcript of the Senate floor     proceedings     Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Judiciary Committee      On Efforts To Pass OPEN Government Act     July 27  2007   The Republican obstructionism continues in the Senate and the latest     casualty is Americans access to their government  I am deeply     disappointed that Republicans continue to block attempts to pass the     Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act  OPEN     Government Act     For more than two years  I have worked on a bipartisan basis to     enact this important Freedom of Information Act reform legislation  and     I remain committed to work with any Senator of either party who is     seriously committed to restoring openness  accountability and trust in     our government  It is unfortunate that this bipartisan bill  which     promotes sunshine and transparency in our government  is being held up     by some Republicans who refuse to debate this bill in public    The OPEN Government Act promotes and enhances public disclosure of     government information under FOIA  by helping Americans to obtain timely     responses to their FOIA requests and improving transparency in the     federal governments FOIA process  During the Judiciary Committees     recent hearing on this bill  we learned that  although FOIA remains an     indispensable tool in shedding light on bad policies and government     abuses  this open government law is being hampered by excessive delays     and lax FOIA compliance  Today  Americans who seek information under     FOIA remain less likely to obtain it than during any other time in     FOIAs four decades of service  This bill would help to reverse this     trend and to restore the publics trust in their government    This is a good government bill that Democrats and most Republicans     are working together to enact  and I hope the few Republican opponents     who are standing in the way will stop obstructing and work in a     cooperative way with us toward a resolution                  Congressional Record transcript from Senate floor  July 26  2007       Mr  DURBIN  Mr  President  I ask unanimous consent that the     majority leader  following consultation with the Republican leader  may     at any time proceed to consideration of Calendar No  127  S  849  the     Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act of 2007      that the bill be considered under the following limitations  that there     be a time limit of 2 hours of general debate on the bill  with the time     equally divided and controlled between the chair and ranking member of     the Judiciary Committee or their designees  that the only amendment in     order be a Leahy Cornyn technical amendment  which is at the desk  that     upon the use or yielding back of time  the amendment be agreed to  the     bill as amended be read three times  and the Senate vote on passage of     the bill  with the above occurring without further intervening action or     debate   The PRESIDING OFFICER  Is there objection   Mr  COCHRAN  Mr  President  it is my understanding that there     are ongoing discussions with both sides of the aisle as well as the     administration to come up with bipartisan  consensual language on this     issue and that we are unable to clear the agreement at this time      Therefore  on behalf of several Republican senators  I object   The PRESIDING OFFICER  Objection is heard   Mr  DURBIN  Mr  President  I understand Senator    Cochran has expressed the sentiments     of some on his side of the aisle  I would like to say for the record     that we have made this proposal for several months now  I think those     who are trying to move this issue have shown extraordinary patience in     trying to reach an accommodation  and this is no reflection on the     Senator from Mississippi  who was not involved in this debate  that I     know of  It only is a plea to those who are considering the merits of     this legislation to try to do so in a timely fashion
