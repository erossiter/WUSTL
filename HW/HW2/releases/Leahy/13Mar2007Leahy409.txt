       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On Reintroduction Of The Leahy Cornyn   OPEN Government Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Reintroduction Of The Leahy Cornyn OPEN Government Act    March 13  2007    Mr  President  I am pleased to join Senator Cornyn     in reintroducing the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National     Government Act  the OPEN Government Act   This bill contains     commonsense reforms to update and strengthen     the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  for all Americans   Last year  the Senate Judiciary Committee favorably     reported an essentially identical bill  Sadly  the full Senate did not     consider this legislation before it adjourned last year  But I hope     that the Senate will do its part to     reinvigorate FOIA this year  by promptly passing this bill  During my three decades in the Senate  I have     devoted a considerable portion of my work to improving government     openness  to make our government work better for the American people      For the past four years  I have been delighted to have Senator Cornyn as     a partner on this important issue  I thank him for his leadership on     preserving and strengthening FOIA  Now in its fourth decade  the Freedom of     Information Act remains an indispensable tool in shedding light on bad     policies and government abuses  But  today  FOIA also faces challenges     like never before  During the past six years  the Bush Administration     has allowed lax FOIA enforcement and a near obsession with secrecy to     undercut the publics right to know  As we celebrate Sunshine Week this     week  there is urgent need to update and     strengthen our FOIA law   Chief among the problems     with FOIA is the major delays encountered by FOIA requestors  According     to a report by the National Security Archive  an independent     non governmental research institute  the     oldest outstanding FOIA requests date back to 1989    before the     collapse of the Soviet Union  And  while the number of FOIA     requests submitted each year continues to rise  our federal agencies     remain unable  or unwilling    to keep up with the demand  Just     recently  the Government Accountability Office found that federal     agencies had 43 percent more FOIA requests pending and     outstanding in 2006  than they had in 2002  Although the Bush Administration has taken modest     steps to address the growing problem with FOIA delays that effort has     not done nearly enough to correct lax FOIA enforcement by federal     agencies  More than a year after the Presidents directive to     government agencies to improve their FOIA services  Americans who seek     information under FOIA remain less likely to obtain it  For example  a     recent study by the Coalition of Journalists for Open Government found     that the percentage of FOIA requestors who obtained at least some of the     information that they requested from the government fell by 31     percent last year  These and other shortcomings with the     Presidents FOIA policy demonstrate that the Congress must play an     important role in preserving and strengthening FOIA   The legislation that Senator Cornyn and I introduce     today takes several important steps to help     Americans obtain timely responses to their FOIA requests and to provide     government officials with the tools that they need to ensure that our     government remains open and accessible  First  our bill restores     meaningful deadlines for agency action by ensuring that the 20 day     statutory clock runs immediately upon the receipt of the request and the     bill impose real consequences on federal agencies for missing statutory     deadlines  Our bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency records     that are held by outside private contractors  no matter where these     records are located  In addition  our bill     establishes a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies  either by     telephone or on the Internet  to enable requestors to track the status     of their FOIA requests  Finally  our bill enhances the agency reporting     requirements under FOIA and improves personnel policies for FOIA     officials to enhance agency FOIA performance  This legislation was     drafted after a long and thoughtful process of consultation with     individuals and organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain information     and share it with the public  including the news media  librarians  and     public interest organizations representing all facets of the political     spectrum   This legislation also     reaffirms the fundamental premise of FOIA  B     that government information belongs to all Americans  Again  I thank     Senator Cornyn for the time and effort that he has devoted to     reinvigorating FOIA  and I urge all Senators to join us in supporting     this important open government legislation                 Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On     Reintroduction Of The Leahy Cornyn
