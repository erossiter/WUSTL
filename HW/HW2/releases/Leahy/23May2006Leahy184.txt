       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Perspectives On Patents                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick  Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary       Subcommittee On Intellectual Property      Perspectives On Patents        Post Grant Review Procedures And Other Litigation Reforms      May 23  2006  Senator Hatch and I have been       grappling with the very complex issues in the patent litigation       process for more than a year  We are grateful for the       assistance we have received from our witnesses  and from many       others in the audience and around the nation  Today  we are here       to address a particularly knotty problem  the proper scope and       form of review procedures after the Patent and Trademark Office       has granted a patent    The proper scope and form raises       sets of questions  matters of patent law  matters of       administrative adjudication  and matters of litigation       strategies  I want to remind everyone of the bigger picture       here  Our Constitution enshrined patent rights for a reason        to promote the progress of science and useful arts  There is       no mandate from the Founders that we embrace any particular       approach to the patent litigation system  no requirement that we       favor one side or another in a patent dispute  and no directive       to ensure that any other policies  however laudable they may be        are advanced  We are charged with creating and maintaining a       system that gives inventors exclusive rights in their       inventions for limited times in order to promote the progress       of science and useful arts    I believe that an effective       post grant review procedure can  and should  do just that        Invalid patents can be weeded out more efficiently and the PTO       can correct its own errors  Infringement claims can be       evaluated more effectively  And patent holders can be more       confident in the rights secured to them   Looking at the written testimony       of our witnesses today  we should have a lively debate on this       topic  In fairness  I will say that I favor a robust post grant       process  which would include a limited second window  in the       event that a patent holder sues for infringement  But there are       a multitude of subsidiary issues to be addressed  even within       that framework  and I look forward to the assistance of all of       you in understanding and resolving those issues  I want to       thank Senator Hatch for his willingness to work on this enormous       project
