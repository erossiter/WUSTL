       Leahy  Feinstein Introduce Legislation Restricting Use  Sale Or Transfer   Of Cluster Bombs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  Feinstein Introduce Legislation      S  594     Restricting Use  Sale Or Transfer Of Cluster Bombs  WASHINGTON       Thursday  Feb  15   U S  Senators Dianne Feinstein  D Calif   and      Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday introduced legislation to restrict      federal funds for the use  sale or transfer of cluster bombs unless      specified that they will be used only against clearly defined      military targets and not where civilians are known to be present  or      in areas normally inhabited by civilians   Their bill would also      restrict cluster bombs with failure rates of 1 percent or greater       Leahy and      Feinstein introduced a similar measure in September 2006 as an      amendment to last years defense spending bill   Next week Norway      will host an international conference to explore the possibility of      an international treaty to ban certain types of cluster munitions      and provide support for the victims of the weapons   This long overdue      step addresses a global problem caused by the irresponsible use of a      weapon that has cost the lives and limbs of countless innocent      people  said Leahy  Civilians too often    and increasingly         are the victims of war  Our bill strikes the right balance by      ensuring that when cluster munitions are used or sold  they are      subject to strict controls so they do not pose unacceptable risks to      civilians  By setting this example the United States can advance      international efforts to stop the carnage caused by cluster      munitions  Leahy also has long been the leading U S  officeholder      working to end the worldwide use of anti personnel landmines   Cluster bombs      have been used around the world Vietnam  Laos  Cambodia  Kosovo       Iraq  Afghanistan  the Middle East  and the list goes on  said      Feinstein  The impact on civilian populations has been      devastating  These indiscriminate weapons of war continue to      endanger the lives and limbs of innocent men  women  and children      long after conflict has ended  Thats because up to 40 percent of      the bomblets that make up cluster bombs fail to explode on contact       remaining volatile for decades  The simple truth is that unexploded      cluster bombs become de facto landmines  ready to explode when      touched   The bill is      cosponsored by Senators Bernie Sanders  I Vt   and Barbara Mikulski       D Md    Specifically  the      Feinstein Leahy bill          Prohibits any funds from being spent to      use  sell  or transfer U S  cluster bombs with a failure rate of      more than one percent    o     The President may waive this provision      if he certifies that it is vital to protect the security of the      United States          Prevents any funds from being spent to      use  sell or transfer cluster munitions unless the rules of      engagement or the agreement applicable to the sale or transfer of      such cluster munitions specify that    o     The cluster munitions will only be used      against clearly defined military targets and   o     Will not be used where civilians are      known to be present or in areas normally inhabited by civilians          Requires the President to submit a      report to the relevant Congressional committees on the plan       including estimated costs  by either the United States Government or      the government to which U S  cluster bombs are sold or transferred      to clean up unexploded cluster bombs   Background  Cluster bombs are      designed to come apart in the air before making contact  dispersing      between 200 and 400 small bomblets that can saturate a wide radius      of 250 yards  They are intended for military use when attacking      large scale enemy troop formations  But in practice  cluster bombs      have increasingly been used in or near populated areas  Handicap      International studied the effects of cluster bombs in 24 countries      and regions  including Afghanistan  Chechnya  Laos  and Lebanon       Its report found that civilians make up 98 percent of those killed      or injured by cluster bombs  Twenty seven percent of the casualties      are children  The civilian toll      has been high  Combining the      first and second Gulf Wars  the total number of unexploded bomblets      in the region is approximately 1 2 million  An estimated 1 220      Kuwaitis and 400 Iraqi civilians have been killed since 1991    In Iraq in 2003       13 000 cluster bombs with nearly 2 million bomblets were used       In Afghanistan in      2001  1 228 cluster bombs with 248 056 bomblets were used  Between      October 2001 and November 2002  127 civilians were killed  70      percent of them under the age of 18   Between nine and      27 million unexploded cluster bombs remain in Laos from U S  bombing      campaigns in the 1960s and 1970s  Approximately 11 000 people  30      percent of them children  have been killed or injured since the war      ended  Most recently  it      is estimated that Israel dropped 4 million bomblets in southern      Lebanon  and 1 million of these bomblets failed to explode  And      reports indicate that Hezbollah retaliated with cluster bomb strikes      of their own   In November 2006       the International Committee for the Red Cross and U N       Secretary General Kofi Annan called for prohibiting use of cluster      bombs in populated areas  Also in November  a wide ranging treaty      went into effect to protect civilians  peacekeepers and other      humanitarian agencies in post conflict regions from cluster bombs       It will require parties to an armed conflict to clear all unexploded      cluster bombs and other munitions once hostilities have ended  Several countries       including Belgium  Germany  and Norway have either instituted a ban      or a moratorium on the use and procurement of cluster bombs  More      than 30 countries are actively calling for increased international      controls on the weapon
