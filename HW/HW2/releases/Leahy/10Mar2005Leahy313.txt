       Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Judiciary Executive Business   Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Opening Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Judiciary Executive Business Meeting        March 10  2005 It is good to see the Chairman looking so well  We        have been working hard together to try to find a consensus on legislation        to fairly compensate asbestos victims  That is important work and we have        undertaken it in good faith   Earlier this week he chaired the third hearing on one        of the Presidents controversial circuit court renominations  That is        three major hearings within barely more than a week  Chairman Specter is        affording each of these nominees  Judge Boyle  Mr  Myers  and Mr  Griffith        another opportunity to provide the Committee and the Senate with additional        information and assurance that they have earned and merit the consent of        the Senate to their lifetime appointment as a custodial of the rights of        all Americans   The Chairman has pressed a most ambitious schedule         Three hearings in eight days stands in sharp contrast to 1999 when a        Republican Chairman refused to hold any hearings on President Clintons        judicial nominees until June  That was when Republicans were successfully        pressuring President Clinton to nominate Republicans that they recommended        for federal judgeships  I do  however  regret that our Chairman has chosen to        list one judicial nomination prematurely on todays agenda  When this        nomination was first listed  the record was indisputably incomplete  That        nomination is not ready to be considered  Written questions after his        hearing were submitted Tuesday  The nominee has not taken the time to        consider and answer those inquiries fully and Senators have not had a fair        opportunity to evaluate the responses   Listing matters on an agenda before they are ready is        an ill advised practice  It was regularly employed by the prior Chairman        to circumvent minority rights under our rules  It is not appropriate or        appreciated  This year Democrats have cooperated with the Chairman to        report a class action bill and a bankruptcy bill that many of us viewed as        significantly flawed  We have cooperated at hearings and established the        quorum for business meetings  We have offered  debated and voted on        amendments without delay  We have even withheld amendments and agreed not        to offer them when we were assured that Republicans would work with us on        the Senate floor  Instead  in connection with both bills  virtually all        amendments were voted down and there was little in the way of bipartisan        effort from Republicans to improve either measure through floor        amendments   What is driving this Committee and the Senate toward        conflict is this White Houses efforts to create unnecessary confrontation        over judicial nominees  The President insisted on renominating troublesome        and divisive choices rather than working with us to find more consensus        nominees who would be fair judges  who would serve only to protect the        rights of all Americans and who would not be selected to advance a partisan        or personal agenda  That is what we all should be seeking  That is why        the Founders and the Constitution afforded the Senate its role as a check        and a balance on the choices of a powerful President   Four years ago  after Senate Republicans had abused        their power to prevent more than 60 moderate and qualified judicial        nominations of President Clinton from being considered and confirmed  I        nonetheless urged this White House and Senate Republicans to work with all        Senators to fill judicial vacancies  I pressed forward in the 17 months I        chaired the Judiciary Committee to put the Senate in position to confirm        100 of President Bushs lifetime appointments to the federal courts         During the other 33 months  almost twice the time  Republicans have        succeeded in adding 103 confirmations   I tried to meet Republicans half way by making and        fulfilling commitments to do what Republicans had not done  and we held        hearings on even some of President Bushs most controversial nominees  For        all of our efforts we were rewarded with vilification and personal        attacks  With respect to judicial nominations  it appears that no good        deed by Senate Democrats goes unpunished   Over the last two years the Bush Administration        continued down its course of politicizing judicial nominations  The Senate        Republican leadership has abandoned its responsibilities to the Senate in        this regard  choosing instead to serve as a wholly owned subsidiary of the        White House in their effort to turn the federal judiciary into an arm of a        particular ideological wing of the Republican Party  Over the last two        years Senate Republicans bent  broke or ignored our traditional rules        governing Committee consideration of judicial nominees   This year Senate Republicans are working to exercise        the nuclear option to destroy the one Senate rule left that allows the        minority any protection and with it any comity in the Senate and any hope        of making bipartisan progress on anything  Changing the rules to remove        the threat of the filibuster  which has allowed the Senate to serve as a        check on a powerful Executive  would destroy the Senate  undermine the        independence and fairness of the federal judiciary  and lead to a rollback        of the rights and freedoms of the American people   At the beginning of this Congress the new Senate        Democratic Leader reached out to the White House and offered an olive        branch and cooperation  His good efforts have likewise been spurned by the        White House  which remains intent on seeking confrontation over        reconciliation   Just last week the Senator        from Colorado sent a letter to the President urging that we join in common        cause on these matters and suggesting that the President make a show of        good faith by ratcheting down the conflict by withdrawing those divisive        judicial nominations on which the Senate has previously withheld its        consent  He offered President Bush some wise counsel noting that the        decision to re nominate these individuals will undoubtedly create the        animosity and divisiveness between the President and the Unites States        Senate as an institution that is not helpful to our Nation and will        sidetrack our collective efforts to work on other crucial matters  It was        a sensible suggestion  It  too  has been rejected out of hand by a White        House that seeks absolute authority and seeks to undermine the checks and        balances that have served for 200 years to protect our rights and our        democracy   Unlike the many anonymous Republican holds and pocket        filibusters that kept scores of President Clintons qualified judicial        nominees from moving forward  the concerns Democrats have about President        Bushs controversial nominees are no secret  I made our blue slips        public when Republicans never would  We have debated these divisive        nominees in this Committee and at length on the Senate floor  That is much        fairer than Republicans accorded President Clintons moderate and qualified        nominees who were defeated through secret holds of as few as a single        anonymous Republican Senator  It is a commonplace of American jurisprudence that no        one is above the law  Yet Senate Republicans first abused the Senates        rules and practices to stymie more than 60 of President Clintons judicial        nominees  Then  once a Republican President was elected  they turned on        their heels to bend  break and override every rule and traditional Senate        practice that has served to protect the minority   If the American people are to have confidence in our        system of laws  they must also have confidence in the process by which        federal judges are chosen as fair arbiters and as trustees of their        rights  Ramming controversial nominees through the Senate by brute force         through hook or crook  is no way to consider judges  That shows no respect        for the rule of law  We are not a rubber stamp  We should not dispense        conveyor belt consideration  This is not the candy factory that ran out of        control in that famous I Love Lucy episode  This is the Senate Judiciary        Committee   The consequences of our decisions are too important to        the rights of Americans  to the preservation of their civil rights and        civil liberties and to the constitutional protections of our children and        grandchildren to be exercised cavalierly  This is no time to turn back the        clock on womens rights and human rights and environmental protections         Given the compliant Republican majority in Congress  the only check on        arrogant abuses of power by this Administration has been an independent        judiciary  The Supreme Court has called this Administrations policies to        task  Once the judiciary is filled with partisans beholden        to the Administration and willing to reinterpret the Constitution in line        with the Administrations demands  who will be left to protect American        values and the American people  These are lifetime appointments we are responsible for        considering  Being a member of the Federalist Society does not entitle one        to a lifetime appointment on the federal bench  Yet this Administration        has chosen to nominate more people affiliated with the Federalist Society        than African Americans  Hispanics and all minorities combined  Nor are        federal judgeships part of a spoils system to be used as rewards for those        who have supported the political agenda of this Administration  Our        judiciary is the envy of the world because it is independent and fair and        made up of men and women of the highest integrity   I can not help but note the        irony given President Bushs recent eloquent speech on the fundamental        requirements of a democratic society when he met with President Putin of        Russia  Where is his commitment to those principles in his demands and the        Republican demands for absolute power  I remind Republicans of the        Presidents own words when he acknowledged that democracy relies on the        sharing of power  on checks and balances  on an independent court system         on the protection of minority rights  and on safeguarding human rights and        human dignity   The President recently        promised the American people in a radio address in this country that he        would serve all Americans and would work to promote the unity of our great        nation  I wish the President and more Senate Republicans would work to        fulfill that promise  His renomination of controversial judicial nominees        already considered by the Senate is inconsistent with that promise and        undercuts the fundamental principles that protect our democracy  It is        unprecedented   Senate Republicans        insistence on deploying the nuclear option is an affront that will further        undermine unity and fundamental safeguards of the rights and freedoms of        Americans  The confrontational approach of this Administration is        unnecessary and unwise  Senate Republicans insistence that this President        be given carte blanche in his efforts to pack the federal courts and that        the Senate become a rubberstamp and give up its distinctive protection of        minority rights is shortsighted at best  It is unfortunate that the Senate        Republican leadership is acting as an arm of the Administration rather than        on behalf of the Senate and providing the checks and balances on which our        democracy and our freedoms depend   As Senator Reid and Senator Salazar have recently        suggested  if the Bush Administration would work with us  we could reach        consensus on nominees to fill the current judicial vacancies  There are        currently 25 judicial vacancies without nominees  including six for circuit        courts around the country  Of these two dozen vacancies without a nominee         the President has already missed his own self imposed deadline on at least        10 because he has failed to nominate within 180 days of the vacancy   In addition there are another eight to 12 vacancies we        have been notified will soon be occurring  For example  before the end of        this month  there will be another vacancy in Alabama and another in        Florida  in May there will be another in Kentucky  in June there will be        another in Georgia and another in Puerto Rico  Obviously  there are also        more than a dozen vacancies on which we could be working together to find        consensus rather than continuing to consider the divisive nominees        previously considered but renominated  I wish the Republican        Administration and the Republican Leadership in the Senate would work with        us to find consensus nominees  experienced  qualified  fair men and women        who could garner virtually unanimous support  The only new judicial nomination received all year has        been Brian Edward Sandoval  a nominee to the District Court in Nevada  who        could serve as a model for how we can work together  This is a nominee        with the support of both of his home state Senators  one Republican and the        other the Senate Democratic Leader  Once his background check is reviewed        and his paperwork is complete  I hope we will move expeditiously on that        model nominee   When we had a vacancy on the Second Circuit from        Vermont  I joined with the Republican Governor and Senator Jeffords in        recommending and supporting Peter Hall who was confirmed expeditiously         This is how we could and should fill judicial vacancies  Unfortunately         this Administration too often chooses not to follow the path of consensus        but  instead  seeks to serve the interests of a narrow partisan wing of        their political party over the interests of the American people   One final point will demonstrate Democratic        cooperation in the face of Republican partisanship  Among this Presidents        renominations there are two noncontroversial judicial nominations on which        we should be able to make immediate progress  I speak of the Presidents        nomination of Paul Crotty to the District Court for the Southern District        of New York and the nomination of Michael Seabright to the District Court        of Hawaii  All Democrats on the Committee have been prepared to vote        favorably on these nominations for some time  We were prepared to report        them last year but they were not listed by the then Chairman on a Committee        agenda  Let there be no misunderstanding  All delay in the consideration        of these judicial nominees is attributable to Republican intransigence         what could fairly be called obstruction  I know of no substantive basis        for Republican objection to either of these nominees  but they continue to        be stalled by anonymous Republican holds  As far as Senate Democrats are        concerned these nominees can be added to the agenda today  reported        favorably today and confirmed as soon as Senate Rules allow  They can be        sworn in and sitting by St  Patricks Day  They would be the first two        judges confirmed this year and would join the ranks of 204 lifetime        judicial appointments nominated by this President that the Senate has        already confirmed
