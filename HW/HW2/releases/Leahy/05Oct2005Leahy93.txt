       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Senate Consideration Of The   Reauthorization Of The Violence Against Women Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Senate Consideration Of The Reauthorization      Of The Violence Against Women Act  S  1197     October 5  2005 I am pleased that      the full Senate has finally taken up  considered and passed the      reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act  S  1197       bipartisan legislation that will further our goal of ending domestic      violence  dating violence  sexual assault and stalking  The      enactment of the Violence Against Women Act over a decade ago marked      an important national commitment to survivors of domestic violence      and sexual assault  I am proud to join Senators Biden  Hatch       Specter and others as an original cosponsor of this important      measure  which currently has 58 cosponsors in total  I want to      especially recognize Senator Biden for his commitment to ending      violence against women and children  Earlier in my      career as a prosecutor in Vermont  I witnessed the devastating      effects of domestic violence  Violence and abuse affect people of      all walks of life every day and regardless of gender  race  culture       age  class or sexuality  Such violence is a crime and it is always      wrong  whether the abuser is a family member  someone the victim is      dating  a current or past spouse  boyfriend  or girlfriend  an      acquaintance or a stranger  The National      Crime Victimization Survey estimates there were 691 710 non fatal       violent incidents committed against victims by current and former      spouses  boyfriends or girlfriends  also known as intimate partners       during 2001  Of those incidents  85 percent were against women       The rate of non fatal intimate partner violence against women has      fallen steadily since 1993  when the rate was 9 8 incidents per      1 000 people  In 2001  the number fell to 5 0 incidents per 1 000      people  nearly a 50 percent reduction  but still unacceptably high       Tragically  however  the survey found that 1 600 women were killed      in 1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend  while in 2000      some 1 247 women were killed by their intimate partners  According to the      annual Vermont Crime Report  the number of forcible rapes reported      in Vermont increased in 2004 to the highest level in seven years       while the amount of violent crime remained unchanged and overall      crime fell by about 5 percent from 2003  Reported incidents of rape      rose by 58 percent  from 117 in 2003 to 185 in 2004  The average      age of the victim was 21  47 percent of victims were younger than 18      years old  in 74 percent of the cases the perpetrator was an      acquaintance of the victim  and in a quarter of the cases the      defendant was a family member or intimate partner of the victim  In      only 1 percent of the cases was the perpetrator a stranger  These      figures cause me great concern because violent crime has declined      nationwide during that same time period  Numbers like these are why      reauthorizing VAWA is so vital  Our Nation has      made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in recognizing that      domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes  We have responded      with better laws  social support and coordinated community      responses  Millions of women  men  children and families  however       continue to be traumatized by abuse  leading to increased rates of      crime  violence and suffering  The Violence      Against Women Act has provided aid to law enforcement officers and      prosecutors  helped stem domestic violence and child abuse       established training programs for victim advocates and counselors       and trained probation and parole officers who work with released sex      offenders  Now we on the Judiciary Committee and then the rest of      our colleagues in Congress have the opportunity to reauthorize VAWA      and make improvements to vital core programs  tighten criminal      penalties against domestic abusers  and create new solutions to      other crucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault  This      is an opportunity to help treat children victims of violence       augment health care for rape victims  hold repeat offenders and      Internet stalkers accountable  and help domestic violence victims      keep their jobs   Included in VAWA      2005 are reauthorizations of two programs that I initially sponsored      that are vital to helping rural communities battle domestic violence      in a setting in which isolation can make it more difficult for both      victims and law enforcement  In a small  rural state like Vermont       our county and local law enforcement agencies rely heavily on      cooperative  interagency efforts to combat and solve significant      problems  That is why I sought to include the Rural Domestic      Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program as part      of the original VAWA  This program helps make services available to      rural victims and children by encouraging community involvement in      developing a coordinated response to combat domestic violence       dating violence and child abuse  Adequate resources combined with      sustained commitment will bring about significant improvements in      rural areas to the lives of those victimized by domestic and sexual      violence   The Rural Grants      Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and expands the existing      education  training and services grant programs that address      violence against women in rural areas  This provision renews the      rural VAWA program  extends direct grants to state and local      governments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include      community collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or      expansion of additional victim services  This provision includes      new language that expands the program coverage to sexual assault       child sexual assault and stalking  It also expands eligibility from      rural states to rural communities  increasing access to rural      sections of otherwise highly populated states  This section      authorizes  55 000 000 annually for 2006 through 2010  which is an      increase of  15 million per year   The second grant      program initiative on which I have focused is the Transitional      Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence  Dating      Violence  Sexual Assault or Stalking  This program  which became      law as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003  authorizes grants for      transitional housing and related services for people fleeing      domestic violence  sexual assault or stalkers  At a time when the      availability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows       transitional housing for victims is especially needed  Today more      than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and children      fleeing domestic violence  We have a clear problem that is in dire      need of a solution  This program is part of the solution    Transitional      housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving violence in      their homes and becoming self sufficient  Our bill  VAWA 2005       amends the existing transitional housing program by expanding the      current direct assistance grants to include funds for operational       capital and renovation costs  Other changes include providing      services to victims of dating violence  sexual assault and stalking       extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match that      used by Housing and Urban Development transitional housing programs       and updating the existing program to reflect the concerns of the      service provision community  The provision would increase the      authorized funding for the grant from  30 000 000 to  40 000 000       Regrettably  this      important bill was saddled in Committee with an extraneous and      ill considered amendment  offered by Senator Kyl  relating to the      national DNA database  Current law permits States to collect DNA      samples from arrested individuals and to include arrestee      information in State DNA databases  In addition  States may use      arrestee information to search the national DNA database for a      possible hit  The only thing that States may not do is upload      arrestee information into the national database before a person has      been formally charged with a crime   Under the Kyl      amendment  arrestee information can go into the national database      immediately upon arrest  before formal charges are filed  and even      if no charges are ever brought  This adds little or no value for      law enforcement  while intruding on the privacy rights of people who      are  in our system  presumed innocent  It could also provide an      incentive for pretextual and race based stops and arrests for the      purpose of DNA sampling  Congress rejected this very proposal less      than a year ago  after extended negotiations and consultation with      the Department of Justice  The Kyl amendment      would also make it harder for innocent people to have their DNA      expunged from a state database  Under current law  if a State      chooses to enter a persons DNA profile into its database before the      person is convicted of a crime  then the State must automatically      expunge that information in the event that no conviction is      obtained  Under the new language  even a person who is arrested in      error and released without charge would need to obtain a court order      before his DNA information could be removed from the database  Databases are      important tools to solving crime  but there are limits to what      should be included in databases  The Kyl amendment raises serious      privacy concerns that cannot be justified by any legitimate law      enforcement need  I opposed it in Committee  I continue to oppose      it in its current form  and I will press for its exclusion in      conference  VAWA 2005 is an      important part of our efforts to increase awareness of the problem      of violence  to save the lives of battered women  rape victims and      children who grow up with violence and to continue progress against      the devastating tragedy of domestic violence  I look forward to      working with Senators Specter and Biden  Congressmen Sensenbrenner      and Conyers and other members of the upcoming conference to      reauthorize the Violence Against Women Act and thus strengthen the      prevention of violence against women and children and its      devastating costs and consequences
