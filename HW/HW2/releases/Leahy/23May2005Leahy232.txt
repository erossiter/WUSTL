       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nuclear Option                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of      Senator Patrick  Leahy  On The Nuclear      Option     Senate Floor     Monday  May 23  2005  The Senate is on a path toward a      divisive and unnecessary showdown  If the vote on the Republican      leaders nuclear option were by secret ballot  we all know it would      fail overwhelmingly  We know this because Senators know that it is      harmful to this institution and wrong for this country    wrong in      terms of protecting the rights of the American people  wrong in      terms of undercutting our fundamental system of checks and balances       wrong in terms of defending the independence of and public support      for the independent federal judiciary  and wrong in unilaterally      destroying minority protection in the Senate in order to promote      one party rule    But Democratic Senators alone will not      be able to rescue the Senate and our system of checks and balances      from the breaking of the Senate rules that the Republican leader      seems so insistent on demanding  It will take at least six      Republicans standing up for fairness and for checks and balances  I      believe that a number of Senators on the other side of the aisle      know in their hearts that this nuclear option is the wrong way to      go    Senators on both sides of the aisle      have called for the vote on the nuclear option to be one of      principle rather than one of party loyalty and for this to be a vote      of conscience  I agree  To ensure that it is  I want to urge both      the Republican leader from Tennessee and the Democratic leader from      Nevada  both of whom are my friends  to announce publicly today  in      advance of the momentous vote that awaits us at the end of this      debate  that every Senator should search his or her heart and      conscience and vote accordingly  and that no retribution or      punishment will be visited upon any Senator for his or her vote        I remember in the aftermath of another      vote  one I called at the time a profile in courage  when our friend      Mark Hatfield of  Oregon cast the deciding vote against      a proposed constitutional amendment  Ten years ago  some of the      newer Republican Senators at the time reportedly wanted to strip him      of the chairmanship of the Appropriations Committee  The press at      the time provided accounts of those newer Senators  some having      recently arrived from the other chamber and who were accustomed to      the way the Republican Party in that body operates  At the time       some of those members urged that Senator Hatfield be penalized for      his vote of conscience that they did not like and that they thought      did not toe the party line  I remember the unfair pressures that      were brought to bear on Senator Hatfield  I do not want to see that      befall other Senators  Republican or Democratic  whichever way they      choose to vote on the nuclear option    The Senate has its own carefully      calibrated role in our system of government  and the Senate was not      intended to function just like the House    The Great Compromise of the      constitutional convention more than 200 years ago was to create in      the Senate a different legislative body from the House of      Representatives  Those fundamental differences include equal      representation for each State in accordance with article I  section      3  Thus   Vermont has equal numbers of Senators      to New York and Idaho  The Founders intended this as a vital      check  Representation in the Senate is not a function of population      or based on the size of a State or its mineral wealth     Another key difference is the right to      debate in the Senate  The filibuster is quintessentially a Senate      practice  James Madison wrote in Federalist Number 63 that the      Senate was intended to provide interference of some temperate and      respectable body of citizens against illicit advantage and the      artful misrepresentations of interested men  It was designed and      intended as a check  as a balancing device  and as a mechanism to      promote consensus and to forge compromise  The House of      Representatives has a different  equally crucial function in our      system  I respect the House and its traditions  just as I respect      and honor the Senates  It is the Senates special role in our      legislative system to protect the rights of a minority from the      divisive or intemperate acts of a headstrong majority    As the Republican leader granted in      debate with Senator Byrd last week  there is no language in the      Constitution that creates a right to a vote for a nomination or a      bill  If there were such a right  it was violated more than 60      times when Republicans refused to consider President Clintons      judicial nominees  According to the Congressional Research Service       more than  500 judicial nominations for circuit      and district courts have not received final Senate votes between      1945 and 2004  more than 500  amount to 18 percent of overall      nominations  By contrast  this President has seen more than 95      percent of his judicial nominations confirmed  208 to date     What the Republican leadership is      seeking to do is to change the Senate Rules not in accordance with      them  but by breaking them  It is ironic that Republican Senators       who prevented votes on more than 60 of President Clintons judicial      nominees and hundreds of his Executive Branch nominees because one      anonymous Republican Senator or another objected  now contend that      the votes on nominations are constitutionally required     I would like to keep the Senate      autonomous and secure and in a nuclear free zone  The partisan      power play now underway by Republicans will undermine the checks and      balances established by the Founders in the Constitution  It is a      giant leap toward one party rule  with an unfettered Executive      controlling all three branches of the Federal Government  It not      only would demean the Senate and destroy the comity on which it      depends  it also will undermine the strong  independent federal      judiciary that has protected the rights and liberties of all      Americans against the overreaching of the political branches        Our Senate parliamentarian and our      Congressional Research Service have said that the so called nuclear      option would go against Senate precedent  Do our friends on the      other side of the aisle really want so blatantly to break the rules      for short term political gain  Do they really desire to turn the      Senate into a place where the parliamentary equivalent of brute      force is whatever can be rammed through by partisan ramrodding and      arm twisting    We did not come to this crossroads      overnight  No Democratic Senator wanted to filibuster  and not one      of us came to those votes easily  We hope we are never forced by an      over aggressive Executive and compliant majority into another      filibuster over a judicial nomination  The filibusters  like the      confrontation that the Senate is being forced into over the last      several days  are the direct result of a deliberate attack by the      current Administration and its supporters here in the Senate against      the rules and traditions of the Senate  The nuclear option is the      grand culmination of their efforts  It is intended to clear the way      for this President to appoint a more extreme and more divisive      choice should a vacancy arise on the Supreme Court     This is not how the Senate has worked      or should work  It is the threat of a filibuster that should      encourage the President to moderate his choices and work with      Senators on both sides of the aisle  Instead  this President has      politicized the process  and Senate Republicans have systematically      eliminated every other traditional protection for the minority  Now      their target is the Senate filibuster  the only tool that was left      to allow a significant Senate minority to be heard     Under pressure from the White House       over the last two years  the former Republican Chairman of the      Judiciary Committee led Senate Republicans in breaking with      longstanding precedent and Senate tradition with respect to handling      lifetime appointments to the federal bench  Senate Republicans have      had one set of practices to delay and defeat a Democratic      Presidents moderate and qualified judicial nominations and a      different playbook to rubberstamp a Republican Presidents extreme      choices to lifetime judicial positions  The list of broken rules      and precedents is long    from the way that home state Senators were      treated  to the way hearings were scheduled  to the way the      Committee questionnaire was unilaterally altered  to the way the      Judiciary Committees historic protection of the minority by      Committee Rule IV was repeatedly violated  In the last Congress       the Republican majority of the Judiciary Committee destroyed      virtually every custom and courtesy that had been used throughout      Senate history to help create and enforce cooperation and civility      in the confirmation process    That is the backdrop for this debate      now before the Senate  An overly aggressive Executive  abetted by a      majority of the same political party in the Senate  acted last      Congress to eliminate any meaningful role of the minority at the      Committee level and to eliminate our traditions  rules and practices      that had protected the minority  For years now  Democratic Senators      have been warning that the deterioration of Senate rules and      practices that have protected minority rights   This systematic and corrosive erosion      of checks and balances has brought the Senate to this precipice       The filibuster in the Senate is the last remaining check on the      abuses of one party rule and the undermining of the fairness and      independence of the federal judiciary  If the Senate is to serve      its constitutional role as a check on the Executive  its protection      must be preserved  That is the question the Senate will be facing      tomorrow
