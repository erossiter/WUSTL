       Leahy Hits House Leaders For Dropping TRICARE Health Insurance For Guard   And Reserve Members                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy Hits House Leaders     For Dropping TRICARE Health Insurance     For Guard And Reserve Members   BACKGROUND   On Monday  May 23       House Armed Services Committee Chairman Duncan Hunter  R Calif        exercised a rarely used power to drop a bipartisan      committee approved provision from the panels version of the FY 2006      Defense Authorization Bill that would have made the TRICARE Reserve      Select program available to every member of the Guard and Reserve         Rep  Gene Taylor       D Miss    co chair of the House National Guard and Reserve      Components Caucus  sponsored the committee amendment to expand      eligibility for the recently established program  The amendment was      adopted last week on a bipartisan basis during the committees      markup  with seven Republicans joining 25 of the committee s      Democratic members     Congress over the      past four years has considered making the militarys TRICARE      insurance program available to reservists on a cost share basis       After the Administration failed in 2003 to implement a      congressionally approved program to allow unemployed reservists to      opt into TRICARE coverage  a more limited program was started in      April that tied eligibility to time on active duty during a military      contingency    A bipartisan group      of senators led by Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    Sen  Lindsey Graham       R S C    Sen  Hillary Clinton  D N Y   and Sen  Mike DeWine       R Ohio  have developed and pushed the legislative effort to open up      TRICARE to reservists  More than two thirds of the Senate has voted      over the past two years for their legislation to offer full      eligibility to any member of the Guard and Reserve who is      participating in drills     The House in recent      years has largely remained silent on the health insurance needs of      the Guard and Reserve  The Taylor amendment would have marked the      first time that the House had a comparable version of the Senates      TRICARE legislation for Guard and Reserve members  Chairman      Hunter s decision to remove the provision from the committee s      version before floor debate decreases the likelihood that the      TRICARE Select Reserve program will be expanded this year      LEAHY REACTION   Leahy  a leading      member of the coalition that is pushing the broader TRICARE health      insurance legislation and who co chairs the Senate National Guard      Caucus  criticized the rule to prevent a vote on the TRICARE      amendment    Our Guard and      Reserves are doing front line duty  but they are getting      second class health insurance  They are doing more than their fair      share in defending the country and taking on the burden of combat in      Iraq  They deserve far better than this arrogant treatment       Affordable health insurance is vital for the readiness of our      reserves  just as it is for the rest of our troops  This amendment      has solid bipartisan support  and the House should not be prevented      from considering it  I hope Chairman Hunter and the House      Republican leadership will reconsider the high handed removal of      this amendment and will allow the entire House to vote                        For      reference  from CongressDaily PM  Monday  May 23  2005       DEFENSE   Hunter Removes Tricare Provision From      Defense Measure     House Armed Services Chairman Hunter has employed      a rarely used authority to strike a provision in the      committee passed  441 6 billion defense authorization bill that      would have opened the military s Tricare healthcare system to all      National Guard members and reservists  The provision  one of only a      handful of Democrat victories during the 14 hour markup last week       would push the military s mandatory spending levels beyond those      allowed under the FY06 budget resolution  The bill is scheduled for      floor consideration Wednesday  I have consulted the chairman of the      Budget Committee on this matter  and he informs me that if the bill      is brought forward to the floor in violation of the Budget Act  he      will exercise his prerogative to raise the applicable point of order      and thus prevent its consideration on the floor  Hunter wrote in a      Friday memo to the committee  After the committee s markup  Hunter      asked and received unanimous consent to alter the bill if mandatory      spending limits exceeded allowed limits  The vote is routine for the      committee  but the authority has not been used in at least the last      five years  said a House aide        Rep  Gene Taylor  D Miss   sponsored the Tricare amendment       which passed Wednesday night on a 32 30 vote despite opposition from      Hunter and other leading committee Republicans  The next day  Hunter      asked the CBO to estimate the price tag for Taylor s amendment  In a      Friday memo to Hunter  CBO said the amendment would cost the      military roughly  230 million in FY06  and  4 6 billion through      2010  It also would skew average costs for the Federal Employees      Health Benefits program because many of the 120 000 Guardsmen and      reservists who work for the federal government would shift to the      less expensive Tricare system  The shift would cause a spike in FEHB      premiums  forcing the government to increase its per capita costs       Costs for employees enrolled in FEHB would decrease by  340 million      through 2010  while the cost of retiree benefits would grow by  94      million over the same period  according to CBO       In a statement today  Taylor said many of the problems with the      amendment could be solved by prohibiting federally employed      reservists from dropping FEHB for Tricare coverage  Taylor plans to      submit a revised amendment to the Rules Committee that would include      that prohibition  his spokeswoman said  The bottom line is that      this is a technicality that could easily be resolved if the chairman      wanted to get it resolved  Taylor said in a statement       Several military organizations are backing the Taylor amendment      and mobilizing their members  The National Guard Association of the      United States plans to issue a legislative alert to its members      later today  urging them to contact their representatives  The      organization also is drafting letters to Hunter and Rules Chairman      Dreier  said Michele Trafficante  who works in legislative affairs      at the Guard association  An estimated 80 percent of Guardsmen and      reservists already have access to non military healthcare programs       During the markup  Hunter said the measure would lead to a gaming      of the Tricare system  giving employers a way to drop these      so called weekend warriors from their healthcare rolls and stick the      government with the bill     by Megan Scully
