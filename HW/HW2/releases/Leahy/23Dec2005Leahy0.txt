       Comments Of Senator Patrick Leahy In Support Of A One Month Extension Of  The USA PATRIOT Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT          Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    D Vt   Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee    On New Documents Released Friday By The National   Archives   Relating To The Nomination Of Judge Samuel Alito   To The U S  Supreme Court  Friday  Dec  23  2005  The Forsyth Brief   and The Forsyth Memo These new   documents fill in more blanks and deepen the impression of activism that   colors Judge Alitos career  They also touch on issues that already   are of great interest to the committee in the upcoming hearings  One   of the most important  and one of the most timely  is the issue of unchecked   presidential authority and the particular issue of warrantless eavesdropping   on the American people   The   judges in our independent judiciary are our systems most crucial check and   balance against abuses and excesses by the President and the rest of the   government in wielding power  Accountability  and even our basic rights    are lost if our courts fail in this role  These documents raise   further questions about Judge Alitos views on and commitment to this vital   role of the judicial branch as a check on Executive authority    Chairman Specter and I and other members of the committee have informed   Judge Alito  by letter and otherwise  that issues relating to Executive   authority and checks and balances are areas of deep concern that we will   bring to these hearings  and Judge Alitos answers will be in vitally   important in evaluating his suitability to serve on our nations highest   court                            DESCRIPTION OF THE JUNE 12  1985  MEMO from Samuel         Alito to the Solicitor General re  Forsyth v          Kleindienst  i e  Mitchell v  Forsyth           DOJ3 00285 DOJ3 00291     Mr  Alito later wrote the         brief in Mitchell v  Forsyth arguing that the         Attorney General should have qualified and absolute         immunity for civil damages stemming from the         warrantless authorization of wiretaps          Ultimately  the court ruled that the Attorney         General was qualifiedly immune  because the decision         was made before the Supreme Court clarified that         such warrantless taps were unconstitutional   but         rejected the arguments for absolute immunity          In this memo  Samuel Alito takes an approach         mirroring what he did in Thornburgh by embracing the         principle of absolute immunity and suggesting         tactical reasons for avoiding taking it head on          He argues that the Administration should seek cert         only on the appealability of the qualified immunity         claim  not on absolute immunity  but for tactical         reasons  I do not question that the Attorney         General should have this immunity  but for tactical         reasons I would not raise the issue here  He         lays out why this is not a good case for absolute         immunity  including the fact that they would not         have Justice Rehnquist s vote and that it involves a         controversial official from a controversial era          In this memo Mr  Alito makes clear his own personal         view in this matter  declaring that he  himself  has         no doubt the Attorney General should have the         immunity
