       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On The Expiring Provisions Of   The Voting Rights Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement       Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary       Hearing On The Expiring Provisions Of The Voting Rights Act      May 9  2006  I am pleased to join the Chairman       in welcoming everyone to our Committees second hearing on       extension of the expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act        Last Wednesday we joined in introducing a bipartisan bill       cosponsored by the Republican and Democratic leaders of the       Senate  a number of Republicans and Democrats serving on this       Committee and more than two dozen cosponsors in all  The same       bill was introduced on Tuesday in the House by Chairman       Sensenbrenner and Representative Conyers and the Republican and       Democratic leadership in the House  Those actions demonstrate       the widespread support that exists for renewing and revitalizing       the Acts expiring provisions  As several of us noted last week       at an historic bipartisan  bicameral event on the Capitol steps        there have been too few occasions in the last six years in which       Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate have joined       together in this way on behalf of the country     There is not much time remaining       in the legislative calendar this year  If we are to achieve our       goal of reauthorizing the expiring provisions this year we need       to focus on this important matter and our hearings this week and       next  We all want to create the best record we can  It is my       hope  which I have urged upon the Chairman  that we are in       position to report our bill before the end of the month     Today we welcome the testimony of       two civil rights practitioners with a combined history of over       60 years litigating voting rights cases   Ted Shaw has a distinguished       career as a litigator and professor  He is the Director and       President of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund  Inc         founded in 1940 under the leadership of Thurgood Marshall  He       has also taught at Columbia and the University of Michigan law       schools  Laughlin McDonald has been the Director of the ACLUs       Voting Rights Project for the past 34 years as well as teaching       at the University of North Carolina Law School  We appreciate       having experienced practitioners testifying   We will also hear from a       distinguished historian  Professor Chandler  Davidson of Rice University        Professor Davidsons books on this topic have taught the nation       about the insidious discriminatory tactics that deprived many       Americans of the right to vote prior to the passage of the       Voting Rights Act in 1965  The fight for equal voting rights       dated back almost 100 years  to the ratification of the 15th       Amendment in 1870  the last of the post Civil War Reconstruction       amendments  It took passage and implementation of the Voting       Rights Act of 1965  however  for people of all races in many       parts of our country to gain the effective exercise of rights       guaranteed 95 years earlier by the Constitution    The pre clearance provisions       included in the Act were one of the primary reasons progress was       made where earlier attempts had failed  Section  5 requires certain covered       jurisdictions with a history of discrimination to pre clear       all voting changes with either the Justice Department or the       U S  District Court for the District of Columbia  In doing so        Section 5 combats the practices in these jurisdictions of       shifting from one invalidated discriminatory tactic to another        which had undermined earlier efforts to enforce 15th       Amendment guarantees    As part of the second       reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act 1975        Congress added Section 203  which requires bilingual voting       assistance for certain language minority groups  Section 203       has been a key factor in expanding the inclusiveness of       democracy to all American citizens and has led to extraordinary       gains in representation and participation made by Asian       Americans and Hispanic Americans  Like Section 5  Section 203       is set to expire  It is imperative that all       citizens be able to exercise their rights as citizens        particularly a right as fundamental as the right to vote       Renewing the expiring language provisions of the Voting       Rights Act will continue to make that a reality    We reauthorized and amended parts       of the original act in 1970  1975        1982 and 1992 because of continuing discrimination and an       evolving need for remedial action to protect the rights of       American voters  This Congress has the opportunity to       reinvigorate the Act  strengthening and improving its remedies        The Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006       does so by clarifying certain parts of Section 5 to restore the       original meaning and interpretation and thereby give our courts       clear guidance    Regrettably  the effectiveness of       Section 5 has been       undermined by two recent Supreme Court decisions  In our       bipartisan bill we have proposed legislative language to clarify       congressional intent and thereby make clear that a voting rule       change motivated by any discriminatory purpose violates Section       5  That restores the original meaning and purpose of the Voting       Rights Act  to protect the right to vote and to have those votes       count by ensuring minority communitys ability to elect their       preferred candidates of choice   The Voting Rights Act of 1965       is one of the most important laws Congress has ever passed  It       is helping usher the country from a history of discrimination       into an era of greater democracy in which there is greater       inclusion of all Americans in decisions about our Nations       future  Our democracy and our nation are better and richer for       it  While I look forward to the day when it is no longer       needed  I believe that our work here is not yet completed  We       need to make sure that the gains we are making are not lost         I look forward to the testimony of       our witnesses here today and thank them for traveling from all       corners of the country to be with us today on short notice
