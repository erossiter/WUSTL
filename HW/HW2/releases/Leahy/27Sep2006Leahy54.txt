       Sen  Patrick Leahy  Opening Statement  Hearing On Refugee Admissions                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Sen  Patrick Leahy    Opening Statement     Hearing On Refugee Admissions    Subcommittee On Immigration  Border Security And Citizenship    September 27  2006  Mr      Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing and I thank the witnesses     for being here   I know you     have several topics to cover but I want to take a minute to explain why     I believe legislation is necessary to prevent further injustice     resulting from the material support bar to refugee admissions   After     9 11  our laws were modified in the interest of protecting national     security  No one wants terrorists or their supporters to come here as     refugees  But the Congress cast the net so widely that we are now     denying asylum to legitimate refugees    There are     two serious problems with the law   First  it     does not make an exception for persons forced to provide material     support under severe coercion or duress  As a result  the very facts     that make up an individual refugees claim  that he or she was     terrorized by armed groups  become the same facts that are used to deny     asylum    Let me     give an example uring the war in Liberia     rebels came to a womans home  shot and killed her father  raped and     abducted her  and forced her to perform household tasks like laundry and     cooking  She eventually escaped and made her way to a refugee camp      where she sought admission to the U S  But the tasks she performed for     the rebels  like doing laundry  were considered to be material     support and her case was placed on indefinite hold    Hundreds     of other victims of persecution  who pose no threat to the United     States  have been turned away for similar reasons  This is perverse      It is an embarrassment for a country that has been known throughout our     history as a safe haven for refugees   The second     problem is the catch all definition of terrorist organization  It is     defined as a group of two or more persons  whether organized or not  who     bear arms against the ruling government  That is so broad as to include     those who fought alongside the U S  like the Montagnards in Vietnam and     members of the Northern Alliance in Afghanistan    This     harsh  illogical and unintended consequence is now widely recognized      the question is how best to fix it   Some have     argued that there is no need to amend the law because the Administration     has the authority to waive the law in extreme cases  But in the four     years since these bars were expanded  and after eight months of     bureaucratic wrangling  the Administration has used its waiver authority     only once  to protect a subset of Burmese refugees living in Thailand       The waiver     process is cumbersome  requiring the agreement of three different     agencies that rarely agree  the Department of State  Department of     Justice  and Department of Defense  It is also limited  While these     agencies can waive in the supporters of groups that fall in the     overbroad definition of terrorist organization  the waiver does not     apply to members of those groups    And the     waiver authority  although available  has never been used in cases of     coercion  like the case of the Liberian woman  that cry out for relief   Despite     this  the Justice Department  according to their written testimony      apparently believes the status quo is fine  It isnt  It is     unworkable  it is unfair  and it is not making us safer  The fact that     they feel that way is why we need to fix the law    It is time     for Congress to act  Congressman Joseph Pitts has introduced     legislation in the House that should guide our work in the Senate  His     legislation includes two simple fixes   1  an exemption for those  like     the Liberian woman  who are coerced into providing support for     terrorists  and  2  assurance that groups who support U S  troops or are     engaged in legitimate resistance movements are not inadvertently defined     as terrorist organizations    Any     supporter or member of one of the more than 100 designated terrorist     groups will still be barred from entry into this country  The changes     proposed by Congressman Pitts  changes we should all support  only     amend the additional  catch all definition of terrorist organization      leaving intact the bars for anyone associated with a designated     terrorist group    The     legislation also leaves untouched the many other security and     terrorism related bars on entry  Anyone who has ever engaged in     terrorist activities  espoused terrorism  incited terrorism  received     military training from a designated terrorist organization  solicited     others to join a designated terrorist organization  associated with      joined or represented a designated terrorist organization  or provided     any sort of material support  no matter how limited  to a terrorist     organization  will continue to be barred entry to the United States   The     legislation will make us safer by ensuring that supporters of the United     States  and those we support  are not inadvertently labeled terrorists      We cannot effectively combat terrorism if we cannot distinguish between     our friends and enemies   It is time     to bring our laws back in line with our values   Thank you     Mr  Chairman  and I hope we can work together to pass legislation like     that proposed by Congressman Pitts
