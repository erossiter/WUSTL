       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Committee On The   Judiciary  The Alito Nomination  The Supreme Court  And Presidential Power                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary  The Alito       Nomination  The Supreme Court  And Presidential Power  Remarks On       The Nomination Of Samuel A  Alito  Jr        To Be An Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court Of The United       States      Georgetown University Law Center      January 19  2006  Good morning  It always feels       good to return to Georgetown  I thank you for the invitation to       join you today and look forward to the work of this important       symposium    For the last few months  I have       been immersed in the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to replace       Justice Sandra Day OConnor  and today I want to touch on what I       believe are some of the most important issues that have arisen          The Supreme       Court As The Ultimate Check On Presidential Overreaching  Central during the hearings on       this nomination was the issue of whether Judge Alito would serve       as an effective constitutional check on the presidency  or       whether he would instead adhere to unchecked expansions of       presidential powers  in accordance with the extreme  and  I       might add  immodest    theory of a Unitary Executive        Presidential power was the first subject I explored with Chief       Justice Roberts in his confirmation hearing  and it was the       first subject I explored with Judge Alito in his hearings  This       is a fundamental question for me as I consider this nomination        It is also a fundamental question for the Senate and for this       country at a time when we have a President prone to       unilateralism and arrogant assertions of Executive power that       range all the way up to illegal spying on Americans     Can this President  or any       President  order illegal spying on Americans  Can this       President  or any President  authorize torture  in defiance of       our criminal statutes and our international agreements  Can       this President  or any President  defy our laws and Constitution       to hold American citizens in custody indefinitely without any       court review   After reviewing thousands of pages       of rulings and writing  and days of testimony from Judge Alito        I have concluded that this nominee has failed to address these       central concerns on the issue of government power  Preventing       government intrusion into the personal privacy and freedoms of       Americans is one of the hallmarks of the Supreme Court  Yet       there is no reason to believe that Judge Alito will serve as an       effective check and balance on government intrusion into the       lives of Americans  Indeed  his record suggests otherwise          Failing The       Test  A Nominee Who Cannot Demonstrate Independence  At the hearings Judge Alito failed       this test  literally  He twice misstated the generally       recognized framework for the Courts reviewing claims of       government power in answer to my first questions  I corrected       him when he could not distinguish between what Justice Jackson       called the zone of twilight    the situation when Congress had       not acted in an area in which the President claimed authority          and the circumstances where Congress has acted and the       Presidents authority is seen at its lowest ebb and subject to       more demanding justification  An example of this latter       category is wiretapping of Americans in light of Congresss       enactment of FISA to comprehensively control government spying       on Americans    The Senate considers this       nomination at a pivotal point in our nations history     Security and liberty are always in       tension in our society  and especially since the attacks of       September 11  But liberty and security need not be mutually       exclusive  And in this blessed land  with the constitutional       legacy that has been entrusted to us through the blood  sweat       and tears of earlier generations of Americans  we must not yield       to the temptation to trade liberty for security  In a week when       we commemorate Ben Franklins 300th birthday  it is       especially fitting to ponder the relevance in our own time of       his observation that  They who would give up an       essential liberty for temporary security  deserve neither       liberty or security   With enough care and effort and       foresight  we can have both   I chaired the Judiciary Committee       after the 9 11 attacks  and in working with the White House and       with congressional partners in crafting the USA PATRIOT Act  I       pushed hard to add a variety of checks and balances  such as       judicial review and sunsets  to many of its provisions  The       Bush Administration resisted those additions at the time  but       today they brag about them as if they were their own  They make       no mention of their earlier contentions that checks and balances       would somehow hinder our anti terrorism efforts    and  in       fact  these checks against abuses have not hindered our       efforts  We need not trade liberty for security   Yet the unilateral assertions of       presidential power have continued throughout this presidency        They have become the pattern  abetted by a Republican Congress       that more often than not is too timid or too beholden or too       uninterested to exercise its own authority  including its       oversight responsibilities    The question of Judge Alitos       confirmation comes to us at a time when we are learning that the       President has been conducting secret and warrantless       eavesdropping on Americans for more than four years  It was       during this backdrop that Judge Alito was vetted by the Bush       Administration  and was ultimately picked  This President has       made some of the most expansive claims of power since American       patriots fought the war of independence to rid themselves of the       oppressive rule of King George III  This President is claiming       power to illegally spy on Americans  to allow actions that       violate our values and laws protecting human rights  and to       detain U S  citizens and others on his say so  without judicial       review or due process  This is a time in our history when the       protections of Americans liberties are at risk  as are the very       checks and balances that have served to constrain abuses of       power for more than two centuries  And once it is taken away or       eroded  liberty is rarely restored   The Supreme Court is the ultimate       check and balance in our system  The independence of the Court       and its members is crucial to our democracy and way of life        The Senate should never be allowed to become a rubber stamp  and       neither should the Supreme Court  I asked Judge Alito to       demonstrate his independence from the interests of the       President  and he failed that test     This       Presidents Choice  This nomination is to a lifetime       seat on the nations highest court  and to a seat that in our       era has often represented the decisive vote on constitutional       issues  The Senate must carefully consider the suitability of       the nominee to serve as a final arbiter of the meaning of       Constitution and the law  Will he allow the government to       intrude on Americans personal privacy and freedoms  In a time       when this Administration seems intent on accumulating unchecked       power  Judge Alitos views on Executive power are especially       vital and pertinent    and  as we learned last week  especially       troubling  It appears that he was chosen to serve as a       surrogate for the President when the Supreme Court is called       upon to review this Presidents expansive claims of governmental       power to intrude into Americans lives  The President wanted a       reliable justice who would uphold the Presidents assertions of       power  He thought he had nominated one in his White House       Counsel Harriet Miers  Having been forced by an extreme faction       within his own party to withdraw her nomination  the President       turned swiftly to Judge Alito to serve that function   Judge Alitos opening statement at       the hearing skipped over the reasons he was chosen for this       nomination  Most importantly  in his testimony he attempted to       revise and redefine the theory of the Unitary Executive to       which he subscribes  It is that troubling theory that this       President and his supporters are using as a legal underpinning       to attempt to justify this Presidents assertions of virtually       unlimited power    No President should be allowed to       pack the courts  and especially the Supreme Court  with nominees       selected to enshrine presidential claims of government power        Our system was designed to ensure a balance and to protect       against overreaching by any branch  The checks and balances       that should be provided by the courts  Congress and the       Constitution are too important to be sacrificed to such an       agenda  The Senate stood up to President Roosevelt when he       proposed a court packing scheme  And today  the Senate should       not be a rubber stamp to this Presidents effort to move the law       dramatically to the right and to give him unfettered leeway  I       will not lend my support to an effort by this President to move       the Supreme Court and the law radically to the right and to       remove the final check within our democracy   We know that Samuel Alito thought       that the Constitution and the law justified absolute immunity       for President Nixons Attorney General John Mitchell from       lawsuits for having authorized wiretapping of Americans  among       other violations of their privacy  That is immunity even if the       Attorney General acted willfully to violate their rights     We know that as a judge  Samuel       Alito was willing to go further than even Michael Chertoff  the       former head of the Ashcroft Justice Departments Criminal       Division  a former U S  Attorney  and the current Secretary of       the Department of Homeland Security  in excusing government       agents for searches not authorized by judicial warrants  He       showed this kind of extreme deference in his dissents in  Doe v  Groody and  Baker v  Monroe  Township  We know       Judge Alito would have excused the strip search of a    10 year old girl that was not       expressly authorized by the search warrant   We know he was part of the effort       within the Meese Justice Department to expand the use of       presidential signing statements to increase the Presidents say       regarding what a law passed by Congress means  That is the       practice that the Bush Administration has elevated to an art       form  but a dark art in which the President signs a law  but       then by way of a unilateral statement  declares that he will not       follow it  or will construe it as he chooses  In these signing       statements  the President is reported to have relied upon the       theory of the Unitary Executive more than 100 times    A Stealth       Strategy For A Presidential Power Grab  The most well known example of       this power grab is this Presidents signing statement in       connection with the recent enactment of our declaration against       torture and cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment  Last month        Congress passed a bill containing a provision against torture       known as the McCain Amendment  which Senator Durbin and I       cosponsored  The McCain Amendment was passed overwhelmingly by       large bipartisan majorities in the Senate and the House after       being stalled by this Administration for months  It       incorporates the language of the Convention Against Torture and       ratified treaties like the Geneva Convention  and it expressly       prohibits cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment of detainees       by U S  government personnel  The Bush Administration opposed       this provision  Vice President Cheney lobbied against it  The       Administration tried to create a loophole in the law to get out       of following it  When Congress said no  the President had a       widely publicized meeting with Senator McCain at the White House       to announce that they had worked it out and the President now       agreed to the prohibition against torture    But the President apparently had       other intentions when he made that deal and signed the bill into       law  On December 30  he released a signing statement       proclaiming that his Administration shall construe the law in       a manner consistent with the constitutional authority of the       President to supervise the unitary Executive branch  Many of       us  Republicans and Democrats  are concerned that the President       is still trying to have it both ways  He signed the law rather       than vetoing it and seeking changes  Then he proceeded to say       that he can choose to disregard the law  at his discretion        based on his own self serving view of his powers      A       Nominees Troubling Record On Expansive Presidential Power         We know that in his       1985 job application Judge Alito wrote that he strongly believed       in the supremacy of the elected branches over the judiciary        At his hearing he told Senator Kennedy that the phrase was       inapt and that it was misleading and inaccurate  Every high       school student in America knows that we have three separate       co equal branches and that the judiciary was intended by the       Founders to serve as a check on the elected branches  including       the President  But Judge Alito was far from clear on this       point  Judge Alito testified that he had not changed his mind       on these matters since 1985 but did not clarify further        Based on his testimony and his record I have no reason to       believe that he will fulfill the proper role of the courts when       the political process is corrupt or breaks down and an elected       branch cannot or will not fix the problem  The Supreme Court       has a longstanding rationale for stepping in where the political       process fails  Judge Alito demonstrated no sense of       faithfulness to that critical role of the courts     Although Judge Alito       produced material for only 21 of the more than 50 speeches he       has given  we do have the transcript of his November 2000       appearance before the Federalist Society  The Judge took time       from his busy schedule and docket to attend that Federalist       Society convention in Washington just days after the       presidential election in 2000  He discussed his adherence to       the theory of the Unitary Executive and criticized the Supreme       Court for upholding the constitutionality of the independent       counsel statute  He went so far as to call the Unitary       Executive gospel and to say that in his view it best       captures the meaning of the Constitutions text and structure        And although Judge Alito has sought to distance himself during       the hearings from his membership in the Concerned Alumni of       Princeton  he has not denied his involvement in the Federalist       Society which touts this theory     That audition before       the Federalist Society appeared to work  reminding those       advising the new President that they had a known quantity in       Samuel Alito  It led to a White House interview in connection       with a possible future Supreme Court vacancy shortly thereafter       in 2001  Judge Alito had other meetings and interviews but the       key one took place in May 2005 with Vice President Cheney        Scooter Libby  Karl Rove and others at the White House  It was       months before Justice OConnor made her announcement to retire        that came in July  But in May  Judge Alito was called to a       meeting with this Administrations key political strategists        It was this meeting that I thought of when Judge Alito sat       before the Committee and asked  How did I get here      He must have gotten       this critical nomination because of his deference to government       power  his adherence to the Unitary Executive  his rulings in       favor of government intrusions  and whatever he said in his job       interviews at the White House that convinced those advising this       President that he will be a reliable vote against challenges to       presidential power     Responding To       Questions  But Answering Few  In last weeks hearings  Judge       Alito responded to hundreds of questions  but he adequately       answered far too few of them  His answers often amounted to a       scholastic or technical discussion  That may be adequate in a       classroom  but his answers were not sufficient about his own       approach to the law and the Constitution  This was his one       moment of accountability before potentially taking a lifetime       seat on the highest court in the land  There was too little       substance and too little accountability to the American people       and to the Senate   Judge Alito spent his entire legal       career working for the government  Indeed since he graduated       from law school his sole employer and  in essence  his one       client has been the government  He was given political       appointments by President Reagan  the former President Bush and       is now nominated by the current President Bush to the most       important position to which anyone could be named  In an       extraordinary era of governmental intrusions into the lives of       ordinary Americans  when it has been left to the Supreme Court       to restore balance  it is difficult to have any confidence that       this nominee will serve as an effective check on his patron or       on the government which he has spent his entire legal practice       representing    I voted for President Reagans       nomination of Justice Sandra Day OConnor  for President       Reagans nomination of Justice Anthony Kennedy  for President       Bushs nomination of Justice Souter  and for this Presidents       recent nomination of Chief Justice Roberts  I cannot vote for       this nomination    I want a Supreme Court that acts       in its finest tradition of preventing government intrusion into       the personal privacy and freedoms of all Americans  I want all       Americans to know that the Supreme Court will protect their       rights and will respect the authority of Congress to act in       their interest  The Supreme Court must be an institution where       the Bill of Rights and human dignity are honored     At a time when the President is       seizing unprecedented power  the Supreme Court needs to act as a       check and to provide balance  Based on the hearing and his       record  I have no confidence that Judge Alito would provide that       check and balance  In good conscience  based on the record  I       cannot support this nomination
