       Leahy Marks Sunshine Week With Restore FOIA Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Leahy Marks Sunshine Week With Restore FOIA Act Would Restore Biggest        Rollback In FOIAs History  In Homeland Security Dept s Charter  WASHINGTON          Tuesday  March 15     Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   on Tuesday plans to mark        Sunshine Week with the introduction of the Restore FOIA Act  which would        strike the appropriate balance between protecting Americans right to know        and restrictions on public access to corporate filings about infrastructure        with the federal government  Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the        Senate Judiciary Committee  introduced similar legislation in the 108th        Congress  He will be joined Tuesday by Sens  Carl Levin  D Mich    Russell        Feingold  D Wisc   and Joseph Lieberman  D Conn    the co sponsors of the        bill  The bill kicks off Sunshine Week  a weeklong campaign to raise        public awareness about the importance of open government  The bill is one        of several legislative efforts Leahy is leading to encourage and promote        open government  Leahy  a longtime FOIA champion  recently co sponsored        with Senator John Cornyn  R Texas   a fellow member of the Judiciary        Committee  the OPEN Government Act  which would enhance and expand        accessibility  accountability  and openness of the federal government by        tightening FOIA compliance deadlines across federal agencies and by levying        penalties on agencies that miss deadlines to release documents sought by        the public under FOIA  Leahys statement is below  followed by a        section by section summary and analysis of the Restore FOIA Act             ________________   Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On Introduction Of The Restoration Of Freedom Of Information Act         Restore FOIA         March 15  2005 Mr  LEAHY  This week        marks the first national Sunshine Week  The centerpiece of this week is        Freedom of Information Day  which falls on March 16  the anniversary of        James Madisons birthday  A firm believer in the need for open and        accountable government  Madison said  A popular government  without        popular information  or the means of acquiring it  is but a prologue to a        farce or tragedy or perhaps both  Each generation of Americans should        heed James Madisons warning  and it is fitting and proper that todays        generations of Americans use this week to revisit the potentially damaging        limitations placed on access to government information in just the last few        years   The Freedom of Information        Act  FOIA  has been the centerpiece of open government for the 38 years        since it came into force in 1967  It enables citizens to obtain        information on how their government is protecting the Nation  spending        their tax dollars  and implementing the laws their officeholders enact         FOIA helps hold our government accountable  It was through FOIA requests        that the St  Petersburg Times uncovered information showing that        since the 1991 Gulf War  and due in part to lax security at military bases         thousands of pounds of weapons have been lost or stolen from U S         stockpiles  and some remains unaccounted for  The Bremerton Sun        newspaper in Washington State used FOIA to confirm the         mishandling of a nuclear missile at a Navy submarine facility  These are        examples of the day to day importance of FOIA in helping Americans        safeguard our security infrastructure  There are countless other examples        of FOIA enabling citizens to obtain information relating to health and        safety concerns in their cities and neighborhoods  In 2002  when I voted to        support passage of the Homeland Security Act  HSA   I voiced concerns about        several flaws in the legislation  I called for the Administration and my        colleagues on both sides of the aisle to monitor implementation of the new        law and to craft corrective legislation  One of my chief concerns with the        HSA was a subtitle of the act that granted an extraordinarily broad        exemption to FOIA in exchange for the cooperation of private companies in        sharing information with the government regarding vulnerabilities in the        nations critical infrastructure   Unfortunately  the law        that was enacted undermines Federal and State sunshine laws permitting the        American people to know what their government is doing  Rather than        increasing security by encouraging private sector disclosure to the        government  it guts FOIA at the expense of our national security and the        safety and health of the American people   Today  with my        distinguished colleagues Senators Levin  Feingold  and Lieberman I        reintroduce legislation to restore the integrity of FOIA  I thank my        colleagues for working with me on this important issue of public        oversight  We first offered this bill  which we call the Restoration of        Freedom of Information Act  or Restore FOIA  in the 108th Congress   Restore FOIA protects        Americans right to know while simultaneously providing security to those        in the private sector who voluntarily submit critical infrastructure        records to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    Encouraging cooperation        between the private sector and the government to keep our critical        infrastructure systems safe from terrorist attacks is a goal we all        support  But the appropriate way to meet this goal is a source of great        debate  a debate that has been all but ignored since the enactment of the        HSA   The FOIA Exemption In HSA The HSA created a new FOIA        exemption for critical infrastructure information  That broadly defined        term applies to information covering a wide variety of facilities  such as        privately operated power plants  bridges  dams  ports  or chemical plants         that might be targeted for a        terrorist attack  In HSA negotiations in 2002  House Republicans and the        Administration promoted language that they described as necessary to        encourage owners of such facilities to identify vulnerabilities in their        operations and share that information with DHS  The stated goal was to        ensure that steps could be taken to ensure the facilities protection and        proper functioning   In fact  such descriptions        of the legislation were disingenuous  These provisions  which were        eventually enacted in the HSA  shield from FOIA almost any voluntarily        submitted document stamped by the facility owner as critical        infrastructure  This is true no matter how tangential the content of that        document may be to the actual security of a facility  The law effectively        allows companies to hide information about         public health and safety from the American people  even from neighbors of        such a facility in its local community    simply by submitting it to DHS         The enacted provisions were called deeply flawed by Mark Tapscott of the        Heritage Foundation in a November 20  2002  Washington Post op ed         He argued that the loophole created by the law could be manipulated by        clever corporate and government operators to hide endless varieties of        potentially embarrassing and or criminal information from public view  In addition  under the HSA         disclosure by private facilities to DHS neither obligates the private        company to address the vulnerability  nor requires DHS to fix the problem         For example  in the case of a chemical spill  the law bars the government        from disclosing information without the written consent of the company that        caused the pollution  As the Washington Post pointed out in an        editorial on February 10  2003  A company might preempt environmental        regulators by voluntarily divulging incriminating material  thereby        making it unavailable to anyone else   The law also  1  shields        the companies from lawsuits to compel disclosure   2  criminalizes        otherwise legitimate whistleblower activity by DHS employees  and  3         preempts any state or local disclosure laws   Finally  the HSA requires        no reporting whatsoever to the Congress or the public on critical        infrastructure submissions to DHS  As a result  it is nearly impossible        for the public to learn whether this law is being followed in good faith         whether it is being manipulated by submitters  and whether DHS is        conducting due diligence on submissions  It also places hurdles before        those of us in Congress who believe in effective oversight  In an effort to obtain        some basic data on the treatment of critical infrastructure information        at DHS  two organizations filed a FOIA request in 2004  OMB Watch and the        Electronic Privacy Information Center sought public release of the number        of submissions and rejections under the law  and of any communications        between DHS and submitters  They also requested the Departments program        procedures for handling information  DHS did not provide answers  The        groups filed a complaint  and the D C  District Court ordered DHS to        respond  We learned that as of February 2005  the critical infrastructure        program received 29 submissions and rejected seven of those  We know        nothing of the substance of the accepted submissions  what vulnerabilities        they may describe  or what is being done to address them   Most        businesses are good citizens and take seriously their obligations to the        government and the public  but this disclose and immunize provision is        subject to abuse by those businesses that want to exploit legal        technicalities to avoid regulatory guidelines that are designed to protect        the publics health and safety  The HSA lays out the perfect blueprint to        avoid legal liability  funnel damaging information into this voluntary        disclosure system and preempt the government or others harmed by the        companys actions from being able to use it against the company  This is        not the kind of two way public private cooperation that serves the public        interest  The HSA FOIA exemption        goes so far in exempting such a large amount of material from FOIAs        disclosure requirements that it undermines government openness without        making any real gains in safety for families in Vermont and across        America  We do not keep America safer by chilling federal officials f        rom warning the public about threats to their health and safety  We do not        ensure our nations security by refusing to tell the American people        whether or not their federal agencies are doing their jobs  or whether        their government is spending their hard earned tax dollars wisely  We do        not encourage real cooperation by giving companies protection from civil        liability when they break the law  We do not respect the spirit of our        democracy when we cloak in secrecy the workings of our government from the        public we are elected to serve   The        Restore FOIA Act The Restore FOIA bill I        introduce today with Senators Levin  Feingold and Lieberman is identical to        language I negotiated with Senators Levin and Bennett in the summer of 2002        when the HSA charter was debated by the Governmental Affairs Committee         Senator Bennett stated in the Committees July 25  2002  markup that the        Administration had endorsed the compromise  He also said that industry        groups had reported to him that the compromise language would make it        possible for them to share information with the government without fear of        the information being released to competitors or to other agencies that        might accidentally reveal it  The Governmental Affairs Committee reported        out the compromise language that day  Unfortunately  much more restrictive        House language was eventually signed into law   The        Restore FOIA bill would correct the problems in the HSA in several ways         First  it limits the FOIA exemption to relevant records submitted by the        private sector  such that only those that actually pertain to critical        infrastructure safety are protected  Records is the standard category        referred to in FOIA  This corrects the effective free pass given to        regulated industries by the HSA for any information it labels critical        infrastructure         Second  unlike the HSA  the Restore FOIA bill allows for government        oversight  including the ability to use and share the records within and        between agencies  It does not limit the use of such information by the        government  except to prohibit public disclosure where such information is        appropriately exempted under FOIA          Third  it protects the actions of legitimate whistleblowers rather than        criminalizing their acts         Fourth  it does not provide civil immunity to companies that voluntarily        submit information  This corrects a flaw in the current law  which would        prohibit such information from being used directly in civil suits by        government or private parties          Fifth  unlike the HSA  the Restore FOIA bill allows local authorities to        apply their own sunshine laws  The Restore FOIA bill does not preempt any        state or local disclosure laws for information obtained outside the        Department of Homeland Security  It also does not restrict the use of such        information by state agencies          Finally  the Restore FOIA bill does not restrict congressional use or        disclosure of voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information                These changes to the HSA would accomplish the stated goals of the critical        infrastructure provisions in the HSA    without tying the hands of the        government in its efforts to protect Americans and without cutting the        public out of the loop  Restore FOIA is supported        by the American Library Association  Common Cause  the Freedom of        Information Center  OMB Watch  Association of Research Libraries  the        Project on Government Oversight  and OpenTheGovernment org  among other        leading open government organizations   The        argument over the scope of the FOIA and unilateral Executive power to        shield matters from public scrutiny goes to the heart of our fundamental        right to be an educated electorate aware of what our government is doing         The Rutland Herald got it right in a November 26  2002  editorial        that explained  The battle was not over the right of the government to        hold sensitive  classified information secret  The government has that        right  Rather  the battle was over whether the government would be        required to release anything it sought to withhold         We need to fix this troubling restriction on public accountability  James        Madisons warning is a clear warning to us  and it is our generations duty        to heed it  I urge my colleagues to support the Restoration of Freedom of        Information Act of 2005                   The Restoration of Freedom of        Information Act  Restore FOIA        Sectional Analysis Sec  1  Short title  This section gives the bill the        short title  the Restoration of Freedom of Information Act  Sec  2  Protection of Voluntarily Furnished        Confidential Information  This section strikes subtitle B  secs  211 215         of the Homeland Security Act  HSA  P L  107 296  and inserts a new        section 211   Sections to be repealed from the HSA  These        sections contain an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  that         1  exempt from disclosure critical infrastructure information voluntarily        submitted to the new department that was designated as confidential by the        submitter unless the submitter gave prior written consent   2  provide        civil immunity for use of such information in civil actions against the        company   3  preempt state sunshine laws if the designated information is        shared with state or local government agencies  and  4  impose criminal        penalties of up to one year imprisonment on government employees who        disclosed the designated information   Provisions that would        replace the repealed sections of the HSA  The Restore FOIA bill        inserts a new section 211 to the HSA that would exempt from the FOIA        certain records pertaining to critical infrastructure threats and        vulnerabilities that are furnished voluntarily to the new Department and        designated by the provider as confidential and not customarily made        available to the public  Notably  the Restore FOIA bill makes clear that        the exemption covers records from the private sector  not all        information provided by the private sector  as in the enacted version of        the HSA  The Restore FOIA bill ensures that portions of records that are        not covered by the exemption would be released pursuant to FOIA requests         It does not provide any civil liability immunity or preempt state or local        sunshine laws  and it does not criminalize whistleblower activity  Specifically  this section of the Restore FOIA bill        includes the following             A definition of critical infrastructure  This term is given        the meaning adopted in section 1016 e  the USA Patriot Act  42 U S C         5195c e   which reads  critical infrastructure means systems and assets         whether physical or virtual  so vital to United States that the incapacity        or destruction of such systems and assets would have a debilitating impact        on security  national economic security  national public health or safety         or any combination of those matters  This definition is commonly        understood to mean facilities such as bridges  dams  ports  nuclear power        plants  or chemical plants             A definition of the term furnished voluntarily  This term        signifies documents provided to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS         that are not formally required by the department and that are provided to        it to satisfy any legal requirement  The definition excludes any document        that is provided to DHS with a permit or grant application or to obtain any        other benefit from DHS  such as a loan  agency forbearance  or modification        of a penalty             An exemption from FOIA of records that pertain to vulnerabilities        of and threats to critical infrastructure that are furnished voluntarily to        DHS  This exemption is made available where the provider of the record        certifies that the information is confidential and would not customarily be        released to the public            A requirement that other government agencies that have obtained        such records from DHS withhold disclosure of the records and refer any FOIA        requests to DHS for processing             A requirement that reasonably segregable portions of requested        documents be disclosed  as is well established under FOIA            An allowance to agencies that obtain critical infrastructure        records from a source other than DHS to release requested records        consistent with FOIA  regardless of whether DHS has an identical record in        its possession            An allowance to providers of critical infrastructure records to        withdraw the confidentiality designation of records voluntarily submitted        to DHS  thereby making the records subject to disclosure under FOIA            A direction to the Secretary of Homeland Security to establish        procedures to receive  designate  store  and protect the confidentiality of        records voluntarily submitted and certified as critical infrastructure        records            A clarification that the bill would not preempt state or local        information disclosure laws            A requirement for the Comptroller General to report to the House        and Senate Judiciary Committees  the House Governmental Reform Committee        and the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee the        number of private entities and government agencies that submit records to        DHS under the terms of the bill  The report would also include the number        of requests for access to records that were granted or denied  Finally         the Comptroller General would make recommendations to the committees for        modifications or improvements to the collection and analysis of critical        infrastructure information   Sec  3  Technical and

Act                 Scope of FOIA Exemption     Creates a            FOIA exemption limited to records submitted by the private sector             not information from the private sector  Records  the

term information for the FOIA            exemption  which could include telephone calls  conversations  or            verbal answers  if the information is not required   This new and            untested category could create confusion and hinder governments            ability to manage information efficiently  s and hamper governments            ability to manage information efficiently                    Definition of Critical Infrastructure Information    Limits the            exemption to records pertaining to the vulnerability of and threats to            critical infrastructure  such as attacks  response and recovery            efforts                 Applies the exemption to the broader and more vague category of any            critical infrastructure information which could allow information not            directly related to vulnerabilities to inappropriately be protected                   Definition of Voluntarily Submitted     Defines voluntarily            narrowly to mean submissions in the            absence of legal authority  This means that the information            falls outside current regulatory authority and that the government            could not obtain the records except by voluntary submission                   Defines voluntarily broadly to mean submissions in the absence of the           exercise of legal            authority  This implies that legal authority to require the documents            may exist but is not currently being exercised  yet the companies may            be credited as voluntarily submitting the information  Information and            details that agencies do not nt currently requestask for but easily            maycould be submitted and protected before regulators have the            opportunity to

only partially contain critical            infrastructure information                    Government Use of Information               Sets no limits or restrictions on the governments use and sharing of            the records within the government  The only restriction upon            government agencies is the record cannot be disclosed to the public                 Significantly limits the governments ability to act upon the            information received by prohibiting any use or disclosure  even to            other federal agencies  of the information except for purposes stated            in the Act                    State  Local Disclosure laws     Does not preempt any            state or local disclosure laws for information obtained outside the            Department of

          same document is also submitted to the DHS      Wording allows for            the provision to be interpreted more broadly and maypotentially allow            the exemption to apply to
