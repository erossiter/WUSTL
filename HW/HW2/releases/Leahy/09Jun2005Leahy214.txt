       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nominations Richard Griffin   And David McKeague To The United States Court Of Appeals For The Sixth Circuit                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick     Leahy On The Nominations Of      Richard Griffin And David McKeague     To The United States Court Of Appeals For The      Sixth Circuit June 9  2005  As we debate the nominations of      Richard Griffin and David McKeague to the Sixth Circuit Court of      Appeals  and move on to their almost certain confirmation  I believe      we must acknowledge the cooperation and statesmanship of the two      Senators from Michigan  who have compromised a great deal in order      to contribute to the preservation of the rules and traditions of the      United States Senate  Senator Levin and Senator Stabenow have spent      much of the last four years trying to persuade the President to      fulfill his constitutional duty and consult with them on his  Michigan appointments  to no      avail  Because of that lack of cooperation  combined with the      shameful treatment given to President Clintons nominees  the      Michigan Senators exercised their right as home state Senators to      withhold their consent to the nominations of candidates chosen      without consultation to the Sixth Circuit    The Michigan Senators had the support      of other Senators  Nonetheless  the Michigan Senators  with grace      and dedication to this institution  withdrew their opposition to      three of those nominees as part of the discussions related to      averting the nuclear option  Because of their willingness to go      forward we are here today debating and voting upon the confirmation      of two nominees to the Sixth Circuit despite a lack of consultation      by President Bush and a complete disregard for the history of this      court    First  it is essential to explain what      a significant break with precedent it was that these two nominees      were even given a hearing in the last Congress without the support      of either of their home state Senators  The scheduling of that      hearing was another example of the downward spiral the Committee      traveled over the last two years  when we witnessed rule after rule      broken or misinterpreted away   The list is long  From the way that      home state Senators were treated to the way hearings were scheduled       to the way the Committee questionnaire was altered  to the way our      Committees historic protection of the minority by Committee Rule IV      was violated  the Republican leadership on the Committee last      Congress destroyed virtually every custom and courtesy that had been      available to help create and enforce cooperation and civility in the      confirmation process    The then Chairman of the Committee      crossed a critical line that he had never before crossed when in      June of 2003  he held a hearing for Henry Saad  another of the      Michigan nominees to the Sixth Circuit  opposed by both of his      home state Senators  It may have been the first time any Chairman      and any Senate Judiciary Committee proceeded with a hearing on a      judicial nominee over the objection of both home state Senators  It      was certainly the only time in the last 50 years  and I know it to      be the only time during my 31 years in the Senate     Having broken a longstanding practice      of the Judiciary Committee founded on respect for home state      Senators  whether in the case of a district or circuit court      nominee  the Committees leadership did not hesitate to break it      again and hold a hearing for Richard Griffin and David McKeague        The Michigan Senators did not do what      so many other Senators did when holding up more than 60 of President      Clintons nominees  and block them silently  To the contrary  they      came to the Committee and articulated their very real grievances      with the White House and their honest desire to work towards a      bipartisan solution to the problems filling vacancies in the Sixth      Circuit  We should have respected their views  as the views of      home state Senators have been respected for decades  I urged the      White House to work with them  I proposed reasonable solutions to      the impasse that the White House rejected  The Michigan Senators      proposed reasonable solutions  including a bipartisan commission       but the White House rejected every one    Although President Bush promised on      the campaign trail to be a uniter and not a divider  his practice      once in office with respect to judicial nominees has been most      divisive  Citing the remarks of a White House official       The  Lansing State      Journal reported that      President Bush was simply not interested in compromise on the      existing vacancies in the State of Michigan  It is unfortunate that      the White House was never willing to work toward consensus with all      Senators and on all courts  Over the last four years  time and      again the good faith efforts of Senate Democrats to repair the      damage done to the judicial confirmation process over the previous      six years were rejected  And time and again  the rules were thrown      by the wayside    Blue Slip Rules      Abandoned for a Republican President  When Republicans chaired the Judiciary      Committee and we were considering the nominations of a Democratic      President  one negative blue slip from just one home state Senator      was enough to doom a nomination and prevent a hearing on that      nomination  This included all nominations  including those to the      circuit courts  How else to explain the failure to schedule      hearings for such qualified and non controversial nominees as James      Beaty and James Wynn  African American nominees from  North Carolina  What other reason      could plausibly be found for what happened to the nominations of      Enrique Moreno and Jorge Rangel    both Latino  both Harvard      graduates  both highly rated by the ABA  and both denied hearings in      the Judiciary Committee  There is no denying that was the rule      during the previous Democratic Administration  There is no way      around the conclusion that with a Republican in the White House  the      Republicans in the Senate have found it politically expedient to      change the rules and reverse their own practices time and again    In all  more than 60 of President      Clintons judicial nominees and more than 200 of his Executive      branch nominees were defeated in Senate committees through the      enforcement of rules and precedents that the Republican majority      later found inconvenient    now that there is a Republican in the      White House  Indeed  among the more than 60  Clinton judicial nominees who the      Committee never considered there were more than a few who were      blocked despite positive blue slips from both home state Senators       So long as a Republican Senator had an objection  it appeared to be      honored  whether that was Senator Helms of North Carolina objecting      to an African American nominee from Virginia or Senator Gorton of      Washington objecting to nominees from California   During the last Congress  the      Judiciary Committee also took the unprecedented action of proceeding      to a hearing on the nomination of Carolyn Kuhl to the Ninth Circuit      over the objection of Senator Boxer  When the senior Senator from     California announced her      opposition to the nomination as well at the beginning of a Judiciary      Committee business meeting  I suggested to the Chairman that further      proceedings on that nomination ought to be carefully considered  I      noted that he had never proceeded on a nomination opposed by both      home state Senators once their opposition was known  Senator      Feinstein likewise reminded the then Chairman of his statements in      connection with the nomination of Ronnie White when he acknowledged      that had he known both home state Senators were opposed  he would      never have proceeded  Nonetheless  in one in a continuing series of      changes of practice and position  the Committee was required to      proceed with the Kuhl nomination  a party line vote was the result        With the Saad nomination  the      Committee made a further profound change in its practices  When a      Democratic President was doing the nominating and Republican      Senators were objecting  a single objection from a single home state      Senator stalled the nomination  There was not a single example of a      single time that the Committee went forward with a hearing over the      objection or negative blue slip of a single Republican home state      Senator during the      Clinton administration  But once a Republican President was doing      the nominating  no amount of objecting by Democratic Senators was      sufficient  The Committee overrode the objection of one home state      Senator with the Kuhl nomination  The Committee overrode the      objection of both home state Senators when a hearing and a vote was      held on the Saad nomination  and once more by holding a hearing and      vote for the two circuit court nominees we are discussing today         The Sixth Circuit      Fared Better Under Chairman Leahy  I know it is frustrating that there      have been unfilled vacancies on the Sixth Circuit for so long  Many      of us experienced worse frustration during the  Clinton years when good nominees were      held up for no discernable reason    other than politics  During      President Clintons second term  the Republican Senate majority shut      down the process of confirmations to the Sixth Circuit entirely  and      three outstanding nominees were not accorded hearings  Committee      consideration or Senate votes  In fact  while there were numbers of      vacancies on the Sixth Circuit and nominees for those vacancies       from November of 1997 there was not a confirmation to that court      until the confirmation of Julia Smith Gibbons while I was Chairman      on July 29  2002  a span of nearly five years  Not a single Sixth      Circuit nominee was even given a hearing during Republican control      of the 106th Congress  and one of the nominees  Kent      Marcus from Ohio  testified at a Judiciary Subcommittee hearing in      2002 that he was told that he would not be confirmed despite public      support from his home state Senators  Republicans wanted to keep      the vacancies in case a Republican was elected President   When I chaired the Committee  we broke      that impasse with the first Sixth Circuit confirmation in those many      years  I scheduled a hearing and a vote for Julia Smith Gibbons of      Tennessee  who was confirmed shortly thereafter  and I did the same      for John Rogers of      Kentucky  who was confirmed in November of 2002    I know that around the time a      Republican leadership staffer was found to have stolen confidential      Democratic files there were outrageous accusations made that Judge      Gibbons confirmation was delayed to affect a pending affirmative      action case in some way  I have never considered the outcome of any      particular case when scheduling that or any other nominee for a      hearing    The facts of this nomination belie      this scurrilous accusation  Judge Gibbons was nominated to the 6th      Circuit in October 2001 but did not have a completed file until      November 15th  shortly before the end of the first session of the      107th Congress  Before her paperwork was complete  the      Sixth Circuit panel assigned to the affirmative action cases had      already circulated a request for the full court to hear argument       and on November 16th  the 6th Circuit ordered that the case to be      argued to the full court  The oral argument in that case took place      after Thanksgiving  on December 6th    Given the lateness of her nomination       her paperwork  and the year  Gibbons could not realistically have      expected a hearing  a committee vote and a confirmation vote to all      have taken place in the three weeks between the time her paperwork      was complete and the time the 6th Circuit sat for the oral argument      in that case and took a poll about the outcome of that case  The      ordinary practice is that only the judges who are on the court at      the time the court votes to hear the case    Aen      banc       can participate in the case  even if they retire  It is just      unreasonable to contend that Judge Gibbons could have heard the      December 6th argument in that case    When we returned for the second      session of the 107th Congress  I scheduled several      hearings at the request of a number of different Republican      Senators  The first circuit court nominee to get a hearing was      Michael Melloy for the 8th Circuit at Senator Grassley s      request  followed by Judge Pickering  who was supported by Senator      Lott  then Judge D  Brooks Smith  for the 3rd Circuit  at Senator      Specter s      request  then Terrence O Brien       for the 8th Circuit  at the request of Senators Thomas and Enzi  and      Jeffrey Howard  for the 1st Circuit  who was supported by Senator      Bob Smith    Once those hearings were completed  in      the week of April 15  I scheduled a hearing for Judge Gibbons  Her      hearing was held on April 25th  I listed her for a      Committee vote the very next week  and all of the Democratic      Senators joined in voting her out the same day  May 2nd  She did      not get an immediate floor vote due to a dispute between the White      House and Senators over commissions  but she was ultimately      confirmed on July 29       2002    The 6th Circuit issued its decision in      the Michigan affirmative      action case on May 14  2002  which means the judges were already      working on the majority and dissenting opinions for weeks  likely      even months  given the complexity of the case  The Supreme Court       where I think we all knew the issue would finally be decided       accepted the appeal of the affirmative action decision later that      year and issued its ruling on June 23  2003    To say that Democrats used their power      to influence the Sixth Circuit in any case is demonstrably false       What is factually true is that from the time the case against the     University of Michigan      case was filed in District Court until the time I facilitated the      confirmation of Judge Gibbons  Republicans had successfully blocked      any and all appointees to that Circuit    Even after the 107th      Congress  Democrats continued to cooperate in filling seats on the      Sixth Circuit  Although many of us strongly opposed their      nominations  we did not block the confirmations of two more      controversial judges to that court  Deborah Cook and Jeffrey      Sutton  With their confirmations  that brought us to a total of      four Sixth Circuit confirmations in three years as opposed to no      confirmation in the last three years of the Clinton Administration       We cut Sixth Circuit vacancies in half  With cooperation from the      White House  we could have done even better    The Republican Senate majority refused      for over four years to consider President Clintons well qualified      nominee  Helene White  to the Sixth Circuit  Judge White has served      on the Michigan Court of Appeals with Judge Griffin since 1993  and       prior to her successful election to that seat  served for nearly 10      years as a trial judge  handling a wide range of civil and criminal      cases  She was first nominated by President Clinton in January      1997  but the Republican led Senate refused to act on her      nomination  She waited in vain for 1 454 days for a hearing  before      President Bush withdrew her nomination in March 2001  It stands in      contrast to the recent mantra from Republicans that every judicial      nominee is entitled to an up or down vote    President Clinton had also nominated      Kathleen McCree Lewis  She is the daughter of a former Solicitor      General of the United      States and a former Sixth Circuit Judge  She was also passed over      for hearings for years  No effort was made to accord her      consideration in the last 18 months of President Clintons term       The Republican double standard denied her the treatment they now      demand for every Bush nominee    Despite the flawed process that      brought us here  the Michigan Senators understood that in recent      weeks we found ourselves on the brink of a terrible moment in the      United States Senate when the Majority Leader would break the rules      to change the rules in order to achieve the Presidents goal of      packing the courts  They understood the extreme tactics of the      Republican majority  I applaud their sacrifice  and hope that the      President was listening to the 14 other Senators who expressly asked      him in their memorandum or understanding on nominations to engage in      real consultation with home state Senators  That is sound advice   In deference to the Michigan Senators       I will no longer oppose these confirmations  Still  there are      issues related to their records and views that trouble me  I hope      that they will be able to put any ideologies or preconceptions aside      and rule fairly in all cases    Richard Griffin       As a judge on the Michigan Court of      Appeals since 1989  Judge Griffin has handled and written hundreds      of opinions involving a range of civil and criminal law issues       Yet  a review of Judge Griffins cases on the Michigan Court of      Appeals raises concerns  He has not been shy about interjecting his      own personal views into some of his opinions  indicating that he may      use the opportunity  once confirmed  to further his own agenda when      confronted with cases of first impression    For example  in one troubling case      involving the Americans with Disabilities Act  ADA   Doe v   Mich  Dept of      Corrections  Judge Griffin      followed precedent and allowed the State disability claim of      disabled prisoners to proceed  but wrote that  if precedent had      allowed  he would have dismissed those claims  Griffin authored the      opinion in this class action brought by current and former prisoners      who alleged that the Michigan Department of Corrections denied them      certain benefits on the basis of their HIV positive status       Although Judge Griffin held that the plaintiffs had stated a claim      for relief  his opinion makes clear that he only ruled this way      because he was bound to follow the precedent established in a recent      case decided by his Court  Moreover  he went on to urge Congress to      invalidate a unanimous Supreme Court decision  written by Justice      Scalia  holding that the ADA applies to State prisoners and prisons       He wrote  While we follow Yeskey  we urge Congress to amend the ADA      to exclude prisoners from the class of persons entitled to      protection under the act    In other cases  he has also      articulated personal preferences that favor a narrow reading of the      law  which would limit individual rights and protections  For      example  in Wohlert Special Products v  Mich  Employment Security      Commn  he reversed the decision of the Michigan Employment      Security Commission and held that striking employees were not      entitled to unemployment benefits  The Michigan Supreme Court      vacated part of Judge Griffins decision  noting that he had      inappropriately made his own findings of fact when ruling that the      employees were not entitled to benefits  This case raises concerns      about Judge Griffins willingness to distort precedent to reach the      results he favors    In several other cases  Judge Griffin      has gone out of his way to interject his conservative personal views      into his opinions  The appeals courts are the courts of last resort      in over 99 percent of all federal cases and often decide cases of      first impression  If confirmed  Judge Griffin will have much      greater latitude to be a conservative judicial activist   It is ironic that Judge Griffins      father who  as Senator in 1968  launched the first filibuster of a      Supreme Court nominee and blocked the nomination of Justice Abe      Fortas to serve as Chief Justice  Despite the deference given in      those days to the Presidents selected nominee  former Senator      Griffin led a core group of Republican Senators in derailing      President Johnsons nomination by filibustering for days       Eventually  Justice Fortas withdrew his nomination  I know that the      Republicans here have called filibusters of federal judges      unconstitutional and unprecedented  but this nominees father      actually set the modern precedent for blocking nominees by      filibuster on the Senate floor     David McKeague       The second of the two nominees before      us today is David McKeague  His record raises some concerns  and      his answers to my written questions on some of these issues did      little or nothing to assuage them    In particular  I am concerned about      Judge McKeagues decisions in a series of cases on environmental      issues  In Northwoods Wilderness Recovery v       United States Forest Serv        323 F 3d 405  6th Cir  2003   Judge McKeague would have allowed the      U S  Forest Service to commence a harvesting project that allowed      selective logging and clear cutting in areas of Michigans Upper      Peninsula  The appellate court reversed him and found that the      Forest Service had not adhered to a statutorily mandated      environmental analysis prior to approval of the project  which was      dubbed Rolling Thunder    Sitting by designation on the Sixth      Circuit  Judge McKeague joined in an opinion that permitted the      Tennessee Valley Authority  TVA  broadly to interpret a clause of      the National Environmental Policy Act in a way that would allow the      TVA to conduct large scale timber harvesting operations without      performing site specific environmental assessments   Help Alert Western Ky   Inc  v  Te      nn  Valley Authority  1999      U S  App  LEXIS 23759  6th Cir  1999   The majority decision in      this case permitted the TVA to determine that logging operations      that covered 2 147 acres of land were minor  and thus fell under a      categorical exclusion to the environmental impact statement      requirement  The dissent in this case noted that the exclusion in      the past had applied only to truly minor activities  such as the      purchase or lease of transmission lines  construction of visitor      reception centers and on site research    Judge McKeague also dismissed a suit      brought by the Michigan Natural Resources Commission against the      Manufacturers National Bank of  Detroit  finding that the bank was not      liable for the costs of environmental cleanup at sites owned by a      troubled borrower  See Kelley ex rel  Mich  Natural Resources Comm n v       Tiscornia   810 F  Supp  901  W D  Mich  1993   The bank took      over the property from Auto Specialties Manufacturing Company when      it defaulted on its loans  The Natural Resources Commission argued      that the bank should be responsible for taking over the cost of      cleanup because it held the property when the toxic spill occurred       but Judge McKeague disagreed    In  Miron v  Menominee County       795 F  Supp  840  W D  Mich  1992   Judge McKeague rejected the      efforts of a citizen who lived close to a landfill to require the      Federal Aviation Administration to enjoin landfill cleanup efforts      until an environmental impact statement regarding the efforts could      be prepared  The citizen contended that if the statement were      prepared  the inadequacies of a state sponsored cleanup would be      revealed and appropriate corrective measures would be undertaken to      minimize further environmental contamination and wetlands      destruction  Holding that the alleged environmental injuries were      remote and speculative  Judge McKeague denied the requested      injunctive relief    In Pape v       U S  Army Corps of Engineers       1998 U S  Dist  LEXIS 9253  W D  Mich    Judge McKeague seems to      have ignored relevant facts in order to prevent citizen enforcement      of environmental protections  Dale Pape  a private citizen and      wildlife photographer  sued the U S  Corps of Army Engineers under      the federal Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976  RCRA        alleging that the Corps mishandled hazardous waste in violation of      RCRA  destroying wildlife in a park near the site  Despite the      Supreme Courts holding in Lujan v  Defenders of Wildlife      that the desire to use or observe an animal species  even for      purely esthetic purposes  is undeniably a cognizable interest for      purpose of standing  and even though RCRA specifically conferred      the right for citizen suits against the government for failure to      implement orders or to protect the environment or health and safety       Judge McKeague dismissed the case  holding that plaintiff lacked      standing to sue   Judge McKeague found plaintiffs      complaint insufficient on several grounds  in particular plaintiffs      inability to establish which site specifically he would visit in the      future  Plaintiff had stated in his complaint that he has visited      the area around the RACO site at least five times per year and      that he has made plans to vacation in Soliders Park located near      the RACO site in early October 1998  where he plans to spend his      time fishing  canoeing  and photographing the area  Comparing      Papes testimony with that of the Lujan plaintiff  who had      failed to win standing after he presented general facts about prior      visits and an intent to visit in the future  Judge McKeague rejected      Papes complaint as too speculative  based on the Courts holding in     Lujan that         Plaintiffs  profession of an intent to return to the places       plaintiffs  had visited before  where they will  presumably  this      time  be deprived of the opportunity to observe animals of the      endangered species  is simply not enough to establish standing       Such some day intentions  without any description of concrete      plans  or indeed  even any specification of when the some day will      be  do not support a finding of the actual or imminent injury      that our cases require   In concluding that the allegations      contained in plaintiffs first amended complaint fail to establish      an actual injury because they do not include an allegation that      plaintiff has specific plans to use the allegedly affected area in      the future  Judge McKeague seemed to ignore completely the detailed      fact description that Pape submitted in his amendment complaint       The judge further asserted that there was no causal connection      between the injury and the activity complained of  and that  in any      case  the alleged injury was not redressable by the suit     On another important topic  that of      the scheme of enforcing the civil and constitutional rights of      institutionalized persons  I am concerned about one of Judge      McKeagues decisions  In 1994   United      States v  Michigan  868 F       Supp  890  W D  Mi  1994    he refused to allow the Department of      Justice access to Michigan prisons in the course of its      investigation into some now notorious claims of sexual abuse of      women prisoners by guards undermines the long established system      under the Constitutional Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act or      CRIPA  That Acts investigative and enforcement regime is      unworkable if the Department of Justice is denied access to State      prisons to determine if enough evidence exists to file suit  and      Judge McKeagues tortured reasoning made it impossible for the      investigation to continue in his district    I know that concern for the rights of      prisoners who have often committed horrendous criminal acts is not      politically popular  but Congress enacted the law and expected its      statute and its clear intent to be followed  It seems to me that      Judge McKeague disregarded legislative history and the clear intent      of the law  and that sort of judging is of concern to me     Finally  I must express my profound      disappointment in his answer to a question I sent him about a      presentation he made in the Fall of 2000  when he made what I judged      to be inappropriate and insensitive comments about the health and      well being of sitting Supreme Court Justices  In a speech to a law      school audience about the impact of the 2000 elections on the      courts  Judge McKeague discussed the possibility of vacancies on the      Court over the following year  In doing so he felt it necessary to      not only refer to    but to make a chart of    the Justices      particular health problems  and ghoulishly focus on their life      expectancy by highlighting their ages  He says he does not believe      he was disrespectful  and used only public information  There were      other  better ways he could have made the same point  and it is too      bad he still cannot see that    Conclusion  Under our Constitution  the Senate has      an important role in the selection of our judiciary  The brilliant      design of our Founders established that the first two branches of      government would work together to equip the third branch to serve as      an independent arbiter of justice  As columnist George Will once      wrote  A proper constitution distributes power among legislative       executive and judicial institutions so that the will of the majority      can be measured  expressed in policy and  for the protection of      minorities  somewhat limited  The structure of our Constitution      and our own Senate rules of self governance are designed to protect      minority rights and to encourage consensus  Despite the razor thin      margin of recent elections  the majority party has never acted in a      measured way but in complete disregard for the traditions of      bipartisanship that are the hallmark of the Senate  It acted to      ignore precedents and reinterpret longstanding rules to its      advantage  but fortunately its attempt to eliminate the voice of the      minority entirely failed because of the efforts of well meaning and      fair minded Senators  Two more well meaning and fair minded      Senators did their part to save the Senate by clearing the way for      the confirmation of the two nominees today  I hope that despite the      concerns I have expressed and others that may emerge during this      debate  once confirmed Judge Griffin and Judge McKeague will fulfill      their oath and provide fair and impartial justice to all who come      before them
