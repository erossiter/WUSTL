       Opening Statement Of Sen  Leahy  Executive Business Meeting  November 1    2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt          Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   Executive Business Meeting  November 1  2007            Yesterday  as Senators were considering the answers to their      questions for Michael Mukasey  I announced a special markup for next      Tuesday to consider that nomination  This is in addition to our      already heavy workload of hearings  and our regular  weekly business      meeting on Thursday next week  I apologize to the Members for      imposing this additional burden during a very busy time for all      Senators  I thank all Members for their cooperation              My hope is that by scheduling the consideration for next Tuesday       Senators will have an opportunity to consider the recently received      written responses from the nominee and will be prepared to debate      the nomination and vote   The White House called after I announced      the markup to thank the Committee for scheduling the matter as we      did              We had an important hearing yesterday and have     limited time to focus on proposals to      amend the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA  during the      next several days  I commend the Senators who participated      yesterday in what was a good hearing  and especially thank Senator      Feinstein for sharing the responsibility for chairing  It is my      hope that working together  we can be prepared to turn our attention      to that matter next Thursday      To do all this  we need to make progress      on the agenda we have before us this week  We have other important      executive nominations  a circuit court nomination  corruption      legislation  cybercrime legislation  human rights legislation  and      courts legislation  which Senators have been working on in a      bipartisan way for a long time  on todays agenda  It is a full      agenda  I hope we can make progress on it and clear the decks so      that next week we can turn to the Mukasey nomination and the FISA      legislation    This morning the Committee has another opportunity to      consider the bipartisan Public Corruption Prosecution Improvements      Act of 2007  Senator Cornyn and I introduced this bill to      strengthen and clarify key aspects of federal criminal law and      provide new tools to help law enforcement combat public corruption      nationwide  I thank Senator Sessions for working with us and      cosponsoring this legislation  I include in the record the letter      of support from the Department of Justice and a letter of support      from a number of public interest organizations including the      Campaign Legal Center  Common Cause  Democracy 21  the League of      Women Voters  Public Citizen  and U S  PIRG       We have circulated a substitute that incorporates some formatting      changes suggested by the Department of Justice and a clarification      inspired by Senator Specter  to make clear that accepting a token      item like a baseball cap in compliance with Senate Rules is not a      criminal violation  I also double checked to be sure that nothing      in this bill makes campaign contributions into gratuities          Congress took an important step in restoring Americans faith in      their elected officials earlier this year by passing long awaited      ethics and lobbying reforms  But rooting out the kinds of rampant      public corruption we have seen in recent years requires us to go      further  and to give law enforcement the resources it needs to      effectively investigate and prosecute public corruption crimes       Congress must send a strong signal that it will not tolerate      corruption and provide better tools for federal investigators and      prosecutors to combat it  Our bill will do exactly that        It gives investigators and prosecutors more time and resources to      effectively enforce existing anti corruption laws        The bill extends the statute of limitations for the most serious      public corruption offenses         It would also provide significant and much needed additional funding      for public corruption enforcement        The bill goes further by amending several key statutes to broaden      their application in corruption and fraud contexts  This series of      fixes will prevent corrupt public officials and their accomplices      from evading or defeating prosecution  And it raises the statutory      maximum penalties for several statutes dealing with official      misconduct  including theft of government property and bribery         If we are serious about addressing the kinds of egregious misconduct      that we have recently witnessed in high profile public corruption      cases  Congress must enact meaningful legislation to give      investigators and prosecutors the tools and resources they need to      enforce our laws  I hope all Members will join Senator Cornyn       Senator Sessions  and me in supporting this bill so that the      Committee can promptly report it to the Senate            We also have an important cybercrime bill on the agenda that is      sponsored by Senators Specter  Durbin  Grassley  Biden  Hatch       Schumer and me  This bill also has the endorsement of the      Department of Justice  We have an amendment that has been circulated      and has bipartisan support  I hope we can report that bill today         I understand that there will be a request to hold over the      Grassley Schumer Sunshine in the Courtroom Act and a request to hold      over the Durbin  Coburn  Feingold Brownback bill to try to work      something out with Senator Kyl  That bill grows out of a hearing      Senator Durbin held earlier this year in the Human Rights      Subcommittee  It would make forcing children to serve in a military      role a crime and creates extraterritorial jurisdiction to combat it
