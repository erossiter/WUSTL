PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  March 6   The Senate Judiciary Committee heard      testimony Tuesday from four U S  Attorneys who had been asked by the      Department of Justice to resign their posts  The Committee has been      looking into the matter since revelations of the mass firings came      to light earlier this year         United States Attorneys around the country are the chief federal      law enforcement officers in their States  They are the face of      federal law enforcement and have enormous responsibility for      implementing anti terrorism efforts  bringing important and often      difficult cases  and taking the lead to fight public corruption       said Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Chairman of the Committee  It      is vital that those holding these critical positions be free from      any inappropriate influence   Below      is Chairman Leahys statement  as prepared  from the hearing     Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing Before The Senate Judiciary Committee     Part II   Preserving Prosecutorial Independence  Is The Department      Of Justice Politicizing The Hiring And Firing Of U S  Attorneys      March 6  2007           We have learned over the last few months of actions by this      Administration that threaten to undermine the effectiveness and      professionalism of U S  Attorneys offices around the country  Not      since the Saturday Night Massacre  when President Nixon forced the      firing of the Watergate prosecutor Archibald Cox  have we witnessed      anything of this magnitude  The calls to a number of U S  Attorneys      across the country last December  by which they were forced to      resign  were extraordinary  What is more disconcerting is that       unlike during Watergate  there was no Elliot Richardson or William      Ruckelshaus seeking to defend the independence of federal      prosecutors  Instead  the Attorney General  the Deputy Attorney      General  the Executive Office of U S  Attorneys and the White House      all collaborated in these actions   United States Attorneys around the      country are the chief federal law enforcement officers in their      States  They are the face of federal law enforcement and have      enormous responsibility for implementing anti terrorism efforts       bringing important and often difficult cases  and taking the lead to      fight public corruption  It is vital that those holding these      critical positions be free from any inappropriate influence  Their      importance is reflected in the fact that these appointments have      traditionally  and are currently  subject to Senate confirmation        Sadly  what we have heard from the      Administration has been a series of shifting explanations and      excuses  This lack of accountability or acknowledgement of the      seriousness of this matter makes it all the more troubling     The Attorney Generals initial      response at our January 18th hearing when we asked about      these matters was to brush aside any suggestion that politics and      interference with ongoing corruption investigations were factors in      the mass firings  Now we know that these factors did play a role in      these matters    The question now arises  where is the      accountability  For six years accountability has been lacking in      this Administration  Loyalty to the President is rewarded over all      else  That lack of accountability  and lack of the checks and      balances that foster it  must end  We do not need another      commendation for the heckuva job done by those who have failed in      their essential duties to the American people   Defense Secretary Gates finally      pointed the way last week  Those in charge of the scandalous      conditions at Walter Reed Medical Center are gone  as is the      Secretary of the Army in charge  Where is the accountability for      the scandalous actions by the Justice Department  That is the      question this Committee is ultimately asking and to which the      American people are entitled to an answer  The women and men      replaced and whose reputations were stained by those seeking to      justify these firings as performance related were appointees of      President Bush  Several had significant achievements in office and      glowing performance reviews  While effective prosecutors  were they      simply too independent for this Administration  What were the real      motivations for their firings  Who within the Administration were      the moving forces and who were involved         This Administration has been creating these vacancies by removing      U S  Attorneys as it chooses on a timeline it dictates  It cannot      now claim that there simply was not the time to work with home state      Senators to identify replacement  Why were home state Senators not      consulted in advance  I would note that every one of the U S       Attorneys who was asked to resign was someone chosen by this      Administration  nominated by this President  approved by the home      state Senators and confirmed by the Senate  This is thus entirely a      problem of the Administrations imagination and choosing     We can fix the statutory excess that      opened the door to these untoward actions  During the Patriot Act      Reauthorization last year  appropriate curbs on the authority of the      Attorney General to appoint interim United States Attorneys to fill      a vacancy temporarily were removed  The change to the law removed      the 120 day limit for such appointments and removed the district      courts role in making any subsequent interim appoints  This change      in law  accomplished over my objection  allowed the Attorney General      for the first time to make so called interim appointments that could      last indefinitely    This Committee has reported a bill to      the Senate to reverse that mistake  Senator Feinstein  Senator      Specter  Senator Schumer and I have all cosponsored the bill to      restore the statutory checks  Regrettably  Republican objections      have prevented Senate consideration of S 214 and prevented its      consideration as an amendment to S 4  I urge all Senators to join      with us to correct the statutory authority  Yet fixing the law will      not undo the damage done to the American peoples confidence in      federal law enforcement    I thank Senator Schumer for chairing      this hearing  the second one this Committee has had on this matter      in the past month  I thank the witnesses for their willingness to      come here today and help us get to the truth
