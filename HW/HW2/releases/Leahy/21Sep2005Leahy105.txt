       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Judge John   Roberts To Be Chief Justice Of The United States                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of Judge John Roberts     To Be Chief Justice Of The United States     Senate Floor     September 21  2005 This week  as we      celebrate our Constitutions 218th anniversary  we are      nearing the exercise of one of the Senates most solemn      constitutional responsibilities  Few decisions the Senate faces are      as consequential and enduring as when the Senate decides whether to      confirm  by giving its consent  to the nomination of a Justice  and      even more so when the nomination is for Chief Justice of the United      States   The Supreme Court      is different from the lower courts  The Supreme Court is the only      federal court required by the Constitution itself  Indeed  the      Chief Justice is the only member of the court expressly named in the      Constitution  All other courts are bound by the decisions of the      Supreme Court    its decisions are final  Only the Supreme Court      can modify or overrule its precedents  Its power is enormous and      the role of the Chief Justice is to lead not only that all powerful      court  but the entire third branch of government  We have had 43      Presidents  We have had only 16 Chief Justices  each being      appointed for life   Senator Byrd       whose passionate advocacy established the Constitution Day      commemoration  describes the Constitution as the soul of our      Nation  The Senates advice and consent responsibilities are at the      core of this bodys vital role in our Republic  This week we      commemorate our Constitution in a time of great challenges  and we      are reminded again how resilient our Constitution is in empowering      our Nation to meet each eras challenges  The carefully calibrated      checks and balances within our Constitution are essential to that       No branch of government is intended to be the rubber stamp of      another branch   Each day      Americans are fighting and dying in Iraq  Hundreds of thousands of      Americans have been displaced by disasters here at home  Four years      after 9 11  with public confidence shattered  we must embark on a      review of why we are still not prepared to respond to a terrorist      attack or foreseen natural disasters  The cost of energy    gas and      home heating fuels  continues to climb to all time highs  adding to      the cost of most other goods  The Bush Administration is suspending      environmental and worker protections  Poverty and the disparities      of opportunity between races and classes continue their insidious      rise each year  After recent years of budget surpluses  the      countrys budget deficits are at previously unheard of levels         between  300 billion and  400 billion a year  Our natural debt is      at  8 trillion dollars  a profligate amount that can be paid off      only by our children and grandchildren  Americans need to      know that their constitutional rights will be protected  that their      government is on their side and that their courts will be a place of      refuge  stability  independence and justice  The nomination of      Judge John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States presents      a close question and one that each Senator must carefully weigh and      decide  This is a question that holds serious consequences for all      Americans  today and for generations to come  I have approached      this nomination with an open mind  as I do with all judicial      nominations   There is no      entitlement to confirmation for lifetime appointments on any court      for any nomination by a president  Democratic or Republican    I have served in      the Senate for three decades and on the Judiciary Committee for most      of that time  I take my constitutional responsibility with respect      to advice and consent seriously  I am one vote out of 100  but I      recognize that those 100 of us privileged to serve in the Senate are      entrusted with protecting the rights of 280 million of our fellow      citizens  We stand in their shoes  We  and the President  are the      only Americans with a voice in the choice of Chief Justice  With this vote  I      do not intend to lend my support to an effort by this President to      move the Supreme Court and the law radically to the right  Above      all  balance and moderation on the Court are crucial  I want all      Americans to know that the Supreme Court will protect their rights      and will respect the authority of Congress to act in their      interest   I want a Supreme      Court that acts in its finest tradition as a source of justice  The      Supreme Court must be an institution where the Bill of Rights and      human dignity are honored   I have voted for      the vast majority of President Fords  President Carters  President      Reagans  President George H W  Bushs  President Clintons  and      President George W  Bushs judicial nominees   I have drawn the      line only at those of President Bushs nominees who were among the      most ideologically extreme and who came to us in the mold of      activists  Unfortunately  the President has opted not to seek      moderate candidates  Instead  he has insisted on nominating several      extreme choices and has politicized the process to a greater extent      than I have seen in my 31 years in the Senate   I have not      reflexively opposed Republican nominees or conservative judicial      nominees nominated by Republican presidents  In fact I recommended      a Republican to President Clinton to fill Vermonts seat on the      Second Circuit  Judge Fred Parker  and I recommended another      Republican  Judge Peter Hall  to President Bush to fill that seat      after Judger Parkers death   I voted for      President Reagans nominations of Justice Sandra Day OConnor and      Justice Anthony Kennedy  and for President Bushs nomination of      Justice Souter   Regrettably  this      President has said that he approached this matter as if fulfilling a      campaign pledge to appoint someone in the mold of Justice Thomas and      Justice Scalia  I voted against confirmation of Justice Thomas  I      voted for Justice Scalia and now question that vote  If I thought      that Judge Roberts would easily reject precedent in the manner of      Justice Thomas or would use his position on the Supreme Court as a      bulwark for activism in the manner of Justice Scalia  I would not      hesitate to vote no   If I were      convinced that he would undercut fundamental rights of privacy or      equal protection  this would not even be a close question  I want to vote      for a Chief Justice of the United States who I am confident has a      judicial philosophy that appreciates the vital role of the judiciary      in protecting the rights and liberties of all Americans  Chief      Justice Marshall understood the essential function of the judiciary      as a check on presidential power  Under his leadership the      Constitutions guarantee of an independent judiciary and the bedrock      principle of judicial review became realities  Chief Justice Roger      Taney  a brilliant lawyer by all standards  led the court in a      different and destructive direction   He authored the      Dred Scott decision which propelled the States toward civil war by      relying only on technical reasoning and an unjust holding that      denied African Americans constitutional standing as persons       Chief Justice Earl Warren  by contrast  led the Supreme Court and      the Nation in a crowning achievement when he forged the unanimous      decision in Brown v  Board of Education and breathed life into the      equal protection guarantee of the 14th Amendment    The President      asked that this nomination be handled with fairness and dignity  and      the Judiciary Committee has met those standards  The Committee held      a hearing on the merits  I worked with the Chairman to expedite the      Committees consideration of the nomination of John Roberts to the      Supreme Court out of respect to Justice OConnor and the work of the      Court   Fewer than 36      hours after the announcement of the passing of Chief Justice      Rehnquist and during the horrific aftermath in the week following      Hurricane Katrina  the President withdrew that July 19 nomination to      be Associate Justice  Thereafter  the White House sent us this      alternative nomination  for Judge John Roberts to become the Chief      Justice of the United States  and I cooperated with Chairman Specter      in an accelerated consideration of the nomination   I was extremely      disappointed by the lack of cooperation from the Administration       Although we started off well with some early efforts at      consultation after Justice OConnors retirement announcement in      early July  that consultation never resulted in any meaningful      discussions  It was truncated after a bipartisan meeting with      Senate leaders at the White House  The President never shared his      thinking with us or his plans  as is the nature of true      consultation  His naming of Judge Roberts as his choice to replace      Justice OConnor came as a surprise  not as a result of meaningful      consultation  He then      preemptively announced that he had decided to withdraw that      nomination and  instead  nominated Judge Roberts to succeed Chief      Justice Rehnquist  He did so at 8 a m  on the Monday morning      following the announcement on the previous Saturday night of the      Chiefs passing   There could and      should have been consultation with the Senate on the nomination of      someone to succeed Chief Justice Rehnquist and to serve as the 17th      Chief Justice of the United States  There was none  I learned      about the Presidents decision shortly before his televised      announcement Monday morning   The Bush      Administration committed another disservice to this nomination         and  especially  this nominee    by withholding information that has      traditionally been shared with the Senate  The Bush Administration      treated Senators requests for information with little respect       Instead  for the first time in my memory  they grafted exceptions      from the Freedom of Information Act to limit their response to      Senators requests for information  They stonewalled entirely the      narrowly tailored request for work papers from 16 significant cases      John Roberts handled when he was the principal deputy to Kenneth      Starr at the Solicitor Generals office during the Presidents      fathers administration  The precedent from Chief Justice      Rehnquists hearing and others of course goes the other way    Previous      Presidents had paid the appropriate respect to the Senate and      especially to the constitutional process by working with the      Committee to provide such materials  Accordingly  I would certainly      understand if a Senator were to vote against the Presidents      nomination on this basis alone   Some Republican      Senators also disserved the confirmation process by urging the      nominee not to answer questions or reveal his judicial philosophy      during the course of this hearing  There was one notable exception      from that Republican chorus  the chairman  I appreciate his      commitment to the role of the Senate and taking his duty to advise      and consent as seriously as it deserves to be taken  Regrettably       the nominee seemed to take the advice of some Republicans to heart      in many of his answers   Finally  Judge      Roberts disserved himself by following the script that he had      developed while serving in the Reagan Administration  He and this      Administration rejected the spirit of Attorney General Jacksons      opinion that  with respect to Senate consideration of nominations       no person should be submitted whose entire history will not stand      light   The nominee took      a narrow judicial ethics rule correctly limiting what a judge or      judicial nominee should say about a particular case and turned it      into a broad excuse from comments on any issue that might ever arise      in a case   He apparently      rejected the Supreme Courts holding in 2002 in Republican Party      of Minnesota v  White  in which Justice Scalia held that a state      canon limiting judicial candidates from announcing their views on      legal and political issues was unconstitutional   By contrast       several of the public witnesses who appeared last Thursday were      extraordinarily helpful in underscoring what is at stake for all      Americans with this decision  No one who heard Congressman John      Lewis  Wade Henderson and Judge Nathaniel Jones can doubt the      fundamental importance of our refusal to retreat from our Nations      commitment to civil rights   The testimony of      Coach Roderick Jackson and Beverly Jones reminded us how courageous      Americans are still in opening doors and righting wrongs through our      courts  The testimony of Marie Anne Talman of MALDEF reflected what      is at stake when alien children are denied education and benefits      that should be available to every child in America   It was a      dignified and fair process  I commend Chairman Specter and those      Members of the Committee on both sides of the aisle who did not      prejudge the matter and who did not seek to politicize the process  The hearings did      provide the committee with some information  I was encouraged by      Judge Robertss answer to my question about providing the fifth vote      needed to stay an execution when four other Justices vote to review      a capital case  That has not always been the practice of late and      he was right to recognize the illogic  if not the injustice of      having the necessary votes to review the case but lacking the      necessary vote to allow that review to take place especially where a      life hangs in the balance   I hope that the      nominee will take up our suggestion to allow greater access to the      Supreme Courts proceedings by authorizing their televising    Likewise  I will      work with him and with Chairman Specter and Senator Grassley to      increase transparency in the work of the increasingly important FISA      court   I would also urge      him to consider ways to decentralize the power accumulated to the      Chief Justice so that the Judicial Conference  Circuit courts and      others can do more  I encourage him to reform the recusal      procedures and conflict of interest protections at all levels of the      judiciary but  in particular  with regard to the Supreme Court      itself  Perhaps what many have said were his own missteps in      connection with his interviewing for this nomination during his      consideration of the Hamdan case will inspire him to greater efforts      in this important regard   As a young man      Judge Roberts clerked for Judge Henry Friendly on the United States      Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit  The Second Circuit has      been the home to a number of leading judicial lights and certainly      Henry Friendly was among them  I hope that he is faithful to Judge      Friendlys fairness and thoughtfulness  I made no secret      of my concerns about this nomination  In advance of the hearing I      met twice with Judge Roberts and for nearly three hours in all       raised my concerns  I provided him additional opportunities to      respond during the hearing   I told him I was      concerned that he would not act as an effective check on the abuse      of presidential power   Judge Robertss      work in the Reagan and Bush Justice Departments as well as his      formative period in the Reagan White House seem to have led him to a      philosophy of significant deference to presidential authority  It      is exhibited most recently in his decisions in the Hamdan  Acree and      Chao cases  among others  Maybe this deference was a principal      basis on which this President chose him   Throughout this      process  I learned that Judge Roberts and I share admiration for      Justice Robert Jackson  Justice Jacksons protection of fundamental      rights  including unpopular speech under the First Amendment  and      his willingness to serve as a check on presidential authority are      among the finest actions by any Justice in our history  When Judge      Roberts testified about his respect for Justice Jackson  I hoped      that it was a signal he was sending and I posed that question to      him  I accept his assurance that he will act as an independent      check on the President  in the mold of Justice Jackson  and that      when he joins the Supreme Court he will no longer heavily defer to      presidential authority  It is one of the crucial roles of the      courts  and I take him at his word that he will do so   This is a      fundamental question  We know that we are in a period in which the      Executive has a complicit and compliant Republican Congress that      refuses to serve as a check or balance  Without the courts to      fulfill that constitutional role  excess will continue  and the      balance will be tilted   The other      dimension of the fundamental balance of constitutional powers      involves appropriate deference to congressional action taken by the      peoples elected representatives   The manner and      techniques Judge Roberts has used while in the Executive  private      practice and while briefly on the D C  Circuit show him to require      an unrealistic exactitude in drafting laws that no collective body      could meet   I wish he had      served in Congress or worked for a time in Congress so that he would      have a deeper understanding of the legislative process  I hope that      his experience during the hearing and the many questions from      Senators on both sides of the aisle have helped increase his      appreciation for congressional authority and its importance    The current      activism of the Supreme Court must be curtailed  That should not be      part of Chief Justice Rehnquists legacy that John Roberts seeks to      continue   Congress acts to      protect the interests of Americans through the Commerce Clause       spending powers and the 14th Amendment  That needs to be      respected  I am encouraged by his assurances that he will respect      congressional authority  My reading of his dissent from the denial      of rehearing en banc of the Rancho Viejo v  Norton case  the      case in which he made the hapless toad reference is that he urged      rehearing to afford the opportunity to consider alternative grounds      for sustaining application of the Act  In addition  his steadfast      reliance on the Supreme Courts recent Raich decision as significant      precedent contravening further implications from Lopez and Morrison      was intended to reassure us that he will not join the assault on      congressional authority pursuant to the Commerce Clause  I heard      him and rely on him to be true to the impression that he created  As a lawyer John      Roberts had been significantly involved in the development of      Supreme Court authority limiting the authority of Congress pursuant      to its constitutional spending powers  He argued before the Supreme      Court in the 80s  90s  and this decade in a series of cases       South Dakota v  Dole  Wilder v  Virginia Hospital Association  Suter      v  Artist M   and Gonzaga University v  Doe  in which he called      for narrowing Congresss spending powers and limiting the ability of      individuals to sue to compel the protections Congress required under      federal law   His briefs in      Gonzaga adopted the extreme view that a spending power enactment was      a contract between the state and federal governments and that the      intended beneficiaries of those programs had no rights to sue to      enforce the commitments  even when states were violating the law and      the federal government was not effectively enforcing it    At the hearing       he took pains to assure me and Senator Feinstein  among others  that      as Chief Justice he would not continue to urge additional      restrictions and would respect congressional authority   To do otherwise      would greatly undermine Congresss ability to serve the interests of      Americans and protect the environment  ensure equal justice  and      provide health care and other basic benefits  I think he knows that      now   From the initial      questioning by Chairman Specter throughout the testimony of the      nominee  many Senators asked about the fundamental reproductive      rights of women that are part of the recognized right of privacy       Judge Roberts testified that he now recognizes Roe v  Wade and      Planned Parenthood v  Casey as established precedents of the Supreme      Court entitled to respect   He testified that      he interprets the liberty protected by the due process clause of the      14th Amendment as the constitutional bedrock of the right      of privacy  which is both substantive and procedural  Here  too       within the overly strict confines of his own self imposed      constraints on his answers  he consciously created the impression      that he will not be a judicial activist on this essential point  He      left me with the understanding that he would not seek to overrule or      undercut the right of a woman to choose  I trust that he is a      person of honor and integrity and that he will act accordingly       As Chief Justice      John Roberts will not be only an appointee of a Republican      administration or a legal advocate for a narrow interest  As Chief      Justice he must check the abuse of presidential power  As Chief      Justice he must support congressional efforts to serve the interests      of all Americans  As Chief Justice he must work to ensure that the      federal courts  and the Supreme Court in particular  are halls of      justice where Americans like Beverly Jones  Roderick Jackson and      Christine Franklin can seek and find redress for grievances       meaningful remedies for the violation of their rights and protection      of their fundamental interests   Justice White      wrote in the Franklin v  Gwinnett County Public School case       From the earliest years of the Republic  the Court has recognized      the power of the Judiciary to award appropriate remedies to redress      injuries actionable in court  As Chief Justice of the United      States  John Roberts must ensure that the Supreme Court and all      federal courts never abdicate our historic judicial authority to      award appropriate relief in cases brought in our court system       Supreme Court      Justices decide what cases to decide  They consciously shape the      direction of the law by choosing which cases to hear as well as how      they are to be decided  We know he believes in the rule of law       But court decisions  especially Supreme Court decisions  are not      mechanical applications of neutral principles  If there were  all      judges would always reach the same results for the same reasons       They do not  Legal decisions are not mechanical  They are matters      of judgment and  often  matters of justice  As Chief Justice  John      Roberts is responsible for the way in which the judicial branch      administers justice for all Americans  He must know in his core      that the words engraved in the Vermont marble on the Supreme Court      building are not just Under Law but Equal Justice under Law  It      is not just the rule of law that he must serve  but the cause of      justice under our great charter   I heard days of      testimony and hours of meetings with Judge Roberts  Would I have      liked more information  Of course    I always want more  Is a no      vote the easier and more popular one   Of course again       especially with my constituency  But in my judgment  in my      experience  but especially in my conscience I find it is better to      vote yes than no  Ultimately my Vermont roots have always told me      to go with my conscience and they do so today  Judge Roberts is      a man of integrity  I can only take him at his word that he does      not have an ideological agenda  For me  a vote to confirm requires      faith that the words he spoke to us have meaning  I can only take      him at his word that he will steer the court to serve as an      appropriate check on potential abuses of presidential power    I respect those      who have come to different conclusions  and I readily acknowledge      the unknowable at this moment  that perhaps they are right and I am      wrong  Only time will tell   All of us will      vote this month but only later will we know if Judge Roberts proves      to be the kind of Chief Justice he says he would be  if he truly      will be his own man  I hope and trust that he will be
