       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Domestic Surveillance  Privacy Challenges   In The Post 9 11 Era                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Domestic Surveillance  Privacy Challenges In The Post 9 11 Era      16th Annual Conference On Computers  Freedom  Privacy       Life  Liberty And Digital Rights      L Enfant Plaza Hotel      Washington  D C       Wednesday  May 3  2006  I welcome       this opportunity to talk about the state of privacy in an age of       new technology and growing challenges  I thank your conference       chair  Frank Torres  for his leadership and thank all the       privacy experts  computer professionals  and representatives       from government and business  who have gathered here today to       talk about these timely issues   Convergence I would       like to touch on what I see as the convergence of three trends        The first trend is our post 9 11 interest in security  sometimes       at the expense of other interests  such as privacy and long held       civil liberties   Second is       the digital data and micro monitoring revolution  new       technological capabilities that threaten to swamp our ability to       draw appropriate privacy boundaries   And the       third trend in this convergence is the rapid post 9 11 rise of       partnerships between government and private data collectors  and       the outsourcing of data banking and data mining functions that       used to be handled by government agencies  This       outsourcing already is blurring the few lines of privacy       protection that once protected the public  The insightful       privacy writer Bob OHarrow of The Washington Post has       described these new private data agencies as mini CIAs    If these       trends continue  then before too long we will tend to think of       privacy as a quaint 20th Century American value that       no longer applies to our everyday lives   That would       be a different American society than we have known  and that is       worth defending    People Want To      BE Safer In our       post 9 11 world  security is the touchstone for an ever widening       array of federal policies and programs  while the technology       that facilitates this shift has begun to advance at breakneck       speed  As we       struggle to protect ourselves from threats like terrorism        technology often has been our crucial  but silent  partner in       helping us to ramp up our law enforcement and national security       capabilities  We in this city are profoundly aware of the new       risks we face  But we also need to get it right   The public       does not want false assurances  nor do they want to be unduly       alarmed   What the       American people want is to actually be safer  And we       still have a way to go in accomplishing that   Security And       Liberty In our       constitutional system there is always tension between liberty       and security  and especially so after September 11th        One of the difficult challenges we face is to strike the right       midpoint  Our constitutional checks and balances are intended       to help us do that   The       technologies available to us today offer tools that are better        faster and smarter  on scales of magnitude that are       unprecedented  As an advocate and an enthusiast of emerging       technologies  I watch these breakthroughs with great interest  Technology       has always played a significant role in shaping our laws on       information privacy   In the face       of technology that makes it easier to delve more deeply into our       private lives  Congress has increasingly been called upon to       confront the question of the proper scope of privacy  I have       promoted the use of new technologies by law enforcement       agencies  while also protecting our privacy and constitutional       freedoms   That was       the balance I sought to strike in my work on CALEA  the USA       PATRIOT Act and in other legislation that blends law       enforcements needs  the needs of our vital technology sector        and the privacy interests of the American people  Right now I       am working with others to enact federal legislation to ensure       the privacy and security of our personal data  which is more and       more collected  stored and disseminated by our government and       commercial data brokers    The       Micro Monitoring Revolution The       marriage of information gathering technology with       information storing technology  manipulated in increasingly       sophisticated databases  is beginning to produce the defining       privacy challenge of the information age        Modern databases  networks and the Internet allow us to easily       collect  store  distribute and combine video  audio and other       digital trails of our daily transactions   We are on the       verge of a revolution in micro monitoring  the       capability for the highly detailed  largely automatic        widespread surveillance of our daily lives         Government Surveillance In The Post 9 11 Era  And one of the       most dramatic and dazzling new challenges we all will be facing       during the micro monitoring revolution is the governments       growing use of information gathering technology to conduct       surveillance on the activities of American citizens    After the attacks       of 9 11  the Bush Administration declared the continental United       States a theater of military operations for the first time since       the Civil War  U S  military and law enforcement agencies have       since used cutting edge technology to implement new surveillance       programs to improve national security   These programs        which include sophisticated eavesdropping capabilities  Radio       Frequency Identification  or RFID  technology  and the       mining of large databases of information from sources such as       local police  military personnel and the Internet  greatly       enhance the governments ability to combat terrorism  However        these technologies also bring to the forefront serious public       policy questions about the proper scope of privacy in the       information age   On December 17        2005  one day after the existence of the program was reported       by The New York Times  the President admitted that the       Bush Cheney Administration has engaged in secret wiretapping of       ordinary Americans without warrants for more than four years         The Administration       maintains that the congressional resolution authorizing the use       of military force against al Qaeda  a resolution that says       nothing at all about wiretapping  also authorized this secret        warrantless wiretapping of Americans inside the United States         During the Senate       Judiciary Committees hearings on the NSA spying program  I       pointed out that the Administrations legal justification for       this program simply cannot be squared with the FISA law and the       Constitution  If  as they claim  the Bush Administration can       ignore FISAs express prohibition of warrantless wiretapping        can the government also eavesdrop on purely domestic phone       calls    Can it search or       electronically bug an Americans home or office  or comb through       Americans medical records and open first class mail  These are       all burning questions to which Congress and the American people       deserve answers    In March  the       LA Times and Seattle Post Intelligencer reported that       federal government antiterrorism agencies conducted surveillance       on longtime Quaker peace activist Glen Milner during the 2003       Seafair festival    Defense Secretary       Donald Rumsfeld told the Senate last month that the Department       of Homeland Security was the source of information in Pentagon       databases about at least three antiwar protests at military       recruiting centers  two in my own state of Vermont and one here       in Washington    Just last week  the Wall Street Journal       reported that the Pentagon has conducted several post 9 11       surveillance programs within U S  borders to track the       activities of more than 20 antiwar groups around the country   We need only look       to history in order to determine the chilling effects of       surveillance on the right to protest and to express dissent in       our nation  Throughout the civil rights movement  the FBI       monitored Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  and other civil rights       leaders  engaging in a pattern of illegal harassment and       surveillance    The Senates 1975       investigation led by Senator Frank Church found that during the       Vietnam War era  our government collected information on more       than 100 000 Americans  infiltrated church youth groups and       posed as reporters to interview peace activists  No doubt in a       post 9 11 world  we should have and use information gathering       technology to protect national security  But  our government       has no business spying on law abiding American citizens           Call For A Privacy Dialogue  These examples of       how the 9 11 terror attacks have sparked a broad effort by the       government to gather intelligence within U S  borders       demonstrate that we must have a meaningful public dialogue about       privacy in the post 9 11 era    We need clear       communication about the goals  plans and uses of       information gathering technology  so that we can think in       advance about the best ways to encourage innovation  while       conserving the publics right to privacy  Congresss oversight       role in this regard is indispensable   Congress must hold       hearings on these issues and draw privacy boundaries where       appropriate  requiring those within our government who collect       and work with private information to understand what is       permitted and what is not   I also believe it       is time for the White House and for Congress to convene a summit       meeting on these sensitive issues  a moment to take stock of       what privacy rights were  are  and will be in American society       This White House needs to re calibrate  It has been devoted to      secrecy  classifying information to conceal its mistakes and      revealing classified information when helpful to its political      purposes  The administration has also been too slow to embrace      legitimate privacy concerns  or even to create a strong Privacy and      Civil Liberties Oversight Board  as Congress required when it      enacted the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of      2004       This is a dialogue that should cut across the political spectrum       and it should include constructive  bipartisan hearings  The      earlier we begin this discussion  the greater the prospects for      success in reaching consensus on a set of guiding principles       Privacy rights  once eroded  are difficult to restore  I      hope that a bipartisan discussion can now begin on the privacy      challenges posed by surveillance technology in the post 9 11 era       Thank you for your interest in this important issue  and thanks for      this opportunity to share some ideas with you
