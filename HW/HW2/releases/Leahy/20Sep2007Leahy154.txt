       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Executive Business Meeting                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Executive Business Meeting     September 20  2007     Today  the Committee is considering the Security from Political     Interference in Justice Act of 2007  S 1845  This bill was introduced     by Senator Whitehouse to begin to correct what he has termed the     expanding portal between the White House and the Department of Justice     regarding communications about ongoing Department investigations  At our     last meeting  Senator Whitehouse agreed to again hold over this bill      beyond the routine week  to accommodate Senator Kyls request  I recall     that the Justice Department had come forward with 11th hour objections     to the legislation       I commend Senator Whitehouse for working during the intervening time     with Senator Hatch and others to further refine the bills language  As     soon as we have the requisite quorum I intend to recognize Senator     Whitehouse to introduce the amendment he has circulated so that we can     proceed to report his bill  I am pleased that Senator Hatch  again      supports the kinds of checks on communications between the White House     and the Justice Department he advocated during the Clinton     Administration       The Security from Political Interference in Justice Act of 2007  is     another important step towards repairing the damage that has been done     to the Department of Justice over recent years  This oversight bill     should help restore some of the better practices at the Department to     limit the political influence of the White House by providing additional     information to Congress about communications between the White House and     the Department as a check on untoward influence       It was during our hearings on the unprecedented mass firings of U S      Attorneys that Senator Whitehouse first sounded the alarm about the     dramatically expanded number of White House and Department officials     permitted by the last Attorney General to communicate regarding civil     and criminal investigations  We do not have to merely imagine the threat     to the independence of law enforcement arising from those     communications  Our investigation revealed instances in which the     Department had been reduced to a political arm of the White House  with     respected prosecutors fired  bad cases filed  and hiring done for     partisan purposes       I trust we will be able to report S 1845 this morning       Next  I will turn to the Chairman of the Antitrust  Competition Policy     and Consumer Rights Subcommittee  Senator Kohl  to begin our     consideration after a weeks holdover of the Railroad Antitrust     Enforcement Act  I understand Senator Kohl has an amendment  but that is     the only amendment that has been circulated  Accordingly  I hope that we     will be able to complete our consideration of that bill this morning and     vote to report it  as well       Then  if there is no objection  we can consider the media shield     legislation  Senator Lugar and Senator Dodd have been leaders in seeking     to enact such a measure  Senator Specter has worked extremely hard while     he chaired this Committee and this year on media shield legislation with     Senator Schumer  Today  I think all of us  Senators Lugar  Dodd      Specter  Schumer and Leahy are prepared to endorse a measure that with     the support of the Committee can be reported to the Senate and  we hope      considered and passed by the Senate this year  Unless there is a request     for a hold  I believe that the substitute is the only amendment     circulated to the Free Flow of Information Act in accordance with our     Committee rules and procedures and we could vote to report that today      as well       The final measure on our legislative agenda is a bipartisan bill     introduced by Senators Durbin and Coburn  the Chairman and Ranking     Member of our new Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law  They have     circulated an amendment to the Trafficking in Persons Accountability     Act  Unless there is a request to hold that matter over  we could vote     to report that measure today  as well       In terms of nominations  we have two on the agenda today  We have the     nominations of Judge Jennifer Walker Elrod of Texas for a lifetime     appointment to the Fifth Circuit and that of Patrick Shen to be Special     Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices at the     Department of Justice       With the cooperation of the Committee  we can make significant progress     this morning on all these items
