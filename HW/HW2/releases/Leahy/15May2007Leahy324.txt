       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Politicization Of The   Hiring  Firing  and Decision Making Of U S  Attorneys                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing On Politicization Of The Hiring  Firing    And Decision Making Of U S  Attorneys    Part IV   May 15  2007   Today  the Committee welcomes former Deputy Attorney    General James Comey to testify as part of its investigation into the mass    firings and replacements of U S  Attorneys  Mr  Comey comes to us at a time    when the Department of Justice    a Department where he served as the    second  highest ranking official   is experiencing a crisis of leadership     The scandal swirling around the dismissal and replacement of several    well performing prosecutors continues to grow  Just yesterday  we learned    from press accounts that Mr  Comeys successor as Deputy Attorney General     Paul McNulty  has tendered his resignation  Mr  McNulty is at least the    fourth senior Justice Department official to resign so far   The American people deserve a strong and independent    Department of Justice with leaders who enforce the law without fear or    favor  Regrettably  that is not the Justice Department we have today     Instead  we see a Department rife with scandal and another agency this    Administration seeks to manipulate as a political arm of the White House     Our justice system should not be a political arm for this White House or any    White House  whether occupied by a Republican or a Democrat   Since the beginning of this investigation  we have    heard shifting explanations from the Administration  First  we were told by    Mr  McNulty and others that these U S  Attorneys were fired for performance    reasons and we were told that the White House was not involved or had    minimal involvement  Then  when we learned they were fired for political    reasons and that political operatives from the White House were involved    from day one  we were told that the White House had nonetheless concluded    that it had done nothing improper   The Administration has sought to place artificial    limitations on our congressional investigation to control the facts and the    damaging revelations  We have been told that we are not allowed to ask    Department witnesses about other U S  Attorneys considered for firing or    kept on as loyal Bushies in order to learn the real reasons for the    firings  We have been prevented from seeing key documents and e mails  The    White House has refused to produce a single document or official to be    interviewed on the record   Yet  more facts continue to emerge  We have learned in    recent weeks about unprecedented efforts to screen potential hires for    political allegiances throughout the Department  including apparently for    career Assistant U S  Attorney positions  a development Mr  Comey has said    strikes at the core of what the department is  And we continue to learn    of more U S  Attorney replacements than were initially revealed   I continue to hope that the Department will cooperate    with the Committees investigation  but the Departments highly selective    and incomplete productions of documents have presented a hurdle since the    investigation began  Indeed  it seems that the closer we get to learning    the truth about these firings  the less cooperation we get from the    Department   The Department chose not to make one of its officials     Bradley Schlozman  available to the Committee for our hearing this morning     We wanted to hear directly from Mr  Schlozman about his knowledge and    recollection relating to his activities as a former interim U S  Attorney in    Missouri and his time in the Departments Civil Rights Division  The    Committee could benefit from Mr  Schlozmans testimony  particularly as new    information is revealed about concerns by Karl Rove and others in the    Administration regarding purported voter fraud  and how those concerns    played into the determinations to retain or remove certain U S  Attorneys     Senators should also have the benefit of Mr  Schlozmans testimony about    the unprecedented and damaging politicization of hiring for career positions    at the Department  Despite a bipartisan letter to Mr  Scholzman requesting    his cooperation and an invitation voluntarily to appear this morning  he has    apparently chosen not to come  The reasons for his failure to appear have     like the explanations for the U S  Attorneys firings  shifted over time and    were provided not directly by him  Given his failure to appear  I will seek    Committee authorization to subpoena him in the near future   I find it troubling that only through the press did we    learn of the confidential order revealed two weeks ago by which the Attorney    General delegated to two young aides  former Chief of Staff D  Kyle Sampson    and former White House Liaison Monica Goodling  authority over the hiring    and firing of many high level employees of the Justice Department  We also    learned only from the press  and not from Administration documents or    witnesses at hearings or interviews  that another former U S  Attorney whose    name appeared on the lists  Todd Graves from the Western District of    Missouri  was  in fact  also told to resign  Mr  Schlozmans testimony    might have shed some light on this additional firing the Department sought    to hide  Instead  he is conveniently unavailable today   It appears from the evidence gathered by the Committee    in five hearings  eight interviews with current and former officials from    the Department of Justice  and our review of the limited documents produced    by the Department that White House officials played a significant role in    developing and implementing the plan for the dismissals  Indeed  the plan    seems to have originated in the White House and was formulated by and with    coordination of the White House political operation  Yet  to date the White    House has not produced a single document or allowed even one White House    official involved in these matters to be interviews   We will see this afternoon whether the Attorney General    will comply with the Committees subpoena requiring him to produce to the    Committee all of Mr  Roves e mails in the Departments possession related    to the Committees investigation or whether our efforts to learn the truth    will be met with more stonewalling  When the Attorney General was before    us last month  I asked him whether he would provide Mr  Roves e mails in    the Departments possession to the Committee without a subpoena  I did not    hear back from him after the hearing or in response to a follow up letter I    sent April 25th asking for a response  I hope that the Attorney General of    the United States will comply with a duly issued subpoena of this standing    Committee of the Senate acting in its oversight capacity  I thank Mr  Comey for appearing before the Committee    today  His appearance on the heels of his successors resignation is a    reminder that we need to restore the Department of Justice to a place    deserving of its name  The way we do that is get to the truth   The Committee has requested cooperation from the    Administration and I hope the information and cooperation requested will    finally be forthcoming  If the White House has done nothing improper  then    they have nothing to hide  The Administration should come clean so that we    can begin the process of reconstituting the leadership of the Justice    Department  Then all Americans can renew their faith in its role as our    leading law enforcement agency The obligations of the Justice Department    are to the Constitution  the rule of law and to the American people  not to    the political considerations of the White House
