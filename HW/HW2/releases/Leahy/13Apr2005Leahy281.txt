PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      281 Vermonters Personal Data Affected By Breach At     LexisNexis     Vermont AG Sorrell Testifies     Before Senate Judiciary Committee on Information Security WASHINGTON      Wednesday  April 13   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the ranking     Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  invited Vermont     Attorney General William Sorrell to testify Wednesday before the panel     on the emerging issue of securing personal electronic data in the     digital age  Sorrell  who is also the president of the National     Association of Attorneys General  discussed several of the recent string     of security breaches at large firms  including LexisNexis  which     confirmed earlier this week that a privacy breach at its subsidiary     Seisint was broader than earlier reported to include more than 300 000     Americans  The personal data of 281 Vermonters may have been accessed     by intruders as part of that breach  according to the company  Leahy  a     longtime champion of the publics privacy rights  requested Wednesdays     hearing as a way to spotlight the need to balance privacy and security     in this digital age and to consider the role Congress should play in     ensuring the protection of personal data  Below is Sorrells testimony     and Leahys statement at the hearing  CONTACT  Tracy Schmaler  202 224 2154       David Carle  202 224 3693    Testimony of Vermont Attorney General William Sorrell     President of the National Association of Attorneys General     Senate Judiciary Committee    April 13  2005     I  INTRODUCTION      Mr  Chairman  Senator Leahy  and honorable members of the     Committee  I am William H  Sorrell  Attorney General of the State of    Vermont and President of the National Association of     Attorneys General  I very much appreciate the opportunity to appear     before you today to discuss security breaches relating to personal     information of consumers and our recommendations for addressing some of     the problems in this area       The public has become aware of numerous incidences of     security breaches in the past two months as a result of     Californias innovative security breach notification laws  The effect     of these security breaches is to expose millions of consumers to     potential identity theft  a serious and rapidly growing crime that now     costs our nation  50 billion per year  We make the following     recommendations to address the problems of security breaches    Enact a federal security breach      notification law that doesnt preempt more protective state laws        Enact a unified federal program for      regulation of data brokers that doesnt preempt more protective      state laws    Strengthen the Gramm Leach Bliley      Safeguards Rules to require definitive minimum standards for      information security  and ensure that these rules cover data      brokers    Recognize the important role of state      legislative and law enforcement efforts  particularly in developing      security freeze laws     II  THE GROWTH OF     SECURITY BREACHES      Over the past several months  consumers  law enforcement     officials and policy makers have learned about a rising incidence of     breaches at private companies and public institutions that exposed     consumers personal information to unauthorized third parties      Separately  these breaches involve the personal information of tens of     thousands  hundreds of thousands  and even millions of records about     consumers nationwide    A  Numerous     Serious Incidences of Security Breaches Have Occurred Since 2002       Nine known incidences of serious security breaches have     occurred in the past few years  It is instructive to examine each one     in some detail    Ford Motor Credit       In 2002  three individuals were arrested for downloading credit      reports on more than 30 000 consumers  and then selling the credit      reports to street criminals who emptied the victims bank accounts      and opened credit cards in their names  The scheme centered on an      employee of Teledata  a company that provides credit reports to      banks and other lenders  the employee stole the passwords and codes      of Teledata clients such as Ford Motor Company in order to download      credit reports from the three major credit reporting agencies  Over      a 10 month period  the password and code for Ford Motor Credit alone      was used to download 13 000 credit reports from just one credit      reporting agency  Experian  Losses were originally calculated at       2 7 million  but were expected to rise significantly in the weeks      after the arrest    Acxiom  In 2003       the records of an unknown number of consumers were stolen from      commercial data broker Acxiom  based in Little Rock  Arkansas       Hackers were able to download the passwords of 300 business accounts      on Acxioms system  costing the company  5 8 million in losses    ChoicePoint  In      February 2005  ChoicePoint notified 144 000 consumers nationwide      that their personal data may have been accessed by unauthorized      third parties who were posing as small business customers       ChoicePoint  an Atlanta based data broker and specialty credit      reporting agency with databases that contain 19 billion public      records about consumers and businesses  reported that identity      thieves created as many as 50 fake companies that posed as customers      and gained access to consumer data   Bank of America       Also in February 2005  Bank of America announced that it lost      computer backup tapes containing personal information  including      names and SSNs  relating to 1 2 million federal workers  The tapes      had been lost two months earlier  in December 2004  Bank of America      received permission from its federal regulators to notify consumers      about the security problem in mid February         DSW Shoe Warehouse       On March 8  2005  DSW Shoe Warehouse announced the theft of credit      card information  including account numbers and customer names       relating to customers at more than 100 of its 175 stores  The theft      took place over a three month period  beginning in early December      2004  DSW is a subsidiary of Retail Ventures  Inc   based in      Columbus Ohio    LexisNexis  On      March 10  2005  LexisNexis owner Reed Elsevier PLC announced that      records of about 32 000 consumers were accessed and compromised when      intruders used log ins and passwords of a few legitimate customers      to obtain access to a database of public records  The records      included names  addresses  Social Security numbers  SSNs   and      drivers license numbers  The breach occurred at Boca Raton       Florida based Seisint  a data broker recently purchased by Reed      Elsevier and integrated into LexisNexis  Seisint stores millions of      personal records about consumers nationwide       On April 12  2005  LexisNexis announced that an additional 280 000      consumers nationwide had been affected by other security breaches of      Seisint data over the past two years    Boston College  In      late March 2005  Boston College notified 106 000 alumni that a      hacker had gained access to a computer database containing personal      information about them  Officials of the college stated that they      had to tell the affected alumni living in California about the theft      due to Californias notification law  and the officials therefore      decided to tell alumni who live in other states  too  to help them      limit their exposure to identity theft    University of California       On April 1  2005  University of California Berkeley officials      announced that a laptop computer containing information about 98 000      students and alumni had been stolen a month earlier  The      information  including names  SSNs  and in some instances birth      dates and addresses  was unencrypted  although the laptop was      password protected  This breach follows another incident at UC Berkeley      in September 2004 in which a hacker obtained the names  SSNs and      other identifying information belonging to 600 000 people    San Jose Medical Group       On April 8  2005  the San Jose  California  Medical Group notified      nearly 185 000 current and former patients that their financial and      medical records might have been exposed following the theft of      computers  The theft occurred after the group copied patient and      financial information from its secure servers to two local PCs as      part of a patient billing project and the groups year end audit        Several conclusions can be drawn from a review of these events  Hackers     and identity thieves employ both high tech means for stealing passwords     and other log in information to access consumers personal information      as evidenced by the LexisNexis and Acxiom breaches  as well as low tech     techniques to breach information systems  as evidenced by the     ChoicePoint incidence  In addition  although the pace of disclosures     about these breaches has accelerated over the past few months  it is     safe to presume that breaches have been occurring regularly over the     past several years  What has changed is not the existence of the     problem  but rather the publics awareness of it    B  The Public     Has Learned About These Breaches As a Result of     Californias Security Breach Notification Laws  On    July 1  2003  Californias security breach notification     laws went into effect  These laws require businesses and California     public institutions to notify the public about     any breach of the security of their computer information system where     unencrypted personal information was  or is reasonably believed to have     been  acquired by an unauthorized person      Californias laws require that the notice be given without unreasonable     delay  consistent with the legitimate needs of law enforcement  which     can request a delay in notification if the notice would impede a     criminal investigation of the incidence      Personal Information is defined as an individual s first name or first     initial and last name in combination with any one or more of the     following data elements  when either the name or the data element is not     encrypted     Social Security number     Driver s license number      or California Identification Card number     Account number  credit      or debit card number  in combination with any required security      code  access code  or password that would permit access to an      individual s financial account     The California law allows a     business or public institution to satisfy the notice requirement in     several ways  written notice through the mail  electronic notice in     conformity with the Federal Electronic Signatures Act      substitute notice through email  website publication  and major     statewide news media if more than 500 000 consumers are affected  or in     conformity with the business or institutions own notification system      if it meets the timeliness requirements of the California security     breach notification laws   Californias unique and     innovative laws in this area have ensured that we are aware of the     growing problem of data leaks that are plaguing our nations businesses     and public institutions       III  THE EFFECT OF SECURITY BREACHES  Identity theft  already a growing problem      is likely to grow even more rapidly as a result of security breaches      The effect of these data leaks is to expose consumers to the threat of     identity theft by the criminals who gain access to consumers personal     information  MSNBC has noted that in the six week period from     mid February through early April  the rash of data heists has exposed     more than two million U S  consumers to possible identity     theft    Current estimates of the incidence of     identity theft in the United States are disturbingly     high  According to a survey released in January 2005 by Javelin     Strategy  Research  about 9 3 million U S  adults were victims of     identity theft between October 2003 and September 2004       Even though the vast majority of victims     of identity theft do not report the crime to law enforcement authorities     or credit bureaus      the reported incidence of identity theft has grown dramatically  The     Federal Trade Commission reported in February 2005 that the number of     identity theft complaints submitted to its Consumer Sentinel database     has grown from 161 896 in 2002 to 246 570 in 2004      representing a growth rate of more than 50  in two years  Victims     information is misused to perpetrate financial fraud in the vast     majority of cases  fraud involving credit cards  checking and savings     accounts  and electronic funds transfers represented 46  of the     complaints in 2004      Members of this Committee represent states that contain areas suffering     the most from the growing incidence of identity theft  Out of the 50     Metropolitan Statistical Areas that have generated the greatest number     of complaints relative to population  six are in     California  four are in Texas  three are in each of New York  Ohio      Pennsylvania  and Wisconsin  and two are in Illinois      Arizona victims of identity theft have filed the largest number of     complaints relative to population  followed by Nevada  California      Texas  Colorado  Florida  New York  Washington  Oregon  and Illinois   Identity theft has a deeply negative     impact on our nations economy  According to a survey published by the     Federal Trade Commission in September 2003  the total cost of identity     theft approaches  50 billion per year  with victims bearing about  5     billion of the losses  and businesses bearing the remaining  45 billion      The average loss     from the misuse of a victims personal information is  4 800  but for     victims who had new credit card and other accounts opened in their name      the average loss is  10 200      Overall  victims spent almost 300 million hours resolving problems     relating to identity theft in one year  with almost two thirds of this     time  194 million hours  spent by victims who had new credit card and     other accounts opened in their name   IV  CONSUMERS AND     STATE OFFICIALS CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY BREACHES      The recent rash of information heists have had several     important effects on the state and local level  Consumers have     expressed concerns about their current level of knowledge of security     breaches and what they realistically can do in the event they become a     victim  State Attorneys General and other state and local officials     have taken action in a number of areas to resolve these concerns          Consumers Across the Nation Want to Receive Notice of Security Breaches   The citizens of California     have received notice of security breaches as a result of that states     innovative law  Consumers in the remaining 49 states  the District of     Columbia and the territories want the same right to receive notice when     their personal information is accessed in an unauthorized manner      Unfortunately  in the absence of other state laws or a federal minimum     standard  consumers in the other states have not consistently received     notices in the recent spate of incidences  LexisNexis sent notices on a     voluntary basis to affected consumers nationwide  ChoicePoint     originally sent notices only to California residents  only after     receiving letters from the Attorneys General of numerous states did     ChoicePoint expand its notification process to include potentially     affected consumers in all states       In addition to haphazard notification  the     paucity of regulation in this area has led to another problem  The     notices that were actually received by consumers came in envelopes from     ChoicePoint  Consumers have no idea who ChoicePoint is because     consumers typically have no business relationship with ChoicePoint  We     learned of instances where consumers tossed out the notification letters     without opening them  on the assumption that the letters were another     unsolicited offer for a credit card or some other piece of junk mail   Rapid and effective notice of a security     breach is an important first step to limiting the extent of harm that     may be caused by identity theft  The Federal Trade Commission reports     that the overall cost of an incident of identity theft  as well as the     harm to the victims  are significantly smaller if the misuse of the     victims personal information is discovered quickly      For example  when the misuse was discovered within five months of its     onset  the value of the damage was less than  5 000 in 82  of the     cases  When victims did not discover the misuse for six months or more      the thief obtained  5 000 or more in 44  of the cases  In addition  new     accounts were opened in less than ten percent of the cases when it took     victims less than a month to discover that their information was being     misused  while new accounts were opened in 45 percent of cases when six     months or more elapsed before the misuse was discovered   To ensure that citizens across the nation     receive adequate notice about security breaches  twenty eight states are     currently considering legislation modeled on Californias     law          After Learning About a Breach of Their Personal Information  Consumers     Want to Review Their Credit Reports to Determine if They Are Victims of     Identity Theft   The 2003 amendments to the federal Fair     Credit Reporting Act     gave consumers the right to receive a free copy of their credit report     once every 12 months  following the example previously set by seven     states that require credit reporting agencies to provide free reports to     their citizens      However  because the FTC allowed the nationwide credit reporting     agencies to stagger the implementation of the national free credit     report  consumers in the  Southern states      Alabama  Arkansas  Florida  Georgia  Kentucky  Louisiana  Mississippi      Oklahoma  South Carolina  Tennessee  and Texas  are not able to order     their free reports under federal law until  June 1  2005      And consumers in the Eastern states      Connecticut  Delaware  Maine  Maryland  Massachusetts  New Hampshire      New Jersey  New York  North Carolina  Pennsylvania  Rhode Island      Vermont  Virginia  and West Virginia  as well as the District of     Columbia  Puerto Rico  and all U S  territories  are not able to order     their free reports under federal law until  September 1  2005      As a result  many citizens have been unable to see their credit report     for free during this time of heightened anxiety over possible   identity theft  causing great frustration     in the Eastern and Southern states    In addition  in those Eastern and Southern     states  like Vermont  that already require credit reporting agencies     to provide free credit reports under  state law  consumers have     been confused and frustrated because the credit reporting agencies have     not adequately adjusted their systems to enable consumers in these     states to easily access their free report under  state law  Many consumers     in Vermont attempted to obtain their free report under     Vermont law after learning about the ChoicePoint and other security     breaches  only to be told  incorrectly  by the credit bureaus     voice mail systems that they were not eligible for a free credit report          Consumers Want to Control Access to Their Credit Reports so that     Identity Theft Does Not Occur       The 2003 amendments to the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act also gave     consumers the right to place a fraud alert on their credit reports for     at least 90 days  with extended alerts lasting for up to seven years in     cases where identity theft occurs      Yet many states are considering enacting stronger measures to assist     consumers in combating the rapidly escalating outbreak of security     breaches      Two states  California and Texas  allow consumers to place     a security freeze on their credit report  A security freeze allows     consumers to control who will receive a copy of their credit report      thus making it nearly impossible for criminals to use stolen information     to open an account in the consumers name      Security freeze provisions will become effective on July 1  2005  in two     additional states  Louisiana and Vermont      Although the credit bureaus argue that security freezes are overkill      and cause consumers more harm than good  many members of the business     community in Vermont supported implementation of our security freeze     law  enacted last year  Overall  consumer advocates and many State     Attorneys General believe that security freeze laws are one of the most     effective tools available to stop the harm that can result from data     heists  Twenty states are currently considering security freeze bills   V  RECOMMENDATIONS     ON ADDRESSING THE PROBLEM OF SECURITY BREACHES      We recommend that this Committee take several actions to     address the security breach problem  with its concomitant potential     effect on the increased incidence of identity theft  The     recommendations center on enactment of better federal laws to address     the problem  while allowing the states to continue to perform their     vital functions in assisting consumers and creating additional     innovative solutions    1      Enact a Federal Security Breach Notification Law  Enact a federal     law requiring notice of security breaches in appropriate circumstances      Allow states to enact laws that are more protective of consumers  thus     ensuring that states can continue devising additional innovative     solutions to this issue    2      Enact a Federal Program for Regulation of Data Brokers  Enact a     federal law to regulate data brokers in a manner similar to regulation     of credit reporting agencies  Currently  the regulation of data brokers     comes under a scattered mixture of federal laws  including the federal     Fair Credit Reporting Act  the Gramm Leach Bliley Act  GLBA       and a few other laws  and arguably these laws do not cover all the     practices of data brokers  In developing a unified federal regulatory     scheme for data brokers  only preempt state laws to the extent that they     are less protective of consumers    3      Strengthen the Safeguards Rules  Enact a federal law that will     strengthen the GLBA Safeguards Rules issued by the federal financial     regulators and the Federal Trade Commission      Currently  these rules require the covered institutions to develop a     written information security plan that describes their programs to     protect customer information  and to maintain reasonable security for     customer information  The rules were intended to provide flexibility to     account for each covered institutions size  complexity  scope of     activities  and sensitivity of information handled  However  in light     of the recent wave of security breaches  we believe that more definitive     minimum standards of information security should be required  and that     the Safeguards Rules should be expanded to more clearly cover data     brokers   4  Recognize the Important Role     Of State Legislative and Investigative Efforts  States are     providing key additional protections for consumers      Californias security breach notification law  and the security freeze     laws in California  Louisiana  Texas  and Vermont  are important     examples of the critical role played by states in developing innovative     solutions to the complex problems presented by data breaches  In     addition  State Attorneys General and local law enforcement are playing     critical roles in the investigations surrounding security breaches that     have been disclosed to date  State and local law enforcement officials     are cooperating with their federal counterparts to investigate and     prosecute the perpetrators  and to determine if there were defects in     security systems that may have allowed the breaches to occur  Congress     should recognize these vital functions provided by state and local     authorities  and ensure that these functions are not preempted  Thank     you for giving me the opportunity to testify on this important subject                        Footnotes to Sorrell Testimony Appear Below    Statement     Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary    Hearing On Securing Electronic Personal Data  Striking A Balance    Between Privacy And Commercial And Governmental Use    April 13  2005 I am     pleased the Committee is turning its attention today to the challenges     we face in securing electronic personal data in a digital era  Earlier     this year I wrote to the Chairman and requested this hearing  and I     appreciate his receptiveness  interest and prompt agreement    I     welcome the witnesses here today and look forward to their testimony      Our colleague  Senator Feinstein  has been a leader on these important     issues and I look forward to hearing of her efforts to date  and Senator     Schumer and other members of our Committee  as well as Senator Nelson on     Commerce  have also followed these issues closely and have insights to     offer  I am also pleased to see here today my old friend and fellow     Vermonter  Bill Sorrell  who is the Attorney General of Vermont and now     is president of the National Association of Attorneys General     Personal Information  A Hot     New Commodity In the     past few months  we have become aware of a string of major security     breaches involving large firms such as ChoicePoint  Bank of America and     Seisint  a LexisNexis subsidiary  These incidents demonstrate the     susceptibility of our most personal data to relatively unsophisticated     scams and logistical mishaps  and they raise broader concerns about the     misappropriation of personal information and identity theft  The     ChoicePoint breach was especially troubling for its highlight of a     dangerous vulnerability in the information economy  the inadequate     screening of the customers who are buying this personal information      ChoicePoints bread and butter business includes identity verification     and screening to help corporate America know its     customers  Yet the company failed to know its own customers and sold     personal information on at least 145 000 Americans to criminals posing     as legitimate companies      Advanced technologies  combined with the realties of the post 9 11     digital era  have created strong incentives  opportunities and a robust     market for collecting and selling personal information about each and     every American  Today  all types of corporate and governmental entities     routinely traffic in billions of digitized personal records about     Americans  The sudden rise of giant data brokers has brought much of     this information together for centralized access  We rely on this data     to facilitate financial transactions  provide services  prevent fraud      screen employees  investigate crimes  and find loved ones  In todays     security saturated environment  our own government is using it to know     its residents  These     advances have improved our lives and made us safer  But in this era     where personal information has become a key commodity  the personal     information of Americans has become a treasure trove  valuable and     vulnerable  and our privacy and security laws have not kept pace      Increasingly  those who trade in digital dossiers have no direct     relationship with the individuals and faces behind the numbers or     letters that identify them  so the normal market discipline of     disgruntled consumers does not necessarily save the companies from     themselves  Even where there is a direct relationship  individuals     often have no idea what companies are doing with their personal data or     even what kinds of information is being collected about them  What are     these companies doing with this information  who do they sell it to  and     why  How is it protected  What are the benefits for Americans whose     information has become a new commodity  These are all questions that     too often go unanswered  with unfortunate  and sometimes tragic      results  An     example of tragic consequences from the misuse of personal data is the     case of Amy Boyer  In 1999  a man who had been obsessed with her since     high school bought Amys Social Security number  work address and other     information from data broker Docusearch for  154  He used the     information to track her down and one day came up to her as she was     leaving work and fatally shot her  just before killing himself  In     this information driven age  the use of personal data has significant     consequences for every American  People have been refused jobs because     a database search has wrongly reported that they have a criminal     history  For others caught up in the endless cycle of watching their     credit unravel  undoing the damage caused by security breaches and     identity theft becomes life consuming  Last year  9 3 million Americans     fell victim to identity theft  resulting in losses of more than  52     billion to individuals and corporations  And on average  it took 28     hours to sort out the subsequent problems  and much  much longer for     many victims   Sophisticated Scams In The     Digital Age While     dumpster diving is still a popular method of data theft  increasingly     the focus is on a new low hanging fruit  insecure  where one good hit     nets troves of information  Insecure databases are now low hanging     fruit for hackers looking to steal identities or otherwise misuse data     for financial gain  This is especially true as more and more of     Americans personal information is being processed abroad  Just this     past weekend  it was reported that individuals working for an Indian     data processor stole personal information of Citibank customers and     transferred  350 000 to fake accounts  Last year was the report that a     Pakistani transcriber of medical files from a San     Francisco hospital threatened to post that information on the Internet     unless she received back pay   In yet     another strain of cyber crime and high tech law breaking  we are seeing     a rise in organized rings that target personal data to sell in online      virtual bazaars  These are not your run of the mill criminals  They     increasingly have sophisticated computing skills and steal data using a     full suite of malicious software  or malware  such as Trojan horses      keystroke logging  spyware  and phishing  which I recently introduced a     bill  S 472  to combat   A     recent investigation by the U S  Secret Service revealed that one     criminal group with some 4 000 members  Shadowcrew    traded more than     one million stolen credit card numbers  resulting in financial losses of     more than  4 million  These are challenging scams to penetrate  and I     appreciate and applaud all the work that the Secret Service and other     federal agencies have been doing to crack these cases  Just recently      the Senate Sergeant of Arms posted guidance on identity theft on the     Senate website  State     and local law enforcement have also worked tirelessly to combat cyber     challenges  I know in Vermont  the U S  Small Business     Administration will be hosting a forum to protect small businesses from     the impact of scams and identity theft       Identity theft is a major problem  but when the government is the     purchaser of personal data  citizen inconveniences have also arisen  and     the stakes can be far higher  We have all heard stories from everyday     individuals  as well as colleagues like Senator Kennedy  about the     airline passenger screening programs that use incomplete or bad data to     peg innocent individuals for delay or denied boarding     Protecting National     Security As Well As Financial Security     Weaknesses in the data industry can also jeopardize our law enforcement     and homeland security efforts  Government contractors providing     critical data and processing tools must get it right  Protecting our     borders requires that we prevent security breaches  especially as we     outsource data abroad  that would allow a potential terrorist to steal     Social Security and account numbers and masquerade as law abiding     residents  or simply fund their criminal enterprises  We also need to     know that data brokers are safeguarding the secrecy of law enforcement     investigations and operations where necessary  For example  we need to     ensure that there are no technological weaknesses in the data brokers     systems that are supposed to prevent their employees from viewing FBI     data searches and suspects the Bureau is investigating  Our     hearing today is not about shutting down these data brokers or     abandoning their services  It is about shedding a little sunshine on     current practices and weaknesses  and establishing a sound legal     framework to ensure that privacy  security and civil liberties will not     be pushed aside in this new and evolving age  Today     will be an opportunity to address these concerns as we hear from some of     the industrys leaders  ChoicePoint  Acxiom and LexisNexis  These     companies play a legitimate and valuable role in the information     economy  Their data services facilitate important commercial     transactions  improve hiring decisions  deter fraud  assist law     enforcement and enhance homeland security  But as with any other     significant beneficial industry  the information industry is subject to     mistakes  abuse  and unintended consequences that can flourish absent     transparency  oversight and proper boundaries       Although we are focusing today on several leading data brokers  many     other companies that traffic in personal data use much lower standards     than the companies that have agreed to come under the spotlight today      For example  Docusearch  the company that sold Amy Boyers personal     information to her killer  has said it has no duty to check its     customers backgrounds  This past December  CNN interviewed the founder     of Abika  an Internet based company that performs some three million     background searches annually and creates psychological profiles  He     said  I dont even believe in privacy too much       why do we need     privacy  Thats the question       why do people need privacy    That     kind of sentiment is outrageous and is not one that should be tolerated     in the data industry  But I will answer the question  One of the most     fundamental liberties of being an American is the right to be let alone      and when you invade someones privacy or treat it glibly  you trample on     that liberty  Thats why we need privacy  and thats why we should     vigilantly protect it    A Role For Congress     Congress has a role in protecting Americans privacy  but we need to do     it right  Senator Specter and I  as well as many others on the     Committee  have been examining these issues closely to ensure a     carefully balanced environment that can evaluate the adequacy of current     boundaries and behaviors in the realm of data brokering    We     need to consider rules that will guarantee Americans the right to see     what information has been collected about them and to make corrections     where necessary  We need to consider rules that will ensure Americans     are notified when there has been a security breach involving their     digitized personal information  We also need to create baseline     expectations for data security programs and practices  and penalize     government contractors that dont comply  We also need to look at how     to protect increasingly public  yet vulnerable  sensitive data such as     Social Security numbers  which are the keys to unlocking so much of our     financial and personal lives  A computer glitch at another payroll     company  PayMaxx  allowed any of its customers to see thousands of W 2s     of other company clients  including social security numbers and     salaries  Just this past week  it was reported that Automatic Data     Processing  a company that provides payroll and benefits to     corporations  mailed out postcards to 1000 workers with their Social     Security numbers brazenly visible for anyone to see  Worse still  they     described in detail how those Social Security numbers could be used to     access employee benefits online  This should not happen  We must have     a national dialogue on when and how Social Security numbers can be     properly used      Finally  we need to take a closer look at how the government is using     commercial data  and whether those uses properly balance privacy and     civil liberty concerns  Recently a ChoicePoint executive was quoted as     saying  We do act as an intelligence agency  gathering data  applying     analytics  These partnerships between governments and private data     brokers create new challenges for maintaining privacy standards over     sensitive information involving each and every American    With     such powerful information age tools comes heightened responsibility  As     the 9 11 Commission noted  we must find ways of reconciling security     and liberty  since the success of one helps protect the other  No     doubt  the information industry can enhance law enforcement and homeland     security efforts  But as the Commission also recognized  while     protecting our homeland  Americans should be mindful of threats to vital     personal and civil liberties  This balancing act is no easy task  but     we must constantly strive to keep it right  We can keep it right by     putting mechanisms in place to ensure appropriate checks and balances     and congressional oversight   We     have many issues to consider on this front  Todays hearing will begin     that process by shedding much needed light on a rapidly growing industry     and its practices of handling the most personal information of each and     every American              Footnotes to Sorrell Testimony     Follow       Debaise and Dreazen     Federal
