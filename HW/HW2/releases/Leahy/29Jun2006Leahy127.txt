       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Supreme Court s Decision In Hamdan   Case                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On Supreme Courts Decision In Hamdan Case      June 29  2006 The Justices      have given our system a constitutional tonic that is sorely needed      if we are to counter terrorism effectively  efficiently and with      American values  This decision is a triumph for our constitutional      system of checks and balances  I commend the Justices for acting as      a much needed check on this Administrations unilateral policies      that have clearly stretched the bounds of the Presidents      constitutional authority    I introduced a      bill more than four years ago that would have ensured the      constitutionality of military tribunals and protected any      convictions they might yield  while at the same time showing the      world that we will fight terrorists without sacrificing our values       My bill offered the President a bipartisan model of how to avoid      this mess  He refused to work with me or the Congress but insisted      on going it alone   We can show by      example how we expect our soldiers and citizens to be treated if      they are swept into foreign courts or tribunals  and do it without      ignoring our laws or our principles  The Justices have given our      system a constitutional tonic that is sorely needed if we are to      counter terrorism effectively  efficiently and with American values        For five      years  the Bush Cheney Administration has violated fundamental      American values  tarnished our standing in the world and hindered      the partnerships we need with our allies  This arrogance and      incompetence have delayed and weakened the handling of the war on      terror  not because of any coherent strategic view it had  but      because of its stubborn unilateralism and dangerous theory of      unfettered power   We have spent      a remarkable amount of time in Congress recently in dealing with      symbols and proposed constitutional amendments  We need to refocus      on our priorities and get the war on terror back on a lawful and      constitutional footing  I remain ready to work with the President       as I have repeatedly offered over the years  to ensure that the war      on terror is prosecuted consistent with our laws and fundamental      values
