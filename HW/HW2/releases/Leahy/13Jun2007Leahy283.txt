       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Issuing Of Subpoenas in The  Investigation Of The Firing Of U S  Attorneys                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee   On The Issuing Of Subpoenas  In The Investigation Of The Firing Of U S  Attorneys  June 13  2007 Today  I am issuing on behalf of the Senate Judiciary   Committee subpoenas to the White House in connection with our investigation   into the firing of United States Attorneys around the country  I have   spoken recently with Mr  Fielding  the White House Counsel  and consulted   with the Ranking Republican on the Committee  Regrettably  to date the   White House has not produced a single document nor allowed White House staff   to testify despite our repeated requests for voluntary cooperation over the   last several months   The White Houses stonewalling of the congressional   investigative committees continues its pattern of confrontation over   cooperation  Those who bear the brunt of this approach are the American   people  those dedicated professionals at the Department of Justice who have   tried to remain committed to effective law enforcement in spite of the   untoward political influences from this Administration  and the publics   confidence in our justice system  That is why we must do everything we can   to overcome the Administrations stonewalling and get all the facts out on   the table   The White House cannot have it both ways    it cannot   stonewall congressional investigations by refusing to provide documents and   witnesses and simultaneously claim that nothing improper occurred  The   involvement of the White Houses political operation in these matters    including former Political Director Sara Taylor and her boss Karl Rove  has   been confirmed by information gathered by congressional committees  Some at   the White House may hope to thwart our constitutional oversight efforts by   locking the doors  closing the curtains and hiding under their desks  but we   will keep asking until we get to the truth   The House   Judiciary Committee led by Chairman Conyers is likewise issuing and serving   subpoenas today  Chairman Conyers makes the point that these subpoenas are   not merely requests for information  they are lawful demands on behalf of   the American people through their elected representatives in Congress    The Senate Judiciary Committee is issuing and serving   three subpoenas today  two seeking the documents and testimony of Sara M    Taylor  former Deputy Assistant to the President and Director of Political   Affairs  and another seeking White House documents relevant to the panels   ongoing investigation  Senator Specter and I had written Ms  Taylor seeking   voluntary cooperation on April 11  more than two months ago   As I noted in my cover letter to the new White House   Counsel  Mr  Fielding  I have sent him a half dozen previous letters during   the past three months seeking voluntary cooperation from the White House   with the Senate Judiciary Committees investigation into the mass firings   and replacements of U S  Attorneys and politicization at the Department of   Justice  It is now clear from the evidence gathered by the investigating   Committees of the Senate and House that White House officials played a   significant role in originating  developing  coordinating and implementing   the plan and the Justice Departments response to congressional inquiries   about it  Yet  to date the White House has not produced a single document   or allowed even one White House official involved in these matters to be   interviewed   It has been two and one half months since Republican   and Democratic members of the Senate Judiciary Committee rejected his take   it or leave it offer of off the record  backroom interviews with no follow   up as unacceptable  Despite our numerous efforts to engage and move forward   cooperatively  the White House stayed the course and refused to furnish   information  Mr  Rove and the President have had no reluctance to comment   publicly that there was  in their view  no wrongdoing and nothing improper    Yet  the White House refuses even to share the basis for those denials and   assertions   Again  the White House cannot have it both ways  The   White Houses continued stonewalling leads to the obvious conclusion that   the White House has something to hide  Because the White House has   continued its refusal to provide the requested information to the Senate   Judiciary Committee on a voluntary basis  I issued these subpoenas   Accordingly  we have formally demanded production of   documents in the possession  custody or control of the White House related   to the Committees investigation into the preservation of prosecutorial   independence and the Department of Justices politicization of the hiring   and firing of United States Attorneys  The documents compelled by the   subpoena include documents related to the Administrations evaluation of   and decision to dismiss former U S  Attorneys David Iglesias  H E  Bud   Cummins  John McKay  Carol Lam  Daniel Bogden  Paul Charlton  Kevin Ryan    Margaret Chiara  Todd Graves  or any other U S  Attorney dismissed or   considered for dismissal since President Bushs re election  the   implementation of the dismissal and replacement of the dismissed U S    Attorneys  and the selection  discussion and evaluation ofpossible   replacements  Those dismissals have yet to be explained   Among these documents are documents related to the   involvement of Karl Rove  Harriet E  Miers  William Kelley  J  Scott   Jennings  Sara M  Taylor  or any other current or former White House   employees or officials involved in the firings and replacements as well as   documents related to the testimony of Justice Department officials to   Congress regarding this matter  These would include the purportedly lost   Rove e mails that should have been retrieved by now and should now be   produced without further delay   I am disappointed that I have to turn to subpoenas in   order to obtain information needed by the Committee to fulfill its oversight   responsibilities regarding the firings and the erosion of independence at   the Justice Department  However  the evidence that White House officials   were deeply involved leaves me no choice  in light of the Administrations   lack of voluntary cooperation
