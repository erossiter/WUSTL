       Senate Confirms 205th Bush Judge                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Senate Confirms 205th     Bush Judge Crotty A Consensus     Choice  WASHINGTON  Monday  April 11   The Senate on     Monday evening unanimously confirmed Paul Crotty to be a U S  District     Court Judge for the Southern District of New York  Mr  Crottys     confirmation marks the 205th judicial nominee of President     Bushs to be confirmed by the Senate  Sen  Patrick Leahy   D Vt    the     ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee  described Mr      Crotty as a consensus nominee and an example of how the judicial     nominations process can work smoothly and successfully when there is     meaningful bipartisan consultation  Leahys statement is below       Statement Of Senator Patrick     Leahy     On The Nomination Of Paul Crotty     To Be United States District Court Judge     For The Southern District Of New York     April 11  2005 I am pleased to see     the Senate finally be able to vote on the nomination of Paul Crotty to     be a U S  District Court Judge for the Southern District of New York      The seat to which Mr  Crotty has been nominated has been unnecessarily     vacant for months  and Democrats have been asking for months now  since     last year  for this nominee to be considered  debated  voted on and     confirmed   As I have noted in     earlier statements in the Judiciary Committee  among this Presidents     renominations there are two noncontroversial judicial nominations on     which we should have been able to make immediate progress  I have often     spoken of the Presidents nomination of Mr  Crotty to the District Court     for the Southern District of New York and the nomination of Michael     Seabright to the District Court of Hawaii  All Democrats on the     Judiciary Committee have been prepared to vote favorably on these     nominations for some time  We were prepared to report them last year but     they were not listed by the then Chairman on a Committee agenda  I thank     Chairman Specter to including them at our meeting on March 17    Last week  I noted     that both these consensus nominations were continuing to languish     without action on the Senate Calendar and that the Senate Republican     leadership was refusing to work with us to schedule them for action  I     thank the Senate Republican leadership for being willing to turn to the     Crotty nomination this evening  I hope that they will not make Mr      Seabright  the people of Hawaii and the Hawaii District Court wait much     longer before we are allowed to consider  debate and confirm Michael     Seabright  as well   Once confirmed  Mr      Crotty will be the 205th of 215 nominees brought before the     full Senate for a vote to be confirmed  That means that 829 of the 875     authorized judgeships in the federal judiciary  or 95 percent  will be     filled  As late as it is in the year  we are still ahead of the pace     the Republican majority set in 1999  when President Clinton was in the     White House  That year  the Senate Republican leadership did not allow     the Senate to consider the first judicial nominee until April 15   Of the 46 judicial     vacancies now existing  President Bush has not even sent nominees for 28     of those vacancies  more than half  I have been encouraging the Bush     Administration to work with Senators to identify qualified and consensus     judicial nominees and do so  again  today   It is now the second     week in April  we are more than one quarter through the year and so far     the President has sent only one new nominee for a federal court vacancy     all year  only one  Instead of sending back divisive nominees  would     it not be better for the country  the courts  the American people  the     Senate and the Administration if the White House would work with us to     identify  and for the President to nominate  more consensus nominees     like Paul Crotty who can be confirmed quickly with strong  bipartisan     votes  I commend the Senators     from New York for their ability and efforts in connection with     Mr  Crottys nomination  Their support is very helpful and indicative     of the type of bipartisan efforts Senate Democrats have made with this     President and remain willing to make  We can work together to fill     judicial vacancies with qualified  consensus nominees  The vast     majority of the more than 200 judges confirmed during the last three and     one half years were confirmed with bipartisan support  The truth is     that in President Bushs first term  the 204 judges confirmed were more     than were confirmed in either of President Clinton two terms  more than     during the term of this Presidents father  and more than in Ronald     Reagans first term when he was being assisted by a Republican majority     in the Senate  By last December  we had reduced judicial vacancies from     the 110 vacancies I inherited in the summer of 2001 to the lowest level      lowest rate and lowest number in decades  since Ronald Reagan was in     office   There should be no     misunderstanding  Mr  Crotty has strong Republican ties  He worked as     Corporation Counsel for then Mayor Rudolph Giuliani  and served in    New York City government in a variety of posts over the years      After the terrorist attack on September 11  2001  Mr  Crotty played a     major role in coordinating Verizon s work in restoring telephone service     to the New York Stock Exchange  Federal  State and local agencies and     large business customers  He continues to play a significant role in     Verizon s revitalization of its telephone network in Lower Manhattan      In 2002  Mr  Crotty led Verizon s efforts in a complex administrative     proceeding to gain the New York Public Service Commission s     authorization to rebalance retail revenues in light of the increasing     competition in New York s communication market  Mr  Crotty has also     given generously of his time and currently serves on the Boards of the     Lower Manhattan Development Corporation  Tri State United Way  where he     is also the Corporate Secretary  Polytechnic University  Council of     Governing Boards  St  Vincent s Hospital Manhattan  New York State     Business Development Corporation  Regional Plan Association  and the New     York Urban League  He has served on the Executive Committee of the     Association of the Bar of the City of New York since 2001  In     addition Mr  Crotty serves on the Advisory Boards of the New York Law     School and the C U N Y  Irish Studies program  Senate Democrats have     long supported and requested action on this nomination  We will be     delighted that the New York Senators will be able to call Mr  Crotty     tonight and tell him that after five months of unnecessary delay the     Senate finally did consider his nomination and granted consent     overwhelmingly  I add my congratulations to Mr  Crotty and his family  I have been urging     this President and Senate Republicans for years to work with all     Senators and engage in genuine  bipartisan consultation  That process     leads to the nomination  confirmation and appointment of consensus     nominees with reputations for fairness  The Crotty nomination  the     bipartisan support of his home state Senators and the Senates act of     granting its consent tonight with a strong bipartisan vote is a perfect     example of what I have been urging   I have noted that     there are currently 28 judicial vacancies for which the President has     delayed sending a nominee  In fact  he has sent the Senate only one new     judicial nominee all year  I wish he would work with all Senators to     fill those remaining vacancies rather than through his inaction and     unnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture longstanding     vacancies  It is as if the President and his most partisan supporters     want to create a crisis  Last week we heard some extremists call for     mass impeachments of judges  court stripping and punishing judges by     reducing court budgets  Rather than promote crisis and confrontation  I     urge that this President do what most others have and work with us to     identify outstanding consensus nominees  It ill serves the country  the     courts and most importantly the American people for this Administration     and the Senate Republican leadership to continue down the road to     conflict  The Crotty nomination shows how unnecessary that conflict     really is  Let us join together to debate and confirm these consensus     nominees to these important lifetime posts on the federal judiciary      It is the federal     judiciary that is called upon to rein in the political branches when     their actions contravene the Constitution limits on governmental     authority and restrict individual rights  It is the federal judiciary     that has stood up to the overreaching of this Administration in the     aftermath of the September 11 attacks  It is more and more the federal     judiciary that is being called upon to protect Americans rights and     liberties  our environment and to uphold the rule of law as the     political branches under the control of one party have overreached      Federal judges should protect the rights of all Americans  not be     selected to advance a partisan or personal agenda  Once the judiciary     is filled with partisans beholden to the Administration and willing to     reinterpret the Constitution in line with the Administrations demands      who will be left to protect American values and the rights of the     American people  The Constitution establishes the Senate as a check and     a balance on the choices of a powerful President who might seek to make     the federal judiciary an extension of his Administration or a     wholly owned subsidiary of any political party   Today  Republicans are     threatening to take away one of the few remaining checks on the power of     the Executive branch by their use of what has become knows as the     nuclear option  This assault on our tradition of checks and balances     and on the protection of minority rights in the Senate and in our     democracy should be abandoned   Eliminating the     filibuster by the nuclear option would destroy the Constitutions design     of the Senate as an effective check on the Executive  The elimination     of the filibuster would reduce any incentive for a President to consult     with home state Senators or seek the advice of the Senate on lifetime     appointments to the federal judiciary  It is a leap not only toward     one party rule but to an unchecked executive  Rather than blowing up     the Senate  let us honor the constitutional design of our system of     checks and balances and work together to fill judicial vacancies with     consensus nominees  The nuclear option is unnecessary  What is needed     is a return to consultation and for the White House to recognize and     respect the role of the Senate appointments process   The American people     have begun to see this threatened partisan power grab for what it is and     to realize that the threat and the potential harm are aimed at our     democracy  at an independent and strong federal judiciary and      ultimately  at their rights and freedoms  Tonights confirmation is a     civics lesson that shows that the Republicans threatened use of the     nuclear option is unnecessary and unwise
