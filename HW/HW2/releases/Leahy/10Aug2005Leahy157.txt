million  that he has      secured in the transportation bill that President Bush will sign      into law Wednesday  These Vermont projects have not previously been      announced    The President      will speak about and sign the transportation bill Wednesday at about      11 30 a m  in Montgomery  Ill    Our communities and our commerce are      big winners in this updated transportation bill  Leahy said       These are much needed road  bridge  and telecommunication      infrastructure upgrades that will make a real difference in the      daily lives of Vermonters   Leahy said the overall bill  which      includes a wide variety of previously announced Vermont projects  is      a credit to Sen  Jim Jeffords  I Vt    the Ranking Member of the      Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  which handled the      Senates work in writing the bill  Earlier announcements have      listed projects included in the bill by Jeffords  Leahy and Rep       Bernie Sanders  The following is a newly announced list of projects      that Leahy also included in the transportation bill           U S  Route 2      Improvements in Danville   5 million       The Danville Project is a partnership of the Vermont Agency of      Transportation  VTrans   the Vermont Arts Council  and the Town of      Danville to maintain and reinforce local aesthetic and cultural      values in downtown Danville while upgrading the portion of U S       Route 2 that runs through the heart of the rural village center       The Arts Council was approached five years ago to involve artists in      the design process to help the Town define its own vision for its      future within the context of this large public works project       Consensus was reached in 2002 on how to proceed with the design      elements  and Leahy secured the first funds for the roadwork portion      of the project    nearly  2 million    last year  These new funds      bring the total secured by Leahy for the project to  7 million        These road and streetscape improvements in Danville are essential      in improving traffic safety along Route 2  said Leahy  Thanks to      community leaders in Danville  officials at VTrans and the Vermont      Arts Council  Danville will get a safer and more efficient road that      honors Danvilles past while providing for its future  This      partnership and what it has achieved can be a model in Vermont for      how to coordinate transportation upgrades and community      development           Johnson Main Street      and Pearl Street Bridges   5 million       Building upon the nearly  2 million that Leahy secured for the      Johnson Main Street Revitalization Project last year  Leahy obtained      an additional  5 million this year to rehabilitate two bridges in      the village center  The funds will be split  providing  3 6 million      for the Main Street Bridge  and  1 4 million for the Pearl Street      Bridge  The entire project will rebuild the bridges  provide a      pedestrian friendly sidewalk system and a new bicycle travel system       and install traffic calming improvements downtown throughout the      village         These improvements will help make the village an easier place in      which to work or shop or stroll  while also making it a nicer place      to visit  said Leahy  The Vermont Council on Rural Development s      community visit a few years ago laid out a vision for the future of      the town  The citizens of Johnson  Town Manager Duncan Hastings       and the town s legislative delegation of Floyd Nease and Susan      Barlett worked diligently to bring the Main Street Project      together  Pedestrians and cyclists will be safer  and the village      will maintain its unique Vermont appeal  These bridge and road      improvements will make the village an easier place to do business      and a nicer place to go for a walk or a bike ride           Church Street      Improvements in Burlington   6 million       With this  6 million allocation  coupled with  1 8 million in      previous funding  Leahy has secured nearly  8 million to help repair      the successful Church Street Marketplace over the past four years       The Marketplace has identified the following areas of need in the      projects capital improvement program  improvements to its      antiquated electrical system  additional brick and amenities      replacement  information directories and kiosks  alleyway      improvements leading to the Bank Street parking garage  and expanded      bricking for the side streets  Cherry  Bank  College  and Main                 Burlington      Waterfront Transportation Improvements   3 5 million       The City of Burlington is planning to improve vehicle  pedestrian       and bicycle access to the waterfront  In order to accommodate the      College Street Shuttle  roadway improvements will be made and a bus      shelter will be built in front of ECHO at the Leahy Center for Lake      Champlain  The City is also working on designs for safer pedestrian      access across several points along Battery Street  as well as a      reconfiguration of the Depot Street North Avenue intersection             Forward thinking and people friendly improvements like these have      helped downtown Burlington to remain vital and vigorous  said      Leahy  Church Street and the Burlington Waterfront have been      dramatically transformed over the past 20 years  and these      investments will help to continue the transformation           U S  Route 2 and      I 89 Interchange  Exit 14  Improvements   7 million       This funding will help alleviate traffic congestion at the I 89 and      Williston Road interchange in South Burlington  The State of      Vermont and the Chittenden County Metropolitan Planning Organization      recently completed a scoping study which called for major      improvements at this heavily used and often congested intersection       Leahy secured these funds to construct the recommended enhancements           Colchester Campus      Road Project   1 million       As part of the ongoing Route 15 Corridor Improvement Plan  a roadway      and pedestrian path is planned in Colchester to connect the main      campus of St  Michaels College to its Fort Ethan Allen Campus and      to the Fanny Allen Hospital Campus  The project will connect the      existing roadways of Winchester Place Road to Johnson Avenue and      provide enhanced interconnectivity by developing pedestrian  bike      and shuttle bus service away from busy Route 15  Leahy previously      secured  1 million to start the planning for this project two years      ago        Route 15 is a busy road  which is a mixed blessing for the      residents and students in Colchester  Its convenient but not all      that comfortable to walk across  Leahy said  These road      improvements and the Johnson Avenue extension will improve traffic      flow along the corridor and improve pedestrian and biker safety           Essex Junction      Downtown Improvements   1 million       Leahy secured another  1 million for the Village of Essex Junction      to continue with roadway  sidewalk  streetscape and pedestrian      improvements in the Village downtown  The Village has put all      necessary design plans and programs in place to complete the road      upgrade  the installation of curbing and sidewalks  and the      installation of street lighting and traffic signals  These      improvements are an essential step in revitalizing this historic      village center that was once a major railroad hub in Vermont and in      building upon the nearly  500 000 that Leahy secured for this      project last year        These improvements will help breathe new life into Essex Junctions      historic downtown center  said Leahy  The streetscape and street      lighting upgrades will improve the efficiency of traffic patterns      and the safety of pedestrians           Vermont Statewide      Rural Advanced Traveler System And Fiber Construction   10 million       These funds will be used to continue development of a rural advanced      traveler information system in Vermont by wiring the states      highways for broadband service  The State of Vermont is in the      midst of an ambitious effort to develop an interactive  web based      database comprised of travel and tourism information about the      state  A major component of this effort is a rural advanced      traveler information system that provides weather and road condition      information to motorists  and which ties into the overall marketing      of Vermonts travel and tourism  With funds that Leahy has set      aside in previous years  the State of Vermont has developed the      infrastructure necessary to sustain a web based information system      that is accessible from information locations around the state and      that can be accessed through       These funds will likely be      adequate to install broadband fiber along all of Interstates 89 and      91  That fiber  frequently referred to as the telecommunications      highway of the 21st Century  will not only serve the      rural traveler information system but also improve broadband      internet and telecommunications access
