       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  100 Days  Senate Accomplishments So Far   in The 110th Congress                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement    Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Judiciary Committee    100 Days  Senate Accomplishments So Far In The 110th Congress    Senate Floor   April 12  2007    Today we mark the 100th day of the    new Congress  While we have much more to do on behalf of the American    people  much has already been accomplished  We have heard the American    peoples call for accountability and competence in their government and have    started making those goals a reality  We have returned the focus to the    rights and interests of the American people   Just as I have commended the Members of the    Judiciary Committee for their help and active participation in the work of    our Committee  I come to the Senate today to thank the Majority Leader and    those Senators who have been working so hard to restore balance to our    government  protect the liberties and rights of all Americans and revive    Americas leadership in the world     First and foremost  we are making progress restoring the Senate and the    Congress to their proper constitutional role  From the FBIs illegal and    improper use of National Security Letters to the politically motivated    dismissal of so many of the Nations U S  Attorneys  there are concerns    about the competence and independence of the Department of Justice  This    pattern of abuse of authority and mismanagement causes me  and many others    on both sides of the aisle  to wonder whether the FBI and Department of    Justice have been faithful stewards of the great trust that the Congress and    American people have placed in them  We need to keep our Nation safe  while    respecting the privacy rights and civil liberties of all Americans  Last    year in the former Congress  the Administration sought expanded powers in    the PATRIOT Act reauthorization to appoint U S  Attorneys without Senate    confirmation  and to more freely use National Security Letters  The    Administration got these powers  and they have badly bungled both     The Judiciary Committee early oversight    efforts included our January 18 hearing with Attorney General Gonzales     There we examined the change in course of this Administration  which had    engaged in warrantless wiretapping of Americans contrary to the law for    years  Under the watchful eye of the new Congress  the Presidents program    for warrantless wiretaps on Americans has been revised and the government is    seeking approval for all such wiretaps from the Foreign Intelligence    Surveillance Court  as the law requires    We must engage in all surveillance necessary    to prevent acts of terrorism  but we can and should do so in ways that    protect the basic rights of all Americans  including the right to privacy     The issue has never been whether to monitor suspected terrorists but doing    it legally and with proper checks and balances to prevent abuses  The    Administrations recent reversal of course and was a good first step   Last month we held an oversight hearing with    FBI Director Mueller in which we called him to task for the longstanding FBI    abuses of national security letters  The Inspector Generals report we    insisted be provided included troubling findings of widespread illegal and    improper use of National Security Letters to obtain Americans phone     financial  credit and other records  Inspector General Glenn Fine testified    that there could be thousands of additional violations among the tens of    thousands of National Security Letters that the FBI is now using each year     The Inspector General also found widespread use by the FBI of so called    exigent letters  These letters  which are not authorized by any statute     were issued at least 739 times to obtain Americans phone records when there    was often no emergency and never a follow up subpoena  as the FBI had    promised  Despite these extensive abuses  the top leadership at the FBI sat    idly by for years  doing nothing to stop this practice    We questioned the FBI Director about these    matters and reports that the FBI has repeatedly submitted inaccurate    information to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court in its efforts to    obtain secret warrants in terrorism and espionage cases    severely    undermining the Governments credibility in the eyes of the Chief Judge of    that Court  These abuses are unacceptable  Director Mueller now knows that    and knows that these abuses and violations can no longer be continued or    repeated    The Judiciary Committee is now in the midst of    an investigation in which we are uncovering an abuse of power that threatens    the independence of U S  Attorneys offices around the country and that    undermines the trust and confidence of all Americans in federal law    enforcement  We are examining the mass firings of U S  Attorneys and are    trying to get to the truth in order to prevent these kinds of abuses from    happening again    I want the American people to have a Justice    Department and United States Attorneys offices that enforce the law without    regard to political influence and partisanship  I want the American people    to have confidence in federal law enforcement and I want our federal law    enforcement officers to have the independence they need to be effective and    merit the trust of the American people      Sadly  what we have heard from the Administration has been a series of    shifting explanations and excuses and a lack of accountability or    acknowledgement of the seriousness of this matter  The women and men    replaced and whose reputations were then stained by those seeking to justify    these firings as performance related were appointees of President Bush     Several had significant achievements in office and glowing performance    reviews    As we learn more details about the ousters of    these U S  Attorneys the story grows more troubling  Had we accepted the    initial testimony of the Attorney General and other Department officials we    would not have gotten to the truth  The White House and the Attorney    General have dodged Congresss questions and ducked real accountability for    years  In the past they counted on a rubberstamping Congress to avoid    accountability  The American people have a new Congress  one that looks for    answers      The Attorney General has admitted mistakes were made without specifying    what they were  He will have another chance to tell the whole truth next    Tuesday at our next Judiciary Committee oversight hearing  The days when he    could come by once a year and not answer questions are over     I made no secret during his confirmation    hearing of my concern whether Mr  Gonzales could serve as an independent    Attorney General of the United States on behalf of the American people and    leave behind his role as counselor to President Bush  The Department of    Justice should serve the American people by making sure the law is enforced    without fear or favor  It should not be turned into a political arm of the    White House      For years preceding this new Congress  accountability has been lacking in    this Administration  Loyalty to the President has been rewarded over all    else  That lack of accountability  and lack of the checks and balances that    fostered it  must end and  I hope  has ended    We do not need another commendation for the    heckuva job done by those who have failed in their essential duties to the    American people  True accountability means being forthcoming  and it means    there are consequences for improper actions    The White House continues to stand by the    firings of the U S  attorneys and despite assurances by the President that    we would receive cooperation  documents and access to witnesses  the White    House has yet to produce a single document or make any witnesses available      Now we are learning that the off book    communications they were having about these actions  by using Republican    political email addresses  have not been preserved  Like the famous    18 minute gap in the Nixon White House tapes  it appears likely that key    documentation has been erased or misplaced  This sounds like the    Administrations version of the dog ate my homework  I am deeply disturbed    that just when this Administration is finally subjected to meaningful    oversight  it cannot produce the necessary information  This Administration    has worn out the benefit of the doubt and undermined whatever credibility it    had left  The American people are right that they are entitled to full and    honest public testimony of the White House staff responsible for this    debacle      We have asked for Administration officials and now former officials to    cooperate with the Judiciary Committee in its inquiry and I hope that they    will  Through the Committees oversight work so far  we know some of the    answers to some of the questions we have been asking  and the answers are    troubling  We have learned that most of the U S  Attorneys that were asked    to resign were doing their jobs well and were fired for not bending to the    political will of some in Washington  Apparently  their reward for their    efforts at rooting out serious public corruption is a kick out the door      Along with these oversight matters the    Judiciary Committee has taken up questions relating to the war in Iraq and    congressional authority to condition funding  the plight of Iraqi refugees     the recommendation of the Iraq Study Group on policing and the    administration of justice in Iraq  and contracting fraud and abuse in Iraq     We have examined enforcement of our antitrust laws  restoring open    government by reinvigorating the Freedom of Information Act  ending    antitrust immunity for insurers  increasing drug competition  strengthening    protections against identity theft and providing for fair and comprehensive    immigration reform   We have also moved legislative initiatives     Indeed  I think the first legislation passed by the Senate this year was our    bill to restore the cost of living adjustment for federal judges  We have    passed a bill to amend the reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act to honor    the contribution of Cesar Chavez and other outstanding Americans  We passed    by a bipartisan vote of 94 to 2 a bill to repeal that part of the PATRIOT    Act reauthorization that had contributed to the U S  attorney firings and    thereby moved decisively to repeal the Attorney Generals unlimited    authority to appoint so called interim U S  Attorneys without Senate    consideration  At long last  we have given final passage to the bill    against animal fighting that has languished for so many years  And we have    passed the Genocide Accountability Act  the first legislative result of the    new subcommittee I worked with Senator Durbin to create within the Judiciary    Committee on Human Rights and the Law    I hope that the Senate will soon be    considering a number of our other legislative initiatives  We have reported    a court security bill  S 378  a bill to increase drug competition by giving    the FTC authority to stop drug companies from paying other companies not to    compete  S 316  a bill to establish a school loan program for those willing    to serve as prosecutors and public defenders  S 442  and legislation to    reauthorize the successful Byrne grant program for law enforcement  S 231     A number of additional items are not far behind  including a bill to    reauthorize the COPS program  S 368  and a bill that Senators Sessions and    Senator Landrieu cosponsored attacking fraud in disaster and emergency    relief funding  I hope to see action on our bill against war profiteering     S 119  as well    The new Congress is off to a strong start in    restoring accountability  in revitalizing the checks and balances of our    system  and in earning back the publics trust in government that has eroded    during a rubberstamp Congress  Much remains to be done but we have made    meaningful progress in just 100 days
