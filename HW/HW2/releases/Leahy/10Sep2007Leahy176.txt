       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Preserving Strong Relations With Our   International Neighbors                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Preserving Strong Relations With Our International Neighbors    September 10  2007    Among the important issues I wish to discuss this     morning is an international border issue with our friendly neighbors in     Canada and Mexico that could have severe implications for the social and     economic ways of life for border communities in Vermont and all across     our country   In the wake of the September 11 terrorist attacks      a number of new border security measures have been put in place  all     with the expressed goal of preventing another terrorist incident  I     worked hard to provide balance and needed resources and to ensure that     in the intervening years we did not focus solely on our Southern     Border  I have also tried to convey something of the special     relationship we have with our northern neighbor Canada   It is convenient to forget that most of the 9 11     hijackers entered the United States with legal visas  that some were on     secret watch lists but not being watched  and that this Administration     was sending them official letters even after they had killed themselves     and thousands of innocent people in their attacks  In reaction  the     Administration has demanded billions for constructing border fences      seeking to develop and deploy surveillance technologies  and adding     troops along our borders  We have snared some illicit drugs shipments     and snared a few criminals  but not many terrorists   We must protect our borders  but do it sensibly and     intelligently  Instead  the Administrations policy threatens to fray     the social fabric of countless communities that straddle the border      they have needlessly offended our neighbors  sacrificed much of the     traditional good will we have enjoyed  and undermined our own economy in     border states  Local chambers of commerce along the border estimate     that the costs will amount to hundreds of billions of dollars   I have heard from many Vermonters about problems     they have encountered at U S  border crossings  from long traffic     backups to invasive searches and questioning to inadequate communication     from federal authorities about new facilities and procedures  Such a     top down approach does not work well in interwoven communities along the     border  where people cross daily from one side to the other for jobs      shopping  and cultural events   Canada has been an important trading partner and     friendly neighbor to Vermont and the United States for more than 200     years  It is in the best interests of both of our countries to keep     those relations as positive and productive as possible  Post 9 11      everyone on both sides of the border recognizes that there are potential     threats and security needs  We have hardened security around this     Capitol and the White House and built fences near San Diego  Those     procedures do not work on Canusa Avenue in Beebe Plain  a two lane road     where one side of the street is the Vermont and the other side is     Quebec  or at the Haskell Free Library and Opera House in Derby Line      Vermont  and Stanstead  Quebec  which straddles the international     border   That is why I am so troubled by the so called     Western Hemisphere Travel Initiative  or WHTI  which will require     individuals from the United States  Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean to     present passports or other documents proving citizenship before entering     the United States  This is a dramatic change in the way that border     crossing have been processed in the Western Hemisphere since the Treaty     of Paris set up the international boundary with Canada in 1783  It is     already costing us greatly  The Departments of State and Homeland Security have     been charged with implementing this law  and should be coordinating     their efforts with our neighbors in Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean to     ensure a smooth transition at our borders  Unfortunately  as I have     detailed to Secretary Rice and Secretary Chertoff on several occasions      there are serious problems in the ways in which their agencies have     pushed forward with implementation of the Western Hemisphere Travel     Initiative  before the necessary technology installation  infrastructure     upgrades  and training take place at our border stations  If these     critical features of the deployment are not in place  we will see severe     delays at our border and law abiding citizens from the United States      Canada  Mexico  and the Caribbean will have great difficulty moving     between our countries  Most importantly  a hasty implementation without     assurances that the technology to be used is truly effective can result     in a less secure border  Month after month and despite hearing after     hearing  DHS and State have high handedly rushed to impose this new     border crossing plan on the American people before they are ready with     the necessary technology  infrastructure  and training  and at every     step their rosy assurances have been wrong  The Administrations record     on implementing the new passport program is clear  and it has been     abysmal  Hundreds of Vermonters have been calling my office for     assistance in salvaging their travel plans  and I know that Americans     from other state have experienced high levels of concern and problems      as well  We have been doing what we can  passport by passport  but a     large backlog persists  The huge passport backlogs  prompted by the launch     of DHSs requirement for air travel passports earlier this year  are     just a taste of the chaos that is likely next summer when they want to     start enforcing passport checks at our land and sea borders  Those land     and sea border crossings account for 10 times more than the volume than     crossings from air travel   I have been urging the State Department and the     Department of Homeland Security not to rush into establishing rules and     procedures that shut our borders to legitimate travel and trade and      instead  coordinate with our neighbors on security plans  We can be     smarter and more effective if  rather than arrogantly insulting our     traditional friends we work with them on joint intelligence operations     to identify and target terrorist  Unfortunately  my calls  and the pleas from border     communities from Maine to Alaska and  for that matter  from California     to Texas  have been largely ignored  This Administration is setting     the American people up  yet again  for a fiasco of failure and     frustration   Since DHS and State keep saying that the WHTI is a     congressionally mandated program  they should stop opposing the     bicameral and bipartisan legislation now moving through Congress to     shift the new passport requirement to June 2009  They have been warned     repeatedly that they are not ready  Even the fresh embarrassment of     this passport debacle has not humbled them  In the memorable words of     President Bush  they are doing a heckuva job  The incompetence that     led to the human and economic tragedy of Katrina and its aftermath  a     tragedy that has not been rectified for more than two years  is     striking  again  By maintaining the fiction that they will be ready to     implement the largest phase of this program next January  they are     recklessly risking the travel plans of millions of Americans and the     economies of scores of states and communities  Today is September 10th  Tomorrow is     the sixth anniversary of the attacks  The Administrations failure to     prevent those attacks  to connect the dots  to take seriously the     warnings of Richard Clarke  to listen to FBI field agents in Minnesota     and Arizona    all because of the preeminence of its ideological agenda        is no longer subject to denial  Those failures  however  are no     excuse to indulge in authoritarian excesses now and in the future   When we sacrifice our freedoms  Americans lose and     the terrorists have taken from us what they cannot by force of arms  As     we commemorate the sacrifices of so many that took place six years ago     tomorrow  we need to rededicate ourselves to American principles and     values   In the days ahead the Judiciary Committee will be     holding a series of hearing into important security matters  Today I am     writing to the Director of National Intelligence inviting him to join us     on September 25th for a hearing into warrantless surveillance     of Americans  I am not convinced that the sweeping scope and lack of     checks and balances in the recently enacted temporary amendment to the     Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act are necessary to address the     national security concerns that the Administration had identified  As     elected representatives of the American people we need to consider     whether there are more effective mechanisms to ensure appropriate     oversight of surveillance involving U S  persons  We need to restore     the proper balance in order to maintain our security while preserving     the constitutional rights of Americans and providing appropriate     oversight of Executive action involving private communications of     Americans   Just this past weekend we saw reports indicating     that the Presidents surveillance programs of Americans was much more     extensive that he led us to believe  The New York Times reported     that the FBI was not just concerned about known or even suspected Al     Qaeda operatives  as the President and his spokespeople repeated over     and over since the programs became known in December 2005  but with     casting a much wider net for information about what is termed a     community of interest  We need to examine how far this so called link     analysis has gone  how far down the daisy chain it has gone  what use     was made of the private call information and whether private information     of innocent Americans has been collected and retained in government     databases without congressional authorization  How many innocent     Americans who called someone  who called someone else  who may have had     some innocent contact with someone else  are now in a government     database  It is telling that as this story became public the FBI     responded by saying that this data is no longer being used and was     used infrequently  Is the Administration nonetheless going to prevent     Congress from obtaining the information in needs to provide appropriate     oversight  Will our patriotism be threatened anew if Congress seeks to     examine the Administrations overreaching and ineffectiveness  I hope     not but we will have to see  The very first hearing we held before the     Senate Judiciary Committee this year was on datamining  With the     leadership shown by Senator Feingold  we have passed a reporting     requiring on government datamining  We now need to follow up and get     the information we need and exercise oversight authority   The first week in October we are looking forward to     hearing from Professor Jack Goldsmith who served at a critical juncture     in 2004 as the Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal     Counsel at the Department of Justice  In that capacity he considered     the constitutional underpinnings of the Presidents warrantless     wiretapping program and helped lead the way to changes in that     clandestine surveillance affecting the rights of Americans   This past week we were reminded yet again of the     need to improve the operations of the Terrorist Screening Center  which     failed to make watch list records on suspected or known terrorists     available to frontline screening agents but continues to list the names     of innocent Americans in its watch list database  We saw a recent     Government Accountability Office report on the Department of Homeland     Security with its failing grades  having failed to achieve half its     performance expectations since 2003  We heard from an independent     commission of former military leaders that indicated the Iraqi police     forces are so riddled with corruption and sectarianism that they should     be disbanded and  after 4 years and hundreds of millions of American     taxpayer dollars  we should start over from scratch  This past week also provided a reminder of the need     to refocus our efforts on Bin Laden  Six years after 9 11 he has not     been brought to justice but continues to taunt us  He should never have     been allowed to escape when our forces had him cornered in Tora Bora      Withdrawing our special forces and not providing the support needed then     was another mistake driven by ideology  The bipartisan leaders of the     9 11 Commission are right that the occupation of Iraq has provided a     recruiting bonanza for Al Qaeda and a costly distraction  We need to be     smarter and more focused in countering terrorism   How many costly mistakes are the American people     going to be asked to bear  I hope all Senators  Republicans and     Democrats  will join together in the days ahead as we did six years     ago  The American people deserve a government that works and that works     for them  American freedom and values need to be defended and     reinforced  not mortgaged to fleeting and ill considered promises of     security
