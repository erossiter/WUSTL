       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy To The President s FOIA Executive   Order                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy     To The Presidents FOIA Executive Order     December 14  2005 I welcome the      Presidents initiative because it will foster better compliance and      signal to federal agencies that the President recognizes that the      government needs to upgrade its performance in implementing FOIA       The Executive Order has the potential to improve agency handling of      FOIA requests  including better customer service  In these ways it      encompasses the spirit of some of the measures that Senator John      Cornyn and I included in our comprehensive legislation  the Open      Government Act  and in the bill we introduced to analyze the sources      of processing delays  the Faster FOIA Act  The Executive Order also      includes some useful reform and reporting measures   I appreciate that      most FOIA officers do their best to process requests efficiently       but lengthy delays and significant backlogs have persisted at many      agencies  The changes mandated by the Executive Order may help  but      they only require agencies to look within  Input from FOIA      requestors is also necessary in aggressively reducing agency delay       That is the approach that I have taken with Senator Cornyn in our      legislation   The Executive      Order is a constructive step  but it is not the comprehensive      reforms we need  The Open      Government Act takes a much more forceful approach to reforming FOIA      implementation  The Act underscores FOIAs presumption of openness      and that effective government depends more than on the need to know  it depends on the fundamental right to      know  Our bill would strengthen FOIA and close loopholes  put teeth in the statutory deadlines for      agency responses  and provide FOIA      officials with all of the tools they need to ensure that our      government remains open and accessible   I welcome the      Presidents statement  but we can do better
