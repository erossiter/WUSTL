       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Cloture On The Immigration Reform   Debate                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy   Cloture On The Immigration Reform       Debate   May 24  2006  I hope that this morning we will       begin to draw to a close the Republican filibuster against       comprehensive immigration reform  I have been encouraged that       since our return to this legislation this month the President       has spoken out in favor of comprehensive immigration reform with       an essential component being a realistic path to earned       citizenship for those who work hard  pay their taxes and       contribute so much to our American way of life  When       Republicans filibustered against two cloture votes last month        including one on a motion by the Republican Leader  I was       disappointed  I had hoped we would recognize the lawful        heartfelt protests of millions against the harsh House passed       criminalization measures  While they waved American flags  some       of those fueling anti immigrant feelings burned flags of other       countries  I hope that through this debate we have been able to       convince enough Senate Republicans to join us in our efforts and       to appreciate the contributions of immigrants to our economy and       our nation   This bill is not all that it       should be  Yesterday we short circuited efforts to make it more       flexible for those persecuted around the world  This country       has had a history of being welcoming to refugees and those       seeking asylum from persecution  Yesterday the Senate turned       its back on that history by refusing to allow the Secretary of       State the flexibility needed after restrictive language was       added by the REAL ID Act to our laws  I hope Senators will       reconsider these issues with more open minds and hearts and a       fully understanding of the lives being affected  Sadly too        many were spooked by false arguments   I have made no secret that I       preferred the better outline of the Judiciary Committee bill        The bill the Senate is now considering is a further compromise        Debate and amendments have added some improvements and some       significant steps in the wrong direction  Besides the failures       yesterday to readjust its asylum provisions to take into account       the realities of oppressive forces in many parts of the world  I       was most disappointed that the Senate appeared to be so       anti Hispanic in its adoption of the Inhofe English amendment        Yesterday Senator Salazar and I       following up on this provision and       the comments of the Attorney General last week and weekend  We       asked whether the President will continue to implement the       language outreach policies of President Clinton s Executive       Order 13166  A prompt and straightforward affirmative answer       can go a long way toward rendering the Inhofe English amendment       a symbolic stain rather than a serious impediment to immigrants       and Americans for whom English is a second language  I ask       consent that a copy of our letter be included in the record   There are growing rumors that some       who oppose comprehensive immigration reform will not be deterred       by a supermajority vote for cloture and are considering various       procedural points of order to delay or derail Senate action in       the nation s interest  I hope that they will reconsider and       join with us in a constructive way to enact comprehensive       immigration reform  We do not need more divisiveness and       derision  This bill is not the bill I would have designed  It       includes many features I do not support and fails to include       many that I do  Nonetheless  I will support cloture and will       continue to work to enact bipartisan  comprehensive immigration       reform
