Passes Senate      On Course To Increase Government Transparency WASHINGTON  Monday  Aug  6   The      U S  Senate has passed sweeping bipartisan legislation that will      streamline and increase government transparency  The OPEN      Government Act of 2007  S 849   introduced by Judiciary Committee      Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Senator John Cornyn  R Texas   a      member of the panel  passed Friday night by unanimous consent        For more than four decades  FOIA has translated the great American      values of openness and accountability into practice by guaranteeing      access to government information  said Leahy  a longtime leader on      FOIA legislation and government transparency  The OPEN Government      Act will help ensure that these important values remain a      cornerstone of our American democracy       The OPEN Government Act  the first major strengthening of FOIA in      more than a decade    is expected to pass the House when Congress      returns to session this September  and the President is expected to      sign the bill        Below is Leahys statement on the passage of the OPEN Government      bill  Background summaries on the Kyl Leahy Amendment and the      Cornyn Leahy Bill follow        Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Passage Of The OPEN Government Act Senate      Proceedings     August 3  2007 Mr  President  I am pleased that      the Senate has passed the Leahy Cornyn Openness Promotes      Effectiveness in our National Government Act  the OPEN Government      Act   S 849  before adjourning for the August recess  This      important Freedom of Information Act legislation will strengthen and      reinvigorate FOIA for all Americans       For more than four decades  FOIA has translated the great American      values of openness and accountability into practice by guaranteeing      access to government information  The OPEN Government Act will help      ensure that these important values remain a cornerstone of our      American democracy       I commend the bills chief Republican cosponsor  Senator John Cornyn       for his commitment and dedication to passing FOIA reform legislation      this year  Since he joined the Senate five years ago  Senator      Cornyn and I have worked closely together on the Judiciary Committee      to ensure that FOIA and other open government laws are preserved for      future generations  The passage of the OPEN Government Act is a      fitting tribute to our bipartisan partnership and to openness       transparency and accountability in our government       I also thank the many cosponsors of this legislation for their      dedication to open government and I thank the Majority Leader for      his strong support of this legislation  I am also appreciative of      the efforts of Senator Kyl and Senator Bennett in helping us to      reach a compromise on this legislation  so that the Senate could      consider and pass meaningful FOIA reform this legislation before the      August recess       But  most importantly  I especially want to thank the many concerned      citizens who  knowing the importance of this measure to the American      peoples right to know  have demanded action on this bill  This      bill is endorsed by more than 115 business  public interest  and      news organizations from across the political and ideological      spectrum  including the American Library Association  the U S       Chamber of Commerce  OpenTheGovernment org  Public Citizen  the      Republican Liberty Caucus  the Sunshine in Government Initiative and      the Vermont Press Association  The invaluable support of these and      many other organizations is what led the opponents of this bill to      come around and support this legislation       The First FOIA Reforms in More Than a Decade      As the first major reform to FOIA in more than a decade  the OPEN      Government Act will help to reverse the troubling trends of      excessive delays and lax FOIA compliance in our government and help      to restore the publics trust in their government  This bill will      also improve transparency in the Federal Governments FOIA process      by         Restoring meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA        Imposing real consequences on federal agencies for missing      FOIAs 20 day statutory deadline        Clarifying that FOIA applies to government records held by      outside private contractors        Establishing a FOIA hotline service for all federal      agencies  and       Creating a FOIA Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and      federal agencies with a meaningful alternative to costly litigation       Specifically  the OPEN Government Act will protect the publics      right to know  by ensuring that anyone who gathers information to      inform the public  including freelance journalist and bloggers  may      seek a fee waiver when they request information under FOIA  The      bill ensures that federal agencies will not automatically exclude      Internet blogs and other Web based forms of media when deciding      whether to waive FOIA fees  In addition  the bill also clarifies      that the definition of news media  for purposes of FOIA fee waivers       includes free newspapers and individuals performing a media function      who do not necessarily have a prior history of publication       The bill also restores meaningful deadlines for agency action  by      ensuring that the 20 day statutory clock under FOIA starts when a      request is received by the appropriate component of the agency and      requiring that agency FOIA offices get FOIA requests to the      appropriate agency component within 10 days of the receipt of such      requests  The bill allows federal agencies to toll the 20 day clock      while they are awaiting a response to a reasonable request for      information from a FOIA requester on one occasion  or while the      agency is awaiting clarification regarding a FOIA fee assessment       In addition  to encourage agencies to meet the 20 day time limit       the bill prohibits an agency from collecting search fees if it fails      to meet the 20 day deadline  except in the case of exceptional      circumstances as defined by the FOIA statute       The bill also addresses a relatively new concern that  under current      law  federal agencies have an incentive to delay compliance with      FOIA requests until just before a court decision that is favorable      to a FOIA requestor  The Supreme Courts decision in Buckhannon      Board and Care Home  Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of Health and Human      Resources  532 U S  598  2001   eliminated the catalyst theory for      attorneys fees recovery under certain federal civil rights laws       When applied to FOIA cases  Buckhannon precludes FOIA requesters      from ever being eligible to recover attorneys fees under      circumstances where an agency provides the records requested in the      litigation just prior to a court decision that would have been      favorable to the FOIA requestor  The bill clarifies that Buckhannon      does not apply to FOIA cases  Under the bill  a FOIA requester can      obtain attorneys fees when he or she files a lawsuit to obtain      records from the government and the government releases those      records before the court orders them to do so  But  this provision      would not allow the requester to recover attorneys fees if the      requesters claim is wholly insubstantial       To address concerns about the growing costs of FOIA litigation  the      bill also creates an Office of Government Information Services in      the National Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate      agency level FOIA disputes  In addition the bill ensures that each      federal agency will appoint a Chief FOIA Officer  who will monitor      the agencys compliance with FOIA requests  and a FOIA Public      Liaison who will be available to FOIA to resolve FOIA related      disputes       Finally  the bill does several things to enhance the agency      reporting and tracking requirements under FOIA  The bill creates a      tracking system for FOIA requests to assist members of the public      and the media  Tracking numbers are not required for FOIA requests      that are anticipated to take ten days or less to process  The bill      also establishes a FOIA hotline service for all federal agencies       either by telephone or on the Internet  to enable requestors to      track the status of their FOIA requests       In addition  the bill also clarifies that FOIA applies to agency      records that are held by outside private contractors  no matter      where these records are located  And  to create more transparency      about the use of statutory exemptions under FOIA  the bill ensures      that FOIA statutory exemptions that are included in legislation      enacted after the passage of this bill clearly cite the FOIA statute      and clearly state the intent to be exempt from FOIA       OPEN Government Is An American Value      The Freedom of Information Act is critical to ensuring that all      American citizens can access information about the workings of their      government  But  after four decades this open government law needs      to be strengthened  I am pleased that the reforms contained in the      OPEN Government Act will ensure that FOIA is reinvigorated so that      it works more effectively for the American people       I am also please that  by passing this important reform legislation      today  the Senate has reaffirmed the principle that open government      is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue  But  rather  it is      an American issue and an American value  I commend all of my Senate      colleagues  on both sides of the aisle  for unanimously passing this      historic FOIA reform measure  I hope that the House of      Representatives  which overwhelmingly passed a similar measure      earlier this year  will promptly take up and pass this bill and that      the President will then promptly sign it into law            Kyl Leahy Amendment To The OPEN      Government Act          3  DEFINITION OF NEWS MEDIA        Representative of the news media is defined broadly enough      to encompass all members of the old and new media  It includes      anyone who gathers information of potential interest to a segment      of the public  uses an editorial process and disseminates their      product to an audience of any size  It states explicitly that as      methods of news delivery evolves  alternative media shall be      encompassed  This provision ensures that blogs and other Web based      forms of media are covered by the bill          4  ATTORNEYS FEES         A requester can obtain attorneys fees when he or she files      a lawsuit to obtain records from the government and the government      releases those records before the court orders them to do so  But       this provision would not allow the requester to recover attorneys      fees if the requesters claim is wholly insubstantial          6 a   20 DAY TIME LIMIT AND TOLLING         The 20 day period that agencies have to respond to FOIA      requests is changed to commence when the request is received by the      appropriate component of the agency  If a FOIA request is received      by a different component of the agency that handles FOIA requests       the agency has 10 days to deliver the request to the appropriate      agency component before the 20 day clock starts to run          Allows federal agencies to toll the 20 day clock while      awaiting a response to a request for information from a FOIA      requester on one occasion reasonable  or while awaiting      clarification regarding a fee assessment          6 b   COMPLIANCE WITH TIME LIMITS         Changes the penalty for non compliance with the 20 day time      limit from the loss of the agencys ability to claim an exemption      under FOIA to a waiver of search fees          7 a   STATUS OF REQUESTS         Clarifies that tracking numbers are not required for FOIA      requests that are anticipated to take 10 days or less to process          8  CLEAR STATEMENT FOR EXEMPTIONS         Ensures that FOIA statutory exemptions enacted after the      passage of this bill clearly cite the FOIA statute and state the      intent to exempt the legislation from FOIA          10  PRIVATE RECORDS MANAGEMENT         Clarifies that FOIA applies to government records      maintained by government contractors who have been contracted to      store and manage data for federal agencies or departments          11  OFFICE OF GOVERNMENT INFORMATION SERVICES OMBUDSMAN         Creates an Office of Government Information Services in the      National Archives and creates an ombudsman to mediate agency level      FOIA disputes         Ensures that each federal agency shall appoint       1  A Chief FOIA Officer who will monitor the agencys      compliance with FOIA requests  and ensure that they are responded to      quickly and efficiently       2  A FOIA Public Liaison who will be available to FOIA to      resolve FOIA related disputes          12  CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE INFORMATION         Strikes the Critical Infrastructure Information reporting      requirements from the bill            BACKGROUND ON THE LEAHY CORNYN OPEN      GOVERNMENT ACT      Led by U S  Senators Patrick Leahy and John Cornyn   the OPEN      Government Act of 2007 is a bipartisan effort to achieve meaningful      reforms to federal government information laws  including  most      notably  the Freedom of Information Act of 1966  FOIA   The      legislation would substantially enhance and expand the      accessibility  accountability  and openness of the federal      government  It has been nearly a decade since Congress has approved      major reforms to FOIA       This legislation is the culmination of extensive discussions between      the offices of Senators Leahy and Cornyn and various members of the      requestor community  The bill is
