       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy Confirmation Hearing Of Governor   Michael Johanns                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement         Of Senator Patrick Leahy        Confirmation Hearing Of Governor Michael Johanns        January 6  2005  I first would like congratulate the new Chairman          Senator Chambliss  and welcome the new members of our Committee who are         joining us for the first time today  Under Chairman Chambliss leadership         I am sure Senators Salazar  Santorum and Thomas will make great additions         to what has been appropriately called the most bipartisan Committee in the         United States Senate   I would also like to welcome Governor Michael Johanns        to his first  of what I expect will be many  hearings before this        Committee  Governor  I was pleased when President Bush selected you as his        choice to succeed Ann Veneman as Secretary of Agriculture   I am especially encouraged by your dairy background         In Vermont  dairy is king  It is our butter and our bread  Our        agricultural economy depends on the hundreds of millions of dollars dairy        farmers bring to our state every year  By growing up on a dairy farm in        Iowa  you surely learned that dairying is more than a job or an industry         it is a way of life for thousands of family farmers  You have had a distinguished career in Nebraska and        demonstrated true leadership on national agricultural issues through your        work with the National Governors Association  You know the federal farm        programs and have the trust and respect of those who have worked with you         Governor  upon your confirmation  I look forward to        working with you to provide strong advocacy on behalf of Americas farmers        and ranchers  You no doubt will have serious challenges ahead of        you  I want to briefly mention a few points that are important to me and I        think to the rest of the Committee   First I hope that you will be a strong partner in        fulfilling President Bush s commitment to extend the Milk Income Loss        Compensation  MILC  program before it expires in September  As you know         for many years there have been widely divergent views on dairy policy in        this body  However  during the 2002 Farm Bill  regions came together to        formulate a national dairy policy  the Milk Income Loss Compensation        Program  MILC   The MILC program has widely been credited with helping        thousands of dairy producers weather the historically low prices we have        seen in recent years  In keeping with the President s pledge to support        the MILC program extension  I look forward to working with you to extend        this essential program for our nations dairy farmers   Second  I hope you will continue the Departments        efforts to provide regional equity for working lands conservation programs        as required by the 2002 Farm Bill  Regional equity        which stipulates that states must be given        priority in conservation program assistance until they have reached a        minimum of  12 million in funding  has been tremendously successful in and        important to Vermont  We have been able to fund an increasing number of        Environmental Quality Incentive Program  EQIP  projects over the last two        years  and with continued regional equity funding  Vermont will be able to        overcome the current backlog of EQIP applications in the near future  Third  I continue to be        very concerned about the increasing concentration of agribusiness  a view I        think most members of this Committee share  Over the last decade we have        witnessed major consolidations in sector after sector  which in the end        will lead to higher prices for consumers and lower incomes for farmers         When Dean Foods merged with        Suiza Foods in 2001 to form the largest milk processing company in the        world  it gained control of approximately 70 percent of the milk supply in        New England  It achieved this market dominance by buying up local        dairies and then closing them down  Moreover  Dean Foods now controls more        than 30 percent of all milk production nationally  I ask that you        carefully monitor this situation and investigate the adverse effects that        this consolidation is having on our farmers  ranchers and consumers        throughout the nation   Fourth  I encourage you to follow in the footsteps of        your predecessors  Secretaries Glickman and Veneman  in providing strong        support for organic agriculture  With an annual rate of growth of 20        percent per year in organic retail sales  organic agriculture is clearly a        bright spot in our agricultural economy  Yet the strength of the organic        market is highly dependent on consumer confidence in the integrity of the        USDA organic label  Therefore  it is critical that USDA take its role as        the administrator of the National Organic Program seriously  This        commitment needs to start at the top  with the Secretary of Agriculture  as        well as with those who directly administer the organic programs          Finally  I urge you to demonstrate strong leadership in advancing federal        nutrition programs  As you know nutrition and hunger programs at USDA        represent a long standing  bipartisan commitment to fighting hunger in        America  Specifically the Department is in the midst of implementing the        Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 which President Bush        signed into law a few months ago  One of the important initiatives in that        legislation was the new farm to cafeteria grant program  Under this new        program  communities will be able to apply for competitive grants from USDA        for up to  100 000 to purchase adequate equipment to store and prepare        locally produced fresh foods  I hope you will work with me to fund and        support this new and exciting program   Governor Johanns  I believe your knowledge and        experience will be useful in meeting these challenges  and I am hopeful        about the progress we can make by working together
