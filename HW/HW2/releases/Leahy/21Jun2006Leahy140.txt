       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The National Guard Empoerment Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Fiscal Year 2007 Defense Authorization Bill     The National Guard     Empowerment Amendment     June 21  2006 I am      pleased to join my colleague Senator Bond in discussing S 2658  the      National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of      2006  A version of this groundbreaking legislation has been adopted      by the Senate as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense      Authorization Bill   Our      amendment would tangibly strengthen our national security by giving      the National Guard more of a voice in decision making and in      ensuring that our Nation is able to optimally tap the enormous      experience and capabilities that exist within the National Guard        Todays Guard is a  21st Century military organization      that is carrying its weight and more in Afghanistan and Iraq  as      well as here at home  whenever disaster strikes  But todays Guard      is needlessly frozen in a 20th Century Pentagon organization chart       The implications of that show up in everything from the Guards      depleted equipment stockpiles  to training and staffing and mission      decisions  Our amendment clears away some institutional cobwebs to      let the National Guard be the best it can be  The      Bond Leahy Amendment specifically increases the rank of the Chief of      the National Guard from Lieutenant General to full General  It will      ensure that the deputy commander of United States Northern Command      come from the ranks of the National Guard  Additionally  the bill      makes the National Guard a joint activity of the Department of      Defense  giving the National Guard greater latitude to talk around      the Pentagon  Finally  the Guard would be given greater ability to      identify gaps in capabilities in our States ability to respond to      emergencies at home  This      amendment differs somewhat from the baseline legislation that      Senator Bond and I introduced earlier this year  The amendment does      not include a requirement that the Chief of the National Guard sit      on the Joint Chiefs of Staff  and we also removed the provision that      would give the National Guard separate budget authority  We heard      some strong objections from other members about these two      provisions  and  as chairs of the wide reaching Senate National      Guard Caucus  we wanted to do the best we could to accommodate every      Guard supporter        However  we still strongly believe in the importance of opening to      the Chief of the National Guard Bureau a position on the Joint Staff      and of giving to the Guard more general flexibility in procuring      equipment to match the needs of its missions  We will fight for      these provisions another day   Given      that we have dropped the core objections that some have raised      against Guard empowerment  there was absolutely no reason that any      member of the Senate could oppose this legislation  This amendment      is about fairness and effectiveness  It is about fairness in that      it makes sure that the National Guard is not treated like a      stepchild in key budget and policy deliberations  Giving greater      institutional standing to the Guard makes it a lot harder for the      Guard to get short thrift in these discussions  Our      amendment is about effectiveness in that it will improve the use of      the Guard in homeland security matters  which is becoming quite a      regular phenomenon  The National Guard is being used regularly in a      so called Title 32 status to increase security and provide military      disaster response  Under this status  the Guard serves under      command and control of the Nations governors  with federal      financing  In addition to the recent Southern Border mission  the      National Guard served spectacularly during Katrina in this way       providing one of the most effective responses to that disaster  By      allowing the National Guard to talk regularly across the Department      of Defense and to work closely with the States to identify gaps  our      amendment takes advantage of the knowledge of the members of the      National Guard to help plug holes in our homeland defense  And we      make this whole process for activating the Guard in Title 32 far      smoother   The National Guard is critical to the Nations      defense on a number of levels  We have to have the trust and      confidence in this force to give them more responsibility  At the      same time  we simply cannot have a repeat of the ill advised      recommendations from the Army and the Air Force that sought to slash      the National Guard personnel levels  The Army wanted to cut the      Army Guard by more than 17 000 troops and the Air Guard by almost      14 000  These proposed cuts made absolutely no sense  We need to turn this dynamic around  We cannot      keep asking the Guard to do more for the country  and then force it      to justify its existence  The National Guard needs institutional      standing and leadership commensurate with its missions and      capabilities   Our National Guard stands willing to do even      more to protect the country  and this amendment will give them a key      tool to help them contribute to the Nations defense  I thank my colleagues and friends  the Chair      and Ranking members of the Senate Armed Services Committee  for      their support of this amendment  We cannot afford to let our Guard      down
