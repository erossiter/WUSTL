       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The Crisis In Lebanon                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     The Crisis In Lebanon            Senate Floor     August 1  2006 Mr  LEAHY       Since July 12th we have watched with growing horror as      hundreds of Hezbollah rockets have landed deeper and deeper inside      Israel  indiscriminately killing and injuring civilians  and Israeli      bombs  missiles and artillery shells have destroyed much of the      civilian infrastructure in areas of Beirut and southern Lebanon       Some 550      Lebanese have died  the vast majority of them civilians  and an      estimated 866 000  one in five Lebanese citizens  have fled their      homes and are either displaced in Lebanon  living in schools and      public buildings  or as refugees in Syria  Fifty Israelis have      died  and in Haifa and other towns in the north many families are      living in terror in basements or shelters   Meanwhile       three Israeli soldiers remain as hostages and their families remain      in anguish  hostages held in violation of the Geneva Conventions      and every other international norm  In another sense  Hezbollah and      its supporters Syria and Iran are holding the entire population of      Lebanon hostage  Of the 26 000      American citizens who were living in or visiting Lebanon when this      crisis began  more than 12 000 have been evacuated  and the exodus      continues  The cost to the U S  government of this air and sea lift      is expected to be at least  46 million  The evacuation      took too long to get started  and the delay and confusion caused a      lot of frustration and anxiety among Americans in Lebanon as well as      their families back home   As after      Hurricane Katrina  I hope the Administration has learned something      from this experience  At the same time  I want to commend the State      Department employees and U S  military personnel who worked around      the clock to help Americans who were trapped in Lebanon find a way      out   The unprovoked       indiscriminate and utterly inexcusable kidnapping of Israeli      soldiers and rocket attacks by Hezbollah should be universally      condemned  Those who ordered it should be brought to justice  It      has ignited a conflict that Hezbollah cannot win  but which could      engulf the region if a way is not found to stop the spiral of      violence from widening   It is clear      that a buffer zone patrolled by an international force is urgently      needed along the Israeli Lebanese border to prevent these kinds of      violent incursions against Israel and its people  and that Hezbollah      must be disarmed in order for Lebanon to finally  finally    break      free of Syrias harsh grip   While hundreds      of Hezbollahs missiles continue to rain down on Israel  Israels      military response has also caused the deaths of hundreds of      civilians in Lebanon  including four United Nations observers  One      of the latest tragedies is the destruction by an Israeli missile of      an apartment building in Qana that resulted in 57 Lebanese deaths      including 34 children  children who were not terrorists  Secretary      Rices whirlwind visits to the region have been welcome but they      have produced few tangible results  This type of crisis diplomacy      rarely achieves lasting solutions  She is also occupied with a      widening civil war in Iraq  resurgent Taliban violence in      Afghanistan  an increasingly recalcitrant and aggressive regime in      North Korea  a worsening humanitarian crisis in Darfur with no end      in sight  the specter of a nuclear weapons capable Iran in the      worlds future  and other pressing problems  She is simply unable      to focus the sustained  high level attention on the Middle East      crisis that is needed   I and others      like my friend from Nebraska  Senator Hagel  have urged President      Bush to appoint a special envoy with the stature and the authority      to work on a continual basis to help broker an immediate ceasefire      and long term solutions to Israels conflicts with Hamas and      Hezbollah  someone who wakes up every single day with the      challenge  the portfolio and especially the authority to help      resolve this conflict  I renew this call for such an envoy again      today   Some U S       officials have questioned the possibility of a ceasefire with a      terrorist organization like Hezbollah  That is a valid question       but ceasefires have been achieved with other terrorist groups  and      while imperfect the results have been sharp reductions in violence       A ceasefire is      needed immediately in Lebanon  to be followed with similar urgency      by the deployment of an international peacekeeping force on the      border  Too many innocent people are dying  innocent people    in      both countries  A peacekeeping force is necessary to prevent      further loss of Lebanese and Israeli lives   We are      committed to protecting Israels security and we support Israels      right of self defense  including going after Hezbollah fighters who      often launch their attacks from civilian areas   But for      Israels sake  for ours and especially  especially    for the sake      of innocent lives on both sides of these battle lines  it is vitally      important to ask whether destroying Lebanon  not Hezbollah  but      destroying Lebanon    will make Israel more secure or instead rally      Muslims behind Hezbollah and give rise to further hatred and      insecurity  I believe that continued bombing of civilian areas in      Lebanon will not destroy Hezbollah  but in a perverse way  it may      strengthen it    The fact that      these attacks are being carried out with such intensity and are      yielding so much death and destruction  with weapons supplied by the      United States  and at a time when we are trying to repair our      already frayed relations with Muslims around the world  is all the      more reason for the United States and the people of Israel to      consider and answer this question frankly and honestly  I am      concerned  as others have also warned  that a short term tactical      victory  even if possible  could prove to be a hollow victory at      great human cost  We should also      reflect on the circumstances that preceded this crisis  For the      past five years  the Bush Administrations approach to the Middle      East has been either to ignore it or to parachute in for just enough      time for a few handshakes and photographs  There has never been an      effective strategy  They have never been willing to expend any      political capital  Their policy toward Syria and Iran has been      erratic and ineffective  Their relations with the Palestinians have      stagnated   It was clear      since the earliest days of this Administration that this laxity      would define their approach to these tinderbox issues  and the      terrible harm of that approach  to our ally Israel  to the      Palestinians  and to the prospects for resuming a meaningful peace      process in that region  is all the more clear today   I am not among      those who believe that the United States pulls all the strings in      the Middle East  There are forces there over which we have only      limited influence   But neither do      I believe there can be a lasting solution to the Arab Israeli      conflict without the active  creative and sustained engagement of      the United States  including direct talks with those with whom we      strongly disagree  like Syria and Iran  That has been sorely      lacking under this Administration  and we are witnessing the price      of that neglect in Lebanon and Israel today
