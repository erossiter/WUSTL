       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Senator Robert T  Stafford                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Sen  Robert T  Stafford    January 4  2007 Mr  LEAHY  Madam President  it is with great sadness that I rise     today to bid a final goodbye to one of Vermont s most distinguished     public servants  On Saturday  December 23  just before Christmas  former     Senator Bob Stafford from Vermont passed away at the venerable age of     93  He leaves behind a tremendous legacy of which he and his family and     fellow Vermonters and all Americans should be exceptionally proud  I     take this opportunity to pay tribute to Robert Stafford  an     extraordinary Vermonter  and especially a very dear and close friend      He will be greatly missed by me  my wife Marcelle  and by so many     other Americans all across our country  We send our condolences to his     wife Helen and his family   Born in Rutland in 1913  Senator Stafford attended his hometown s     public schools  He completed his undergraduate work at one of our     Nation s finest undergraduate institutions  Middlebury College  He     briefly attended the University of Michigan Law School but ultimately     earned his law degree from Boston University School of Law in 1938   Bob was a remarkable person not only because of his service as a     statesman but also for his service in the military  He is a prime     example of what has been so aptly named the   greatest generation     Senator Stafford courageously stepped forward to serve our Nation     during not one but two foreign wars  In 1942  he enlisted in the U S      Navy and served on active duty from 1942 to 1946  Again  when the Korean     war began  he served from 1951 to 1953 as an officer in the Navy  Bob     later became the first commander of the Navy Reserve Center in     Burlington  VT  The center later moved to White River Junction in 1995      and I was pleased to recommend to the Navy that the new facility be     named the Robert T  Stafford Naval Reserve Center  They happily obliged      Throughout his life  Bob remained extremely proud of his Navy career  I     still remember that beautiful day when we opened the new Naval Reserve     facility named in honor of his leadership   Indeed  the recently completed Lake Champlain Navy Memorial was     dedicated in his honor by the unanimous recommendation of its founding     committee  made up of Navy veterans  retirees  and reservists   Bob Stafford was an absolute giant in Vermont politics  He spent     almost 30 years representing our great State  first in the U S  House of     Representatives  and then in the U S  Senate  Prior to his arrival in     Washington in the early 1960s  he served his fellow Vermonters closer to     home  holding a number of prominent State positions   He served as Rutland County State s attorney and deputy State     attorney general  and finally as our State attorney general  From 1957     to 1959  Bob Stafford held the post of Lieutenant Governor  In 1959  he     went on to become Governor   In 1960  Bob Stafford was elected to Vermont s sole seat in the U S      House of Representatives  He won five successive reelections  In     September of 1971  he resigned his House seat to accept an appointment     to the U S  Senate following the death of Senator Winston Prouty   After he won a special election in January 1972  Bob proceeded to     represent Vermont in the Senate during the next 17 years  I had the     distinct privilege of serving with him during all but 2 of those years      He also had serving with him from the time he was Governor through the     House and the U S  Senate a most remarkable Chief of Staff  Neal     Houston  He and Neal Houston were like brothers  They could almost     complete each other s sentences  When I spoke to Neal and heard the sad     news about Senator Stafford s passing  I knew he felt that he had lost a     member of his own family   When I first came to Washington as a young man in 1974  I was a     34 year old junior Senator from Vermont  We didn t have any kind of     orientation for new Senators at that time  Bob Stafford was an     indispensable mentor to me  I will never forget the leadership and     friendship he offered me during that challenging time   Interestingly enough  Senator Stafford was sort of the epitome of a     Vermont Republican in the proudest tradition  I was the only Democrat     ever elected  He took me under his wing during those early years  He was     enormously helpful to me  his younger  far less experienced junior     colleague  I will never forget that he even allowed me the use of his     office before I was assigned a space of my own  where we could interview     people for positions in my office and where telephone calls could be     answered   He brought me around and introduced me to both Republicans and     Democrats and basically vouched for me   But Bob and his wife Helen s kindness extended far beyond the     confines of the Senate office buildings  Helen was kind enough even to     offer to babysit our children when Marcelle and I were so new in town     that we had nowhere to turn for childcare while we were house hunting      This is a remarkable couple   To this day  Marcelle and I hold enormous gratitude for the     friendship the Staffords offered during our early years in Washington      That friendship has continued throughout the years  and we have many     fond memories of visiting their home on Sugar Hill Road  Even after Bob     left the Senate  we would drop by and visit  We had some most remarkable     conversations  some political  some family  and after all of them I     would leave with a smile on my face   Bob was an extremely well liked member of the Republican Party  He     served at one time in the Republican leadership  but he also formed many     close friendships with Senators on the Democratic side  Always     respectful  always polite  Bob Stafford consistently recognized the     importance of moderation and compromise  He  better than most  knew how     to form bipartisan alliances   In his quiet and unassuming manner  Bob Stafford fought hard for the     issues that mattered most to him  He believed passionately that higher     education should be more accessible to all Americans  regardless of     their socioeconomic status  and he was instrumental in creating the     student loan program which today bears his name  The Stafford Student     Loan Program has made higher education more accessible for millions of     Americans  even for some who work in my office today  Bob was a champion     of vocational education  Today the Stafford Technical Center  located in     his hometown of Rutland  serves the needs of hundreds of students in     Rutland County   Bob showed tremendous leadership in blocking President Reagan s     attempts to slash health and education funding  Thanks to Bob Stafford s     hard work  programs for disabled Americans and legal aid were left     largely intact during much of the 1980s when other programs were starkly     scaled back  His chairmanship made sure they were protected   Bob Stafford also played an important role in another issue of     enormous relevance today  Federal emergency assistance  In 1988      President Reagan signed into law the Robert T  Stafford Disaster Relief     and Emergency Assistance Act  a bill which provides the statutory     authority for Federal disaster response activities pertaining to FEMA     programs   While his achievements in the areas of education and Federal disaster     relief were certainly superb  I believe his most enduring legacy will be     for the work he did in protecting the environment and public health  He     helped shape and strengthen some of our Nation s most critical     environmental laws for over two decades   As chairman of the Environment and Public Works Committee from 1981     to 1986  Bob Stafford was instrumental in persuading Congress to expand     and strengthen the Superfund toxic waste cleanup law in the mid 1980s      It was in large part due to Robert Stafford s unwavering commitment to     this bill in 1980 that the Superfund Act became law at all  As many of     us know  this law has been indispensable in forcing industry polluters     to contribute money to finance cleanup and restoration of contaminated     wastesites   Bob Stafford believed passionately in the Federal Government s     commitment to improving the quality of our Nation s air  This was never     more evident than in his steadfast work to uphold the Clean Air Act when     it was under attack during the 1980s  He did not shirk from taking on     his friend President Reagan as well as auto manufacturers and other     industry groups in refusing to roll back this critical air pollution     law   In fact  I remember talking to him once  They were so anxious to get     him to change and let these rollbacks go through that they invited him     down to the White House  to spend some one on one time with President     Reagan  The Reagan administration amazed many of their members afterward     that Bob didn t back off at all  He came back and kept on protecting the     environment   I said to him  Bob  what happened when you went down there to talk     with President Regan   He said  Well  the President had notes of what he was supposed to say     and he said it  Then he looked at me and he said  Bob  you re probably     not going to give in  are you  Bob said  No  no  I m not  Mr  President      but I certainly appreciate the time to be with you   I said then  What did you talk about the rest of the time   Oh  we talked about our kids  we talked about sports  we talked about     a lot of other things  He said  I had a wonderful conversation with     President Reagan  But he did not budge on the environment  something no     Vermonter would do   His concern about the contamination of our air was truly remarkable      The consistent and clear manner in which he spoke about the danger of     ozone depletion  acid rain  and the release of greenhouse gases related     to global warming  during a very difficult period  was a source of     inspiration to so many of his colleagues on both sides of the aisle  It     certainly was an inspiration to me   As EPW chairman  Senator Stafford also led the fight to improve the     quality of our water  Working closely with Senator John Chafee and     others on both sides of the aisle  his leadership was critical in     reauthorizing the Clean Water Act in 1987  Bob cited the passage of this     act as the culmination of one of the greatest bipartisan efforts in     protecting our Nation s environment  It really was  Republicans and     Democrats came together  It gave me enormous pride to see him appear 3     years ago before the Senate in celebrating the act s 30 year     anniversary  Thanks to Bob s leadership during those difficult years of     deregulation  our Nation was able to make great strides in reducing the     levels of pollutants and contaminants in our water   Even after he retired from Congress  he served Vermont in many ways      He was a member of the University of Vermont s School of Natural     Resources Advisory Committee and attended the day long hearings with his     wife Helen up to just a few years ago  He also lectured at UVM  Norwich     University  and Castleton State College  In 2003  his old alma mater      Middlebury College  honored both Bob and his wife Helen  also a     Middlebury graduate  by inaugurating the Robert and Helen Stafford     Professorship in Public Policy  Two people who had been together almost     all their lives are together in this professorship   Also in retirement  Bob continued to fight for clean air  In 1995  he     joined forces with his friend and former colleague  Senator Edmund     Muskie  in incorporating the Clean Air Trust  a nonprofit organization     dedicated to upholding and enforcing clean air legislation   He leaves so many impressive achievements for his lifelong work in     public service  But outside these public accomplishments  Senator     Stafford was also a man of many personal hobbies and interests  It kind     of reflects who he is  On weekends  he liked to slip out of Washington     with his wife Helen and enjoy time on his boat  a full Moon  cruising     down the Chesapeake Bay  Marcelle and I were fortunate enough to join     them on occasion  He loved the water  He loved everything about sailing      You can tell why the Navy holds him in such high regard back home   He took flying lessons as a young man  He eventually got his pilot s     license in the early sixties  In fact  he would pilot a leased Cessna     back and forth between Washington and Vermont   It was a mark of this unique Senator that he welcomed and helped the     first Senator of the other party to be elected in Vermont  I will always     remember and cherish the walks we took down the halls and the times we     would sit and talk at lunch  People thought we were talking so much     about politics  We were talking about Vermont  We were talking about     whether the foliage season was going to start early or late  and we     would make a determined judgment when it would be  Heck  we had not the     foggiest idea but  boy  we had fun determining when it would start   No Senator could have learned as much from his fellow Senator as I     did  nor could a senior Senator be so patient and understanding with his     junior  Throughout our time together  when I had been inclined to move     impulsively  it would be Bob Stafford who would help me decide what was     truly in the best interest of the country and Vermont  He was the most     unflappable person I have ever known   I remember flying to Vermont with him once on a commercial airline      The plane hit a tremendous amount of turbulence  We suddenly dropped     thousands of feet  At least one person was airborne in the cabin  and     things were flying around  I know my pulse raced ever so fast  When the     pilot finally got control of the plane with a shuddering  banging     maneuver  I sat there stunned  I had sweat soaking through my shirt  Bob     simply folded his paper  which he never stopped reading  turned to me     and in a quiet voice said  Patrick  just think if this plane had gone     down  Tomorrow morning there would have been a long line outside the     Governor s office  Everybody would be saying what a terrible tragedy     that we have lost our Senators  but  Governor  I am willing to be     appointed to either one of the seats  I found that I was not so     frightened  and I was able to laugh until it hurt  and I did laugh   Bob Stafford was a man who dedicated his entire adult life to public     service because he deeply believed in the value of public service  And     no matter where life took him  Bob stayed close to his Vermont roots  He     never forgot the people he served  While many younger Vermonters and     Americans may not know much about Bob Stafford  his public service and     leadership are examples for all of us  Our country would do well to stop     and take notice of his life and reflect on how we should all serve our     Nation better with his bipartisan leadership style   It is with tremendous sadness that I say goodbye to this truly     distinguished American  more importantly to an exceptionally dear     friend  To honor Robert Stafford s legacy  Senator Sanders and     I  along with Congressman Peter Welch from Vermont  introduced a bill to     rename the White Rocks National Recreation Area  This is an area Senator     Stafford created in 1984  We are naming it after him  White Rocks was     among his most beloved natural areas in our State  We know that he and     Helen could actually see the towering white cliff face of White Rocks     Mountain from their home  This will remind generations of future     Vermonters of Senator Stafford s towering achievements and the humanity     of his spirits   I hope all my colleagues will support this legislation
