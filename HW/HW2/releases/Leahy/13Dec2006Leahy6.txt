       Ensuring Liberty And Security Through Checks And Balances  A Fresh Start   For the Senate Judiciary Committee In The New 110th Congress                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Ensuring Liberty And Security Through Checks And Balances      A Fresh Start For The Senate Judiciary Committee     In The New 110th Congress  By Senator      Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Incoming Chairman     Senate Judiciary Committee     United States Senate   As Prepared   Georgetown      University Law Center     December 13  2006     It always       feels good to come back to Georgetown Law Center  I am grateful       to this law school for nurturing my appreciation for the rule of       law in a just and free society  I thank Dean Aleinikoff for his       invitation and we wish his duties allowed him to be with us       today  and I also appreciate the sponsorship of the Constitution       Project  which is making a real difference in focusing public       discourse on first principles and away from the partisan       divisiveness of the last few years  I will not speak long       because I know that the students among you  including a number       of talented folks who have helped me  Chanda Betourney  Phil       Toomajian  and Emily Dakin  to name a few  are in the throes of       finals for your classes this semester  With the Congress       finally adjourning early Saturday morning  I want to take this       opportunity to look forward to the next Congress and some of the       priorities that will help restore balance to our system and       better protect the rights and serve the interests of the       American people    I came to the Senate during the       ebb tide of Watergate and Vietnam  In my 32 years since then in       the Senate  I have never seen a Congress so willfully derelict       in its duties as during this Administration  This has been an       unfortunate chapter in Congresss history  a time when our       Constitution was under assault  when our legal and human rights       were weakened  when our privacy and other freedoms were eroded        This election was an intervention  The American people rose up       to take away Congresss rubber stamp  and to demand a new       direction with more accountability    The Senate Judiciary Committee       will do its part  We will take an active role  and  I hope  a       bipartisan role    in charting a new course  I have enjoyed       working closely with our current Chairman  Arlen Specter  who       has accomplished much and has tried to accomplish even more        under difficult circumstances and with incredible stamina  We       have a strong bond of friendship to build upon      Restoration        Repair and Renewal  Year in and year out  the       Judiciary Committee handles much more than its share of the most       sensitive and controversial issues that come before the Senate          from countering terrorism and fighting crime  to protecting       the civil and voting rights of all Americans  to protecting       inventors patents  and everything in between  The Judiciary       Committee has a special stewardship role over our national       charter and over our most cherished rights as Americans  This       sense of stewardship helps shape the agenda that I will discuss       today    As a Democratic majority prepares       to take the lead on the Judiciary Committee  we do not have the       luxury of starting with a completely clean slate  We begin        knowing that we have a duty to repair real damage done to our       system of government over the last few years   Today I will outline a new agenda       for the Senate Judiciary Committee  an agenda of restoration        repair and renewal  Restoration of constitutional values and       the rights of ordinary Americans  Repair of a broken oversight       process and the return of accountability  And renewal of the       publics right to know          Corrosive       Unilateralism  When a White House acts as if it       alone knows best  thwarting the accountability of checks and       balances  it makes bad decisions  even worse  It also risks       losing the peoples trust  These are precisely the penalties       that this Administration has amassed through its unilateralism        in policies ranging from Iraq  to torture  to domestic       surveillance   The Bush       Administrations impulse to unilateralism predates 9 11  But       after that watershed crisis  the White House accelerated its       power plays at the expense of the other branches of government        all  in the name of fighting terrorism    This Administration has rolled       back open government laws and systematically eroded Americans       privacy rights  It has brazenly refused to answer the       legitimate oversight questions of the publics duly elected       representatives  and it has acted outside lawful authority to       wiretap Americans without warrants  and to create databanks and       dossiers on law abiding Americans without following the law and       without first seeking legal authorization  This White House has       behaved as if the Constitution begins with Article II  and they       have taken their extreme ideology of a unitary executive to       strip both Congress and our independent federal judiciary of       their rightful roles     The Oversight       Imperative   The constitutional balance must be       restored  Congress has a solemn duty to protect the rights of       the American people and to perform meaningful oversight to make       sure the laws are followed  Real oversight makes government       more accountable and more effective in keeping us safe     This is why oversight of the FBI       and the Department of Justice will again be one of my highest       priorities when I take the gavel once more as chairman of the       Senate Judiciary Committee  When I previously chaired the       Committee  our oversight was done in a bipartisan way  and I       hope and expect to carry on that tradition in the coming       Congress      The Erosion Of       Privacy  At a time when government is       trying to databank and datamine more and more information about       ordinary Americans  this Administration has been less and less       willing to let us know what they are doing   Americans privacy is a price the       Bush Administration is willing to pay for the cavalier way it is       spawning new databanks  But privacy rights belong to the       people  not to the government  They need to stop treating the       privacy of ordinary Americans as an expendable commodity         When it comes to protecting       Americans privacy  what we have today are analog rules in a       digital world  We are way overdue in catching up to the erosion       of privacy  and the Judiciary Committee now will help to bring       this picture into focus  This will be one of our highest       priorities   I have long questioned Secretary       Rumsfeld about the Defense Departments creation of dossiers on       Quakers and peaceful anti war protestors  Congress acted to       rein in Admiral Poindexters Total Information Awareness       program  Recently we learned through the press    and Im       thankful for a free and vigilant press    that the Bush       Administration has secretly been compiling dossiers on millions       of law abiding Americans  It is incredible that the       Administration has reportedly been sharing this sensitive       information with foreign governments and even private employers        while refusing to allow U S  citizens to see or challenge the       so called terror score that the government has assigned them       based on their travel schedules    New and improved technologies make       data banks and data mining more powerful and more useful than       they have ever been before  They can be important tools in our       national security arsenal  and we should use them in an       effective way  But data banks are ripe for abuse and prone to       mistakes without proper safeguards  A mistake can cost       Americans their jobs and wreak havoc in their lives and       reputations that can take years to repair  Mistakes on       government watch lists have become legendary in recent years and       would be comical if not a tragic reflection of dangerous       government incompetence  Not only do we need checks and       balances to keep government data bases from being misused       against the American people  that is what the Constitution and       our laws require         Senator Specter and I have worked on a good data privacy bill       that was reported by the Committee two years ago but never taken       up by the Senate  The proliferation of data brokers and the       burgeoning market for collecting and selling personal       information intrude on the privacy of all Americans  Our       bipartisan legislation establishes stronger penalties to deter       identity theft and requires companies to notify individuals when       their information has been compromised     War       Profiteering Oversight And Prevention  Another oversight priority on the       Judiciary Committee will be pressing for accountability over the       use and abuse of billions of taxpayers dollars  sent as       development aid to Iraq  Rarely if ever has so much money been       funneled so fast to so many unsupervised contractors  with so       few safeguards     It is hard to win a battle for the       hearts and minds of Iraqis who still are without basic services        even as they watch billions of dollars being siphoned off by       unsupervised contractors  Too much of that money is unaccounted       for  and many of the facilities and services it was supposed to       provide are still nonexistent  And now this week we read about       plans to spend hundreds of millions more to create jobs in       Iraq  Werent we supposed to be doing that with all those       billions of other taxpayers dollars  At the risk of incurring       another of Vice President Cheneys special seasons greetings        I ask  Where did all the money go     Up to now  the committees of       Congress have looked the other way  and the Administration has       fought tooth and nail against any accountability for this       massive wastefulness  We even had to fight to preserve the one       watchdog that Congress has sent to Iraq  the Special Inspector       General for Iraq Reconstruction  Two months ago  a rider was       slipped into the Defense Authorization Bill that pulled the plug       on the inspector generals work  I am pleased that the election       results helped us reverse that last week    for now      The Judiciary Committee will be       asking the Justice Department why it has slowed and obstructed       the civil suits against contractors brought by whistleblowers        under the False Claims Act  And because prosecuting criminal       cases against war profiteering is difficult under current law       and has to overcome jurisdictional legal defenses  we also will       renew our efforts to enact the War Profiteering Prevention Act        I have repeatedly offered this bill  and it has passed the       Senate  only to die in a Republican controlled conference       committee     With each passing day of the       conflict in Iraq  it is more than just the future of Iraq that       hangs in the balance  but also our own  The recently released       Iraq Study Group report offers a way forward to change the       disastrous course of the past four years  As the Study Group       points out Iraq has long desperately needed an effective and       credible law enforcement and legal system  I look forward to       the Judiciary Committee contributing to these efforts by       exploring the dozen recommendations relating to the Iraqi       justice system and the training of Iraqi police forces  The       police force has proven to be one of the worst failures of the       occupation  Just this past weekend the press reported that a       nephew of Saddam Hussein escaped from custody with the help of       police forces     Defending The       Publics Right To Know  The publics need to know is a       constant in our democracy  a basic building block for the       consent of the governed  This year  we marked the 40th       anniversary of the Freedom of Information Act  or FOIA         Unfortunately  open  informed       government has been under assault by the first administration in       modern times that is explicitly hostile to the publics right to       know  By using ideology to trump science  gagging government       scientists and experts  reclassifying public documents and       undermining important tools like FOIA  this government has       displayed a dangerous disdain for the free press and the       public  Dr  James Hansen  director of NASAs Goddard Institute       and a leading authority on climate change  was kept away from       events where he could share his research insights with the       public  the same American public that pays the bills for the       research Dr  Hansen has been doing      It will be a priority of mine to       continue efforts to strengthen and improve our open government       laws  Some may be surprised to know that Senator John Cornynhas       been an ally in efforts to restore FOIA  We are forging a       bipartisan partnership that I hope will continue  and I look       forward to greater progress in the next Congress      Defending Our       Constitution By Restoring Checks and Balances    I am immensely proud to be one of       the two Senators given the opportunity to represent a state that       boasts such a rich tradition of defending those rights  At one       time  we even declared ourselves an independent republic         Vermont did not       and would not become a state until 1791  the year the Bill of       Rights was ratified  It is also the state that gave us  some of the most honorable senators in our history          Robert Stafford  Ralph Flanders  George Aiken and Jim Jeffords        to name a few  These are men who exemplified that tradition        who rose up against abuses  against infringements upon       Americans rights when doing that was not popular  but it was       right    Just as we cannot allow ourselves       to be lulled into a sense of false comfort when it comes to our       national security  we cannot allow ourselves to be lulled into       parking our rights and liberty in a blind trust  Our freedom is       the foundation that makes us strong as a nation  We must remain       vigilant on all fronts or we stand to lose all that is precious        our liberty  along with our security    For years  this Administration had       hidden the Presidents program of warrantless wiretapping of       Americans  We are now beginning to learn that it was not just       one program but many that have been hidden from Congress  We       all support monitoring the communications of suspected       terrorists  Doing that is basic to thwarting terrorism  It is       essential  and it is permitted under existing law  It is also       essential that when that monitoring impinges upon the rights of       Americans  it needs to be done lawfully and with adequate checks       and balances to prevent abuses  Initially the Administration       stonewalled our inquiries and claimed unilateral power and a       monopoly on deciding what needs to be done and how to do it  As       we pressed for answers  their responses turned into a demand for       sweeping legal authority without any independent judgment by       Congress  or any meaningful answers about what they have been       doing    We came together in the days after       9 11  We worked together to provide new authority the       Administration said it needed  But after White House       unilateralism set in  they have claimed for themselves broad       authority to violate the law and secretly eavesdrop on American       phone and computer communications  without proper congressional       or judicial review  That is a recipe for abuse  The reason we       have the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  or FISA  in       the first place is because of a period of earlier abuses of       Americans rights and privacy   With meaningful oversight and       cooperation from this Administration we can achieve the right       balance  We all have the same goal  protecting our country and       its citizens  We have made more than a dozen changes to FISA       since 9 11  If FISA needs more changes  then we should work       together to achieve that in a responsible way  once Congress has       a basis in knowledge that justifies further changes    Defending The       Independence Of The Judiciary  The final check on an overreaching       Executive in our constitutional structure is the judiciary  The       reason I have fought against the packing of the federal courts       with those who will not preserve its independence and fairness       is because the courts are so important to protecting the rights       of all Americans   For too long  this White House has       used judicial nominations for partisan political purposes and       refused to work with us on consensus nominees  The American       people want the Senate to be more than a rubber stamp  They       want the Senate to do its job by carefully evaluating nominees       for lifetime judgeships    judgeships that will continue long       after this President leaves office and will affect the rights of       todays Americans and those of their children and grandchildren   The process starts with the       President  In the choices he makes  he can unite the Senate and       the American people  or he can divide us  If he works with us       to send consensus nominees instead of picking political fights        we can make good progress filling vacancies in these important       lifetime appointments  One tangible step we should consider is       wider use of bipartisan judicial nominating commissions in       screening judicial candidates          Restoring Our Basic American Values And Human Rights  A       lesson in how not to legislate was the adoption in the run up to       the November election of the Military Commissions Act  Congress       was wrong to suspend the Great Writ of Habeas Corpus    a       keystone of American liberty    in order to avoid judicial       review that prevents government abuse  That law needlessly       undercut our freedoms and values  and  as I noted at the time        allowed the terrorists to achieve something they could never win       on the battlefield  an action from fear rather than strength to       undercut the Constitution  It was a squandered opportunity to       write a good law to set enforceable guidelines for fighting and       winning the war on terror without sacrificing American values       and American leadership on human rights          Justice Scalia wrote in the       Hamdi case  The very core of liberty secured by our       Anglo Saxon system of separated powers has been freedom from       indefinite imprisonment at the will of the Executive  But the       bill written by the White House and passed by the last Congress       is designed to ensure that the Bush Cheney Administration is       never again embarrassed by a United States Supreme Court       decision reviewing its unlawful abuses of power  I am committed       to restoring basic American values to the way we combat       terrorism and to developing a more effective strategy     As a result of that sweeping        ill conceived law  we have now eliminated basic legal and human       rights for 12 million lawful permanent residents who live and       work among us  to say nothing of the millions of other legal       immigrants and visitors whom we welcome to our shores each year          I look forward in the next Congress to working       with Senator Specter  Senator Dodd and others to restore these       fundamental protections and the checks and balances on which the       Constitution and our freedoms rest          Comprehensive Immigration Reform  I hope that we can also       advance American interests and American values by making further       progress on comprehensive immigration reform  We made some       bipartisan progress on the Committee and in the Senate last year       only to be stymied by Republican congressional leaders  We can       work together to bring people out of the shadows  to treat       hardworking people with dignity and respect rather than disdain       and discrimination     Patent Reform       And Life Saving Medicines  Reforming our patent system will       also be an enormous  but critically important  project in the       new Congress  Our Constitution enshrined patent rights for a       reason  to promote the progress of science and useful arts        The spirit of American innovation has made the United States the       worlds leader in intellectual property  Yet the expressions of       American innovation  in the form of patented goods and       processes  are only as good as the system that fosters and       protects innovation  Our patent system was created in another       century  and we need to update it  It must serve the 21st       Century industries that have made us the envy of the world  just       as it well served the smokestack industries of an earlier era    Complementing that effort  I       intend to redouble efforts to reexamine our patent laws in the       hope that by making thoughtful and practical changes we can       greatly increase access to essential medicines throughout the       world  We can help struggling families in developing nations        while improving U S  relations with large segments of the       worlds population  The current global health crisis is one of       the great callings of our time  Whether it is the Avian Flu        AIDS  SARS  West Nile Virus  or the approaching menace of       multi drug resistant bacteria  we need to recognize that the       health of those half way around the world now influences our       security and affects our lives here in the United States  I       want the work of the Judiciary       Committee to be a catalyst to help make life saving medicines       more readily available around the world     New       Subcommittee On Human Rights And The Law  Finally  I plan to establish a new       subcommittee  one that will focus our attention and efforts on       protecting human rights  A Human Rights and the Law       Subcommittee would help us better fulfill our role in a       challenging global environment  Over the years we have enacted       laws against torture  human trafficking and war crimes  for       example  This Human Rights Subcommittee would provide a focal       point for our activity  I want to do this on a bipartisan basis       and hope to continue consultations so that we can proceed to       establish all our subcommittees at the outset of the new       Congress    A Fresh Start       Emphasizing Progress Over Politics        There is much work to be done  I look forward to a new Congress       where we work together on behalf of all Americans  We are       living in challenging times  It is my intention to confront       security risks by finding strength in our core American values        Benjamin Franklin memorably warned that those who would give up       an essential liberty for temporary security  deserve neither       liberty nor security          History can attest that we are able to make a difference when we       fight to protect our freedoms  instead of sacrificing them       through fear  Those freedoms and core values are what make this       such a great and good nation  Freedom and security must not       become mutually exclusive values in America  We can have both        and we must have both  Steering that prudent course will be one       of the greatest challenges of our time
