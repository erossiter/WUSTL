                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Introduction Of The Resolution On The Ogoni Nine     November 10  2005 MR  LEAHY  Mr       President  ten years ago today  in what was by all accounts a      barbaric miscarriage of justice  Ken Saro Wiwa and eight of his      Ogoni colleagues from the delta region of Nigeria were hanged after      being convicted by a biased military tribunal  Those of us who      knew Mr  Saro Wiwa remember him as a thoughtful  passionate       nonviolent advocate for the rights of the Ogoni people  His arrest       conviction and hanging by the corrupt and brutal Abacha government      outraged the world and resulted in Nigerias suspension from the      British Commonwealth  and a United Nations investigation which      concluded that Saro Wiwa and his colleagues had been denied due      process in violation of international and Nigerian law  The UN      recommended financial relief for their families and improvements in      the living conditions of the Ogoni people and the other minorities      in the delta region  Unfortunately       none of the UNs recommendations have been carried out  the      environmental  economic and social conditions there have gotten      worse  and ten years later the Ogoni Nine remain convicted of a      crime for which they were unfairly tried  Today  I am      honored to introduce  on behalf of myself and Senators Kennedy       Obama  Feingold  Durbin  and Dodd a resolution calling on the      Government of Nigeria to conduct a thorough judicial review of this      travesty  By this      resolution we remember Ken Saro Wiwa and the others who were      executed  and we honor their courage and their nonviolent commitment      to social justice  In addition to calling for a judicial review and      just compensation to the survivors if a miscarriage of justice is      found  we urge the Nigerian government  international donors  and      international oil companies operating in the Niger delta to increase      assistance significantly to improve the lives of the people who live      there  It is unconscionable that after all the billions of dollars      in oil that have been extracted from that area  these people      continue to suffer daily from the polluted water and soil and the      gas flaring and are living in squalor   And we call on      the Nigerian Government to ensure that its security forces receive      the necessary training and discipline to prevent the violations of      human rights that the Ogoni have suffered for so many years  The volatile      situation in the Niger delta has been ignored for far too long  It      cannot be resolved by force  It cannot be resolved by lip service       There are serious environmental issues and urgent economic and      social needs  Ken Saro Wiwas example of nonviolence stands today      as it did a decade ago as a model for the Nigerian government  the      people of the Niger delta  and the international community to join      together to finally address them   I yield the      floor
