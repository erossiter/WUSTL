       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The FY2007 Emergency Supplemental   Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On The FY2007    Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill    March 27  2007    Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  this emergency     supplemental bill has been long anticipated as the best opportunity to     finally begin the belated process of extracting our military forces from     the quagmire of Iraq   As one of the 23 Senators who opposed the     authorization of the use of military force  I have supported every     credible proposal to end this debacle and bring our troops home   This war was not about September 11th      It was not about al Qaeda  It was not about making our nation safer      While no one can prove a negative  I believe that the damage this war     has done to our national security  our national interests and our     international standing has been incalculable  The injustices     perpetrated at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo have tarnished our national     reputation and leadership  and the way that Iraq has become a rallying     cry for religious extremists has made our country and the American     people less safe  I believe historians and future generations will look     back on this war as among the most reckless  costly mistakes made by any     President in our Nations history  This Supplemental contains another  96 billion to     support U S  military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  I supported     the use of military force to remove the Taliban from power  and I     support the continued efforts of our military and NATO forces against     the Taliban and al Qaeda in Afghanistan  But I did not  do not  and     will not agree with the use of the U S  military in a fruitless effort     to end a civil war in Iraq   This bill also contains money to help the people of     Lebanon rebuild after the devastating war between Hezbollah and Israel     last year  aid for refugees in Darfur  the Congo  Uganda  and other     humanitarian crises  and to prevent the spread of avian influenza  It     contains resources to help Kosovo as it moves toward independence  for     Liberia to rebuild after the civil war  and to support the peace process     in Nepal which finally has the chance to shed its feudal past  It     contains a provision I sponsored  with the support of both Republicans     and Democrats  to fix the illogical and unfair provisions in the     Immigration and Nationalization Act that have been used to prevent     victims of terrorist groups or members of groups who fought along side     the United States from admission as refugees or from obtaining asylum  As the chair of the Senates Subcommittee on State      Foreign Operations and Related Programs  I am also pleased to report     that this bill includes  for the first time  benchmarks on     reconstruction assistance for Iraq  After billions of dollars spent on     no bid contracts plagued by rampant fraud and shoddy workmanship  it is     about time that we put an end to the practice of handing out money with     no strings attached  These benchmarks reflect what the Iraqi Government     itself has pledged  and what even President Bush has acknowledged is     necessary if the Iraq Government is to succeed in bringing stability to     that country  There is much in this bill that I support  Despite     that  I do not support the funding to continue the military operations     in Iraq  and I will vote against this bill unless it contains the     provision setting a date for the withdrawal of our forces  This     provision is similar to legislation that narrowly lost in the Senate     last week  I voted for it then and I will vote for it again   The withdrawal provision in this bill is not  in     some respects  as definitive as what passed the House by the slimmest of     margins last Friday  Had it been up to me I would have written it     differently  I wanted a deadline not only for commencing the withdrawal     of our forces but also for completing it  rather than a target date  I     have cosponsored legislation that contains such a deadline  But this     provision represents a ninety degree change of course from the     Presidents policy of escalation  It is our best hope of obtaining the     50 votes needed to begin that process  I am confident that once the     withdrawal of our troops is underway there will be no turning back   We must remove our troops from Iraqs civil war      The arguments for doing so have been made eloquently  including by     former senior military officers whose credibility is unimpeachable      Retired Lieutenant General William Odom  in an op ed piece in the     February 11th edition of the Washington Post  said it     better than I ever could  It is the only way that the Iraqis will make     the difficult political compromises that could save their country from     further destruction  The President has threatened to veto this bill if     the troop withdrawal provision is included  That is not surprising for     a White House that has stubbornly refused to change course even in the     face of dwindling support from the American people whose sons and     daughters are dying   For more than four years  President Bush  Vice     President Cheney  and former Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld  backed by a     rubberstamp Congress  made one incompetent decision after another      arrogantly insisting that they knew best and dismissing anyone who so     much as questioned their policy for not supporting the troops  It has     been reminiscent of the old soft on Communism or soft on drugs     refrains that were used and still are used for political purposes to     justify failed policies  None of us should be intimidated by those bankrupt     and worn out arguments  None of us should have confidence in a failed     war effort that has already wrought an enormous toll in American blood      treasure and credibility  Not after the fiasco this White House has     wrought  It is time for the Congress to act as the voices and the     conscience of the American people
