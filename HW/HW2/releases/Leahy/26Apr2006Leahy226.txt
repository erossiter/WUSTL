       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Parity  Platforms And Protection  The   Future Of The Music Industry In The Digital Radio Revolution                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     Parity  Platforms  And Protection       The Future Of The Music Industry In The Digital Radio Revolution     April 26  2006  The principles that guide me here are      simple  We should be supporting and promoting the artists who write      and perform the music that enriches all of our lives  and we should      be helping everyone else to hear and enjoy that music  The      copyright laws exist  in this arena  to define how creators can      control  and profit from  the use of their works  All of the      technological advances of recent years  all of the improvements in      quality and quantity of music that the digital age has brought us       should mean that more people can hear more music  more easily  and      that everyone gets paid their due   I recognize and appreciate the fact      that many other people and businesses are involved in getting music      from the artist to the listener  The record companies  from the      smallest independent to the largest of the majors  the broadcasters       whether they own one station or thousands  and the digital music      providers  be they cable or satellite or internet  all of these      play crucial roles in turning the copyrights of the artists into the      listening pleasure of the consumer  But they are not ends in      themselves  they are at their best when they are helping to develop      new artistic talent  to nurture creative endeavors  and to      facilitate ever better ways of getting people the music they love       wherever they may be   The statutory license in Section 114      is complicated  Nobody would deny that  Maybe it is too      complicated  and maybe it is outdated  Maybe we in Congress should      take a new approach to this whole situation  Congress has      legislated in a piecemeal fashion  trying to work reasonable and      effective changes to the licensing scheme when new technologies have      changed the music marketplace  Maybe it is time for all of us  both      those of us up here on the dais and those of you at the witness      table  to step back and try to consider music licensing from its      first principles  Maybe we should primarily focus not on the      technologies that are delivering music today  but on the rights at      stake  Maybe then we can produce a licensing scheme that has a real      foundation in the rights of creators and the interests of      consumers  Maybe then the purposes of the Copyright Act  and of      this Committee  will be better realized in the marketplace for      music   I must thank my colleagues  Senators      Feinstein and Graham and Cornyn  as well as Senator Frist  for      taking up the formidable task of beginning this inquiry  Delving      into the morass of this statute  and trying to make some sense out      of it  is an act of real optimism and courage  I look forward to      hearing from our witnesses today  and I am grateful to all of them      for their time and expertise
