       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The President s Comments About The   Senate s Consideration Of The Mukasey Nomination                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Reaction Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      To The Presidents Comments     About The Senates Consideration Of The Mukasey Nomination  October 27  2007    The Senate is evaluating this nomination fairly       thoroughly and responsibly in keeping with the way other major      nominations are handled  Judge Mukaseys written responses to      questions from Republicans and Democrats  responses which the      Committee has not yet received  are critical in the consideration of      his nomination  As Chairman  I will work to ensure that both      Republicans and Democrats receive answers to these important      questions       Over the last six years  the White House has become accustomed to      thinking that they run the Senate  but those days are over  This is      a key position in a Justice Department that has become increasingly      politicized  and it comes at a crucial juncture for the Department       In order to be able to make an informed judgment  the Senate will      take the time that requires on this nomination  no more  and no      less      MUKASEY NOMINATION      FACTS AT A GLANCE     WHITE HOUSE ASSERTION       White House press secretary Dana Perino this week criticized the      Judiciary Committee for not completing the Mukasey hearings in a      single day   FACT  Two day      confirmation hearings are not unusual for nominations to major      Cabinet positions  And it was only on the second day of Judge      Mukasey s confirmation hearings that he departed from the broad      assurances he had given members of the Judiciary Committee and the      American people on such important topics as torture policy and      executive power   WHITE HOUSE ASSERTION       The President and White House aides have complained that the Senate      has not yet voted on the Mukasey nomination   FACT  The confirmation      process is proceeding under standard Committee practice  and has      even been expedited at several points  After the hearings were      concluded on Oct  18  senators were given one week to review the      hearing transcript and submit written questions  That deadline was      Thursday  Oct  25  It now is the nominee s responsibility to      respond to those questions       In contrast to the Senate s methodical and responsible handling of      this nomination  the White House allowed the Justice Department to      languish  rudderless  for months while keeping former Attorney      General Gonzales in the job  and while stonewalling congressional      efforts to investigate Justice Department scandals           For questions      submitted to Judge Mukasey                  Nomination Of      Michael B  Mukasey To Be Attorney
