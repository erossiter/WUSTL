       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Detention Center At Guantanamo   Bay  Cuba                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On The Detention Center At Guantanamo Bay  Cuba     June 30  2005 MR  LEAHY  At a      Defense Department news briefing in December 2001  a reporter asked      Secretary Rumsfeld why we should use Guantanamo Bay to hold      detainees  Secretary Rumsfelds answer was that he would      characterize Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  as the least worst place      we could have selected  This was hardly a ringing endorsement       Now  four and a half years later  the Administration and its      defenders have been trying to change the subject from the legal      morass that Guantanamo has become  and to argue that Guantanamo is      like an island resort  with great food  top notch medical care  and      a view of the ocean   These arguments      are distractions from the real issue  which is the needless way that      the Administrations unilateralism in its decisions about Guantanamo      have compromised American principles and ideals and weakened our      moral leadership in the world  If the Administration has improved      conditions at the prison  I am glad to know it  We may now run the      most humane prison in the most scenic location in the world  But it      is still a prison  Many prisoners have been kept in cells for more      than three years without being charged and without a meaningful      process to evaluate or challenge their detention  Regardless of how      well the detainees are treated  it is not the American way to detain      them indefinitely without an adequate hearing  These policies are      not only beneath us  but they have radicalized an untold number of      Muslims around the world  Even Secretary Rumsfeld had to admit last      year that he did not know whether we were capturing       killing or dissuading more terrorists every day than the madrassas      and radical clerics are recruiting  training and deploying against      us  This is important      because it is the ideals of the American people and of our great and      good country  and our longstanding commitment to the rule of law       that are being compromised  These are not the policies of a great      nation like ours  and this is not the American system of justice      that has been a beacon to the entire world  We need not trade away      our values and the principles that have guided us in order to feel      safer or to be safer  And if we do that  we give those who would      harm us a victory they could not win on any battlefield  and we cede      leverage to them that they will never deserve   Everyone in      Congress agrees that we must capture and detain terrorist suspects       but it can and should be done in accordance with the laws of war and      in a manner that upholds our commitment to the rule of law   In our recent hearing on      detainees  Senator Graham  a former Air Force lawyer who still      serves in the Reserves  said that once enemy combatant status has      been conferred upon someone  it is almost impossible not to      envision that some form of prosecution would follow  He continued       We can do this and be a rule of law nation  We can prove to the      world that even among the worst people in the world  the rule of law      is not an inconsistent concept  We know that some      of the detainees have been wrongly detained  And many suspect there      are others who have not yet been released  against whom the evidence      is weak at best  In a January 8  2005  New York Times      article  a senior American official claimed that the vast majority      of the 550 prisoners now held at the American detention center at      Guantanamo no longer had any intelligence value and were no longer      being regularly interrogated  The article also quotes a veteran      interrogator at Guantanamo who told the New York Times that      it became clear over time that most of the detainees had little      useful to say and that they were just swept up during the      Afghanistan war with little evidence they played any significant      role  The      Administration says these detainees are the worst of the worst and      pose a continuing threat to the safety of Americans  If that is      true  there must be at least basic evidence to support it  No one      advocates releasing terrorists  But it is the American way to      provide a fair process to ensure that the detainees at Guantanamo      really are a threat to our nation  In a break with military      tradition and regulations  the Administration denied detainees even      the limited process contemplated by Article 5 of the Third Geneva      Convention  and established the Combatant Status Review Tribunal  CSRT       only after being rebuked by the Supreme Court in Rasul v  Bush       The CSRT affirmed the enemy combatant status of the Guantanamo      detainees based on secret evidence to which the detainees were      denied access  raising serious questions about the fairness of the      process  It is time for      Congress to focus on the real issue  which is defending American      ideals and our commitment to the rule of law  The chicken at      Guantanamo may be wonderful  but this matters little to Americas      core values if we are imprisoning some people who may have been      wrongly accused of supporting terrorism and who have no way to      challenge their detention   The      Administration is trumpeting the humane treatment of detainees at      Guantanamo as a diversion  Guantanamo is a symbol of the needless      problems created by the unilateral ways this Administration has      chosen to proceed since 9 11  It is being used to deflect attention      from this Administrations deliberate rejection of the rule of law
