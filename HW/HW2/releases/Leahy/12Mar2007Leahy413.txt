       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy At The Senate Agriculture Committee   Field Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    At The Senate Agriculture Committee Field Hearing    Montpelier  Vermont    2007 Farm Bill Opportunities For Vermont And The Northeast    March 12  2007 Welcome to the Senate Agriculture Committees first     field hearing this year to examine the upcoming 2007 Farm Bill  I would     like to thank our witnesses today for taking time out of their busy     schedules to appear here  Your perspectives on the various Farm Bill     programs that Congress will write in the coming months are important to     us and the full Committee  I would also like to encourage other     interested Vermonters to submit testimony to the Committee  The record     of this hearing will remain open for five business days to allow     sufficient time for written comments  First  let me welcome Senator Bernie Sanders and     Congressmen Peter Welch to the Senate Agriculture Committee  As the     former Chairman of this Committee  and acting as Chairman today  I have     invited them to join me and ask any questions that they may have during     the course of the hearing  Also  Governor James Douglas was kind enough     to accept my invitation to present testimony on the good work the State     is undertaking to assist our farmers and rural communities  Welcome      Governor Douglas  Vermonts agriculture sector is vital to our     States future  Farming in Vermont is more than a job or an industry      It is a way of life  Vermonts landscape is defined by our farms      fields and forests  which also define much of our economy  In     particular our agricultural economy depends on the hundreds of millions     of dollars dairy farmers bring to the state every year  We all need to     ensure that dairying is not only a part of Vermonts rich past  but also     a vital part of Vermonts future   However  our dairy farms will not be able to     survive unless they can receive a fair price for the milk our farmers     produce  With the current depression in milk prices  ever increasing     fuel costs and near record high feed costs  dairy producers need     assistance in getting a fair price from the marketplace   I suspect nearly everyone in this room will agree     with me that the Northeast Dairy Compact was the single best tool for     getting a fair price for milk out of the market  not from the     government  Unfortunately we currently face an Administration that     killed the Compact in 2001 and  with their allies in Congress        continues to block any efforts to revive it   In 2002  the Vermont Congressional Delegation led     the effort to create the Milk Income Loss Contract  MILC  program that     was modeled on the benefits of the Northeast Dairy Compact  The MILC     program has delivered nearly  60 million to Vermont dairy farmers since     2002  While not perfect  it has been an essential safety net for many      Unlike the many of the large commodity programs run by the federal     government  the MILC program is targeted to small  generally family run     farms  and it only kicks in when the market price of milk plummets  MILC expires in the coming months before the new     Farm Bill will take effect  which means we start with a baseline in     which there is very little funding available for dairy programs in the     next Farm Bill  Though a difficult challenge for us  it is imperative     that the program is extended for a short time to ensure that dairy     programs will have an adequate level of funding during the consideration     of the Farm Bill  Much of the testimony we will hear today will help     inform our efforts to build on and improve the MILC program  However  the Farm Bill holds many opportunities in     addition to dairy policy  Ranging from important conservation programs     like the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP   to Rural     Development assistance for our communities  to funding to enhance the     productivity of working forest lands  we will hear testimony on how     these Farm Bill program have worked and how they can be improved   And while many people think about the Farm Bill in     terms of milk and other commodities  the legislation is one of the     largest anti hunger initiatives Congress will consider  Far too many     people in our communities lack resources to consistently put food on     their tables for their families and for themselves  In fact  the most     recent survey of food security by the Census Bureau and the U S      Department of Agriculture documents that more than 35 million people in     the United States live in households that face a constant struggle     against hunger  Some here may recall the dispute Ive had with the     Administration recently about their intention to stop using the word     hunger and to call it food security instead  But Ill continue to     call hunger by its name  It is absolutely essential  and it is     absolutely right    that the 2007 Farm Bill address the pressing problem     of hunger amid plenty  by strengthening our nations food assistance     programs  Finally there will be new opportunities in the next     Farm Bill to expand the agriculture economy in Vermont  On energy     production  Vermont is home to many emerging technologies that are     harnessing agriculture waste products to produce energy  And we lead the     nation on a per capita basis on organically certified farms  an issue     that is close to my heart after I authored the law that chartered the     organic standards and labeling program in 1990  We will be looking for     opportunities to expand and support organics  which are the fastest     growing sector of American agriculture  The Farm Bill also presents a     unique opportunity to provide real financial assistance to expand     broadband coverage in Vermont that is so important to our States     economic development   There are many issues to consider  and I look     forward to hearing todays testimony  We have a strong set of witnesses     that will build comprehensive record for the Vermont and Northeast     priorities for the next Farm Bill
