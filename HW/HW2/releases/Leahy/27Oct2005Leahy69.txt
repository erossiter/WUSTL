       Leahy  Jeffords Lead Successful Effort To Exempt Ski Pants From Quota                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy  Jeffords Lead Successful Effort To Exempt Ski Pants From      Quota  Exemption Benefits Vermont Ski      Industry  Tourists WASHINGTON       THURSDAY  Oct  27   Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Jim Jeffords       I Vt   announced Thursday that the U S  Department of Commerce will      exempt ski pants from the quota now applied to synthetic pants      imported from China  The exemption will allow Vermont ski      distributors and retailers to provide advanced  high quality gear no      longer made in the United States to skiers in Vermont during the      approaching season  The Vermont      Senators led a bipartisan effort to urge the Administration to      exempt ski pants from the U S  imposed quota on apparel and textile      goods imported from China  No domestic manufacturers currently      produce this advanced skiwear  and the senators noted that the quota      created substantial supply problems for the snow sports industry       The quotas  which are designed to protect American firms from      potentially unfair international competition  actually only served      to hurt American ski gear distributors  The Committee on the      Implementation of Textile Agreements  CITA   a division of the      Commerce Department  responded to the senators efforts by      announcing Thursday that ski pants will be exempt from the quota      that applies to man made fiber trousers  We began this      effort in July when the sun was high in the sky and the days were      warm  but we knew it was a problem that needed to be solved for      Vermont ski retailers before skiers hit the slopes  said Leahy       Its fitting that this decision came the day after our first      significant snowfall  because folks are not only thinking about      their snow tires but also their snow apparel  This is a victory for      Vermont businesses and Vermont tourism  This is great      news for Vermont businesses as the ski season approaches and      Vermonters and tourists alike look to stay warm and dry as they      enjoy our winter weather  said Jeffords  I am pleased the Commerce      Department has recognized the importance of this exemption to the      ski industry both in Vermont and throughout the country    Leahy and      Jeffords  who were joined by Sens  Judd Gregg  R  N H    Olympia      Snowe  R Maine   and Orrin Hatch  R Utah  in their efforts  first      wrote to the Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez in July expressing      concern about the problems the quotas created for the ski industry       and again in September urging the exemption  Quotas impose      legal limits on the amount of a product that can be imported  and      are intended to help domestic manufacturers  However  some      products  such as ski pants  have a limited domestic market  and      supplies are only filled by overseas manufacturers  The exemption      becomes effective November 1
