       Leahy Presses Gonzales On Ports Deal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Presses Gonzales On Ports Deal             Letter Seeks Answers On Bush      Administrations Speedy Review Of Deal     While Leaving Congress Out Of The Loop  WASHINGTON       Friday  Feb  24   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   the ranking member      of the Judiciary Committee  on Friday sent a letter to Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales seeking more information about the      Administrations approval of the deal that turns operations of six      U S  ports over to Dubai Ports World  a company owned by The United      Arab Emirates   The deal has      sparked significant controversy among Democrats and Republicans in      Congress  who were not informed of the agreement until after it was      announced  despite a mandate in the law for a thorough review      process  Several lawmakers  including Leahy  have also raised      questions about the national security implications of turning the      operation of major U S  ports over to a country with previous ties      to terrorism   Leahy and      several other Democratic and Republican senators have called for a      thorough investigation into the deal struck between the Bush      Administration and the UAE owned company  In his letter  Leahy      asked Gonzales to provide information on what role the Justice      Department played in the deal  whether any national security      concerns were raised and discussed  why the Administration opted not      to adhere to the 45 day review process set out in law  what legal      analysis was done  and whether the special assurances offered by the      Dubai company in a confidential January 6 letter could be enforced       The      Administration should have recognized that an unprecedented sale of      this size and scope requires extraordinary precautions to ensure      that appropriate security safeguards are in place at all of our      ports  Instead  they rushed through and rubberstamped a secret      review  and now they once again ask us to trust their vague      assurances that adequate national security arrangements are in      place  said Leahy   The text of      Leahys letter is below                    February 24  2006 The Honorable Alberto Gonzales     Attorney General     United States
