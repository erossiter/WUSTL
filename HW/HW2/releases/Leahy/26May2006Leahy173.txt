       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh      Senate Floor       May 26  2006 As debate       concludes today on the controversial nomination of Brett       Kavanaugh to a seat on the Court of Appeals for the D C        Circuit  I hope that Americans use this opportunity to reflect       on the checks and balances that have been lost in their       government  Sadly  this nomination adds to those losses    This is an       Administration that has been secretly wiretapping Americans for       years without warrants  despite the requirements of the law        This is an Administration that refused to allow the Justice       Departments own Office of Professional Responsibility to       proceed with an investigation into whether Justice Department       lawyers violated their responsibilities or the law in       establishing and justifying programs to spy on Americans  This       is an internal government investigation that is being stymied by       the Administration   This is an       Administration that has operated behind a wall of secrecy and       that has issued secret legal opinions justifying the use of       torture and rendition of prisoners to other countries  ignoring       the dangers such tactics pose to our own soldiers and Americans       around the world  This is an Administration that is talking       about prosecuting reporters and newspapers for trying to inform       the American people about their government  This is an       Administration that says the law is what the President decides       the law should be not what Congress passes    What is desperately       lacking throughout this Administration is accountability  A       Republican controlled Congress has not provided a check  making       it all the more important for the courts to be that check to       preserve our rights and way of life against the Governments       overreaching  Yesterday  those responsible for the Enrons       collapse  which cost so many employees and investors their       savings  were held accountable in a court of law  Yesterday        the President expressed some regrets over the disastrous course       he has charted in Iraq and began to acknowledge the harm done to       this country at Abu Ghraib   During his       last campaign  President Bush responded to a question about       mistakes he had made without acknowledging any except for some       of his nominations  Well  the Presidents picks for important       judicial nominations continue to fare no better than his picks       to head the CIA or FEMA or the VA  But bad judicial nominations       will continue for lifetimes  not just the two years left to the       Bush Cheney Administration  In just the past few months  we       have learned that Judge Terrence Boyle  President Bushs pick       for the Fourth Circuit and a sitting United States District       Judge  has ruled on multiple cases involving corporations in       which he held an interest  The Presidents nominee to the Tenth       Circuit  Judge James Payne  was withdrawn after it was revealed       that he  too  sat on many cases where he held stock in one of       the parties  Another of President Bushs nominees to the Fourth       Circuit  Claude Allen  who would be a sitting Circuit Judge now       if Democrats had not opposed his nomination  is now the subject       of a criminal prosecution for charges akin to stealing from       retail stores  And Michael Wallace  President Bushs pick for       the Fifth Circuit  recently received the first unanimous not       qualified rating from the ABA for a Circuit Court nominee in       nearly 25 years   Now we are       considering a nominee today  Brett Kavanaugh  who is a young and       relatively inexperienced  but ambitious member of the White       Houses inner circle  He is the Presidents pick to put another       ally and trusted vote on the D C  Circuit  He has spent most of       his legal career in partisan political positions  As Staff       Secretary to the President  Mr  Kavanaugh has been involved in       President Bushs use of 750 Presidential signing statements       designed to reserve for the President alone the power to choose       whether to enforce laws passed by Congress  As an Associate       White House Counsel   Mr  Kavanaugh       worked with Karl Rove on the Presidents plan to pack the       federal bench with ideologues such as William Pryor  Janice       Rogers Brown and others  He helped justify the wall of secrecy       that has shrouded so many of the White Houses activities        At his       hearing Mr  Kavanaugh emphasized  as if a qualification  that he       had earned the trust of the President and his senior       staff  All that may be useful for advancement within this       Presidents Administration or Republican circles  but those are       hardly qualities or qualifications for an independent judge of       this President and this Administrations actions  Indeed  when       pressed at his confirmation hearing to provide answers about his       qualifications for this lifetime appointment and how he would       fulfill his responsibilities as a judge  Mr  Kavanaugh sounded       like a spokesman and representative for the Administration        Over and over he answered our questions by alluding to what the       President would want and what the President would want him to       do  We heard from a nominee who parroted the Administrations       talking points on subject after subject  Rather than answer our       questions  he referred us to the bland explanation offered by a       former presidential spokesman  I do not think the Senate should       confirm a presidential spokesman to be a judge on the second       highest court in the land  I do not believe that Mr  Kavanaugh       demonstrated that he has left his role as a member of the       Presidents Administration or that he will    The reasons for the       downgrading of Mr  Kavanaughs ABA rating also raise concerns       about his independence        Not only did those who have seen Mr  Kavanaugh in his limited       legal practice describe him as less than adequate  but those       who were interviewed recently raised concerns about Mr        Kavanaughs ability to be balanced given his many years in       partisan positions working to advance a political agenda  They       described him as insulated  sanctimonious  and immovable and       very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on some issues        These may be good qualities for a partisan political operative        but they are not qualities that make for a good judge     My concerns about       Mr  Kavanaughs judicial independence are heightened by the fact       that he has been nominated to the D C  Circuit  a court which       the Republicans have spent more than a decade trying to pack        They spent President Clintons second term blocking his       highly qualified nominees  Elena Kagan  now Dean of Harvard Law       School  and Allen Snyder  a former clerk to Chief Justice       Rehnquist and highly respected litigator  Nonetheless  I voted       to confirm Judge John Roberts to be a member of the D C  Circuit       and later supported his nomination to be Chief Justice of the       Supreme Court    After the Senate       last year confirmed two of President Bushs nominees that I       strongly opposed    Janice Rogers Brown and Thomas Griffith          Republican appointees now comprise a two to one majority on this       important court  This is not a Court that needs another       rubberstamp for the Presidents political ally   The Senate       Republican leadership is catering to the extreme right wing and       special interest groups agitating for a fight over judicial       nominations  With a number       of judicial nominees ready for bipartisan confirmation  the       Senate Republican leadership would rather concentrate on this       controversial and divisive nominee   That this       nomination has not moved forward for three years is indicative       of the fact that even Republican Senators know what a poor       nomination this is  They have made no secret of the reason for       rushing this nomination through the Senate now  after it has       languished for three years under Republican control  and after       the nominee admitted to slow walking his responses to this       Committee  They want to stir up a fight  They want to score       cheap political points at the expense of another lifetime       appointment to the courts    The  Senate Republican leadership is       apparently heeding the advice of The Wall Street Journal       editorial page  which wrote   a  filibuster fight would be       exactly the sort of political battle Republicans need to       energize conservative voters after their recent months of       despond  Rich Lowery  editor of the conservative National       Review  listed a fight over judges as one of the ways       President Bush could revive his political fortunes  writing that       he should   p ush for the confirmation of his circuit judges       that are pending  Talk about them by name  The G O P  wins       judiciary fights  Republican Senators are relishing this       chance for a political fight  Senator Thune has said  A good       fight on judges does nothing but energize our base               Right now our folks are feeling a little flat  Senator Cornyn       has said  I think this is excellent timing  From a political       standpoint  when we talk about judges  we win  On May 8  2006       The New York Times reported  Republicans are itching for       a good election year fight  Now they are about to get one  a       reprise of last years Senate showdown over judges  The       Washington Post reported on May 10  Republicans had revived       debate on Kavanaugh and another Bush appellate nominee  Terrence       Boyle  in hopes of changing the pre election subject from Iraq        high gasoline prices and bribery scandals   We should not       stand idly by as        Republicans choose to use       lifetime federal judgeships for partisan political advantage        In a May 11  2006  editorial The Tennessean wrote          T he nation should look with       complete dismay at the blatantly political angle on nominations       being advocated by Senate Republicans now        Republicans are       girding for a fight on judicial nominees for no reason other       than to be girding for a fight  They have admitted as much in       public comments        In other words  picking a public fight       over judicial nominees is  in their minds  the right thing to do       because its the politically right thing to do        Now        Republicans are advocating a brawl for openly political       purposes  The appointment of judges deserves far more respect       than to be an admitted election year ploy        It should be       beneath the Senate to have such a serious matter subjected to       nothing but a tool for political gain  On May 3        2006  The New York Times wrote in an editorial     The Republicans have long used       judicial nominations as a way of placating the far right of       their party  and it appears that with President Bush sinking in       the polls  they now want to offer up some new appeals court       judges to their conservative base  But a lifetime appointment       to the D C  Circuit is too important to be treated as a       political reward  Our job in       Senate should not be to score political points or advance       partisan agendas  Our job is to fulfill our duty under the       Constitution for the American people  We must be able to assure       the American people that the judges confirmed to lifetime       appointments to the highest courts in this country are fair to       those who enter their courtrooms and to the law   We have heard       from many who are concerned about the nomination of Mr        Kavanaugh  The AFL CIO  United Auto Workers  and Service       Employees International Union have all written to us opposing       this nomination  The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights        NARAL PRO Choice American  and the National Council of Jewish       Women have all written to us opposing this nomination  The       Society of American Law Teachers  National Employment Lawyers       Association  and the Alliance for Justice have all written to us       opposing this nomination  Earthjustice and Community Rights       Counsel have also written to us concerned about this nomination         The Senates job is       to fulfill our duty under the Constitution  rather than act as a       rubberstamp for the Presidents attempt to pack the courts with       political allies  We must be able to assure the American people       that the judges confirmed to lifetime appointments to the       highest courts in this country are being appointed to be fair       and protect their interests  rather than those of a presidential       patron  Mr  Kavanaugh has given the Senate no reason to believe       he has the capacity for independence
