       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary   Committee  On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Nomination Of Brett Kavanaugh      May 11  2006  WASHINGTON        Thursday  May 11  2006   The Senate Judiciary Committee  in a       10 8 party line vote  reported out the controversial judicial       nomination of Brett Kavanaugh on Thursday  All eight Democratic       members of the Committee opposed the nomination  which now moves       to the full Senate  Kavanaugh is nominated to the D C  Circuit       Court of Appeals  Democratic senators raised questions about       Kavanaughs nomination based on his thin record of legal       experience  he has spent several years as a White House insider       working for President Bush and forwarding partisan Republican       agendas  including co authoring the Starr Report  as well as       his refusal to fully answer the Committees questions        Senators also raised concerns based on the ABAs recent       decision to downgrade Kavanaughs rating  noting his shallow       legal experience and questioning his ability to be fair and       balanced on the court given his extensive work on behalf of       partisan Republican causes  A statement from Senator Patrick       Leahy  D Vt    the ranking Democratic member of the panel        opposing the nomination  follows   The difficult and controversial       nomination and re nomination of Judge Boyle  the recent       nomination of Michael Wallace  and the re nomination of Brett       Kavanaugh indicate that the Bush Cheney Administration and its       allies in the Senate are more interested in heeding the siren       call of special interest groups and picking election year fights       than in finding well qualified judges  The Presidents declared       aim to be a uniter and not a divider by now is but a faded       memory  These are nominees who divide the American people and       who divide the Senate   Local and national law enforcement       have called upon the President to withdraw the nomination of       Judge Boyle  and he would be well advised to do so  The       nomination of Michael Wallace received the first       ABA rating of unanimously not qualified that I have seen for a       circuit court nominee since President Reagan  And the       nomination of Mr  Kavanaugh is one of the few to be downgraded       by the ABA upon further review  I cannot recall anyone being       confirmed after such a development    After seeing Mr  Kavanaugh at the       hearing  I can appreciate why the ABA peer review       committee heard from a judge that Mr  Kavanaughs argument was       less than adequate and as someone who demonstrated experience       on the level of an associate  Others interviewed recently       raised concerns about Mr  Kavanaughs ability to be balanced and       fair given his many years in partisan positions working to       advance a partisan political agenda  Mr  Kavanaugh was       described by interviewees as insulated  sanctimonious  and       immovable and very stubborn and frustrating to deal with on       some issues  These are not qualities that make for a good       judge  Despite the word put out falsely by his White House       defenders  it was not a change in membership on the ABA peer       review committee that led to his downgrading  Indeed        three quarters of those who had previously reviewed this       nomination and continued on the committee voted to downgrade the       rating based on the recent interviews and review    His response to one simple       question I asked during Tuesday afternoons hearing spoke       volumes  I asked why he had taken seven months to answer the       written questions submitted to him following his initial hearing       in 2004  His repeating the phrase that he took responsibility       for such dismissive and irresponsible conduct and  implicitly        for his lack of seriousness about the confirmation process       elicited laughter from the hearing room  but not from me  It       was not the first time that I felt Mr  Kavanaugh had       dissembled in response to my questions    I suspect that the truth is that       he made a political calculation and decided to expend his time       and effort on his benefactors re election campaign during the       spring  summer and fall of 2004  We did not receive any       response to our written questions until after that November 2004       election  Mr  Kavanaugh may be brilliant at politics and have       powerful supporters  but that does not mean that he will be a       good judge   In my opening statement at his       hearing I raised the key question regarding this nomination        Will he demonstrate his independence and show that he can serve       in the last  independent branch of the government that the       American people can look to as a check and balance on a       President who is asserting extraordinary claims of power  He       could have told us something about his responsibilities as Staff       Secretary or as an associate White House counsel and given us       examples of when he showed independence and good judgment  but       he did not    Instead  Mr  Kavanaugh appeared at       his confirmation hearing to be a spokesman and representative       for the Administration  Over and over he answered our questions       by alluding to what the President would want and what the       President would want him to do  We heard from a nominee who       parroted the Administrations talking points on subject after       subject  Rather than answer our questions  he referred us to       the bland explanation offered by former presidential spokesman       Scott McClellan  I do not think the Senate should confirm a       presidential spokesman to be a judge on the second highest court       in the land   We heard from a young man who when       invited by the Chairman to introduce his family  began his       remarks by thanking the President for nominating him and later       emphasized as if a qualification that he had earned the trust       of the President and his senior staff  All that may be       useful for advancement within this Presidents Administration or       Republican circles  but those are hardly qualities or       qualifications for an independent judge of this President and       this Administrations actions    Senator Graham put the question       this way during the course of the hearing  There       is a fine line between doing your job as a White House       counselor  being part of the judicial selection team and being a       judge yourself  There is a line between being advocate and       being a judge  I do not believe that Mr  Kavanaugh       demonstrated that he has left his role as a member of the       Presidents Administration or that he will     With the sudden       resignation last Friday of the Presidents hand picked head of       the CIA   America witnessed another heck of a       job accolade to an Administration insider leaving a critical       job undone  What is desperately lacking throughout this       Administration is accountability  A Republican controlled       Congress has not provided a check and has made it all the more       important for the courts to be that check to preserve our rights       and way of life  to check the Governments overreaching      Last year  when the       President nominated Harriet Miers  a woman who had not gone to       Ivy League schools but had a more impressive background of legal       experience than this nominee  Republicans questioned her       qualifications and demanded answers about her work at the White       House and legal philosophy  They defeated her nomination before       allowing her a hearing  While it now appears that Republicans       are back to their rubberstamping routine with every Senate       Republican ready to approve this nomination without question or       pause  the question raised by the nomination of the Presidents       own counsel and staff secretary remain  Will that nominee act       as a check and balance     The Senates job is       to fulfill our duty under the Constitution so that we can assure       the American people that the judges confirmed to lifetime       appointments to the highest courts in this country are being       appointed to be fair and protect their interests rather than to       advance a political agenda or that of a presidential patron    At his hearing       Senator  Feinstein and I gave Mr  Kavanaugh a       way to answer concerns about his loyalty to this President       affecting his decisions as a judge  We asked about recusal  He       could have said that he would not hear any matter that raised       questions about the Presidents claims or exercise of powers       given his close association with the development of the policies       and practices of this Administration  He could have walled off       matters covered by the presidential signing statement  now       reported to number 750  in which this President has shown an       assertiveness of unchecked Executive power that exceeds those of       Richard Nixon  He could have said that given his role in the       development of this Administrations secrecy policies  he would       recuse himself from those questions regarding the rights of the       American people to know about their Government  Instead  we       were served pabulum    My concerns about       Mr  Kavanaughs judicial independence are heightened by the fact       that he has been nominated to the D C  Circuit  a court on which       Republicans blocked President Clinton nominees for his second       term and have already managed to pack it with two other nominees       of this President who I found questionable    When the Republican Senate       majority stalled the nomination of Merrick Garland to the D C        Circuit beyond the 1996 election  even Senator Hatch became       frustrated and in March 1997 he proclaimed that the way that       Republicans were opposing judicial nominees was playing       politics with judges  was unfair and that he was sick of       it  Regrettably  he did not follow through  That was the last       nominee of President Clintons that Senator Hatch and the       Republican Senate were willing to consider to this important       Circuit  Two highly qualified nominees  Elena Kagan  now Dean       of the Harvard Law School  and Allen Snyder  who       had served as a clerk to Justice Rehnquist and was an       experienced and respected litigator  were left without       consideration for years  The fact is that for the rest of       President Clintons entire second term  Senate Republicans would       not consider another nominee to the D C  Circuit  The result is       that today  judges appointed by Republican Presidents outnumber       those appointed by Democratic Presidents six to three on this       pivotal Circuit   At a time when the Senate should       be addressing Americans top priorities  including ways to make       America safer  the war in Iraq  rising gas prices  health care       and health insurance costs  stem cell research  comprehensive       immigration reform and the reauthorization of the Voting Rights       Act  the President and his Senate allies  instead  try to divide       and distract from fixing real problems by pressing forward with       controversial and unqualified nominations   The Senate Republican leadership is       ready to cater to the extreme right wing and special interest       groups agitating for a fight over judicial nominations  They       have made no secret of the reason for rushing this nomination       through this Committee and to the Senate after it has languished       for three years under Republican control and a nominee who       admitted to slow walking his responses to this committee  They       want to stir up a fight    Mr  Kavanaugh is a young and       relatively inexperienced but ambitious person who in two       hearings has failed to demonstrate his capacity for       independence  Accordingly  I oppose reporting his nomination to       the full Senate
