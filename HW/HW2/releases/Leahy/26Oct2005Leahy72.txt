       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Terrorism  Emergency   Preparedness                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Hearing Before The Subcommittee On      Terrorism  Technology  Homeland Security     Terrorism  Emergency Preparedness October 26  2005 I thank Senator      Kyl for convening todays hearing and commend his efforts to address      the critical issue of terrorism preparedness   I want to welcome each of      our witnesses  particularly my friend Slade Gorton        Terrorism was not a top priority of the Bush Administration when it      took office in January 2001  Problems ranged from an understaffed      foreign translation program  woefully inadequate information      systems  and cultural attitudes that frustrated information sharing      across agencies  Just one day before the September 11  2001       terrorist attacks  the serving Attorney General rejected the FBIs      request to include more money for counterterrorism in his budget      proposal  After the attacks of 9 11  the Administration resisted      this Committees efforts to examine what led to the tragedy  The      Administration fought attempts by Congress to establish a Department      of Homeland Security  It tried to block the formation of the 9 11      Commission  and then it put roadblocks in the way of the      Commissioners as they worked to fully investigate under its mandate  Unfortunately       this Administration has displayed a clear pattern by misreading the      warning signs of impending disaster  whether in the form of a      terrorist attack or a natural disaster  often with dire consequences      for Americans  We recently saw the Administrations failure to plan      for  and quickly react to  Hurricane Katrina  It has been shocking      and sobering to see how woefully unprepared our government was to      help the victims of this disaster  The government failed to react      despite reports that were prepared on exactly the point at hand  a      hurricane in New Orleans that caused the levees to breach  The      chaotic response raises serious concerns about the adequacy of our      preparedness to respond to terrorist attacks  despite the many      billions of dollars spent by the Department of Homeland Security      since 9 11  Terrorism experts      warn about the      possibility of a catastrophic bioterrorist attack  yet we learned      last fall that we are not prepared to meet the biological threat      that comes every year  influenza  I hoped that the Bush      Administration would learn a lesson from the 2003 shortage of flu      vaccines  Instead  health providers across the country  including      in my home state of Vermont  were forced to ask healthy people to      forgo their flu shot  If the governments top health officials can      not prepare for the seasonal flu  an annual occurrence  what does      that portend about their ability to prepare for biological terrorist      attacks   The President      only recently addressed the threat of avian flu spreading to the      United States  but the Administrations track record gives me little      confidence that an outbreak in our country would be handled      effectively  I am particularly troubled by the Presidents proposal      to use the military to enforce quarantines and travel restrictions      in the event of an avian flu outbreak  Putting the military in the      lead role in domestic disaster situations negates fundamental      attributes of the National Guard  its experience in working with      local and state first responders and its familiarity with local      communities   It would be      comforting if we could at least tell Americans that their Government      was doing everything possible and practical to keep them safe       Unfortunately  we cannot truthfully tell them that  As we sit here      today  there is much left undone in securing our nation  The 9 11      Public Discourse Project  a public education campaign founded by the      members of the 9 11 Commission  issued a report in September on our      governments progress towards improving emergency      preparedness and response  The report evaluates      five recommendations issued by the 9 11 Commission in July 2004       The progress of each recommendation received a status ranking  four      received a minimal progress ranking and the fifth received a      ranking of unsatisfactory  Commissioners Kean and Hamilton issued      a statement with the report in which they warned that Congress and      the Executive branch need to step up to the plate  They need to      respond with a necessary sense of urgency to adopt the reforms we      recommend on emergency preparedness and response       While I share the concerns of the 9 11 Commissioners  I am hesitant      to fully embrace one of their recommendations on emergency      preparedness  The Commission recommends basing  federal homeland security funding      strictly on an assessment of risks and vulnerabilities  I strongly      believe that every state  rural or urban  small or large  has      basic domestic security needs and deserves to receive federal funds      to meet those needs  Instead of pitting large states against small      states  as the Administration has done by shortchanging overall      resources for first responders  the needs of both should be      recognized and addressed  These funds help police  fire and rescue      squads meet the homeland security responsibilities the federal      government is asking them to meet  The attacks on      9 11 were a horrible tragedy for our nation  They should have also      served as a wake up call  Four years later we remain unprepared for      another major terrorist attack  Our inadequate response to natural      disasters highlights how vulnerable we are to a major act of      terrorism  Rather than hope that an attack does not occur  we      should act as if an attack is inevitable and strive to be fully      prepared  Our main focus must remain on preventing terrorism  but      we cannot dismiss the possibility that we will someday confront      another day like 9 11
