       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Combating Trafficking Of Women And   Children                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt        Combating Trafficking Of Women And Children     July 29  2005 Mr  President  I      rise today to draw attention to the widespread problem of human      trafficking  It is the worlds fastest growing criminal enterprise       It is a modern day form of slavery  involving victims who are      forced  defrauded or coerced into sexual or labor exploitation       Annually  nearly one million people  mostly women and children  are      trafficked worldwide  including nearly 18 000 persons into the      United States        The fact is that the violent subjugation and exploitation of women      and girls is on going and not enough is being done by governments to      address it  Take for example reports that in a marketplace in      Skopje  Macedonia  women are forced to walk around a stage naked      while brothel owners point their fingers to make a selection  Women      are bought and sold like cattle and treated like slaves        In Krong Koh Kong  Cambodia  14 year old girls stand outside a row      of shacks where they charge the equivalent of  2 or  3 dollars for      sex  half of which goes to their pimps  These girls  many of whom      have AIDS  are discarded when they become too sick to continue      working        Even in the United States  we are not immune to the scourge of human      trafficking  Earlier this month  federal agents raided brothels and      businesses in San Francisco and arrested two dozen people allegedly      operating an international sex trafficking ring  Nearly 100 South      Korean women were lured to illegally enter the United States      whereupon they were held captive and forced to work as prostitutes            Around the world  women and girls are sold as slaves and forced to      engage in unprotected sex because clients offer more money for such      acts  These women have no control over their lives  their health  or      their futures  Trafficking victims in the      sex industry are exposed to HIV AIDS at much higher rates than the      general population with no access to medical care  The fear of      infection of AIDS among customers has driven traffickers to recruit      younger girls  erroneously perceived to be too young to have been      infected   Just last month  the State Department issued its fifth annual      Trafficking in Persons Report  which ranks the efforts of 150      countries to combat human trafficking  Some have observed that the      United States has been soft on certain Asian countries thought to be      lax on trafficking  such as Indonesia  Philippines  India  and      Thailand  Because these countries are vital allies in fighting      terrorism  they may have been treated with greater leniency        On the other hand  this year  the State Department identified four      Middle East allies  Kuwait  Qatar  Saudi Arabia  and the United      Arab Emirates  as being among the worst offenders of human      trafficking and whose governments are doing little to control it       Despite the fact that these countries have been important partners      of the United States  their inadequate efforts on human trafficking      demand a call to action by the United States        Mr  President  this report is merely one first step in combating a      growing international problem  We must call upon governments around      the world to renew their efforts against this form of modern day      slavery        We must rededicate our efforts to the prevention of human      trafficking  protection of victims  and prosecution of traffickers       No where on earth should it be acceptable to deceive  abuse  and      force a person into a life of enslavement  To deny a person their      right to freedom is an affront to the ideals established nearly 57      years ago in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights  We can and      must do better
