       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Medical Malpractice Legislation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Medical Malpractice Legislation    May 8  2006      I     find it unfortunate that we do not hear any discussion by proponents     of this legislation about what is best for patients injured or     killed by medical errors  The debate in favor of malpractice award     caps has been cast in terms of patient accessibility to health care      but what about patient safety  Capping non economic damages may     benefit insurance companies  but it does nothing for victims and     nothing to address the serious problem of preventable medical     errors        Despite all of the rhetoric and all the myths and misinformation     about the so called crisis facing our medical professionals  what     about the fact that medical errors kill up to 100 000 people each     year  How does capping what a victim can recover help address this     tragic fact  Rather than having all the talk be about alleged     physician shortages and phantom reductions in insurance rates  we     should be looking at how to improve the quality of care patients     receive and how to improve patient safety  This legislation does     nothing to provide any incentive for health care providers to     improve the safety of their services  drug companies to rigorously     test their products  or nursing homes to provide responsible and     compassionate care to our elderly citizens    As     insurance rates  like gas prices  continue to soar to the benefit of     corporate profits  as the number of uninsured continue to rise     during this presidency  the Republican controlled Senate seeks to     take up partisan legislation that will help a few very powerful     insurance companies become even more powerful  Rather than take up     legislation to apply competitive antitrust principles to the     business of insurance  the Majority Leader insists that we limit     our actions to legislative proposals that will deprive citizens     injured by medical errors a full measure of justice  Instead of     taking up legislation to push the frontiers of life saving medicine     through stem cell research  we are going to debate whether we should     make it easier for insurance companies to continue their predatory     behavior at the expense of both doctors and patients    In     recent weeks  hundreds of thousands of Americans have taken to the     streets in peaceful demonstrations to urge sensible and humane     immigration reform and the public clearly wants Congress to address     these issues and to strengthen our borders  and instead we are     discussing how to dismantle our internal borders and tread on state     sovereignty by nullifying state tort law  A war rages in Iraq in     which our Nations best and bravest are making the ultimate     sacrifice to advance democracy  and meanwhile we are talking about     how to curtail Americans access to justice  Forty five million     people do not have health insurance in this country  and yet we are     considering legislation that will make it harder for children who     suffer lifelong injuries from medical errors to get the long term     care they need  The gap between the richest Americans and everyone     else continues to widen  but instead of taking up legislation to     raise the minimum wage  the Majority Leader wants to shield     lucrative insurance companies from having to pay fair awards to     medical malpractice victims  Where in the Majority Leaders     schedule are the American peoples real priorities        There are ways to improve health care  These bills do not do that      There are alternatives that address the high costs of medical     malpractice insurance and patient safety  but they differ from the     narrow approach we debate today  There are solutions to both the     current high rate of medical errors  as well as high insurance     costs  that will not further victimize patients or intrude into the     sovereignty of state legislatures and citizens  but they are not     brought before the Senate for consideration and action        Some of us have proposed legislation to tackle the problem of rising     insurance costs without taking away American citizens access to     justice   If     we want to reign in the costs of insurance for health care     providers  we must address the conditions within the insurance     industry  I have proposed a bill along with Senator Kennedy to     exempt medical malpractice insurers from the counterproductive     McCarran Ferguson Act  This bill would give regulators the tools     necessary to prevent anticompetitive business practices that hurt     doctors and patients  If medical malpractice insurers are     artificially driving up the costs of insurance  we should stop it      Health care in our country is too important to allow profits at the     expense of patients    I     urge other Senators to join me in rejecting legislation that will do     nothing more than benefit profitable insurance companies under the     guise of improving patient accessibility  Let us work together in a     bipartisan fashion to come up with real solutions to the problem of     preventable medical errors  Let us find ways to end the abusive     practices in assisted living facilities and nursing homes  Let us     find ways to lower insurance costs without hurting victims  Those     in need of care must be able to trust their doctors and health care     providers without doubt  Elderly Americans deserve the best care     that can be provided  Our doctors and other health care providers     deserve to be treated fairly in the marketplace when purchasing     malpractice insurance  If we work together  we can make progress     and make a difference
