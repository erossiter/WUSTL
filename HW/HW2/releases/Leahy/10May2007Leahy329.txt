       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On FY 08 State  Foreign   Operations Budget Request                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick    Leahy    Chairman  State  Foreign Operations  And Related Programs Subcommittee    Hearing On   FY08 State  Foreign Operations Budget Request   May 10  2007  Secretary Rice  it is good to have you here to discuss    the Administrations Fiscal Year 2008 budget request for the State    Department and Foreign Operations   We have too much to cover and too little time  so I am    going to make only brief remarks  I would urge you to do the same  as we    have your written testimony for the Record  I want to be sure that all    Senators have a chance to ask questions   Madam Secretary  wherever I go these days  a question I    am invariably asked is how can the United States repair the damage to its    international reputation as a nation that has historically stood for the    rule of law  including international law  for peace  and for defending the    fundamental rights of people everywhere regardless of race  religion     ethnicity or nationality   The policies of this Administration  from Iraq to    Guantanamo  have turned strong allies into reluctant partners  and friends    into antagonists  According to surveys  many people  particularly in Muslim    countries  now see America as a greater threat than the religious extremists    who incite hatred and violence  This should alarm us and stir us to    action  Those who hold these views are horribly mistaken  But we are not    doing enough to convince them otherwise  While some may argue that taking unpopular stands is    the price of leadership  I reject that as a justification for the damage we    have needlessly caused to a proud and principled reputation that took the    founding of our nation  a civil war  two world wars  and the lives of    countless American patriots to forge  fortify and defend   Everywhere I look    from the Pacific Rim to the Middle    East  from Darfur to South America  our image  and our influence  are    waning sharply in the face of growing challenges  Once again  we have    learned the painful lesson that military might is no substitute for    effective policies that rally support and cooperation from the international    community   Transformational diplomacy is a lofty slogan for what    amounts to adding new positions at posts that have been under staffed for    years  I welcome it  But beyond that  your 2008 budget offers little    confidence that this Administration is prepared to devote the resources    necessary to successfully exert Americas influence in such a complex and    dangerous world   Senator Gregg and I will do our best to fund the    Presidents requests and to incorporate the meritorious suggestions of    Senators  but I am afraid that once again we will fall far short of what    this country is capable of and should do  We want you to succeed in the time you have left     particularly in the Middle East where so much is at stake  But much time    has been wasted and much good will has been squandered   This White House has not only favored a my way or the    highway unilateralism in its dealings with the world  it has often treated    Democrats in Congress the same way  It was as unnecessary as it was    ineffective  and the American people and our national interests in the world    have paid a high price for it   We may have our disagreements  but you  Madam    Secretary  and your staff  have always been accessible and willing to    discuss ways that we can work together  I appreciate that and hope we can    do more of it in the months ahead   Questions  Round 1   Questions  Round 2
