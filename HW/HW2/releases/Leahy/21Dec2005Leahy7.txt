       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Failing Our Domestic Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On Failing Our Domestic Priorities     December 21  2005 MR  PRESIDENT  I      must express my opposition to the irresponsible domestic budget      policy that has been forwarded by the majority party  The Senate is      being asked to approve spending and budget bills that make deep cuts      to programs that serve some of our countrys neediest citizens  At      a time of year typically signified by wishes of goodwill towards      all  it is difficult to be anything but outraged by this attack on      critical components of our social safety net  While many in the      majority party have claimed that these bills are needed in order to      reduce the deficit  with the knowledge that the leadership will make      passing massive tax cuts benefiting some of the wealthiest among us      a priority during the next session  this argument is simply      disingenuous   Instead of      putting the country on the road to fiscal security  these bills      expose the agenda of the majority that blatantly undermines American      families and make clear where the priorities of the majority party      lie  It is not with the family that relies on Medicaid for their      health insurance  the student who  without student aid  cannot      afford to attend college  or the mother who needs childcare so that      she can go to work and put food on the table for her family  Nor is      it with the single mother who has been abandoned without child      support  the grandparent raising their grandchild on a fixed income       or the worker who has lost his or her job and is trying to be      retrained   No  the      priorities of this majority party consistently lie with the powerful      special interests and big drug companies  At every opportunity the      Republican leadership has had to choose between supporting the      American people or wealthy corporate interests  and they have sided      with the corporate interests  Even by the standards of this first      session of the 109th Congress  with the consistent      erosion of consumer protections and support for American working      families  these bills sink to new lows  As a result  dozens of      health  education  labor  and human services programs will be cut      and millions of people who rely on these programs will suffer       Some of the most      egregious policies in these bills expose the disparity between the      treatment of big drug companies and those individuals who must rely      on Medicaid as their primary form of health care  With numerous      options on the table  the Republican leadership chose to use the      budget reconciliation bill to increase Medicaid co payments and      premiums  potentially eliminated federal standards for comprehensive      Medicaid care  and created highly restrictive rules governing the      transfer of assets for those who require care in a nursing home       Rather than do away with an unnecessary multi billion dollar slush      fund for insurers and drug companies  a small group of Congressional      budget writers has chosen to freeze home health payments that ensure      seniors are able to receive care in the comfort of their own homes  In addition  this      years Labor  Health and Human Services  Labor HHS  Appropriations      Bill shortchanges our countrys rural health programs  For      instance  the bill eliminates five programs  including funding for      Rural EMS and Health Education Training Centers  which are critical      to the fragile network of the rural health care infrastructure       One of the most      disappointing aspects of the Labor HHS Bill was the treatment of the      National Institutes of Health  NIH   Not since 1970 has the NIH      been provided an increase as small as the one contained in this      bill  As a result  the vital medical research being done around the      country  including in my home state at the University of Vermont       will suffer  The search for cures to innumerable diseases will be      slowed and foreign competitors will be given a chance to exploit our      short sightedness   Not only will      this Congress take the step of cutting education for the first time      in ten years  these will be the biggest cuts in history to student      loan programs  A remarkable  12 7 billion will be cut from student      aid programs so that there will be no increase to the Pell Grant for      an astonishing fourth year in a row  While making changes to      eliminate loopholes in student loan lending laws  it appears that      small lenders that specialize in providing comprehensive loan      counseling to students have been given short shrift  It appears      that from almost every angle  students are assaulted by these      policies  For those      education programs that are lucky enough to escape the knife  they      will either be frozen or given minimal increases  I am curious to      know how our Nations schools can be expected to meet and exceed the      standards set forth in the No Child Left Behind Act  when Congress      is content to slash funding by three percent  leaving these programs      to sink more than  13 billion below their authorized levels  It has      been almost five years since Congress passed this legislation  and      we have consistently failed to meet our commitment to students       parents and teachers   In what is      becoming a hallmark of this Republican leadership  these conference      reports are loaded down with controversial legislation approved by      neither body  Despite bipartisan support for legislation approved      by the Senate Finance Committee earlier this year  Senators are      being asked to approve a five year reauthorization of the Temporary      Assistance to Needy Families Program that would impose strict new      working requirements with only nominal new funding for child care      support  At the same time Congress asks single mothers to work      longer hours  it cuts money for child support enforcement  dollars      that are used to track down deadbeat dads   Though it is a      sad commentary on the current state of affairs when one of the lone      bright spots for health and human service programs is that this bill      includes no cuts to the Food Stamp program  I would be remiss if I      did not mention my appreciation that this program remained      unscathed  While protecting Food Stamps should be hailed as a      victory  the Community Food and Nutrition Program  a modestly sized      program that helps support anti hunger advocacy groups  was not so      fortunate  The work being done on the local levels by these groups      is extremely important  and it is my hope that these funds will be      restored next year   The programs and      services I have mentioned are but a few of the dozens of cuts that      will negatively impact families across the country  As we usher out      the final days of 2005 and the 1st Session of the 109th      Congress  I am saddened that the last actions of this body will be      to pass such harmful bills  After more than 30 years in the Senate       I know that we can do better and it is my sincere hope that when we      return next year  we will reverse the wayward direction set by such      policies and implemented by such legislation   Mr  President  I      yield the floor
