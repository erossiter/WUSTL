       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing on Hamdan v  Rumsfeld    Establishing A Constitutional Process                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       Hearing On Hamdan v        Rumsfeld  Establishing A Constitutional Process      July 11  2006  Mr  Chairman  today we pick up       where the Judiciary Committee started almost five years ago in       November and December 2001  when we urged the President to work       with us to construct a just system of special military       commissions  You and I introduced bills with procedures that       would have complied with our obligations under law and provided       the kind of full and fair trials the President has said that       he wants to provide    This hearing today follows the       United States Supreme Courts repudiation of the Presidents       military commissions  The Supreme Court determined that the       Bush Cheney Administrations system for prosecuting detainees at      Guantanamo is illegal  It is a decision that       has given our system of constitutional checks and balances a       tonic that was sorely needed  The Supreme Court is right in       holding that the President is bound to comply with the Rule of       Law  One of our core American values is that no one is above       the law  I commend the Supreme Court for acting as a       much needed check on this Administrations unilateral policies       that have stretched beyond the Presidents lawful authority         This decision provides yet another       example of this Administrations arrogance and incompetence in       the war on terror  When the President announced the creation of       these commissions  Alberto Gonzales  then White House Counsel        touted them as a means to dispense justice swiftly  close to       where our forces may be fighting  But the results have proved       otherwise  In the last five years there have been no trials and       no convictions of any of the detainees and no one has been       brought to justice through these commissions  Instead  precious       time  effort and resources have been wasted     In our hearings in 2001we heard       from the Attorney General as well as from two Assistant       Attorneys General  the General Counsel to the Department of       Defense and a number of knowledgeable witnesses  We suggested       that at this hearing the Bush Cheney Administration be       represented at the highest levels  by the current Attorney       General  the Secretary of Defense  and the Navy Judge Advocate       General    Unfortunately  we have been sent a       deputy counsel and an acting assistant attorney general and no       one from the Judge Advocate Generals Corps  That is not the       fault of the witnesses  though it is an unmistakable message       about this Administrations continuing unwillingness to work       with us and listen to those most knowledgeable in these matters       from the ranks of experienced and dedicated military lawyers and       those from the State Department  as well  Had this       Administration done so from the outset  we would not be in the       circumstance that we find ourselves in today    When the Bush Cheney       Administration rejected our advice  refused to work with       Congress and chose to go it alone in the development of military       commissions  they made a mistake of historic and constitutional       proportions  I hope that the Administration will begin todays       hearings by admitting their mistakes and acknowledging the       limits on presidential authority  As Justice Kennedy emphasized       in his opinion  Subject to constitutional limitations        Congress has the power and responsibility to determine the       necessity for military courts  and to provide the jurisdiction       and procedures applicable to them    The Supreme Courts decision is a       triumph for our constitutional system of checks and balances        It stands for a simple proposition  When Congress passes a law       the President is bound to follow it  Congress passed the       Uniform Code of Military Justice  Our country adopted and is       bound to abide by the Geneva Conventions  regardless of whether       the Attorney General still considers them to be quaint  This       President decided not to follow the law  In       America  no one  not even the President  is above the law   The Supreme Courts opinion is not       surprising  What is surprising is that three Justices who claim       the mantle of conservatism were so deferential to the President       that they would not stand up for the Rule of Law and reinforce       the protections of our fundamental freedoms made possible by the       Constitutions separation of powers  Instead  they dissented          In the Fall of 2001  in the wake       of September 11  a Democratically led Senate worked on a       bipartisan basis to give the Administration the tools it needed       to fight the war on terror  Within days of September 11  we       passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force in order to       provide authority for the military action against Osama bin       Laden for those horrific attacks and against those harboring him       in Afghanistan  We worked with the President to       pass the USA PATRIOT Act  but we included sunset provisions in       order to be able to revisit those powers in a timely fashion         I urged the Administration to work       with us on establishing military commissions to ensure their       legitimacy  their efficiency  and their effectiveness  The       President decided to go it alone  Instead of acting in unity       and pursuant to congressional authority  the Administration       decided to rely on what it called an extension of the       Presidents power as Commander in Chief    Instead of working with us  the       President established a system so flawed that upon reviewing it        the United States Supreme Court concluded that it       violated not only the American common law of war  but also the       rest of the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the rules and       precepts of the law of nations    It is telling that within a week       of the 230th anniversary of our great Declaration of       Independence from tyranny  the Supreme Court found it necessary       to admonish this Administration with James Madisons warning        The accumulation of all powers legislative  executive and       judiciary in the same hands       may justly be pronounced the       very definition of tyranny  In America  no one        not even the President  is above the law   I am a former prosecutor  I find       it hard to fathom that this Administration is so incompetent       that it needs kangaroo court procedures to convince a tribunal       of United States military officers that the       worst of the worst imprisoned at Guantanamo Bay should be held       accountable  Military commissions should not be set up as a       sham  They should be consistent with the high standard of       American military justice that has worked for decades  If they       are to be United States military commissions  they should       dispense just punishment fairly  not just be an easier way to       punish    For five years  the Bush Cheney       Administration has violated fundamental American values  damaged       our international reputation  and delayed and weakened       prosecution of the war on terror    not because of any coherent       strategic view that it had  but because of its stubborn       unilateralism and dangerous theory of unfettered Executive power       augmented by self serving legal reasoning        Guantanamo Bay has been such a debacle that even the President       now says it should be shut down  But the damage keeps       accumulating under this President  Along with Abu Ghraib and       the alleged criminal misconduct against civilians in Iraq  the       detention of hundreds held at Guantanamo without a single trial       or conviction through these now illegal commissions have       undermined our standing in the world and sullied the moral high       ground from which we look to lead the world toward democracy        freedom  human rights and human dignity    I said to the Attorney General in       2001  and I say again now  America works best       when all parts of our Government work together  By acting       unilaterally  and in violation of laws passed by Congress  this       Administration has acted as if it was above the law  The       President has important responsibilities and tremendous power        but he is part of a constitutional system and must be subject to       the Rule of Law    Too often the rhetoric surrounding       this debate is couched as one about conflicting values of       national security versus civil liberties  That is a political       distraction that undermines our security and our values  That       rhetoric ignores the reality that by getting the process right       we will have greater security  The point of having a just       system is not to be soft on terrorism  rather  it is to       ensure the process actually gets the right people  We are not       safer as a Nation by imprisoning innocent people while the truly       dangerous remain free   Some still will not admit this       Administrations errors  They argue as if the       United States should measure itself against the brutality of the       terrorists  Our standards have always been higher than that  I       disagree with their argument when it comes to the Rule of Law        I disagree when it comes to engaging in torture  I disagree       when it comes to honoring our legal and international       obligations  Americas ideals are sullied whenever we resort to       bumper sticker slogans about giving special privileges to       terrorists  No one is urging special privileges  The President       says he is for fairness and justice  So am I  But I would like       to see a system that can determine guilt and punish the guilty        I am for a system that works  and a system that honors the       American values that have been part of our strength as a good       and great nation   Military justice is swift and       effective  Courts martial have been used to bring some members       of our own Armed Forces  who violated the law  to justice        Others are being investigated  Meanwhile  not one of the       prisoners at Guantanamo Bay  who the President has       called the worst of the worst  has been brought to justice        Iraq may well complete its trial of Saddam Hussein before a       single Guantanamo detainee is tried  The system the       Administration created was fatally flawed  and it has created       perverse results    If the President decides not to       proceed promptly by courts martial against the detainees  I       remain willing to work to develop bipartisan legislation       creating military commissions that will comply with our laws  I       will do so despite the past five years in which the       Administration has shown no interest in working with us  If we       are to do so we need to have our questions answered  We need to       know why we are being asked to deviate from rules for       courts martial  And we also need to see a realization by this       Administration that it is Congress that writes our laws  and       that no officeholder  branch or agency of our government is       above the law
