       Leahy Welcomes Pentagon s Support For Raising Death Payments To Families   Of U S  Troops  Including Guard Members  Killed In Combat Zones                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Cornyn  Leahy Introduce Bill         To Promote Openness In Government         Bipartisan Legislation Improves  Strengthens FOIA         WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Feb  16     U S  Senators John Cornyn  R Texas   a        member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  and Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the        ranking Democratic member of the panel  introduced legislation on Wednesday        to achieve meaningful reforms to federal government information laws  most        notably the Freedom of Information Act of 1966  FOIA     The        bipartisan Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act        of 2005  or the OPEN Government Act  is aimed at substantially enhancing        and expanding the accessibility  accountability  and openness of the        federal government  The legislation is supported by groups from across the        political spectrum  including the ACLU and the Heritage Foundation     This        reform legislation was created from the belief that FOIA establishes a        presumption of openness  said Cornyn  who in 2001 was presented with the        James Madison Award for his efforts to promote open government by the        Freedom of Information Foundation of Texas  Open        government is one of the most basic requirements of any healthy democracy         It allows for taxpayers to see where their money is going  it permits the        honest exchange of information that ensures government accountability  and        it upholds the ideal that government never rules without the consent of the        governed   This        bill advances one of the most fundamental rights of Americans  the publics        right to know what its government is doing  said Leahy  who has been a        longtime champion of FOIA in Congress  Leahy sponsored the Electronic        Freedom of Information Act Amendments  which updated FOIA for the Internet        age  and in 1996 he was installed in the Freedom of Information Act Hall of        Fame    Access        to public information in a timely and effective manner is a vital piece of        our democratic system of checks and balances that promotes accountability        and imbues trust  said Leahy  FOIA represents the foundation of our        modern open government laws and this bill builds on that by updating its        protections to include new technologies and refining the process to reduce        delays and encourage accessibility    The        Cornyn Leahy legislation is not just pro openness  pro accountability  and        pro accessibility   it s also pro Internet  It includes a hotline enabling        citizens to track their requests  including Internet tracking  and grants        privileged FOIA fees for bloggers and writers for Internet outlets         providing the same status as traditional media    The        last time Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a decade ago         and the Senate Judiciary Committee has not convened an oversight hearing on        compliance issues since  April 30  1992  The Senate Homeland Security        and Governmental Affairs Committee  which shares jurisdiction over federal        government information  has not held a FOIA oversight hearing since 1980   The        OPEN Government Act contains more than a dozen substantive provisions         designed to achieve the following four objectives    1         Strengthen FOIA and close loopholes   2         Help FOIA requestors obtain timely responses to their requests   3         Ensure that agencies have strong incentives to act on FOIA requests in a        timely manner   4         Provide FOIA officials with all of the tools they need to ensure that our        government remains open and accessible         STRENGTHEN FOIA AND CLOSE LOOPHOLES                   Ensure that FOIA applies when agency recordkeeping functions are outsourced                   Establish a new open government impact statement  by requiring that any        future Congressional attempt to create a new FOIA exemption be expressly        stated within the text of the legislation                   Impose annual reporting requirement on usage of the DHS disclosure        exemption for critical infrastructure information                   Protect access to FOIA fee waivers for legitimate journalists  regardless        of institutional association  including bloggers and other Internet based        journalists                   Provide reliable reporting of FOIA performance  by requiring agencies to        distinguish between first person requests for personal information and        other kinds of requests  HELP        FOIA REQUESTORS OBTAIN TIMELY RESPONSES                   Establish FOIA hotline services  either by telephone or on the Internet  to        enable requestors to track the status of their requests                   Create a new FOIA ombudsman  located at the Administrative Conference of        the United States  to review agency FOIA compliance and provide        alternatives to litigation                   Authorize reasonable recovery of attorney fees when litigation is        inevitable  ENSURE        THAT AGENCIES HAVE STRONG INCENTIVES TO ACT ON FOIA REQUESTS IN TIMELY        FASHION                   Restore meaningful deadlines for agency action by ensuring that the 20 day        statutory clock runs immediately upon the receipt of the request                   Impose real consequences on federal agencies for missing statutory        deadlines                   Enhance authority of the Office of Special Counsel to take disciplinary        action against government officials who arbitrarily and capriciously deny        disclosure                   Strengthen reporting requirements on FOIA compliance to identify agencies        plagued by excessive delay  and to identify excessive delays in fee status        determinations  PROVIDE        FOIA OFFICIALS WITH THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR GOVERNMENT        REMAINS OPEN AND ACCESSIBLE                   Improve personnel policies for FOIA officials to enhance agency FOIA        performance                   Examine the need for FOIA awareness training for federal employees                   Determine appropriate funding levels needed to ensure agency FOIA        compliance                       Senator        Leahys remarks on the introduction of the bill  delivered on the Senate        floor Wednesday morning  follows      Statement of Senator        Patrick Leahy       Introduction of the       Openness Promotes Effectiveness       In our National Government Act         OPEN Government Act of 2005        February 16  2005   MR  LEAHY  I am pleased to join as a         partner with the Senator from  Texas in introducing the OPEN Government Act         of 2005  I have devoted a considerable portion of my work in the Senate         to improving government oversight  government openness and citizen         right to know laws to make government work better for the American         people  and at times it has been a lonely battle  Finding dedicated         allies on the other side of the aisle has proven difficult  That is why I         am delighted to have a partner in John Cornyn  Senator Cornyn has a         distinguished record of supporting open government dating back to his days         as Attorney General of Texas  In fact  some of the provisions in the bill         we introduce today are modeled after sections of the Texas Public         Information Act   I believe that we both see this effort as the        first of many bipartisan steps we can take together in the new Congress         Senator Cornyn and I began to forge a partnership on improving public        access to government information well over a year ago when  during the 108th        Congress  we worked with several other Senators and with the Library of        Congress to improve the publicly accessible congressional information        website  THOMAS  He and I also cooperated last fall in a successful effort        to ensure that government information  including the application of the        Freedom of Information Act  FOIA   be subject to the jurisdiction of both        the Judiciary Committee and the newly constituted Homeland Security and        Governmental Affairs Committee    The bill we introduce today is a collection        of commonsense modifications designed to update FOIA and improve the timely        processing of FOIA requests by Federal agencies  It was drafted after a        long and thoughtful process of consultation with individuals and        organizations that rely on FOIA to obtain information and share it with the        public  including the news media  librarians  and public interest        organizations representing all facets of the political spectrum   The OPEN Government Act reaffirms the        fundamental premise of FOIA  government information belongs to all        Americans and should be subject to a presumption in favor of disclosure         James Madison said that a popular government  without popular information         or the means of acquiring it  is but a prologue to a farce or tragedy or        perhaps both  His caution rings just as true today  The publics right        to know what its government is doing promotes accountability  imbues trust        and contributes to our system of checks and balances   First enacted in 1966  FOIA represents the        foundation of our modern open government laws  In 1996  I was the        principal author of the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments         which updated FOIA for the internet age  The bill we introduce today is        the next step  a practical set of important modifications that respond to        common complaints and limitations in the current system that we have heard         whether from frequent FOIA requestors  such as representatives of the        press  or individual citizens who may only occasionally rely on FOIA  but        who nonetheless deserve timely and comprehensive responses to their        requests    Chief among the problems with FOIA        implementation is agency delay  Following the successful model of the        Texas Public Information Act  this legislation imposes penalties on        agencies that miss statutory deadlines to release documents and strengthens        reporting requirements on FOIA compliance    The OPEN Government Act responds to some        confusion over the applicability of FOIA to agency records that are held by        outside private contractors  It does this by clarifying that such records        are subject to FOIA wherever they are located    Our legislation establishes an ombudsman to        mediate FOIA disputes between agencies and requestors  a step that many        FOIA requestors believe will help to ameliorate the need for FOIA        litigation in the Federal courts  We hope that this mechanism will work to        the benefit of all parties  However  where mediation fails to resolve        disputes  our bill preserves the rights of requestors to litigate under        FOIA    Our bill responds to recent Federal        jurisprudence by explicitly providing for recovery of attorneys fees under        the so called catalyst theory  That is  where a FOIA lawsuit was the        catalyst for an agency determination to release documents prior to a        courts entry of judgment  the plaintiff may recover attorneys fees          Finally  the bill requires reports on a        controversial law  the Critical Infrastructure Information Act  enacted as        part of the Homeland Security Act of 2002  and it protects fee waiver        status for journalists under FOIA    Letters of support for the OPEN Government        Act have been submitted by the American Association of Law Libraries         American Civil

Information Act is an        invigorating mechanism that helps keep our government more open and        effective and closer to the American people  FOIA has had serious setbacks        in recent years that endanger its effectiveness  This legislation is a        rare chance to advance the publics right to know    I thank my colleague  the Senator from  Texas  for the time and        effort he has devoted to protecting the publics right to know  and I urge        all members of the Senate to join us in supporting this important        legislation
