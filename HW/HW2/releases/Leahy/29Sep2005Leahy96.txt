       Senate Passes Leahy Bond Amendment To Replenish National Guard Equipment   Stocks                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Senate Passes Leahy Bond        Amendment       To Replenish National Guard Equipment Stocks    The        Senate Thursday passed a  1 3 billion amendment to the        Defense Appropriations Bill sponsored by Sens  Patrick Leahy         D Vt   and Kit Bond  R Mo    co chairs of the Senate        National Guard Caucus  The amendment will provide funding        to help fill deficiencies in available equipment for the        National Guard  Leahy and Bond wrote to President Bush on        September 13  asking him to request the funding in an        upcoming supplemental bill for the Gulf hurricanes  Leahy s        statement on the amendment  which he delivered late Thursday        on the Senate Floor  follows  along with news articles and        other background materials     Statement Of Senator Patrick        Leahy       National Guard Homeland Security       And Emergency Response Equipment Amendment       To The Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations Bill       Senate Floor       September 29  2005  Mr  President  I rise today to        introduce an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense        Appropriations bill  This amendment adds  1 3 billion in        emergency funding for National Guard equipment to the        supplemental portion of the Fiscal Year 2005 Defense        Appropriations Bill  This funding will be set aside to        enable the National Guard to buy much needed items for        homeland security and natural disaster response     Hurricane Katrina exposed        glaring deficiencies in the equipment available for the        National Guard to respond to such disasters  We had barely        sufficient levels of trucks  tractors  communications  and        miscellaneous equipment to respond to the overwhelming scale        of this storm  If we have another hurricane  or God forbid         a large scale terrorist attack  our National Guard will        not have the basic level of resources to the job right   National Guard Chief        Lieutenant General Steven Blum recently noted that the Guard        has only about 35 percent of what is officially required to        respond to hurricane  natural disasters  and possible        terrorist attacks at home  Just yesterday  at an appearance        in the House of Representatives  General Blum noted that        Guard members responded to this disaster with insufficient        and outdated communications  General Blum noted that we        will need at least  7 billion to procure the communications         trucks  medical supplies  and machinery necessary to respond        to future disasters   We know without a doubt that        there is an immediate need for at least  1 3 billion  We        need to procure such equipment as the Family of Medium        Tractor Vehicles  new SINCGARS radios  night vision goggles         and other equipment  I ask that a recent report from the        National Guard on these critical needs be included in the        Record    We find ourselves in this        situation for two reasons  First  we have traditionally        under funded the National Guards equipment levels         Secondly  much of the equipment that the Guard does have is        being used in the ongoing war efforts in Iraq  Afghanistan         and across the Middle East and Central Asia  And there is        no prospect that we will see it again back in the States        anytime soon   My friend Sen  Bond and I        co chair the U S  Senate National Guard Caucus  On        September 13  we wrote to President Bush to urge that the        Administration deal with this problem immediately  We asked        that the President include the  1 3 billion in the next        supplemental spending bill to deal with Hurricane Katrina          Yet we cannot wait for the        President to request the funding  We must act now  The        date that this next supplemental spending bill will be        submitted is still uncertain  With this defense bill  we        have an appropriations bill with billions of dollars in        emergency funding  Much of that emergency funding will go        towards insuring that our men and women in uniform abroad        have the right tools to do their job   It seems perfectly reasonable        to me that we add emergency funding to deal with the        equipment needs of our troops at home    I want to commend Senators        Stevens and Inouye for including so much equipment money for        the Guard in the supplemental and baseline bills  While        most of that new equipment will go towards the Guards        overseas warfighting needs  this funding take a big step        forward  I look forward to working with them closely in the        future                                            Background On The Leahy Bond Amendment      To Replenish National Guard Equipment Stocks  Heres the       text of the Leahy Bond letter on the Guards equipment needs             September 13  2005  The Honorable George W  Bush      The President      The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW      Washington        DC 20500  Dear Mr  President   As co chairs of the 85 member U S        Senate National Guard Caucus  we urge the Administration to       provide  1 3 billion for National Guard equipment in the next       applicable supplemental spending bill  Due to longstanding       shortfalls and the high operational tempo in Iraq and       Afghanistan  the National Guard has a perilously low level of       equipment available for natural disasters  a potential       large scale terrorist attack and readiness training     The National Guard is carrying out       the dual role missions for which our forefathers envisioned  In       Iraq  thousands of Air and Army National Guard forces comprise       almost 50 percent of the force engaged in counter insurgency       operations aimed at establishing political stability  In the       Gulf States region National Guard forces from all 50 states and       4 protectorates are working through Emergency Management       Assistance Compacts  EMACs  to supplement forces from       Mississippi and Louisiana  Over 45 000 Guardsmen are deployed       to assist in the search  relief  and recovery effort  Serving       under Title 32 with federal financing and local       command and control  the National Guard are working tirelessly       with local  state  and federal law enforcement  first responder        and relief personnel    The National Guard has deployed       many of its resources to Iraq and Afghanistan  consequently       there are insufficient reserves of equipment available to       respond to future disasters and military contingencies  The       National Guard has approximately 34 percent of its equipment       available for use in the United States with significant       shortages in trucks  engineering equipment  night vision       goggles  information systems  and communications equipment   The National Guard should be given       the flexibility to determine its most pressing requirements        similar to that which exists in the National Guard and Reserve       Equipment Account of the annual DoD appropriations bill        Therefore  we urge the Administration to act quickly to fill       deficiencies in the National Guards equipment account and look       forward to discussing this important matter with you in the near       future   Sincerely   Christopher S        Bond       Patrick J  Leahy      Co Chair       Co Chair      U S        Senate National Guard Caucus       U S  Senate National       Guard Caucus   The New York       Times  September 28  2005         When Storm Hit  National Guard Was Deluged Too   By       Scott Shane and Thom Shanker The       morning Hurricane Katrina thundered ashore  Louisiana National       Guard commanders thought they were prepared to save their state        But when 15 foot floodwaters swept into their headquarters  cut       their communications and disabled their high water trucks  they       had their hands full just saving themselves  For a       crucial 24 hours after landfall on Aug  29  Guard officers said        they were preoccupied with protecting their nerve center from       the waves topping the windows at Jackson Barracks and rescuing       soldiers who could not swim  The next morning  they had to       evacuate their entire headquarters force of 375 guardsmen by       boat and helicopter to the Superdome   It       was an inauspicious start to the National Guard response to the       storm  which ultimately fell so short that it has set off a       national debate about whether the Pentagon should take charge       immediately after catastrophes  President Bush has asked       Congress to study the question  and top Defense Department and       Guard officials are scheduled to testify on the response before       a House panel on Wednesday   Other       elements of the response to Hurricane Katrina are also coming       into question  The New Orleans police chief  Edwin P  Compass       III  resigned Tuesday after the department announced that 250       police officers   roughly 15 percent of the force   could face       discipline for leaving their posts without permission during the       storm and its aftermath   The       former head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  Michael       D  Brown  testified in Congress that he had warned the White       House of impending disaster several days before the storm       struck  In       interviews  Guard commanders and state and local officials in       Louisiana said the Guard performed well under the circumstances        But they say it was crippled in the early days by a severe       shortage of troops that they blame in part on the deployment to       Iraq of 3 200 Louisiana guardsmen  While the Pentagon disputes       that Iraq was a factor  those on the ground say the war has       clearly strained a force intended to be the nation s bulwark       against natural disasters and terrorist attacks        Reinforcements from other states  National Guard units  slowed       by the logistics and red tape involved in summoning troops from       civilian jobs and moving them thousands of miles  did not arrive       in large numbers until the fourth day after the hurricane       passed  The coordinating task was so daunting that Louisiana       officials turned to the Pentagon to help organize the appeal for       help  At       the convention center  222 soldiers trained in levee repair  not       police work  locked themselves into an exhibit hall at the       convention center rather than challenge an angry and desperate       crowd of more than 10 000 hurricane victims at the center  The       near total collapse of communications made every task far more       difficult  forcing some Guard commanders to use runners  like       in World War I  as one put it  With landlines  cellphones and       many satellite phones out of action  the frequencies used by the       radios still functioning were often so jammed that they were       useless        Disaster experts said that even with perfect planning and       management  the 5 700 Louisiana National Guard troops available       were far too few  What       do you expect of 5 700 soldiers when so much of a state is       destroyed  said James Jay Carafano  who studies emergency       response at the Heritage Foundation  If we want the military to       close the 72 hour gap in responding to natural disasters  we ll       have to come up with a new model  Yet       the very effectiveness of the eventual military response   which       climbed to 35 000 guardsmen and active duty troops   only       underscored questions that will long haunt Louisiana guard       officials  Should commanders have moved their headquarters to       higher ground before the storm  Could they have better headed       off the lawlessness or built more resilient communications  And       especially  could they have moved more troops faster to New       Orleans and other devastated areas  I       think to a man  we will live with the pain of this experience        said Col  Douglas Mouton  41  commander of 2 500 Louisiana Guard       engineers  The restoration of order at the convention center        when it came  was phenomenally quick  Colonel Mouton said  I       think the frustration we all have   the country has   is  why       couldn t it have been done a lot quicker  It       was Colonel Mouton who made the decision not to send his       soldiers into the crowd at the convention center  A 41 year old       New Orleans architect whose own house was destroyed by the       flood  Colonel Mouton defended that decision but said the scenes       of anguish that became an international emblem of American       failure were particularly painful for local guardsmen          These are fellow New Orleanians who are suffering  he said        people that I go to Mardi Gras parades with   When       the storm hit  4 000 Louisiana guardsmen were on duty  including       1 250 in New Orleans and surrounding parishes  Guard officials       said  By the next day  all 5 700 Guard members available for       duty were on the job  they said   The       senior commander of National Guard troops at the Pentagon  Lt        Gen  H  Steven Blum  said the Iraq deployment did not slow the       hurricane response  He said that Louisiana Guard troops were in       the water and on the streets throughout the affected areas       rescuing people within four hours of Katrina s passing  and       that out of state troops arrived as soon as they could be       mustered  But       state Guard commanders disagreed  Asked whether the 3 200       soldiers deployed to Iraq could have made a difference  Lt  Col        Pete Schneider  a spokesman for the Louisiana Guard  replied        Well  of course  We would have used them if we d had them        We ve always known in the event of a catastrophic storm in New       Orleans that we d use our resources up pretty fast  There       is little disagreement that Guard equipment sent to Iraq        particularly hundreds of high water trucks  fuel trucks and       satellite phones  could have helped speed the response  The       chairmen of the Senate National Guard caucus  Christopher S        Bond  Republican of Missouri  and Patrick J  Leahy  Democrat of       Vermont  said in a Sept  13 letter to Mr  Bush that the Guard       nationally had only 34 percent of its equipment available for       use in the United States  With       about 150 high water trucks available statewide  Guard       commanders placed most of them outside the danger zone at bases       more than two hours  drive from New Orleans  They risked parking       20 trucks at the low lying Jackson Barracks so they could be       immediately available  Even       though the National Hurricane Center warned that Hurricane       Katrina might be catastrophic  they did not consider setting up       headquarters elsewhere  In 10 years with the Guard  said Col        Tom Beron  who oversees most of the Guard s trucks and drivers        he had never seen more than a few inches of water on the grounds       and none inside the buildings  But by midmorning on Aug  29  as       the flood approached the second floor of an armory where 35       truck mechanics  many of them unable to swim  had found refuge        Colonel Beron decided they needed to get out of that building  The       trucks were useless  There s not a truck in the U S  Army       arsenal that could get through that water  Colonel Beron said  After       ferrying the mechanics to the three story headquarters building       in a borrowed fishing boat  guardsmen grabbed civilian neighbors       as they floated past  It       was best to have a rope tied to you  because the water would       just carry you away  said Col  Glenn Curtis  deputy commander       of the state s response to the hurricane  The       relocation of the Guard command on Aug  30 to the Superdome from       the flooded barracks assured attention to the huge crowd there        But as word arrived Wednesday night of the ballooning numbers at       the convention center  commanders felt they had no soldiers to       spare  By       happenstance  there were guardsmen at the convention center        backhoe operators  truck drivers and mechanics who had chosen a       huge exhibit hall to stage their heavy equipment  Of       the 222 there on Wednesday night  almost none were trained in       police work or riot control  Many did not have weapons  said       Colonel Mouton  the engineers  commander  We didn t expect a       martial law situation  he said  We were building levees        Thirsty  hungry civilians began banging on the doors  But       commanders decided opening them would pose a danger of a       stampede as people tried to get at the Guard s supplies of food       and water  enough for perhaps 1 percent of the crowd  Colonel       Mouton said  We       understand we re soldiers  Colonel Mouton said  But what we       had at the convention center was a partially armed group of       engineers  ready to operate equipment    and with enough food       and water to anger 20 000 people  On       Sept  1   he withdrew the engineers to the Superdome  Aware       that the Guard would be stretched thin  state officials had       contacted other states two days before the storm hit about       sending troops under an agreement called the Emergency       Management Assistance Contract  The day the storm hit  Gov        Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana asked President Bush for       all the help he could provide  After touring New Orleans by       helicopter the next day  the governor asked General Blum  of the       National Guard Bureau at the Pentagon  to speed and coordinate       aid from other states  Some       states got troops there quickly  Sgt  Lawrence Ouellette  a       Rhode Island guardsman who works as a police officer  was in       court in Central Falls  R I   on Aug  31  when he got the call        Just 24 hours later  he and his fellow soldiers had flown to a       base near New Orleans and then helicoptered to the Superdome to       help  At       least one governor  Bill Richardson of New Mexico  has       complained publicly that his early offer of help went       unanswered  Officials said New Mexico offered 200 Guard members       the day the storm hit  and the troops were packed and ready to       move the next day  But no orders were received to move those       troops until two days later  Sept  1  and 400 soldiers finally       flew to the hurricane zone on Sept  2  At       the Pentagon  National Guard officials offered no explanation       for the apparent delay  An officer not involved in the specific       case said the reasons might include lack of aircraft and housing       for the troops or uncertainty about their mission  By       week s end  the first of some 10 000 active duty troops had       arrived to back up the Guard  doing everything from vaccinating       civilians against tetanus to manning water distribution points  In       the weeks since the military presence brought order to the Gulf       Coast  officials in Washington and statehouses have suggested       that the state controlled National Guard is no match for a       disaster on the scale of Hurricane Katrina  Some have suggested       that the military have a domestic force ready for instant       deployment to a disaster zone  while others say the Pentagon       should simply assume responsibility for communications and other       support services  On Tuesday  Defense Secretary Donald H        Rumsfeld said he expected a debate on the military s role  It s       up to the country  the government  to think that through and       decide how they want to be arranged for a catastrophic event        he said   The New York Times      September 28  2005   At Hearings  States and National       Guard Make Appeals for Aid    By SCOTT SHANE  WASHINGTON  Sept  28   The       National Guard has only a third of the equipment it needs to       respond to domestic disasters and terrorist attacks and will       need  7 billion to acquire the radios  trucks  construction       machinery and medical gear required  the Guard s top commander       told a Congressional committee on Wednesday    Lt  Gen  H Steven Blum  chief of       the National Guard Bureau  said that after Hurricane Katrina        guardsmen using old radios were unable to talk to active duty       troops with the latest communications systems as they patrolled       New Orleans    Addressing Representative John P        Murtha  Democrat of Pennsylvania  who served in the Marine Corps       during the Korean and Vietnam Wars  General Blum said  I m       dealing with radios  sir  that you probably saw the last time       you were in battle fatigues    General Blum said  1 3 billion was       needed immediately  The chairmen of the Senate National Guard       Caucus  Senators Christopher S  Bond  Republican of Missouri        and Patrick J  Leahy  Democrat of Vermont  wrote President Bush       this month  urging him to include that amount in a supplemental       spending bill    General Blum said the problem had       become acute as Guard units had deployed to Iraq and       Afghanistan  taking the newest equipment with them and then       leaving it there for replacement soldiers to use  That practice       was wise  he said  but left the home front with an outdated and       dwindling supply of gear  at best about 34 percent of what was       needed    In 2001  the Guard estimated that       it had about 74 percent of the equipment it required at home        General Blum told the defense subcommittee of the House       Appropriations Committee  That figure was deemed acceptable       because the Guard was viewed as a strategic reserve that would       have time to acquire materiel in time of need  he said     But  he said  the terrorist       attacks of Sept  11  2001  and Hurricane Katrina showed the need       for the Guard to be fully equipped and ready to deploy instantly       in a crisis    The general s appeal  coming after       the huge Guard deployment to the Gulf Coast  which peaked at       50 087 soldiers on Sept  10  drew supportive remarks from       subcommittee members    But another issue arising from the       hurricane response  President Bush s call for a discussion of       whether the Pentagon should take the lead in responding to       catastrophes  met with some skepticism  Representative David R        Obey  Democrat of Wisconsin  said the proposal was being put       forward only because the Bush administration had politicized the       Federal Emergency Management Agency and downgraded it by merging       it with the Department of Homeland Security    The president seems to think       we ll use the Guard and Reserve in Iraq and the Army in       Louisiana  Mr  Obey said  calling that approach backward         But Paul McHale  the assistant       secretary of defense for homeland defense  cautioned that the       president s recent comments were meant to frame an analysis        not to provide definitive answers  A lead role for the Pentagon       is being contemplated only in the most extreme disasters  Mr        McHale told the panel    General Blum s appeal was not the       only post Katrina urging on Capitol Hill on Wednesday  At the       Senate Finance Committee  the governors of the states hardest       hit   Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Louisiana  Haley Barbour of       Mississippi and Bob Riley of Alabama   said swift enactment of       stalled legislation to give Medicaid coverage to hurricane       victims would be one of the most important steps Washington       could take to bring relief to the stricken areas     We ve got people who have needs       today  Ms  Blanco said  people who would never have imagined       themselves needing Medicaid    Senators Charles E  Grassley  the       Iowa Republican who is the committee chairman  and Max Baucus of       Montana  the top ranking Democrat on the panel  are sponsoring       legislation that would extend coverage under Medicaid  the       health insurance program for the poor  to thousands of hurricane       victims  Many have been evacuated to states where they are not       eligible for Medicaid  Other people have lost their jobs and        with them  their health insurance    The measure is opposed by the Bush       administration and is being blocked by a few Republican senators       who object to its  9 billion price tag  In a letter to Senate       leaders  Michael O  Leavitt  the secretary of health and human       services  said that states were better equipped to provide for       the health needs of hurricane victims and that money was       available for this purpose    Senators from both parties       promised to fight for the legislation    We can work with everybody        including the administration  or against them  Senator Trent       Lott  Republican of Mississippi  said  And I m prepared to go       either way    At the White House  Joshua B        Bolten  the budget director  told reporters that the       administration did not favor making federal flood insurance       payments to hurricane victims who did not carry the insurance         For the federal government to       step in after the fact  Mr  Bolten said  would be to undermine       the effectiveness of the system            From markup session in the Appropriations Committee  Defense       Subcommittee     Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy      Defense Appropriations Bill Markup      Defense Subcommittee      Senate Appropriations Committee      Monday  September 26  2005  As co chair of the National Guard       Caucus I want to thank the Subcommittee for so strongly       supporting the National Guard in this bill  Senator Bond  the       other caucus co chair  and I recognize the critical investments       made in the Guards warfighting capability   The more than  300 million set       aside for the Air and Army Guard in the Guard and Reserve       Equipment Account  as well as the funds that are spread out       through the supplemental  will greatly help the Guards ability       to fight abroad  We want to help the Subcommittee hold as much       of this funding during Conference  Its regrettable that the       House has not funded this critical account in the bill     We do still need to address the       enormous equipment requirements of the National Guard to respond       to emergencies here at home  Recently Lieutenant General Steven       Blum noted that the Guard has only about 35 percent of what is       officially required to respond to hurricanes and other natural       disasters  or a catastrophic terrorist attack at home     The Guards requirements of       trucks  tractors  communications and night vision equipment have       been under funded for years  Much of the equipment the Guard       does have is now overseas  with no prospect that we will see it       again back here at home anytime soon   Senator Bond and I have requested       on behalf of the entire National Guard Caucus that the President       include  1 3 billion for additional Guard equipment in the next       supplemental spending bills for hurricane relief   The amount we have requested from       the President just meets immediate needs  which are clearly       spelled out in a recent report from the National Guard Bureau          Time is not our ally  The longer       it takes to restock the Guards equipment  the more we are       flirting with disaster    This is an urgent matter that I

BETSY TAYLOR        The National Guard       has taken on a larger role in the fight against terrorism and in       responding to natural disasters since 2001 and needs an       additional  1 3 billion in funding  Sen  Kit Bond said Monday   Bond  a Missouri       Republican  and Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   co chair the Senate       National Guard Caucus  In a letter earlier this month to       President Bush  Bond and Leahy said the Guard has just 34       percent of its equipment available for use in the U S   with       significant shortages in trucks  night vision goggles        information systems  and engineering and communications       equipment   As a result  the       Guard has dangerously little equipment available to respond to       natural disasters  a potential terrorist attack and readiness       training  Bond said during a visit to a National Guard facility       at Jefferson Barracks in south St  Louis County   Bond and Leahy have       asked the president to include the additional funding in the       next supplemental spending bill for hurricane relief   The amount we have       requested from the president just meets immediate needs  which       are clearly spelled out in a recent report from the National       Guard Bureau  Leahy said Monday in Washington during remarks       about defense appropriations in Washington   Time is not our       ally  The longer it takes to restock the Guard s equipment  the       more we are flirting with disaster   Bond  who commanded       the Missouri National Guard when he served two terms as Missouri       governor  said he knows firsthand that the Guard is an       absolutely critical part of our national response  But  he said       more equipment is crucial in order to better use the Guard s       citizen soldiers   The Guard supports       efforts to increase and update its equipment  spokesman Jack       Harrison said   There are about       440 000 people in the Army and Air National Guard  and Harrison       said there is no question the Guard has taken on a more active       role in the past four years   In the month before       the Sept  11  2001  attacks  about 4 000 members of the Army       Guard were mobilized compared to more than 70 000 last month        Figures were not immediately available for the Air Guard        thought they would be much smaller  Harrison said   When Guard units       deploy  they take their best equipment with them and it often       stays in place for the next units  even as Guardsmen return       home  he said   Response to       Hurricane Katrina to help along devastated parts of the Gulf       Coast also made it clear that improved communications systems       are needed  something that the chief of the National Guard       Bureau  Lt  Gen  Steven Blum  has spoken about recently        Harrison said   The National Guard       funding could pass quickly if it is added to the bill  Bond       said   We expect the       emergency supplemental bill to be delivered to us in early       October  We hope to have it passed in a week  Bond said    USA Today      September 20  2005        Guard Relief Hurt by Obsolete Equipment   Top general  Troops need better       radios       By  Dave Moniz       WASHINGTON    Hurricane Katrina exposed serious weaknesses in       the National Guard s communications systems  particularly a       shortage of high tech radios and satellite communications gear        the Guard s top general said Monday        If it s going to protect the USA while also fighting overseas        the Guard needs better equipment  Lt  Gen  Steven Blum  head of       the National Guard Bureau  said in an interview with USA TODAY        We were underequipped  Blum said  We don t need tanks and       attack helicopters and artillery  but we must have       state of the art radios and communications        Much of the Guard s best communications equipment was being used       by troops fighting in Iraq and wasn t available for units       helping Gulf Coast states recover from the hurricane  Blum said        Many Guard military police in New Orleans were using obsolete       radios as they sought to restore order  he said  That  combined       with a crippled civilian communications network  made it harder       for them to communicate  Many also lacked night vision goggles        After Katrina struck the Gulf Coast  about 50 000 Guard troops       were sent to states battered by the storm  the largest such       domestic response in Guard history  said Blum  who oversees Army       and Air National Guard units in all 50 states        The active duty Army  which helps equip the Guard  recognizes       the deficiencies  said Blum  who has met with Pentagon officials       to find more money for new equipment  The leadership of the       Army is committed to addressing the problem  he said        Last week  Sens  Kit Bond  R Mo   and Patrick Leahy  D Vt         wrote President Bush asking for  1 3 billion to buy new       equipment for the Guard        Long standing shortages and the stress of fighting wars in       Afghanistan and Iraq have left the Guard with a perilously low       level of equipment available for natural disasters  the       senators wrote        Only 34  of the Guard s equipment is available for use in the       USA  the letter said  The worst shortages are in trucks        night vision goggles  engineering equipment and communications       gear  the letter said  The Guard has historically used       hand me down equipment from the active duty military  For       example  the Army Guard is using radios from the Vietnam War era       and needs 37 000 newer radios  according to a recent Guard       budget briefing paper posted on its website        Two wars and a recruiting shortfall have taxed the       350 000 member Army National Guard this year  At one point        about 40  of the 140 000 U S  troops in Iraq were from the Guard       or Reserves     Defense Daily      September 16  2005          Lawmakers Say Guard Needs  1 3 Billion In New Equipment For       Future Disasters  By George Cahlink  The National Guard needs  1 3       billion in the next supplemental spending bill for Hurricane       Katrina relief to help buy new equipment that is running in       short supply with tens of thousand guardsmen deployed in the       Middle East and along the Gulf Coast  according to key       lawmakers   Due to longstanding equipment       shortfalls and high operational tempo in Iraq and Afghanistan        the National Guard has a perilously low level of equipment       available for natural disasters  a potential large scale       terrorist attack and readiness training  Sen  Kit Bond  R Mo         and Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    co chairman of the 85 member       Senate National Guard caucus  wrote in a Sept  13 letter to       President Bush   The lawmakers said because so many       of the National Guards resources have been deployed overseas       theres insufficient resources to respond to future disasters        About 34 percent of the Guards resources are available for use       right now with shortages in trucks  engineering equipment  night       vision goggles  information systems and communications       equipments  the lawmakers said   Lawmakers noted about 50 percent       of the troops in Iraq are Air and National Guard members and       another 45 000 guardsmen have been deployed to the Gulf Coast        They urged Bush to give the National Guard full flexibility in       deciding what equipment should be purchased rather than       earmarking it for specific items
