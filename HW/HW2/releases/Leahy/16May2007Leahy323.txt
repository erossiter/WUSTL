       Opening Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Rogue Online   Pharmacies                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Hearing On Rogue Online Pharmacies     The Growing Problem Of Internet Drug Trafficking    May 16  2007    Today  the Committee holds an important     hearing on the growing problem of rogue online pharmacies that illegally     traffic in highly addictive painkillers and other controlled     substances    In many ways  the Internet has made our     lives better and I have been one of its biggest proponents for those     reasons  It removes the historic constraints from geography and     provides access to information and knowledge that might otherwise remain     unavailable to those of us from rural areas  Distance learning  access     to medical knowledge at the finest hospitals and increased commercial     competition are all aspects of the Internet that are important to     recognize and promote  Vermont businesses sell Vermont products     throughout the Nation and around the world through the Internet  At the     same time  the Internet has enabled Vermonters  and others  better     access to convenient and more affordable medicine   But the online sale of pharmaceuticals     presents a more complicated and problematic aspect  Rogue online     pharmacies increasingly have become a source for the illegal supply of     controlled substances  Dangerous and addictive prescription     drugs are too often only a click away without the proper constraints of     local doctors and pharmacists    Controlled drugs  such as pain relievers      tranquilizers  stimulants  and sedatives  can too easily be bought     illegally over the Internet  Anyone  including children  can readily     obtain dangerous controlled substances from online pharmacies  All they     need is access to a computer and a credit card  The check and security     provided by our local pharmacists in local pharmacies    those who have     served Americans for generations and helped us get well and keep us well        is not always replicated online   The 2006 National Survey on Drug Use and     Health indicates that almost 6 million people currently misuse     prescription drugs and  of them  more than two thirds    4 4 million     people    abuse pain relievers such as OxyContin  Some celebrities have     been involved in high profile cases  but people in every state and     increasingly from every age group and demographic are affected  When     abused  these drugs have enormous potential to cause harm  illness      addiction  and  as we will hear this morning from one of our witnesses      tragically even death   American teenagers are particularly     vulnerable to Internet drug trafficking  Among young people      prescription drugs have become the second most abused illegal drug      behind marijuana  In fact  if you exclude marijuana  more adults and     teens report abusing prescription drugs than all other illicit drugs     combined    Too many American teenagers mistakenly     believe that abusing addictive narcotics is a safe way to get high       As we learned just last week  some drug     companies have themselves contributed to that dangerous impression by     giving consumers misleading information about the addictive qualities of     these drugs  Purdue Pharmacies  the maker of the powerful painkiller     OxyContin  and three of its corporate executives  pleaded guilty to     intentionally misleading the public when it promoted OxyContin as less     addictive than traditional narcotics  It is a sad day when     pharmaceutical companies act like tobacco companies and mislead the     public rather than alerting the public to the risks associated with use     of its products    We have legislation referred to this     Committee that would create potent new tools for law enforcement to     prosecute those who illegally sell drugs online  and allow state     authorities to shut down online pharmacies even before they get     started  I look forward to working with the Senators from California     and Alabama on these matters    As the longtime co chair of the     Congressional Internet Caucus  I will ask the Caucus to consider the     issue of the growing danger that online pharmacies pose to youth       Internet drug trafficking has presented     another challenge for law enforcement  If drug dealers came into our     neighborhoods selling these kinds of drugs  Americans would be up in     arms    I thank our distinguished panel of     witnesses for appearing here today and Senator Specter our ranking     member for his work in connection with this hearing
