       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Comprehensive Immigration Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Comprehensive Immigration Reform     April 7  2006  I was encouraged this week that the      Majority Leader and other Senate Republicans moved in our direction       a good direction  by recognizing that we need a solution to the      problems posed by having millions of undocumented immigrants inside      our borders  Many of us believe that immigration reform  to have      any chance to succeed  needs to be comprehensive   with strong      enforcement and border security  matched with fair and effective      steps to bring millions of hardworking people out of the shadows and      provide them a path to citizenship and a full measure of  Americas promise    The bill now being proposed by the      Majority Leader is not as comprehensive or as good as that produced      by the Judiciary Committee in that it leaves many among us out of      the equation and may have the perverse affect of driving millions      further underground  I thought the bipartisan Committee bill      represented a better balance of strong enforcement of our borders      with fair reforms that honored human dignity and our American      values    I continue to work for a bill and a      law that is fair to all  We all agree that it will be tough on      security  but it also has to acknowledge our American values and       above all  human dignity  The House passed bill and the original      Frist bill were overly punitive       Wisely  in our deliberations in the Judiciary Committee      and in the alternative now being proposed  we have rejected the      controversial provisions that would have exposed those who provide      humanitarian relief  medical care  shelter  counseling and other      basic services to the undocumented to possible prosecution under      felony alien smuggling provisions of the criminal law  That was a      cruel amendment and Im glad its gone  And we have rejected the      proposal to criminalize mere presence in an undocumented status in      the United States  which      would trap people in a permanent underclass  Those provisions      understandably sparked nationwide protests  are being viewed as      anti Hispanic and anti immigrant  and are inconsistent with American      values  I am delighted that those efforts have now been abandoned      in the Senate  I was encouraged  as well  by Chairman      Sensenbrenners recent letter on this subject  We need to be      vigilant and not backslide in this regard   I fear that the arbitrary      categorization of people in the current proposal is not fair to      all  I would not want us to set bureaucratic hurdles and arbitrary      timeframes that will serve negatively to continue an underclass in      American and drive people underground  The purpose of the path to      citizenship is to bring people into the sunshine of American life      and into law abiding status so that they abide by all our laws       That will allow our enforcement resources to be focused on real      security concerns  Sadly  those across the aisle have refused to      proceed on the bipartisan Committee bill so this alternative      proposal is an effort to garner additional support from the Majority      Leader and others but it comes at some expense  He opposed the      Specter Leahy Hagel amendment but now supports the Frist amendment       which he graciously called the Hagel Martinez amendment  The      Majority Leader called it a negotiated compromise     I was not a party to those      negotiations  Given the successful Republican opposition and      obstruction of the bipartisan Committee bill  I have now joined in      efforts to improve the Frist amendment and the Hagel Martinez      amendment  I am working with Senator Obama and Senator Durbin to      improve that measure   I do not in any way disparage the      efforts of my friends from  Nebraska and Florida  I appreciate      their efforts  I know that they had indicated their support for the      bipartisan Committee bill  In fact  a majority of Senators      supported the bipartisan Committee bill  Rather  they are trying to      point a way toward the best possible legislation that can achieve      not just a majority but a supermajority of support within the      current Senate    I will support the Majority Leaders      motion for cloture on the motion to commit  That will bring the      Frist amendment before the Senate  I will continue to work for      bipartisan  comprehensive  smart  tough and fair immigration reform   I was surprised to hear the Majority      Leader say last night that he was considering opposing oppose his      own motion  We should have invoked cloture yesterday on the      bipartisan Committee bill  I hope that we do so today on the Frist      motion on the Frist amendment    I appreciate that for those      undocumented immigrants who can prove they have been in the  U S  for more than five years       the path to citizenship that we voted out of Committee would still      govern  To earn status and eventual citizenship  the immigrant must      undergo background checks  work  pay taxes  pay fines  and learn      English  That is not an amnesty program  The Republican Leader has      now reversed his position and supports those provisions  That is      progress  In addition  the bill we will be considering continues to      contain the Ag Jobs bill and the DREAM Act  and the amendments the      Senate voted to add to the bipartisan Committee bill  including the      Bingaman enforcement amendment and the Alexander citizenship      amendment   Those undocumented immigrants who have      been here for two to five years would  under the provisions of the      new bill  have to leave the  U S  and seek approval to return and      to work under a temporary status for four years  They could      eventually seek legal permanent status  probably after a total of 8      to 10 years  and only after those who have seniority to them by      being in the group that has been in the U S  for more than five      years  Thus  this new grouping of people is treated under a      combination of rules drawn from a bill introduced by the senior      Senator from Nebraska and the Kyl Cornyn bill  Perhaps those who      negotiated this scheme will garner the support of Senator Kyl and      Senator Cornyn and others with whom they have been working     At least  this new categorization      preserves a potential pathway to regularized status  The test will      be whether it is made so onerous by its implementation that those in      this designated category will come forward at all  We will all need      to work to make that a reality so that they know that we value them       their families and their hard work   The most recent arrivals  those      immigrants after January      1  2004  are offered no special treatment  I was concerned about      similar aspects of the Committee bill  There are no incentives to      come forward  They are merely told to leave the U S  and apply for      one of the limited visas that will be authorized  They could try to      come back as legal temporary workers     If we do not  I worry that the      Majority Leaders announcement of a breakthrough will have the      unintended effect of having created a false impression and false      hopes  I commend him for changing his position over the course of      the last week  I am delighted that he and others who had been      opposing comprehensive immigration reform with a path to citizenship      are joining us in the effort  But an announcement is not the      enactment of a new law  I urge people  especially the undocumented       to remember that  We are still a long way from enacting fair       comprehensive and humane immigration reform  None has yet passed      the Senate  And certainly fair immigration reform has not passed      the House  The cruelest joke of all would be to raise expectations      and false hopes by premature talk of a solution when none has yet      been achieved  especially if it remains elusive and that promise is      not fulfilled    So while I am glad that some      Republicans have dropped their opposition to establishing a path to      citizenship for many  I worry that many others may be left behind       I also urge everyone concerned about the lives of those who are      undocumented to remain cautious and focused on enacting a law  and      on what it will provide in its final form  It would be wrong to      just pass a bill that ends up serving as a false promise to those      who yearn to be part of the promise of a better life that is  America    Our work on immigration reform is a      defining moment in our history  We are writing laws that will      determine peoples lives and what it is that  America stands for  I continue to      urge the Senate to rise to the occasion and act as the conscience of      the Nation  I will continue to work on immigration reform so that      the laws we enact will be in keeping with the best the Senate can      offer the Nation and the best that America can offer to immigrants       I hope that our work will be something that would make my immigrant      grandparents proud  and a product that will make our children and      grandchildren proud   There will be more rallies around the      country next week by thousands of people in cities across the  United States  They know what      we Senators now know  our immigration system is broken and we need      to fix it  We need to fix it with effective  comprehensive      reforms  The question is still open whether the Senate is committed      to making real immigration reform    I have said from the outset that      Democratic Senators could not pass a good immigration bill on our      own  With fewer than 50      Democratic Senators  we will need the support of Republican Senators      if the Senate is to make progress on this important matter     The Majority Leader had often spoken      of allowing two weeks for Senate debate of this important matter       We now approach the end of that work period  I had hoped we would      be farther along  When the Senate did not complete work on the      lobbying reform bill on schedule  because Republicans refused to      vote on the port security amendment    it cut into time for this      immigration debate  When the Majority Leader decided to begin the      debate with a day of discussion of the Frist bill  we lost more      time  We were left then with one week  not two  We have lost time      that could have been spent debating and adopting amendments when      some Republicans withheld consent from utilizing our usual      procedures over the last days  We have endured the false and      partisan charges of obstruction came from the other side  We have      experienced seemingly endless quorum calls without debate or      action    I thank the Democratic Leader for his      efforts  He has been working for a comprehensive  realistic and      fair immigration bill  We still are  I regret that over the last      several days some tried to make this into a partisan fight  I hope      that we are now able to draw back together in a bipartisan effort to      pass a good bill that becomes a good law
