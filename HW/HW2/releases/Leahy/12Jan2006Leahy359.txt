       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judge Alito s Responsiveness During   His Supreme Court Nomination Hearing                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy        D Vt        Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On Judge Alitos Responsiveness      During His Supreme Court Nomination Hearing      January 12  2006   Supreme Court justices serve for       life  but only after the Senate decides  on behalf of 295       million fellow Americans  that they will be good stewards in       defending our constitutional rights  These hearings are Judge       Alitos accountability moment  and he is falling short of       sufficiently accounting to the American people about the kind of       justice he would be   He has responded to many questions       over the course of these hearings  but he has adequately       answered far too few of them       Failing The Test On       Protecting Fundamental Rights    Judge Alito Thursday failed the       test whether he would serve to protect Americans fundamental       rights and liberties in answer to my questions about       court stripping   Chairman Specter rightly said that       it is absolutely fundamental that the Constitution gives the       Supreme Court jurisdiction to protection Americans rights under       the First Amendment to free speech and freedom or religion and       freedom of the press and under the Equal Protection clauses and       that cannot be stripped away  Chief Justice Rehnquist so       testified with respect to the First Amendment at his       confirmation hearing   Judge Alito viewed this as an       academic debate on which scholars are divided  It is not  It       is a fundamental question of constitutional law and the       fundamental role of the courts  to protect the rights and       liberties of Americans  What is the Supreme Court for  if not       to defend the Constitution and the fundamental free speech  free       assembly and freedom of religion rights of the American people        His refusal to acknowledge that is stunning  and it is greatly       disappointing       Failing The Test On Checking       Government Intrusion   Judge Alito danced around issues       and gave conflicting answers on his expansive view of government       power and the controversial theory of the unitary executive   He went so far Thursday as to use       the patented phrase that Justice Scalia and Justice Thomas used       during their hearings to dodge direct answers  He is now saying       that he has no quarrel with the Supreme Courts holding the       special counsel law constitutional  Well  he criticized it when       he appeared before the Federalist Society in November 2000    in       what now looks like a tryout for this nomination     I have to worry that if confirmed       Judge Alito will revert back to his views of the expansive power       of the government and of government intrusion into the personal       lives of the American people  I have grave concerns that he       will not act as an effective check on abuses of government power       and government trampling of the fundamental liberties and rights       of Americans
