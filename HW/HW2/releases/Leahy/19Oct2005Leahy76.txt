       MILC Program Survives Key Test                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               MILC Program Survives Key Test  Amendment To Kill Program Fails     Agriculture Panel Then OKs MILC Extension      WASHINGTON  Wednesday  Oct  19     The Senate Agriculture Committee      just after Noon Wednesday defeated an amendment to delete the MILC      Program extension  The vote on the amendment by Sen  Mike Crapo       R Idaho  to kill the MILC extension provisions was defeated in a      surprisingly strong vote of 6 to14  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt    a      senior member of the committee and the panels former chairman  had      led efforts to renew the MILC program  which expired Sept  30  The      MILC extension was included in the Agriculture Committees budget      reconciliation package  Leahy also successfully pushed to eliminate      Food Stamp cuts that had been included in the earlier version of the      package  The Agriculture Committee at 12 13 p m  then passed the      reconciliation bill  including the MILC Program extension  in a vote      of 11 to 9  Below is Leahys opening statement from todays markup      session  followed by the announcement yesterday    and Leahy      reaction    to restoration of the Food Stamp cuts    Reaction Of Sen       Patrick Leahy     To Agriculture Committee Passage     Of Legislation To Extend The MILC Program      The outcome of this vote was hard won and greatly encouraging  We      have several more steps to go in restoring this lifeline for      hard working dairy farmers  but this is the most important step                  Opening Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt         Budget Reconciliation Markup MILC Program Extension     Senate Committee On Agriculture  Nutrition  And Forestry     Wednesday  October 19  2005      Mr  Chairman  you had a difficult task    balancing the farm      interests of various regions while protecting a safety net for      low income families on food stamps   I      believe you have done a good job  As I  and others  pointed out      months ago  you successfully worked to reduce the level of      the cuts imposed on this Committee   I      intend to vote for final passage of your mark unless destructive      language is added today        Are these cuts still too high for many of our farmers  Yes         Is the timing bad because of Hurricanes Katrina and Rita and other      disasters  Yes  But is this the Chairmans fault  No  I      know the Chairman would agree  most of us would rather not have any      agriculture cuts this year        However  if this Committee does not meet its target  then our title      would be wide open for objectionable amendments on the Senate floor      including food stamp cuts   I      want to urge a more positive approach to set the stage for the next      farm bill  As we approach the next farm bill  I hope we can become      more bipartisan  instead of less  After the December World Trade      Organization meetings we may be faced with massive cuts  over time       in many of our important support programs  I      hope we can continue to work on policy in this committee  instead of      politics  and focus on helping each other while addressing our own      special situations        Mr  Chairman your mark includes an extension of the MILC program       but it cuts the benefits by around 25 percent  while other      commodity programs are cut around 2 5 percent        While 2 5 percent is ten times less than the MILC cuts  I      would have preferred no commodity cuts for farmers in Kansas  Iowa       Mississippi  Missouri  North Dakota  or any other state       However  I do not intend to offer an amendment to eliminate that 25      percent cut for dairy farmers because I think the Chairman did about      the best he could under the circumstances       Smaller dairy farmers throughout this nation depend on this      program  I know that the huge operators  with thousands of dairy      cows  dont like the MILC safety net because it only provides      counter cyclical support on the first 125 cows worth of production            Everyone knows that that is why Members from states with huge dairy      operations often oppose MILC   I      have tried to be very supportive of programs which do not directly      benefit Vermont  and intend to vote to help farmers in other      regions    just as I hope that others will join me in supporting      dairy farmers in Vermont  and throughout the nation  Just like      corn  wheat  soybean  sugar  cotton and you name it farmers  dairy      farmers work hard for a living and should not be left out       Mr  Chairman  I want discuss food stamps for a moment  Thank you      very much for not including any cuts in the food stamp program            That program provides a vital safety net to low income families just      as commodity programs provide a vital safety net to hardworking      farmers and ranchers   I      am disappointed in the significant conservation cuts  but      appreciate that these were reductions  not terminations  I      also realize that under our potential WTO obligations this Committee      may work together in the future to fashion even stronger and more      widely available conservation programs        In conclusion  I want to note that whichever party is in control      during reconciliation has to make cuts that they otherwise would not      want to make  we all know that        However  I believe the Chairman has done a good job in creating a      balanced bill                     News Update On Wednesdays MILC Program Showdown            Food Stamp cuts eliminated      from draft Senate bill         Leahy and others build support for      MILC program extension  TUESDAY  Oct       18     The question of extending the MILC program continues to      dominate negotiations and press coverage in advance of Wednesdays      Senate Agriculture Committee showdown vote on the panels part of      the budget reconciliation package  After two more weeks of      negotiations  Chairman Chambliss Tuesday morning announced that he      has DROPPED the controversial Food Stamp cuts   574 million       over five years  from the chairmans mark  Senator Leahy and others      had urged elimination of the Food Stamp cuts  In its      counterpart reconciliation process  the House is considering cuts as      large as  5 billion  over five years  in the Food Stamp program       though the extent of the cuts are not likely to be known until later      this week  The House also does not include an extension of the MILC      program  Leahy  a senior      member and former chairman of the Agriculture Committee  has been      working with others on the panel in fighting for the MILC programs      extension  The MILC program extension  from now until 2007 when      the next Farm Bill is to be completed  has been scored at  998      million over that time period  As usual  its      the Perils of Pauline again when it comes to fairness for      hard working dairy farmers  said Leahy  Renewing the MILC program      will not be easy  but we have done all we can to strengthen our hand      for this showdown vote  and beyond  Restoration of      the Food Stamp cuts was accomplished by shifting advance payments in      commodity programs  When the      Agriculture Committee meets on Wednesday to vote on the package  10      a m   Room 328 A of the Russell Senate Office Building   Sen       Mike Crapo  R Idaho  now is expected to offer an amendment to strike      the MILC program extension  Misguided      fiscal and policy choices have led us to this point  but we should      do all we can to avoid compounding those bad decisions by taking      food away from those who are struggling the most in our society       said Leahy  I commend Chairman Chambliss for making the extra      effort to remedy the Food Stamp cuts in this bill  Leahy has long      championed the hunger and nutrition programs under the Agriculture      Committees jurisdiction
