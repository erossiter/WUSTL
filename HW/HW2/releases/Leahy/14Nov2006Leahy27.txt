       Floor Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Amendment 5123 To The FY 2007   Miiltary Construction Appropriations Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Floor Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  On Amendment 5123      To The FY 2007 Military Construction Appropriations Bill     November 14  2006  Mr  President  I am a pleased to be a      cosponsor of Amendment 5123 offered by Senators Collins and      Feingold  This bipartisan amendment would extend the life of the      Office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR       and restore the bipartisan agreement made regarding the termination      of the SIGIR in the Senate passed FY 2007 Defense Authorization      bill    The Collins Feingold amendment is      necessary to undo the damage of a veiled provision inserted in the      FY 2007 Defense Authorization conference report by the Chairman of      the House Armed Services Committee that terminates the SIGIR by an      artificial date that has no basis in the progress of reconstruction      projects   This amendment will sustain the      valuable work of the Special IG to monitor  audit  and inspect funds      made available for assistance for Iraq in both the Iraq Relief and      Reconstruction Fund and in other important accounts  which totals      nearly  32 billion    The amendment will restore the formula      for calculating the SIGIRs termination to 10 months after 80      percent of the funds appropriated for Iraq reconstruction have been      expended While I strongly support this amendment  I believe the      SIGIRs authority should extend as long as necessary to ensure that      the billions of dollars appropriated for Iraqs reconstruction be      granted adequate oversight    It is important that the Special IG      auditors continue their work as long as taxpayer funds are being      spent on reconstruction efforts  Thus aspects of this amendment      including the 80 percent expended trigger and the exclusion of      future Iraq reconstruction appropriations  will need to be      revisited in the coming months  I intend to work with other      Senators to ensure that all future Iraq reconstruction funds are      subject to the continued oversight of the SIGIR   Wasteful spending and profiteering are      especially offensive in wartime  and our soldiers and the American      people deserve more oversight of how their tax dollars are being      spent in Iraq  not less oversight   The Special Inspector Generals work      to date has been enormously valuable to the Executive Branch  to      Congress  and to American taxpayers  The SIGIR has completed more      than 55 audit reports  issued more than 165 recommendations  and      seized more than  13 million in assets  What the SIGIR has      uncovered proves the need for the work of this office to continue   The SIGIRs investigations have sent      American reconstruction officials to jail on bribery and conspiracy      charges  exposed numerous instances of colossal mismanagement in      construction projects  and uncovered case after case of waste  fraud      and abuse at the taxpayers expense  In fewer than three years  the      Special IGs operations have resulted in savings to the U S       government and the taxpayers of more than  24 million and uncovered      considerable wasteful or fraudulent spending    The Collins Feingold amendment will      abolish the artificial and arbitrary termination date inserted by      one member of the other body and extend the SIGIRs charter with the      recognition that the office has performed crucial work  with much      more remaining to be done    I appreciate the work of Senators      Collins and Feingold in offering this commonsense amendment and urge      its adoption by the Senate
