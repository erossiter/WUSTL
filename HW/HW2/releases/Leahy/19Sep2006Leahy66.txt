       Address Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The Crisis In Darfur                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Address Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      The Crisis In Darfur      Senate Floor      Tuesday  September 19  2006    Mr  LEAHY  It is disheartening to be back on the floor of the      Senate to once again talk about a looming humanitarian catastrophe      in the Darfur region of Sudan  Despite the partial peace agreement      signed in May between the Sudanese Government and one rebel faction       the three year civil war in Darfur has intensified in recent months      and the situation is rapidly deteriorating    Today  Darfur faces a more complex and brutal environment where      rebel groups have splintered and one has joined forces with the      Sudanese Army  strengthening the Janjaweed militias that have long      used rape  murder and mayhem to gain control of the region    On August 28  Sudanese Government forces launched a major      offensive in Darfur to finish off any opposing rebels  in direct      violation of the Darfur Peace Agreement and cease fire accord  As a      result  tens of thousands more civilians have been forcibly      displaced  bringing the total to more than 2 million people    Relief organizations that have not already left the region face      near impossible hurdles to reach hundreds of thousands of desperate      people in need of food  water  and medical attention who are also      vulnerable to the intensifying and indiscriminant aerial bombings        The well intentioned 7 000 member African Union peacekeeping      force is understaffed  under equipped  and has been unable to stop      the violence in Darfur  Estimates of the number of people who have      died from war and disease in Darfur range as high as 450 000    The United Nations Security Council adopted Resolution 1706 that      would replace the African Union force with a much larger UN force      empowered to protect civilians  but the Sudanese Government not only      rejected the resolution but demanded that the African Union withdraw      from the country after its mandate expires at the end of this month        While the United Nations  the African Union and most of the      international community are united in support of a larger UN      peacekeeping force  the government in Khartoum has repeatedly      refused  presumably fearing that the UN could pose a challenge to      its own ability to act with impunity    It is ludicrous that a lone despot  Sudans President Omar Hassan      al Bashir  can obstruct the deployment of a UN peacekeeping force to      stop genocide from continuing in his country  He has even gone so      far as to threaten to attack any UN force that enters Sudan    Despite the Bush Administrations diplomatic efforts in pressing      for urgent international intervention to ease the Darfur crisis       China and Russia managed to thwart passage of a stronger UN Security      Council resolution   And on August 20  the Arab League committee on Sudan backed the      Sudanese presidents refusal of a UN peacekeeping force and further      distanced itself from any responsibility for the situation in      Darfur    The diplomatic inertia on Darfur is illustrative of just how much      Americas credibility and influence has eroded in the eyes of the      world  largely due to our misguided policy in Iraq    Having squandered the trust and confidence of our allies       particularly those in the Arab world  the Bush Administrations      leverage with which to solve other regional and global crises is      weakened  Darfur is one example  The impasse over Irans nuclear      program is another    It is tragic how much damage this Administrations policies have      caused to Americas leadership on so many issues that require the      cooperation and support of other nations  The price in Darfur is an      emboldened Sudanese regime that has managed to defy U S  diplomatic      pressure  and the deaths of thousands of innocent people    Urgent and immediate action is essential to save Darfur from      further catastrophe    First  the President will today finally appoint a Presidential      Special Envoy to Sudan  I and others had called for the designation      of a special envoy for Sudan for months  so this long overdue      decision is welcome    Second  although the African Union troops are too few and lightly      equipped to stop the violence  they are serving as witnesses for the      rest of the world at a time when the government in Khartoum commits      atrocities and makes it more difficult for humanitarian      organizations and journalists to operate    The United States and other nations must continue to support the      African Union until a UN peacekeeping force is deployed  which would      take at least four to six months    There should be no doubt that our first priority is to get UN      peacekeepers on the ground as soon as possible  but in the interim       if African Union troops are forced to leave at the end of September       the last line of protection will be lost and an even worse period of      lawlessness and slaughter will begin    Third  the Administration should call upon the European Union and      the UN Security Council to impose financial  travel  and diplomatic      sanctions against the Sudanese leadership  rebel forces  and others      who are responsible for the atrocities in Darfur    Fourth  the United States must increase diplomatic pressure on      countries friendly to Khartoum  particularly Russia  China  and      members of the Arab League  to use their influence to convince      Sudan to support a UN peacekeeping force  This  unfortunately  is      not made easier by our weakened influence with these nations    Fifth  the Administration must urge all United Nation member      states to accelerate implementation of Security Council Resolution      1706 and the deployment of UN peacekeepers to Darfur  The White      House should be working more vigorously to persuade countries to      commit troops and funds for the UN force    Finally  in circumstances like this the United Nations should be      empowered to deploy troops to prevent the mass murder of civilians       irrespective of the stubborn  self serving opposition of the      government of the country    When a countrys corrupt  abusive leader  lacking any legitimate      mandate from the people  flagrantly violates UN resolutions and a      cease fire agreement and embarks on a scorched earth campaign which      threatens the lives of countless innocent people the UN should be      able to go in    Mr  President  if Darfur were in Europe  we would have responded      differently  Although belated  our response  as the leader of NATO       to the ethnic cleansing in the former Yugoslavia put a quick end to      the atrocities there    Darfur is on a different continent  but the forcefulness of the      response to genocide should not depend on where genocide occurs or      the race  ethnicity or nationality of the victims    I have no illusions about the difficulties of ending this      conflict  nor do I question the sincerity of those who have tried to      do so  But the efforts that have been made so far have been woefully      inadequate    The situation in Darfur calls for far more intensive  sustained       and high level attention than the Bush Administration and other      countries have provided thus far
