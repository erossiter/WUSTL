bill into law  The sweeping      anti crime package renews and strengthens key programs to help      federal  state and local law enforcement agencies fight crime and to      combat violence against women  The bill also reauthorizes      appropriations for the Department of Justice  DOJ  for fiscal years      2006 through 2009  It also establishes key reporting requirements      and other mechanisms intended to better enable the Congress to      oversee DOJ operations  Leahy  a longstanding champion of the needs      of rural America  also strengthened programs focused on rural needs       including his earlier program targeting rural domestic violence and      crimes that victimize children  He also succeeded in expanding his      earlier grant program that aids victims of domestic violence  who      account for more than half of todays homeless population  These are      vital programs that help protect millions of Americans and their      communities  said Leahy  a former prosecutor  Its especially      important that we are giving more tools to our local and state law      enforcement officers who are on the front lines against crime and      drug abuse  Leahy is the      ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  which      has jurisdiction over the Department of Justice and its anti crime      programs  Working with Judiciary Chairman Arlen

provisions of the package       including   VIOLENCE      AGAINST WOMEN ACT       The Rural Domestic Violence       and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program        Reauthorizes and expands program that makes services available       to rural victims and children by encouraging community       involvement in developing a coordinated response to combat       domestic violence  This provision includes new language that       expands the program coverage to sexual assault  child sexual       assault and stalking  It also expands eligibility from rural       states to rural communities  increasing access to rural sections       of otherwise highly populated states  Since the last       reauthorization in 2000  Vermont organizations have received       more than  5 million in grants through this program to aid rural       areas in treating domestic violence as a serious violation of       criminal law     Transitional Housing       Assistance Grants        This program authorizes grants for transitional housing and       related services for people fleeing domestic violence  sexual       assault or stalkers  At a time when the availability of       affordable housing has sunk to record lows  transitional housing       for victims is needed now more than ever  Today more than 50       percent of homeless individuals are women and children fleeing       domestic violence  Earlier this year  Leahy announced more than        618 000 in grants to four Vermont organizations to provide       transitional housing and related services for individuals who       were homeless as a result of domestic violence  sexual assault       or stalking  This marked the first time that grants under this       program have ever been awarded   DOJ AUTHORIZATION    Byrne       Formula Grant Program        Creates a reserve fund this grant program that will give the       Attorney General discretion to increase Byrne funding to states        like Vermont  that have been hit hard by prior changes in the       Byrne formula and cuts to its overall funding  States with       increasing rates of crime may also receive extra funds       Drug Courts Program        Provides targeted technical assistance and training by the newly       created Community Capacity Development Office  This Office will       consider and respond to the unique needs of rural states  such       as Vermont  that wish to implement and enhance drug court       systems        Campbell Leahy Bulletproof       Vest Partnership Program        Extends through 2009 this program which helps
