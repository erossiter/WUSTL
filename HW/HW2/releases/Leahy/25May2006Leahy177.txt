       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S J  Res  12 To Prohibit The Physical   Desecration Of The Flag                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      On S J  Res  12  To Prohibit The Physical Desecration Of The Flag May 25  2006 Today for the      second week in a row the Senate Judiciary Committees agenda      included a proposed amendment to the Constitution  to its      fundamental purpose and to our rights as Americans  I understand      that Republicans are trying to keep to a political timetable for      raising divisive matters in the run up to the November elections       I know that in      election years they love to wave the flag amendment  rather than      work on veterans health care or protecting veterans privacy  We      have just witnessed the largest theft of private information from      the Government ever  the loss of information on more than 26 million      American veterans  Compounding the incompetence was the misguided      decision by the Veterans Administrations for secrecy in trying to      cover this up for last three weeks  This follows on the heels of      last years debacle of a billion dollar shortfall in VAs budget for      veterans health care  after repeated denials  It all adds up to a      heckuva bad job for Americas veterans  The President      should call Secretary Nicholson into the woodshed for a serious      shakeup in how the VA is run In the meantime  Secretary Nicholson      needs to answer why this information was left vulnerable to such a      breach  why such a delay in notification was allowed to occur  and      what specific steps he is taking to ensure such a breach does not      happen again  The nations veterans who have been willing to make      the ultimate sacrifice for their country  deserve to have the best      tools available to protect themselves and their families from      identity theft   Rather than work      on our privacy and identity theft legislation  including the      Specter Leahy Personal Data Privacy and Security Act of 2005  or the      Kerry Salazar legislation to provide credit checks and monitoring to      veterans those whose private information was compromised  we are      being directed to another divisive debate on a proposed      constitutional amendment   In that regard I      noticed that earlier this week  the White House Press Secretary was      asked about this constitutional amendment  and had no knowledge of      it existing  I would like to include that exchange into the record       Question   C ould you tell us if      the President also supports the proposed amendment to protect the      United States flag from public desecration   MR  SNOW  Do we have a flag      desecration    I apologize  this is something that  believe it or      not  in the last two weeks has not come up  So I m afraid      Question  Flag burning    MR  SNOW     flag burning  I ll      just have to get back  to you    The White House      Press Secretary has yet to become familiar with the talking points      on how much more important this is than national security  the war      in Iraq  unprecedented gas prices  the lack of a federal budget  the      penalties on seniors who may now wish to sign up for Medicare drug      prescription  comprehensive immigration reform  emergency      supplemental appropriations  preparations for the hurricane season       preparations for a possible avian flu pandemic  privacy legislation      and completing our work on reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act
