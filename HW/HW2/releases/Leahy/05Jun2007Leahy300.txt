       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Examining The Federal Role To Work   With Communities To Prevent And Respond To Gang Violence                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    Chairman  Judiciary Committee    Examining The Federal Role To Work With Communities   To Prevent And Respond To Gang Violence    The Gang Abatement And Prevention Act Of 2007   June 5  2007  The importance of today s Committee hearing is underscored    by the recent news that violent crime in America is again on the rise  This    troubling news is the result of the Bush Administration s failure to heed    the lessons learned from our successful fight against violent crime in the    1990s  Congress and the Clinton Administration in the 1990s provided    significant new funding to strengthen state and local law enforcement  as    well as supporting programs to prevent gang and youth violence  and our    joint efforts worked      Studies have repeatedly shown that  largely due to these initiatives     violent crime and gang offenses steadily dropped to historic lows  But the    Bush Administration chose a different course  and  despite warnings from me    and others  has repeatedly cut funding for state and local cops on the beat    and community programs targeting the prevention of youth crime  I hope that    with todays hearing and new legislative proposals  we can begin to reverse    the mistakes of this Administration and place this country back on the right    track to reducing violent crime      I know the witnesses today agree with me about the importance of our state    and local law enforcement  who work every day to keep our streets safer  and    about the need for more efforts to prevent juvenile and gang crime  I share    the views of Los Angeles Police Chief William J  Bratton  who is one of our    witnesses today  that we can t arrest our way out of our gang crime    problem  As those who have worked on this issue for years know all too    well  we must match our commitment to law enforcement with an equal    commitment to intervention and prevention as a means of curbing gang    violence  Neither strategy works without the other  and I believe  as so    many law enforcement and civil leaders do  that any legislative proposals to    address gang violence must focus on new means to prevent youth and gang    violence      The gang problems of today are not the same crime problems that we have    faced historically  The gangs today are less centralized and younger than    ever before  and the violence from these groups is less affected by    traditional law enforcement techniques  Local police forces and community    groups from across the country have responded in new ways to this problem     and their efforts and successes in creating programs to provide alternatives    and options for youth who are at risk for gang violence must be encouraged    and applauded      I want to thank Senator Feinstein for her continued hard work on this    important issue  and for her commitment to restoring the resources necessary    for state and local law enforcement  along with community and civic groups     to combat gang violence      The Gang Abatement and Prevention Act of 2007 is an improvement over earlier    gang legislation  It does not contain the death penalties  mandatory    minimums  and expansive juvenile transfer provisions that were among my    strongest objections to some of the past proposals  I am hopeful that  with    additional changes  it could provide some of the resources necessary to    reverse the policies of this Administration which have neglected the    officers who combat gang violence on a daily basis and the organizations    that work to keep children out of gangs  I particularly support provisions    in the bill to provide up to  1 billion over 10 years to support    collaborative law enforcement and community prevention efforts  with at    least half of that amount going to civic groups for innovative prevention    programs that truly work to reduce gang violence      I am concerned  though  that certain provisions in the current version of    the bill may work against these valuable efforts by creating mandatory    sentencing schemes and federalizing many petty crimes that do not attack the    core problem and only direct our federal law enforcement efforts away from    the most serious offenders  I do not believe that sweeping new federal    crimes  which federalize the kind of street crime that states have    traditionally addressed and can address well with the adequate resources     are the right way to go  I thank Senator Feinstein for working with me    toward addressing many of these concerns  and I hope that she and the other    sponsors of this bill will continue to work with me to find common ground    and come up with legislation that all can support without reservation      We all care deeply about eradicating gang violence  and we must work    together to create a comprehensive solution to this troubling  persistent    problem  I am dismayed that the Bush Administration has turned away from the    tried and proven methods used to reduce gang crime and other violent crime    so effectively  I will work tirelessly to reverse their mistakes and    reinvigorate our efforts to provide federal support for those who combat    gang violence every day and to protect those who are its victims
