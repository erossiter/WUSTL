       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Consideration Of The District Of   Columbia House Voting Rights Act Of 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Chairman  Senate Committee On The Judiciary     On Consideration Of     S  1257  The District Of Columbia House Voting Rights Act Of 2007    September 17  2007    This month the Judiciary Committee marked the 50th     anniversary of the Civil Rights Act of 1957 with a hearing  Congressman     John Lewis  a courageous leader during those transformational struggles     only decades ago  gave moving testimony reminding us that we in     Congress must do all we can to inspire a new generation to fulfill the     mission of equal justice  While we are observing this golden     anniversary  it is fitting that the Senate turn to this important voting     rights measure  the District of Columbia House Voting Rights Act   I am a cosponsor of this bipartisan legislation to     end the unfair treatment of District of Columbia residents and give them     full representation in the House of Representatives  I thank the     Majority Leader  Senator Reid  for bringing this timely issue to the     Senate for consideration   In April  the House of Representatives worked in a     bipartisan manner to pass their version of a voting rights bill for the     District of Columbia  led by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton     As a young lawyer  she     worked for civil rights and voting rights around the country  It is a     cruel irony that upon her return to the District of Columbia and     election to the House of Representatives she does not yet have the right     to vote on behalf of the people of the District of Columbia who elected     her  She is a strong voice in Congress but the people of the District     of Columbia deserve a vote  as well   This is not the time for further delay  It is the     Senates turn to do what is right  The Senate bill would    give the District of     Columbia delegate a full vote in the House  To attract Republican     support  the bill offsets that vote for D C  by according Utah an     additional representative in the House  as well  This is an effort to     provide political balance  With it or without it  I support     representation for the District of Columbia   I     believe that the legislation that we are considering today is within     Congresss powers as provided in the Constitution  I agree with     Congressman Lewis  Congresswoman Norton and numerous other civil rights     leaders and constitutional scholars that we should extend the basic     right of voting representation to the hundreds of thousands of Americans     residing in our Nations Capital  They pay federal taxes  defend our     country in the military and serve on federal juries  They are citizens     no less than the citizens of any State  Their votes should count  They     should be represented   In May the Senate Judiciary Committee held a     hearing on this legislation  We heard compelling testimony  Retired     Chief Judge Patricia Wald testified that this legislation is constitutional     and highlighted the fact that Congresss greater power in accordance     with the Constitution to confer full statehood on the District certainly     contains the lesser power to grant District residents voting rights in     the House of Representatives  She also reminded us that Congress has     exercised this authority in the past without a rigid adherence to the     constitutional text when it granted voting rights to Americans abroad      in their last State of residence  regardless of whether they are     citizens of that State  pay taxes to that State  or have any intent to     return to that State  Her former colleague on the D C  Circuit      Ken Starr  echoed her conclusion that this legislation is     constitutional      Congress has repeatedly treated the District of Columbia as a State     for various purposes  Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton testified     that although the District is not a State  the Congress has not had     the slightest difficulty in treating the District as a State  with its     laws  its treaties  and for constitutional purposes  Examples of these     actions include a revision of the Judiciary Act of 1789 that broadened     Article III diversity jurisdiction to include citizens of the District     even though the Constitution only provides that federal courts may hear     cases between citizens of different States  Congress has also treated     the District as a State for purposes of congressional power to     regulate commerce among the several States  The Sixteenth Amendment     grants Congress the power to directly tax incomes without apportionment     among the several States  That constitutional provision has been     interpreted also to apply to residents of the District  In fact  the     District of Columbia pays the second highest federal taxes per capita      yet has no vote in connection with how those dollars are spent  The     local license plates say a good deal and remind us of our heritage when     they say Taxation without Representation  In     2005  President Bush praised the Iraqi people for exercising their     democratic right to vote  and he noted that by participating in free     elections  the Iraqi people have firmly rejected the anti democratic     ideology of the terrorists a nd they have demonstrated the kind of     courage that is always the foundation of self government      Unfortunately  the President does not speak so enthusiastically about     voting rights for the American citizens living literally in his     backyard  It is disappointing that the Bush Administration has     threatened to veto this legislation   I     understand that opponents of this voting right bill are considering a     filibuster to prevent its passage  In a recent column in the     Washington Times  former Maryland Lieutenant Governor Michael Steele     and former Congressman J C  Watts  two Republicans  voiced their strong     support of this legislation and reminded Senators that the last time a     voting rights bill was filibustered was 50 years ago  Despite Senator     Thurmonds record setting effort  the Senate rightfully passed the Civil     Rights Act in 1957 and followed up with the Civil Rights and Voting     Rights Acts in 1964 and 1965  I hope the Senate does not return to the     days when it filibustered voting rights for its African American     citizens   In an editorial  The Washington Post on Monday observed  This     cloture motion is technical  but how the senators vote is entirely about     principle  It is simply not right that U S  citizens who live in the     Nation s Capital are denied basic representation in their government      That a procedural gambit would be used to prevent a redressing of this     wrong is inexcusable  This     is a historic vote that holds great significance within the civil rights     community and for the residents of the District of Columbia  I urge     Senators to do what is right and to support cloture on this measure   Last year  Congress showed bipartisanship to     reauthorize the Voting Rights Act  We fought     for the fundamental civil rights of all Americans and united as a     Congress behind its noble purpose  Let us not backslide today     No ones right to vote should be abridged      suppressed or denied in the United States of America  Let us move     forward together and provide full voting rights for the citizens in our     Nations Capital
