       Remarks Of Sen  Leahy On Feingold Reid Leahy Amendment On Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Remarks Of Sen       Patrick Leahy  D Vt    On      Feingold Reid Leahy Amendment on Iraq  December 18  2007    Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  I support      the Feingold Reid Leahy Amendment because it specifically requires      the President to begin the redeployment of American forces in Iraq      within 90 days  Within nine months of enactment  the redeployment      would be completed and funding terminated for Iraq operations with      narrow exceptions for a limited number of counterterrorism  force      protection  and troop training missions     The Presidents so called surge is      just another word for escalation  It has failed to set the lasting      conditions for peace  Violence  though down  still continues at      horrifying rates  The various Iraqi factions have made little      progress towards political reconciliation  The deadly rifts in that      war torn country have only grown deeper  The Iraqi government has      done little to support the few encouraging trends like the      willingness of some Sunni groups to turn against the insurgency     The only thing that is going to      force the Iraqis to come to terms  the only way to get Iraqs      neighbors involved in bringing about peace there  is to make clear      that our country is not going to be there forever  We cannot afford      to spend more of our precious resources and to spill more of the      precious blood of our troops if the Iraqis will not take      responsibility for their own future     There is a way to begin to right the      wrongs of the Presidents failed policy on Iraq  That better path      involves effective diplomacy and a strong signal about our finite      military presence in Iraq  not this senseless waste of money and      lives  The Feingold Reid Leahy Amendment offers the real promise of      a long term positive outcome for our security and the people of      Iraq  I urge the amendments adoption
