    It is with great pleasure that we      welcome to the Committee today the Honorable Anthony Kennedy       Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court  to discuss      issues of judicial security and independence    In todays society  our independent      Judiciary faces many and varied types of threats  We have witnessed      judges physical security being threatened and their institutional      security and independence under rhetorical attack by some affiliated      with the political branches  There are also more subtle threats       As the Chief Justice recently re emphasized  there is pervasive      uncertainty about the Judiciarys financial security and ability to      function as an efficient and effective arbiter of justice because of      stagnant salaries year after year  It is my hope that working      together we can make real progress on these important issues  We      need to do our part to ensure that the dedicated women and men of      our judiciary have the resources  security  and independence      necessary to fulfill their crucial responsibilities  Our      independent Judiciary is the envy of the world  and we must take      care to protect it    In this Congress  we have  again       taken up the matter of court security by reintroducing legislation      that  I believe  should have been enacted last year  The Court      Security Improvement Act of 2007  S 378  is a bipartisan measure I      introduced along with Senator Specter  the Majority Leader  Senator      Durbin and other Members of this Committee  House Judiciary      Chairman Conyers introduced an identical measure in the House with      bipartisan support  Our bicameral  bipartisan introduction should      have sent the signal that we intend finally to complete action on      our work and increase legal protections for the Judiciary and their      families  I have included the bill on the Committees markup agenda      tomorrow    Our efforts gained increased urgency      after the tragedy that befell Judge Joan Lefkow of Chicago  She is      the federal judge whose mother and husband were murdered in their      home two years ago  Her courageous testimony in our hearing on      judicial security in May 2005 is something none of us will forget       The shooting last summer of a State judge in Nevada provided another      terrible reminder of the vulnerable position of our Nations state      and federal judges  We cannot tolerate or excuse violence against      judges  and no one should seek to minimize its corrosive damage to      our system  Congress should rise to the occasion without further      delay or distraction and enact the Court Security Improvement Act   These protections are crucial to the      preservation of the independence of our federal Judiciary so that it      can continue to serve as a bulwark protecting individual rights and      liberty  Our Nations founders knew that without an independent      Judiciary to protect individual rights from the political branches      of government  those rights and privileges would not be preserved       The courts are the ultimate check and balance in our system of      government in times of heated political rhetoric   In recent years  Justice Sandra Day      OConnor has spoken out against the attacks on the Judiciary and the      need to reinforce its security and independence  She continues to      lend her voice to this important topic even after stepping down from      the bench    It is most unfortunate that some in      this country have chosen to use dangerous and irresponsible rhetoric      when talking about judges  We have seen federal judges compared to      the Ku Klux Klan  called the focus of evil and in one      unbelievable instance referred to as a more serious than a few      bearded terrorists who fly into buildings  A prominent television      evangelist even proclaimed the federal judiciary the worst threat      America has faced in 400 years  worse than Nazi Germany  Japan and      the Civil War  Perhaps most regrettably  we have seen some in      Congress threaten the mass impeachments of judges with whom they      disagree and even suggest that violence against judges has been      brought on by their own rulings   This high pitched rhetoric should      stop  for the sake of our judges and the independence of the      Judiciary  Judicial fairness and independence are essential if we      are to maintain our freedoms  Our independent Judiciary is a model      for the rest of the world and a great source of our national      strength and resilience  During the last few years it has been the      courts that have acted to protect our liberties and our      Constitution  We ought to be protecting them  physically and      institutionally    We owe them our gratitude and  in my      view  we owe them more  We can demonstrate our respect and      appreciation for our Judiciary by making appropriate adjustments to      their pay  One of the first bills that we passed in this Senate      this year was a bill to authorize cost of living adjustments for the      salaries of United States judges  The Ranking Member  Senators      Feinstein and Cornyn joined me in cosponsoring this bill  This is a      step I supported taking  and that we should have taken    in the      last Congress  I am glad that we were able to resolve the previous      problems and move forward in a unanimous and bipartisan way this      year  I hope that the House of Representatives will join us in      making this cost of living adjustment a reality      Of course  that legislation is but a      modest step toward addressing the issues raised by Chief Justice      Roberts in his recent Year End Report on the Federal Judiciary  I      have commended the Chief Justice for speaking out on behalf of the      Judiciary and for seeking to strengthen the independence of the      judicial branch  I commend Justice Kennedy for doing so today in      the interests of preserving the judicial independence that is so      critical for preserving our system of government     I intend to do what I can to convince      Congress to fairly evaluate this issue  Justice Kennedys testimony      today  like the Chief Justices year end report  provides important      considerations  I urge Congress and the President to consider a      broader judicial compensation measure this year
