Sen       Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Nomination of Judge Kent Jordan To The Third Circuit     December 8  2006          Excerpt of Senator Leahys Remarks on the Senate Floor Earlier         MONTHS AGO    MONTHS AGO    BEFORE THE LAST RECESS  I WAS URGING      SENATE ACTION ON NOMINEES LIKE THE MICHIGAN DISTRICT COURT NOMINEES      AND JUDGE JORDAN WHOM WE HAVE BEFORE US NOW  THE LITTLE PROGRESS WE      MAY HAVE MADE HAS BEEN UNDONE BY SOME ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE          DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS SUPPORTED HIM  Jordan  MONTHS AGO  AND      HERE WE ARE STALLED BECAUSE NOBODY CAN FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO THE      LAST FEW DAYS OF A SESSION  SUDDENLY  IT IS LIKE  MY GOD  WE VE GOT      TO HAVE A CLOTURE VOTE ON HIM  WE COULD HAVE HAD 30 HOURS OF DEBATE      AFTERWARDS  WHICH I SAID LET S NOT DO  AND WE GOT A CONSENSUS  WE      WOULDN T  BUT TO HAVE GOTTEN TO A CLOTURE VOTE ON SOMEBODY THAT      WOULD HAVE PASSED ON A BED CHECK VOTE MONTHS AGO    WELL IF THIS      IS THEATER  IT S THEATER OF THE ABSURD  IF THIS IS THEATER  IT WOULD      CLOSE AFTER OPENING NIGHT ON BROADWAY OR ANYWHERE ELSE          THIS GOES BEYOND A FARCE  AND IT IS PARTICULARLY IRONIC THAT AFTER      MONTHS OF REPUBLICANS REPEATING A NEW MANTRA    EVERY ONE OF THE      PRESIDENT S NOMINEES  WHETHER QUALIFIED OR NOT  WHETHER ENGAGED IN      CONFLICTS OF INTEREST OR NOT  WHETHER FOUND BY THEIR OWN PEERS TO BE      QUALIFIED OR NOT  WHETHER SUPPORTED BY HOME STATE SENATORS OR NOT       IS ENTITLED TO A SWIFT UP OR DOWN VOTE    AFTER WE VE HEARD THIS      OVER AND OVER  GUESS WHAT  IT WAS REPUBLICAN OBJECTIONS THAT      STALLED MORE THAN A DOZEN JUDICIAL NOMINEES         AFTER THE LAST WORKING SESSION IN OCTOBER  I LEARNED THAT SEVERAL      REPUBLICANS WERE OBJECTING TO SENATE VOTES AND SOME OF PRESIDENT      BUSH S OWN JUDICIAL NOMINEES I MEAN THIS IS THEATER OF THE ABSURD       YOU HAD REPUBLICANS ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL  SAYING OH MY GOD  THOSE      DEMOCRATS ARE HOLDING UP PRESIDENT BUSH S POOR NOMINEES FOR THESE      HIGHLY PAID LIFETIME APPOINTMENTS  THEY RE HOLDING THEM UP  WELL       GUESS WHAT HAPPENED  ALL THESE NOMINEES OF PRESIDENT BUSHS    WE      SAID  FINE  LET S JUST PASS THEM  WE WERE TOLD  OH  CAN T DO IT       CAN T DO IT BECAUSE WE HAVE REPUBLICANS WHO PUT HOLDS ON THEM  TALK      ABOUT HAVING IT BOTH WAYS   Full Statement as      Prepared for      Delivery       Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On the Nomination of Judge Kent Jordan to the Third Circuit     December 8  2006   I am pleased the Senate finally has an      opportunity to consider the nomination of Kent Jordan of Delaware      for a lifetime appointment to the U  S  Court of Appeals for the      Third Circuit  Judge Jordan is a well qualified nominee with the      support of both home state Democratic Senators as well as that of      the Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  whose state is within the      Third Circuit  I support his nomination and will vote to confirm      him    I regret that the Republican      leadership chose to eschew bipartisan discussion of nominations and      unilaterally filed an unnecessary cloture motion on Judge Jordans      nomination  especially after we worked so hard to expedite it at a      busy time in September  I wish  instead  they had followed our      customary practice in the Senate for the Republican and Democratic      leaders to have sat down with the Chairman and the Ranking Member of      the Judiciary Committee and worked out a process to conclude the      consideration of judicial nominations for this session  Had they      done so  we could have capitalized on the hard work done by the      Chairman and the Judiciary Democrats to report consensus      nominations  Instead  this is the only judicial nominee that the      Republican leadership has scheduled for consideration in months        What they have left unexplained is why      they have refused to go forward with the Presidents nomination of      Judge Janet Neff of Michigan  The federal court serving the Western      District of Michigan has three federal trial court vacancies that      are judicial emergency vacancies  three in one federal district       The Senators from Michigan have worked with the White House on the      Presidents nomination of three nominees to fill these emergency      vacancies  The Judiciary Committee has proceeded unanimously on all      three  Working with Chairman Specter  the Democratic Members of the      Committee cooperated to expedite their consideration  On September      16  we held a confirmation hearing for those three nominees on an      expedited basis  Regrettably  the President had waited until July      to make these nominations  Had he acted sooner  as some of us      suggested earlier this year  we might not be in this situation       From the beginning  I have urged the President to work with us on      consensus nominations  and I have worked hard to proceed     I continue to do so now  even at this      late date in the session  and in spite of the pocket filibusters      employed by Republicans to stall more than 60 of President Clinton s      qualified judicial nominees         Democrats cooperated to expedite consideration of a number of      matters and reported the three judicial nominees to fill the      emergency vacancies in the Western District of Michigan on September      29  Regrettably the White House  Republican leadership  and      objections by Republican Senators continued to undermine this      process  Instead of focusing on consensus nominees  the President      sent back to the Senate in September and  again  following the      November election  highly controversial nominees who had been      returned to the White House in the hope that the President would      work with us on a bipartisan basis        We have been accommodating  and we will continue to be as we vote      for confirmation of Judge Jordan  but neither the Judiciary      Committee nor the United States Senate should be a rubber stamp for      the President  We should be taking our constitutional responsibility      to advise and consent seriously  These are the only lifetime      appointments in the Federal Government  and they will have an      enormous impact on the lives  the rights and the future of      Americans    We were accommodating when Judge      Jordan was pending before the Judiciary Committee  I cooperated      with Chairman Specters request for a Special Executive Business      Meeting  I came to the meeting and made the quorum  The Chairman      had said that the meeting would be held to expedite consideration of      non controversial nominees  I attended to enable the majority to      hold over the nomination of Judge Jordan in order to expedite its      consideration at our next meeting  In order to be accommodating  I      went further and continued to meet so that nominees of interest to      Senator Grassley and Senator DeWine could be held over  as well        The Democratic Senators on the      Judiciary Committee worked especially hard as time ran down in this      Congress to be accommodating on judicial nominations  The Chairman      held four nominations hearings in September  Three of these      hearings were for four nominees and the fourth was an unprecedented      hearing for two nominees receiving not qualified ratings from the      American Bar Association  This was a faster pace than is      traditional for the Committee so late in the session  particularly      in an election year  And it was a much faster pace than is ideal      for careful consideration of lifetime appointments to the nations      courts  But we nonetheless cleared nominees at this pace to be      accommodating and to keep nominations moving forward     Sadly  rather than meet to work out a      process to conclude the consideration of judicial nominations for      this session  the Republican leadership has apparently made the      unilateral decision to stall certain of these nominations  including      those for the judicial emergencies in the Western District of      Michigan and  in particular  the Presidents nomination of Judge      Janet Neff        This fall  an editorial in the      Richmond Times Dispatch entitled  No Vacancies       highlighted the Administrations counterproductive approach to      judicial nominations  The editorial criticized the Administration      before the November elections and before the President renominated      those controversial choices  for failing to turn vacancies into      judges and instead pursuing political fights  According to the  Richmond Times Dispatch       The president erred by renominating       and may be squandering      his opportunity to fill numerous other vacancies with judges of      right reason  The Richmond Times Dispatch focused on the      renomination of William James Haynes II to the Fourth Circuit  Of      course Mr  Haynes has yet to fulfill the pledge he made to me under      oath at his hearing to supply the materials he discussed in his      opening statement regarding his role in developing the legal      justifications and policies having to do with torture  detention and      other matters       The Richmond Times Dispatch      editorial could just as easily have been written about Judge      Terrence Boyle  whom the President also re nominated  again  He did      so despite the fact that as a sitting United States District Judge      and while a Circuit Court nominee  Judge Boyle ruled on multiple      cases involving corporations in which he held investments  The      President should have heeded the call of North Carolina Police      Benevolent Association  the North Carolina Troopers Association       the Police Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia       the National Association of Police Organizations  the Professional      Fire Fighters and Paramedics of North Carolina  as well as the      advice of our former colleague  Senator John Edwards  to withdraw      this ill advised nomination and not re nominate him  Law enforcement      officers from North Carolina and across the country oppose the      nomination  Civil rights groups oppose the nomination  Those      knowledgeable and respectful of judicial ethics oppose this      nomination  This nomination had been pending on the floor calendar      in the Republican controlled Senate for more than a year after being      forced out of the Committee on a party line vote  The Senate did the      President a favor by returning this nomination to the White House      before the summer recess and again before the election        The President also squandered an opportunity to fill Idahos vacancy      on the Ninth Circuit by re nominating William Gerry Myers III for      that seat  again  in September and  again  after the November      elections  This is another Administration insider and lobbyist whose      record has raised serious questions about his ability to be a fair      and impartial judge  I opposed this nomination when it was      considered by the Judiciary Committee in March 2005  This was a      nomination that the so called Gang of 14 expressly listed as      someone for whom they made no commitment to vote for cloture  and      with good reason        Mr  Myers record as Solicitor General for the Department of the      Interior suggests that he was part of a culture of corruption      documented in the testimony of the Interior Departments Inspector      General  Earl E  Devaney  at a hearing of the House Government      Reform Subcommittee on Energy  Mr  Devaney testified about a      culture of managerial irresponsibility and lack of accountability      at the upper levels of the Interior Department in which   s imply      stated  short of a crime  anything goes at the highest levels of the      Department of the Interior  He also testified  I have observed one      instance after another when the good work of my office has been      disregarded by the Department   Ethics failures on the part of      senior Department officialstaking the form of appearances of      impropriety  favoritism and biashave been routinely dismissed with      a promise not to do it again        While Mr  Myers anti environmental record is reason enough to      oppose his confirmation  his connection to the culture of      managerial irresponsibility and lack of accountability raises      further concerns  In particular  questions remain about his role in      authorizing a lawyer who worked for him  Bob Comer  to arrange a      sweetheart settlement agreement for a politically well connected      rancher  Frank Robbins  Mr  Comer was found in an investigation by      the Department of Interiors Inspector General to have been      responsible for arranging the deal  Documents have come to light      recently showing that Mr  Myers had been given materials about the      deal  undermining his assertions that he was merely misled by Mr       Comer  If anyone sought to proceed to this nomination  we would need      to know more about these new documents  and we would need to explore      any connections to the lobbying scandals associated with the      Interior Department and Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff  Recent      reports in The Denver Post      raise additional questions about the thoroughness of Mr  Myers      recollection  since their report that Mr  Myers and Mr  Abramoff      attended at least one party together has gone unrefuted and      unexplained        It is particular troubling to see Mr  Myers re nominated because the      President squandered yet another opportunity to fill a vacancy  I      had suggested that he re nominate Norman Randy Smith for the vacancy      created by the retirement of Judge Thomas G  Nelson from Idaho       Instead  the President has again nominated Judge Smith to a      California seat on the Ninth Circuit  effectively stealing      Californias seat  That is wrong  I support Senators Feinstein and      Boxer in their opposition to this tactic  I had urged President Bush      to resolve this impasse and turn Idahos vacancy into a judge by      withdrawing the controversial Myers nomination and nominating Judge      Smith for the Idaho vacancy to which he could be easily confirmed       Alternatively  he could have renominated them both but merely      switched the vacancies for which they were nominated and thereby      allowed the Smith nomination an opportunity to proceed        In addition  the President has renominated  again  Michael Wallace      to a vacancy on the Fifth Circuit even though he received the first      ABA rating of unanimously not qualified that I have seen for a      Circuit Court nominee in 25 years  Committee proceedings on this      nomination detailed the significant concerns raised by numerous      jurists around the country regarding Mr  Wallaces judicial      temperament  lack of commitment to equal justice for the poor and      minorities  lack of tolerance  and closed mindedness  It detailed      concerns from judges and lawyers that Mr  Wallace may not follow      the law and is driven by his personal agenda  Of course  the      troubling issues raised in the ABAs testimony echo significant      concerns about Mr  Wallaces record on civil rights  his opposition      to the Voting Rights Act  his support for tax exemptions for Bob      Jones University  his opposition to prison safety regulations  and      his attempt as President Reagans director of the board of the Legal      Services Corporation to undermine efforts to provide legal services      to low income clients    Months ago  before the last recess  I      was urging Senate action on nominees like the Michigan district      court nominees and Judge Jordan  What little progress we might have      made has been undone by some on the Republican side  It is      particularly ironic that after months of Republicans repeating a new      mantra  that every one of the Presidents nominees  whether      qualified or not  whether engaged in conflicts of interest or not       whether supported by home state Senators or not  is entitled to a      swift up or down vote  it was Republican objections that stalled      more than a dozen judicial nominees    After the last working session in      October  I learned that several Republicans were objecting to Senate      votes on some of President Bushs judicial nominees  According to      press accounts  Senator Brownback had placed a hold on Judge Neffs      nomination  even though he raised no objection to her nomination      when she was unanimously reported out of Judiciary Committee       Later  without going through the Committee  Senator Brownback sent      questions to Judge Neff about her attendance at a commitment      ceremony held by some family friends several years ago in      Massachusetts  Senator Brownback spoke of these matters and his      concerns on one of the Sunday morning talk shows     So where is the consultation about      this with the leaders of the Committee  Where is the cooperation       Where is the working together  Where is the explanation why the      Republican leadership has chosen not to proceed with the Neff      nomination to a judicial emergency vacancy  Can it really be that      her attendance at a commitment ceremony of a family friend failed      some Republican litmus test of ideological purity  that her lifetime      of achievement and qualifications are to be ignored  and that her      nominations is to be pocket filibustered by Republicans     The Republican approach to      nominations  of using nominations to score political points rather      than filling vacancies and administering justice  has led to a dire      situation in the Western District of Michigan  Judge Robert Holmes      Bell  Chief Judge of the Western District  wrote to me and to others      about the situation in that district  where several judges on senior      statusone over 90 years oldcontinue to carry heavy caseloads to      ensure that justice is administered in that district  Judge Bell is      the only active judge  If not for Republican objections  these      nominations would be filled by now   Of course  this is not the first time      Republicans have objected to an up or down vote on judicial      nominees  More than 60 of President Clintons judicial nominees      were pocket filibustered by Republicans without an up or down vote       Last year  the Presidents nomination of Harriet Miers to a vacancy      on the Supreme Court was stalled and then withdrawn due to      Republican objections   Republicans questioned her      qualifications and demanded answers about her work at the White      House and legal philosophy  They defeated her nomination before      allowing her a hearing    With regard to Democratic cooperation      on judicial nominations  I do want to acknowledge the kinds words of      the Majority leader who noted before the October recess that we have      made tremendous progress on confirming qualified judicial      nominees  By Senator Frists count  the Senate has confirmed 88      percent of President Bushs judicial nominees  giving him the      highest confirmation rate since President Reagan  He calculates      that 95 percent of all judgeships are filled  including more than      92 percent of all circuit court judgeships and more than 95 percent      of all district court judgeships  He notes that the Senate has      confirmed  n early 160 nominees for judgeships under the 46 months      of his leadership  He leaves out the fact that 100 of this      Presidents judicial nominees were confirmed during the 17 months      that I chaired the Judiciary Committee and Senator Daschle was the      Senates leader    Likewise  Chairman Specter      acknowledged before the recess that the Democrats on the Judiciary      Committee and in the Senate have been extremely accommodating  He      did so  again  yesterday here in the Senate  I thank him      This year  we have confirmed 31      judicial nominees so far  This far surpasses the total number of      judges confirmed in the 1996 congressional session  when Republicans      controlled the Senate and stalled President Clintons nominations       In the 1996 session  Republicans would not confirm a single      appellate court judge  not one  and moved forward on only 17      district court judges all session  That was the only session of the      Senate I can remember in which the Senate simply refused to consider      appellate court nominations  That was part of their pocket      filibuster strategy to stall and maintain vacancies so that a      Republican President could pack the courts and tilt them decidedly      to the right  In confirming eight Circuit Court judges this year       we have already confirmed more Circuit Court judges than in 1996       1997  1999  and 2000   We also could have accomplished more      this year if the White House had sent over consensus nominees early      in the year  Regrettably the Administration concentrated on a few      highly controversial nominees and delayed until recently sending      other nominations and thereby prevented us from having the time to      do any meaningful review    By contrast  there are six judicial      emergencies still without any nominee at all  Nor has President      Bush fulfilled his pledge to make a nomination for every vacancy      within 180 days  Of the vacancies currently without a nominee       seven have been vacant for more than 180 days  An additional 14 of      the pending nominees were nominated only after their vacancies had      been open for more than 180 days   With respect to the matter before the      Senate  I note  again  that I support the confirmation of Judge      Jordan and I am pleased to have helped expedite his consideration by      the Judiciary Committee  During the 17 months the Democrats were in      charge of considering President Bushs judicial nominations and I      was Chairman of the Judiciary Committee  we confirmed 100 judges        We have been accommodating  and we      will continue to be as we vote for confirmation of Judge Jordan      today  but neither the Judiciary Committee nor the United States      Senate should be a rubber stamp for the President Our success in      this process depends on the White House sending consensus nominees       as opposed to the highly controversial nominees it has sent the      Senate repeatedly  I was encouraged by President Bushs pledge      after the election to work with Congress in a bipartisan and      cooperative way  I was disappointed barely a week later when the      President re nominated a slate of his most controversial nominees       who failed to win confirmation under a Republican controlled      Senate    I am hopeful that we can find a better      approach in the 110th Congress  It starts with the      President  If the President consults with us and works with us to      send consensus picks instead of failed controversial nominations for      important lifetime appointments  we can make good progress filling      vacancies    We owe it to the American people  who      do not want nominations to be about partisan politics  but about      government responsibility to provide justice  The American      peopleexpect the federal courts to be fair forums where justice is      dispensed without favor to the right or the left  These are the      only lifetime appointments in our entire government  and they matter      a great deal to our future  I will continue in the 110th      Congress to work with Senators from both sides of the aisle to      ensure that the federal judiciary remains independent and able to      provide justice to all Americans        I congratulate Judge Jordan and his family on his confirmation      today
