       Comment Of Vermont Senators Patrick Leahy And Jim Jeffords About Vermont   Yankee Power Uprate                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Vermont Sens  Patrick Leahy And Jim Jeffords     About Vermont Yankee Power Uprate     March 2  2006   U S       Senators Patrick Leahy  D  and Jim Jeffords  I  issued the following      statement March 2 in response to the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions      decision to approve a power uprate at Vermont Yankee    Today the Nuclear Regulatory      Commission  NRC  has approved Entergys request to boost power at      its Vermont Yankee plant by 20 percent  We expect the NRC to closely      monitor this uprate to ensure the plants increased power generation      does not result in safety or reliability problems  The NRC should      ensure that all required safety related changes to the plants      license are made expeditiously  The NRC should also ensure that the      power boost at Vermont Yankee is implemented slowly  so the effects      on the plants operations can be fully monitored  As a delegation       we intend to continue to use our oversight authority to ensure the      NRC follows through in these areas  As we have said from the start       safety must be our first priority   In addition  as the public and the      State of Vermont have requested  the NRC has agreed to hold formal      hearings on the Yankee Power uprate  The NRCs Atomic Safety and      Licensing Board  ASLB  granted those requests in November 2004  We      remain concerned that the ASLB has not set a hearing schedule yet       and we urge the NRC to do so immediately  The outcome of the      hearings has the potential to affect the terms and conditions of the      uprate  and Vermonters have a right to the due process they      deserve
