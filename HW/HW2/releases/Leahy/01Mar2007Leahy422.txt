       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Release Of The Draft REAL ID   Regulations By The U S  Department Of Homeland Security                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy    On Release Of The Draft REAL ID Regulations    By The U S  Department Of Homeland Security    March 1  2007 There are parallels     in the troubled handling of both the REAL ID and WHTI programs  For     both of these programs  the Bush Administration has been slow to even     admit serious flaws  let alone to fix them  In the case of the WHTI     border crossing system  the Administration continues to pretend the     reform path ordered by Congress was never enacted   The new draft REAL ID     regulations confirm the worst suspicions that this program will impose a     massive unfunded mandate on state governments while raising innumerable     civil liberties and privacy concerns   It is ironic that we probably would have stronger     drivers  licenses today if the original shared rulemaking procedures     that Congress agreed to in 2004 had been allowed to move forward      Instead of spending years ahead in court over the constitutionality of     REAL ID  we would do better by taking a fresh look at the collaborative     path Congress first intended in 2004
