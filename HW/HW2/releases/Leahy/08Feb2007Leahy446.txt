       Leahy  Kohl Introduce Bill Prohibiting Cloned Products From Organic   Labeling                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Leahy  Kohl Introduce Bill    Prohibiting Cloned Products From Organic Labeling WASHINGTON  Thursday  Feb  8    U S  Senators     Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Herb Kohl  D Wis   Thursday introduced     legislation to bar products that are produced from cloned livestock from     receiving an organic food label under the National Organic Program     administered by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA    According to emerging legal analysis  prompted by     recent Food and Drug Administration  FDA  action  the federal definition     of organic food could allow cloned animal products to be labeled     organic   Any attempt to allow cloned animal products to     carry the organic label would be inconsistent with the national organic     standards and labeling program  said Leahy  the father of the program     and author of the Organic Foods Production Act of 1990  Recent USDA     statements unfortunately have called that fact into question  Ensuring     that the organic label stands for the highest possible standards is     essential to ensuring and maintaining consumer confidence in our rapidly     growing organic market   This bill has one purpose and one purpose only      to protect the integrity of organic standards  Kohl said  The     conditions under which cloned animal products enter our food supply will     be much debated in the months and years to come  But I would hope that     we can begin that discussion with general consensus that it is not     acceptable for cloned food products to enter the marketplace under the     organic label  Both the Agricultural Marking Service  which runs     USDAs National Organic Program  and the National Organic Standards     Board  which sets guidelines for the organic food labeling  have     indicated that they will take up this issue when they meet later this     year
