       Leahy  Specter Press For Answers On Administration s Domestic Spying   Program                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy  Specter Press For Answers     On Administrations Domestic Spying Program  Leading     Judiciary Committee Senators Continue To Seek Information     On Legal Justification For Warrantless Wiretapping Program  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  May 22   Senate     Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and Ranking Member     Arlen Specter  R Pa   sent a letter to Attorney General Alberto Gonzales     seeking answers to longstanding questions about the Bush     Administrations warrantless wiretapping program    Leahy and Specter renewed earlier requests     made by the Committee relating to the legal justifications for the     warrantless wiretapping program  The request follows testimony last     week by former Deputy Attorney General James Comey  who revealed that     the Justice Department had concerns about the legal basis for the     program and refused to certify it for a period of time in 2004   This Committee has made no fewer than     eight formal requests over the past 18 months  to the White House  the     Attorney General  or other Department of Justice officials  seeking     documents and information related to this surveillance program  These     requests have sought the Executive Branch legal analysis of this program     and documents reflecting its authorization by the President  the     senators wrote  You have rebuffed all requests for documents and your     answers to our questions have been wholly inadequate and  at times      misleading    Leahy and Specter noted that the     information is crucial for the Committee to have before consideration of     any of the Administrations proposed changes to the Foreign Intelligence     Surveillance Act  FISA   They set a deadline of June 5 for the Justice     Department to respond to the inquiry       May 21  2007  The Honorable Alberto     Gonzales    Attorney General of the United States    U S  Department of Justice    950 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W     Washington  DC 20530    Dear Attorney General     Gonzalez   Last week we heard dramatic     and deeply troubling testimony from former Deputy Attorney General Comey      He testified that in March 2004  when he was Acting Attorney General  he     informed the White House that the Department of Justice had concluded an     ongoing classified surveillance program had no legal basis and would     not certify it  He then described how you  then Counsel to the     President  and former White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card arrived at     the hospital bedside of an extremely ill Attorney General Ashcroft and     attempted to persuade him to certify the program  When you failed      because Mr  Ashcroft refused  Mr  Comey testified that the program was     nonetheless certified over the objections of the Department of Justice      That apparently prompted a number of high ranking Justice officials to     consider resigning en masse    This incident obviously     raises very serious questions about your personal behavior and     commitment to the rule of law  Mr  Comeys testimony also demonstrates     vividly how essential it is that this Committee understands the legal     underpinnings of the surveillance program that was the subject of that     incident  and how the legal justification evolved over time  The     stonewalling by you and the Administration must end  The Committee on     the Judiciary is charged with overseeing and legislating on     constitutional protections  civil and criminal justice  civil liberties      and the Judiciary  all subjects that this matter impacts  We intend to     do our job   This Committee has made no     fewer than eight formal requests over the past 18 months  to the White     House  the Attorney General  or other Department of Justice officials      seeking documents and information related to this surveillance program      These requests have sought the Executive Branch legal analysis of this     program and documents reflecting its authorization by the President      You have rebuffed all requests for documents and your answers to our     questions have been wholly inadequate and  at times  misleading     We note also that the     Administration has offered a legislative proposal that it contends seeks     to modernize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA   As you     know  the Judiciary Committee has historically overseen changes to FISA     and it is this Committees responsibility to review the Administrations     proposal with great care  The draft legislation would make dramatic and     far reaching changes to a critical national security authority  Before     we can even begin to consider any such legislative proposal  we must be     given appropriate access to the information necessary to carry out our     oversight and legislative duties    This Administration has     asserted that it established its program of warrantless wiretapping by     the NSA because it deemed FISAs requirements to be incompatible with     the needs of the intelligence community in fighting terrorism  You     testified in January that the warrantless wiretapping program had been     terminated and that henceforth surveillance would be conducted pursuant     to authorization from the FISA Court  To consider any changes to FISA      it is critical that this Committee understand how the Department and the     FISA Court have interpreted FISA and the perceived flaws that led the     Administration to operate a warrantless surveillance program outside of     FISAs provisions for over five years   Your consistent stonewalling     and misdirection have prevented this Committee from carrying out its     constitutional oversight and legislative duties for far too long  We     understand that much of the information we seek may currently be     classified  but that can be no excuse for failing to provide relevant     information to all members of this Committee and select  cleared staff      We will  of course  handle it with the greatest care and consistent with     security requirements    Therefore  we reiterate our     requests for the following documents and ask that you provide them to     this Committee no later than June 5  2007   1  Please provide all     documents that reflect the Presidents authorization and reauthorization     of the warrantless electronic surveillance program that you have called     the Terrorist Surveillance Program  including any predecessor programs      from 2001 to the present   2  Please provide all     memoranda or other documents containing analysis or opinions from the     Department of Justice  the National Security Agency  the Department of     Defense  the White House  or any other entity within the Executive     Branch on legality of or legal basis for the warrantless electronic     surveillance program  including documents that describe why the desired     surveillance would not or could not take place consistent with the     requirements and procedures of FISA from 2001 to the present   3  Please provide all     documents reflecting communications with the Foreign Intelligence     Surveillance Court  FISC  about the warrantless electronic surveillance     program or the types of surveillance that previously were conducted as     part of that program  that contain legal analysis  arguments  or     decisions concerning the interpretation of FISA  the Fourth Amendment      the Authorization for the Use of Military Force  or the Presidents     authority under Article II of the Constitution  including the January     2007 FISC orders to which you refer in your January 17  2007 letter to     us and all other opinions or orders of the FISA court with respect to     this surveillance   4  If you do not     consider the surveillance program that was the subject of discussion     during the hospital visit and other events that former Deputy Attorney     General James Comey described in his May 15  2007 testimony before the     Senate Judiciary Committee to be covered by the requests made above      please provide all documents described in those requests relevant to     that program  as well    We emphasize that we are     seeking the legal justifications and analysis underlying these matters     and not the specific operational details or information obtained by the     surveillance   Sincerely   PATRICK     LEAHY ARLEN SPECTER    Chairman     Ranking Member
