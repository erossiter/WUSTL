       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Bush Administration s Announcement  Of The Lifting Of Financial Restrictions On The Palestinian Government                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK       LEAHY                 VERMONT               Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chairman  Senate Subcommittee On State and Foreign Operations    Of the Appropriations Committee    On The Bush Administrations Announcement   Of The Lifting Of Financial Restrictions   On The Palestinian Government   And Of Support For Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas  Leahy and others in    Congress had worked with the White House in including funds for UNWRA     for Palestinian humanitarian relief  in the recently enacted    supplemental appropriations bill    The deteriorating situation in the    Palestinian territories is both tragic and alarming  The cost of the    Administrations prolonged neglect of the Israeli Palestinian conflict    and of restoring the peace process  while they have pursued a disastrous    policy in Iraq  compounds by the day  Of course we should provide    additional humanitarian aid to the Palestinians  who have been suffering    extreme hardships and have virtually lost hope  We should also do what    we can to support President Abbas  who has shown both courage and    tolerance  But no one should be under the illusion that todays    announcement by the Administration will solve a mess that is long in the    making  The only viable approach is one of sustained  high level    engagement to get back on track toward a political settlement
