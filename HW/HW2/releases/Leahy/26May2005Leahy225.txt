       Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy At The Nomination Hearing Of Rodolphe   Skip Vallee To Be Ambassador To The Slovak Republic                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Introductory Remarks Of Senator Patrick Leahy     At The Nomination Hearing     Of Rodolphe Skip Vallee     To Be Ambassador To The Slovak Republic     Thursday  May 26  2005 I thank Senator      Allen and the members of the Foreign Relations committee for the      opportunity to be here today as Senator Jeffords and I present to      you a distinguished native son of Vermont  Rodolphe Skip Vallee       to be Ambassador to the Slovak Republic  I am confident that he      will be a credit to our nation in this assignment  Skip is a native      Vermonter whose family has lived in Vermont for generations  While      we approach politics from different sides of the aisle  I have      tremendous respect for Skip as a businessman and as a fellow      Vermonter  Anyone who has had the pleasure of traveling through      Vermont has likely bought some gas at a Vallee owned service      station  The steady growth of the company and its emphasis on      customer service have benefited from Skips vibrant tenure as head      of the family business   I imagine those      who have closely followed Skips career are enjoying a little      chuckle to themselves that I sit here recommending him for this      important position  That is because years ago  many years ago         Skip applied for a position as an intern in my office  Its become      a bit of political lore in Vermont that he did not get that      position  I dont recall the decision making process for that      opening so long ago  but it does prompt some interesting      speculation  Having the pleasure of getting to know Skip in more      recent years  I know that he would have been a great asset to my      office  and I can not help but wonder if perhaps his political life      might have tracked in different directions than it has       ah  but      we shall never know  All joking aside       Skip will represent our country well as Ambassador to the Slovak      Republic  His intellect  his commitment and his attentiveness will      serve him effectively in this important post  His business      experience will not only be an asset to potential American investors      in Eastern Europe  he will also be able to offer free market advice      to Slovakian entrepreneurs   Skip  though your      talents will be missed in Vermont while you are away  we will be      proud to have one of our own serving in such a prestigious      position  Slovakia may be a long way from Vermont  but the small      towns  hilly countryside and skiing will seem familiar  I wish you       Denise and your children the best as you begin this journey       I have no doubt      that this Committee will find Skip qualified for and deserving of      this position  and I look forward to supporting his nomination on      the Senate Floor
