       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     On Judicial Nominations    January 30  2007 Today the Senate is considering the first judicial     nominations of the year  If these nominees are confirmed  it will be     the 101st and 102nd while I have served as Judiciary     Committee Chairman under this President  If confirmed  these nominees     will bring the total number of President Bushs nominees confirmed     during his tenure to 260   Last Thursday  the Judiciary Committee held its     first business meeting of the year  We were delayed a few weeks by the     failure of the Senate to pass organizing resolutions on January 4  when     this session first began  The Republican caucus had meetings over     several days after we were in session before finally agreeing on January     12 to S  Res  27 and S  Res 28  the resolutions assigning Members to     Senate committees   The Judiciary Committee has traditionally met on     Thursday  Regrettably  the delay in Senate organization meant that I     could not notice or convene a meeting of the Committee the morning of     January 11  as I had hoped  We devoted the intervening Thursday to our     oversight hearing with the Attorney General  January 18 was the date     the Attorney General selected as most convenient for him  and we     accommodated him in that   Accordingly  it was last Thursday that we were     first able to meet  At our first meeting  I included on our agenda the     nominations of five men and women to lifetime appointments as federal     judges  Three were for vacancies that have been designated judicial     emergencies by the Administrative Office of the Courts  Before     proceeding  I inquired of each Member of the Committee whether a hearing     was requested on these nominations this year  They were each nominees     we had considered in the Committee last year  They were returned to the     President without Senate action when Republican Senators objected to     proceeding with certain nominees in September and December last year      Last week I thanked the Members of the Judiciary Committee for working     with me to expedite consideration of these nominations this year  In     particular  I extend thanks to our new Members  the Senators from     Maryland and Rhode Island   All five nominations were not sent to the Senate     until January 9  We have moved promptly to vote to report them on     January 25 and now begin the process of final Senate consideration  I     know from last year that Senators Chambliss and Isaakson are strong     supporters of Ms  Woods nomination to fill the emergency vacancy in     Georgia  I appreciate that they have both worked with me and am     delighted that hers is the first nomination to be considered by the     Senate this year   The second nomination we will consider is that of     Philip S  Gutierrez  another nominee to a seat deemed to be a judicial     emergency  He has been nominated to the U S  District Court for the     Central District of California after a distinguished career in private     practice and as a Los Angeles County Superior and Municipal Court     judge  While on the Superior Court  Judge Gutierrez served as a     founding member of the Judicial Ethics Committee  which developed a     curriculum for ethics training for every California judicial officer      and devoted significant time to improving the court system statewide      Judge Gutierrez  a Los Angeles native  is a graduate of the University     of Notre Dame and UCLA Law School  This new Congress presents an opportunity for a     fresh start on judicial nominations  one that emphasizes qualifications     and bipartisan consensus over political game playing by the other side      President Bush made the right decision in not resubmitting this year     several controversial and troublesome nominees who failed to win     confirmation from a Republican controlled Senate  Of course it is     unfortunate that we lost many months of valuable time on those failed     nominations  We spent far too much time engaged in political fights     over a handful of nominees in the last Congress  time the Senate could     have spent making progress on filling vacancies with qualified consensus     nominees   I do wish the President had gone further and     renominated three nominees for vacancies in the Western District of     Michigan who were reported out of Committee  but left pending on the     Senates Executive Calendar when some on the other side of aisle blocked     the nomination of Judge Janet Neff for one of those seats  All three     nominations were for vacancies that are judicial emergency vacancies      three in one federal district  The Senators from Michigan had worked     with the White House on the Presidents nomination of three nominees to     fill those emergency vacancies  The Judiciary Committee proceeded     unanimously on all three  Working with then Chairman Specter  the     Democratic Members of the Committee cooperated to expedite their     consideration  On September 16  we held a confirmation hearing for     those three nominees on an expedited basis and reported them out of     Committee on September 29   Regrettably  rather than meet to work out a process     to conclude the consideration of judicial nominations last session  the     Republican leadership apparently made the unilateral decision to stall     certain of these nominations  including those for the judicial     emergencies in the Western District of Michigan and  in particular  the     Presidents nomination of Judge Janet Neff  After the last working     session in October  I learned that several Republicans were objecting to     Senate votes on some of President Bushs judicial nominees  According     to press accounts  Senator Brownback had placed a hold on Judge Neffs     nomination  even though he raised no objection to her nomination when     she was unanimously reported out of Judiciary Committee  Later  without     going through the Committee  Senator Brownback sent questions to Judge     Neff about her attendance at a commitment ceremony held by some family     friends several years ago in Massachusetts  Senator Brownback spoke of     these matters and his concerns on one of the Sunday morning talk shows      I wondered at the end of the last Congress whether     it could really be that Judge Neffs attendance at a commitment ceremony     of a family friend failed some Republican litmus test of ideological     purity  that her lifetime of achievement and qualifications were to be     ignored  and that her nomination was to be pocket filibustered by     Republicans  I do not know why the President has not chosen to     renominate Judge Neff or the other two Western District nominees  But     the approach to nominations we saw in the last Congress  of using     nominations to score political points rather than filling vacancies and     administering justice  has led to a dire situation in the Western     District of Michigan  Judge Robert Holmes Bell  Chief Judge of the     Western District  wrote to me and to others about the situation in that     district  where several judges on senior statusone over 90 years     oldcontinue to carry heavy caseloads to ensure that justice is     administered in that district  Judge Bell is the only active judge  If     not for Republican objections  these nominations would be filled by now  I urge the President to fill these and other     outstanding vacancies with consensus nominees  The Administrative     Office of the U S  Courts list 59 judicial vacancies  28 of which have     been deemed to be judicial emergencies  So far in this Congress  the     President has sent us 30 judicial nominations  There remain 17 judicial     emergency vacancies    17    now without any nominee at all   We continue to make progress today towards filling     longstanding judicial vacancies  If the President consults with us and     works with us to send consensus selections instead of controversial     nominations for important lifetime appointments  we can make good     progress filling vacancies   The American peopleexpect the federal courts to be     fair forums where justice is dispensed without favor to the right or the     left  I intend to do all that I can to ensure that the federal     judiciary remains independent and able to provide justice to all     Americans      These are the only lifetime appointments in our entire government  and     they matter  I will also continue in the 110th Congress to     work with Senators from both sides of the aisle  as I have with Senators     Chambliss and Isaakson as well as Senators Feinstein and Boxer  I     congratulate Ms  Woods and Judge Gutierrez on their confirmations today
