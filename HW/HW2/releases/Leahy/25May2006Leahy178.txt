       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of The Life Saving   Medicines Export Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On The Introduction Of The Life Saving Medicines Export Act Of 2006     May 25  2006 Mr       President  Mr  President  I am today introducing a bill which can      be the catalyst for saving the lives or improving the health of      millions of families in impoverished nations   In far too many      nations  thousands of children die needlessly each month    The concept of      my bill  called the Life Saving Medicines Export Act of 2006    is      easy to summarize   It allows U S       companies to make low cost generic versions of patented medicines      for export to impoverished nations that face public health crises      but cannot produce those life saving medicines for themselves       This bill is      based on World Trade Organization agreements permitting nations with      pharmaceutical industries to help nations in need   That WTO      agreement was labeled by U S  Ambassador Portman as a landmark      achievement that we hope will help developing countries devastated      by HIV and AIDS and other public heath crises  Apart from the      pressing need for this step in humanitarian terms  passage of this      bill could go a long way in improving U S  relations with large      segments of the worlds population   On December 6       2005  the Office of the U S  Trade Representative announced that it      welcomes efforts to allow countries to override patent rights      when necessary to export life saving drugs to developing countries      that face public health crises but cannot produce drugs for      themselves   I am concerned       however  that the Administration has taken no steps whatsoever to      begin to implement that agreement  No implementing legislation has      been provided to the Hill  I was informed just today that the      Administration has no present plans to propose legislation to      implement that international agreement  I am disappointed with that      answer but am pleased that the Administration expressed a      willingness to work with me on this important effort  I will      forward my bill to them later today   Indeed  the      World Health Assembly and the World Health Organization have adopted      resolutions urging all WTO member nations with a generic capability      to adopt laws that implement that agreement   The World Bank      recently issued a guide and model documents on how best to implement      that international agreement  My bill follows their model  Like a      generation ago  infectious and parasitic diseases remain the major      killers of children in the developing world  Many of these diseases         measles  malaria  river blindness    we can prevent or cure  But      those countries still lack the public health systems and the vital      medicines   Every hour       more than 500 African mothers lose a child  mostly from diseases      caused by contaminated water   In some      sub Saharan countries  HIV infection rates range as high as a third      of the adult population  and for this reason 35 percent of African      children are at higher risk of death than they were a decade ago       Despite these      grim statistics  there is a brighter side   We are far more      aware today of how much our own health depends on what takes place      half a world away  Whether it is AIDS  SARS  West Nile Virus  the      Avian Flu  or some as yet unknown infectious disease  we are all at      risk  and only an airplane flight away  from wherever the outbreak      may occur   Because of this      new awareness  global health is finally recognized as an issue of      national security  It may seem obvious today  but even ten years      ago it was not   Health threats      that once concerned only medical personnel  now receive the      attention of the highest levels of governments   We are      supporting policies and programs to help the poorest countries      conduct better surveillance and respond more quickly to protect      their own people  and to prevent the spread of disease   There is a      great deal more we need to do  Today  15 percent of the worlds      people consume 91 percent of the worlds pharmaceuticals  The high      price of many life saving medicines    medicines that we take for      granted in this country    is beyond reach for billions of the      worlds most vulnerable populations   President      Franklin Roosevelt said   The test of      our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of those      who have much  it is whether we provide enough for those who have      little   Imagine if you       or a loved one  were dying and you knew the medicine to cure the      disease exists and costs only a few dollars  but you have no way to      get it or to pay for it  That is a reality for millions of people      today  Reports by      UNICEF  UNAIDS  and Doctors without Borders clearly show that the high price of many life saving      medicines is a significant barrier to their availability in many      very low income areas of the world  Indeed  the 4th      Global Report of UNAIDS notes the extremely low rate of treatment      for HIV AIDS in those areas by pointing out that of the 5 to 6      million urgently in need of antiretroviral medicines  only some      400 000 were receiving them   With respect to      AIDS  a recent book by Philip Hilts called Prescription for      Survival notes the importance of offering affordable medicines to      populations of impoverished nations  It was said      that the price of the drugs was killing tens of thousands         Under my bill       U S  generic manufacturers would be allowed to make generic versions      of patented drugs without the consent of the patent holders    Those patent      holders would receive compensation in the form of a royalty payment      under a so called compulsory license and the generic companies      would then be required to sell those less expensive generic drugs      only to least developed or developing nations   Use of a      compulsory license occurs when Congress determines that there is an      important need which should be addressed   For example       most Americans do not realize that their network television programs      received by satellite or by cable are provided under a compulsory      license  The program owners receive a royalty for their programs      under a formula   This way      American families can watch network TV programming over satellite or      cable just like it is made available over the air  This same      compulsory license approach  except with respect to patented      medicines  is employed in this bill   The WTO      agreement contains language designed to protect the interests of the      patent holders by focusing its benefits on areas of the world where      these important medicines would not otherwise be available except      for some of the wealthiest residents   Thus       implementation of the agreement would not take business away from      the companies owning the patents  sometimes referred to as the      brand name companies  since their medicines are not purchased by      low income families in those impoverished nations  In addition       the patent holders will receive royalties from the generic companies      under the bill  Third  generic versions of products sold under the      agreement have to be clearly marked as not for resale to developed      nations  This will mean that the bill should not result in      undercutting the high priced sales of those medicines by the      brand name companies in developed nations   Thus  the bill      addresses both the urgent needs of millions of low income families      in impoverished nations while protecting the interests of the patent      owners of these life saving medicines   There have been      significant voluntary efforts made by brand name pharmaceutical      companies  foundations  and non profits who have donated life saving      medicines and have donated time  personnel and money to help in the      fight against deadly diseases in other nations  I commend and      greatly appreciate those efforts  Some funding      mechanisms have been started including the Global Fund to Fight      AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria and President Bushs Millennium      Challenge Account  Nonetheless  much remains to be done    If this bill is      enacted it would complement the above efforts and implement the WTO      agreements and make low cost life saving pharmaceutical products       and other medicines  available to hundreds of thousands of persons      without other access to those products  To provide a      little history  I am very pleased that all the member nations of the      World Trade Organization  WTO  agreed to this approach to assist      people suffering from life threatening diseases in least developed      or developing nations  Under this international agreement  nations      such as the United States with pharmaceutical industries would be      allowed to make and sell generic medicines to nations in need even      if the patent owners of those medicines refused to authorize such      manufacture and sale   As I said      earlier  On December 6  2005  the United States announced that it      welcomes the WTO amendment to allow countries to override patent      rights when necessary to export life saving drugs to developing      countries that face public health crises but cannot produce drugs      for themselves  The amendment will go in effect  for those nations      which adopt it  once two thirds of the member nations adopt it  The      current waiver approach  allowing nations to implement it now  will      remain in place until the permanent amendment is adopted  This      permits that U S  to move forward with this effort this year       Indeed  Canada has already passed implementing legislation    Participation      by any nation which wants to export such generic products is      voluntary  In order to participate  each country must pass      legislation to implement the WTO agreement  The United States needs      to act as soon as possible   This is a moral      issue  I am working with a number of religious groups  humanitarian      organizations  international assistance groups  and generic drug      companies on this effort  I have also received input from some      pharmaceutical brand name companies and hope a few will step forward      and be leaders in this effort  I will also reach out across the      aisle to try to form a bipartisan coalition   Two recent      World Health Organization annual reports  the World Health Reports      for 2003 and 2004  demonstrate the enormous scope of the need for      supplying these medicines to needy countries  The Life Saving      Medicines Export Act of 2006 that I am introducing today would      allow the U S  generic industry to respond to these urgent      international needs and could save millions of lives in impoverished      nations  Canada  Norway      and the Netherlands have already enacted such legislation or rule      changes However  aspects of the Canadian law have been an      impediment to the willingness of generic companies to participate       For example  that law allows Canadian generic companies to provide      such medicines for at most only four years  The Canadian version      permits dilatory and needless litigation  omits important medicines      from a complex list of covered drugs  and creates unnecessary      bureaucratic hoops   I have received      input from generic companies and my bill addresses all of those      concerns  For example  it would provide that a participating      generic manufacturer could provide such medicines for up to fourteen      years which makes it much more likely that U S  generic companies      would make the investments needed to make low cost medicines for      export to impoverished areas   Under my bill       U S  generic manufacturers would be allowed to make generic versions      of patented drugs without the consent of the patent holders  Those      patent holders would receive compensation  a royalty payment  under      a so called compulsory license and the generic companies would      then be required to sell those less expensive generic drugs only to      least developed or developing nations   The WTO      agreement contains language designed to protect the interests of the      patent holders by focusing its provisions on areas of the world      where these important medicines would not otherwise be available      except for some of the wealthiest residents  Thus  implementation      of the agreement would not take business away from the companies      owning the patents  sometimes referred to as the brand name patent      holders since their medicines are not purchased by low income      families in those impoverished nations  There may be de minimis      losses of profits for brand name patent holders but certainly the      humanitarian and self interest benefits provided by the bill would      massively outweigh those concerns   In addition       the patent holders will receive royalties from the generic companies      under the bill  Third  generic versions of products sold under the      agreement have to be clearly marked as not for resale to developed      nations  This should mean that the bill will not result in      undercutting the high priced sales of the patented medicines in      developed nations  Re exporting of these generic products is      prohibited unless it is part of a regional trade alliance among      impoverished nations as permitted under the WTO agreements  Thus  the bill      addresses both the urgent needs of millions of low income families      in impoverished nations while protecting the interests of the patent      owners of these life saving medicines and will hopefully help      enhance Americas image in the world   For those only      interested in self interest rather than humanitarian aid  note that      because of the globalization of travel our nation is at risk from      failure to contain diseases in other nations  America has a strong      self interest in combating diseases in foreign nations  A      surprising number of new diseases have emerged in recent years       Some of these new diseases are variations of existing diseases       The volume of people and cargo going to and from distant nations is      astounding  According to Rx for Survival by Philip Hilts  if you      count only travel between nations with a heavy burden of disease and      those with less disease  more than a million people a week are      making the trip   The more      viruses and bacteria mutant inside animals and people  and the more      people and goods travel throughout the world  the more residents      living in the United States are at risk of being harmed by dangerous      diseases  The National      Intelligence Estimate of January  2000  published by the CIA and the      National Intelligence Council noted that  New and emerging      infectious diseases will pose a rising global health threat  and      will complicate U S  and global security over the next 20 years       These diseases will endanger U S  citizens at home and abroad       threaten United States armed forces deployed overseas and exacerbate      social and political instability in key countries and regions       I hope all my      colleagues will join me in supporting this effort  Here is my      section by section summary of the bill   Section 1 Sets      forth the name of the Act as the Life Saving Medicines Export Act      of 2006  Section 2       States that the purpose of the Act is to promote public health under      World Trade Organization agreements by permitting the export of      generic versions of life saving patented pharmaceutical products and      other medicines including diagnostic tools and vaccines needed to      prevent or treat potentially life threatening diseases to residents      of impoverished countries with insufficient or no manufacturing      capacity to make the medicines  The findings set forth      determinations by the World Health Organization concerning the      millions of low income persons without regular access to medicines      in lesser developed or developing nations  Section 3       This section requires the Director of the United States Patent and      Trademark Office to issue a compulsory license  permission to make      and sell a patented product under this new Act  to permit generic      companies to make and export medicines under the terms of WTO      international agreements under several conditions  The recipient      country must be a least developed nation  as defined by the United      Nations  or a developing nation without the ability to manufacture      the medicine in question  The recipient      country  called an eligible country in the bill  must notify the      WTO of its interest in participating in this program  Efforts must      have been made by the generic company to buy the right to make and      sell the medicine under normal business arrangements with the patent      holders  The medical      product exported under this Act must be for life threatening public      health problems and can only be used in least developed or      developing nations  and is not for re export except in identified      circumstances relating to regional trade alliances  Special      labeling and packaging must be used to make clear that the product      is sold under the authority of the WTO agreement only for use as      allowed under agreement and this bill  The permission      to make and sell the product  the license  can not exceed seven      years  except that the license may be extended once  The holder of      the compulsory license shall pay a royalty to the patent holder  as      determined by the Director of the PTO within a limited range of      possible rates set forth in the bill  taking into account such      factors as humanitarian needs  the economic value to the importing      nation  and the need for low cost pharmaceutical products by persons      in the importing nation  The maximum      royalty for any shipment shall not exceed 4 percent times the      commercial value of the pharmaceutical products to be exported under      this Act under that supply agreement   An alternative      royalty payment approach  modeled after the approach enacted into      law by Canada  would also be permitted with the same 4 percent      maximum  In addition  the Director may accept combined applications      from multiple eligible countries  Note that in emergency situations      the Director may waive provisions of the bill in a manner consistent      with the WTO agreements    Section 4  This section makes clear      that compulsory licenses issued under this Act shall not be      considered an infringement of a patent  Section 5       This section creates a diverse advisory board of academic  patent       trade  medical  international aid  and industry experts to advise      the Director  and to report to the Congress  on ways to improve      implementation of the bill to achieve its purposes  Mandatory      funding for the board is provided out of the general fund of the      U S  at  1 5 million in fiscal years 2007 and 2008  with modestly      declining amounts provided in subsequent years through 2011
