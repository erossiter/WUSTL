       Leading Judiciary Senators Plan Bipartisan Amendment To Restore Habeas   Protections To DoD Authorization Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Leading Judiciary Senators     Plan Bipartisan Amendment    To Restore Habeas Protections     To DoD Authorization Bill     TUESDAY  JULY 10    Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt       and Ranking Member Arlen Specter  R Pa   took to the Senate floor today     to urge senators to adopt an amendment they plan to offer later this     week that would restore the habeas corpus protections stripped as a     result of last years Military Commissions Act    The Specter Leahy Amendment  No  2022  to the National Defense     Authorization Act of 2007 builds off of a bill the senators introduced     on the first day of this session that would restore these basic     safeguards to roughly 12 million legal permanent residents of the United     States  The bill was reported out of the Judiciary Committee on a     bipartisan vote last month    Below is Chairman Leahys statement on the amendment  followed by the     closed captioning transcript of the floor remarks of Leahy and Specter      and comments from Republicans  military officials and faith leaders     supporting the effort to restore habeas corpus protections    Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Amendment 2022  The Habeas Corpus Restoration Act Of 2007     To S  1547  The National Defense Authorization Act    July 10  2007    This week  the Senate considers the National Defense Authorization     Act  I am proud to join Senator Specter in introducing as an amendment     to that bill the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007  I thank Senator     Specter for his strong and consistent leadership on this issue  I hope     all Senators will join us in restoring basic American values and the     rule of law  while making our Nation stronger    Last year  Congress committed an historic mistake by suspending the     Great Writ of habeas corpus  not just for those confined at Guantanamo     Bay  but for millions of legal residents in the United States  The     Senate Judiciary Committees hearing in May on this bill illustrated the     broad agreement among people of diverse political beliefs and     backgrounds that the mistake committed in the Military Commissions Act     of 2006 must be corrected  This Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007     has 25 cosponsors  and the Senate Judiciary Committee passed it last     month on a bipartisan basis    Habeas corpus was recklessly undermined in last years Military     Commissions Act  Like the internment of Japanese Americans during World     War II  the elimination of habeas rights was an action driven by fear      and it was a stain on Americas reputation in the world  This is a time     of testing  Future generations will look back to examine the choices we     made during a time when security was too often invoked as a watchword to     convince us to slacken our defense of liberty and the rule of law   The Great Writ of habeas corpus is the legal process that guarantees     an opportunity to go to court and challenge the abuse of power by the     Government  It is enshrined in the Constitution  and stalwart     conservative Justice Antonin Scalia has recently referred to it as the     very core of liberty secured by our Anglo Saxon system of separated     powers  The Military Commissions Act rolled back these protections by     eliminating that right  permanently  for any non citizen labeled an     enemy combatant  In fact  a detainee does not have to be found to be an     enemy combatant  it is enough for the Government to say someone is     awaiting determination of that status   The sweep of this habeas provision goes far beyond the few hundred     detainees currently held at Guantanamo Bay  and it includes an estimated     12 million lawful permanent residents in the United States today  These     are people who work and pay taxes  people who abide by our laws and     should be entitled to fair treatment  Under this law  any of these     people can be detained  forever  without any ability to challenge their     detention in court  Stanford Professor Mariano Florentino Cuellar called     this an issue about which the Latino community  which encompasses so     many of the nations legal permanent residents  must be concerned   Giving the Government such raw  unfettered power should concern every     American  Since last fall  I have been describing a nightmare scenario     about a hard working legal permanent resident who makes an innocent     donation to  among other charities  a Muslim charity that the Government     secretly suspects of ties to terrorism  I suggested that  on the basis     of this donation and perhaps a report of suspicious behavior from an     overzealous neighbor or a cursory review of library records  this     permanent resident could be brought in for questioning  denied a lawyer      and confined indefinitely  Such a person would have no recourse in the     courts for years  for decades  forever    Many people viewed this kind of nightmare scenario as fanciful  It     was not  In November  that scenario was confirmed by the Department of     Justice itself in a legal brief submitted in a federal court in     Virginia  They asserted that the Military Commissions Act allows the     Government to detain any non citizen designated an enemy combatant     without giving that person any ability to challenge his detention in     court  This is true  the Justice Department said  even for someone     arrested and imprisoned in the United States  The Washington Post wrote     that the brief raises the possibility that any of the millions of     immigrants living in the United States could be subject to indefinite     detention if they are accused of ties to terrorist groups    That is wrong  It is unconstitutional  It is un American  It is     designed to ensure that the Bush Cheney Administration will never again     be embarrassed by court decisions reviewing its unlawful abuses of     power  The conservative Supreme Court  with seven of its nine members     appointed by Republican Presidents  has been the only check on this     Administrations lawlessness  This Supreme Court  and other conservative     federal courts  and recently even military judges  have repeatedly     overturned the lawless systems set up by this Administration governing     detainees    Many have hoped that the courts will come to the rescue again on the     issue of habeas corpus  With the continued drift of the Supreme Court     toward endorsing greater executive power  we cannot count on their     intervention  Congress cannot and must not outsource its moral     responsibility    We all want to make America safe from terrorism  But I implore those     who supported this change to think about whether eliminating habeas     truly makes America safer in the world  and whether it comports with the     values  liberties  and legal traditions we hold most dear    Top conservative thinkers like Professor Richard Epstein  and David     Keene  head of the American Conservative Union  agree that this change     betrays centuries of legal tradition and practice  Professor David     Gushee  head of Evangelicals for Human Rights  submitted a declaration     calling the elimination of habeas rights and related changes deeply     lamentable and fraught with danger to basic human rights  General     Colin Powell recently advocated habeas rights for detainees  asking      Isnt that what our systems all about   Perhaps most powerful for me was the testimony of Rear Admiral Donald     Guter  who was working in his office in the Pentagon as Judge Advocate     General of the Navy on September 11  2001  and saw first hand the     effects of terrorism  His credibility is unimpeachable when he says that     denying habeas rights to detainees endangers our troops and undermines     our military efforts    In testimony to the Committee  Admiral Guter wrote  As we limit the     rights of human beings  even those of the enemy  we become more like the     enemy  That makes us weaker and imperils our valiant troops  serving not     just in Iraq and Afghanistan  but around the globe    He was right  Whether you are an individual soldier  or a great     Nation  it is difficult to defend the higher ground by taking the lower     road  The world knows what our enemies stand for  The world also knows     what this country has tried to stand for and live up to  in the best of     times  and the worst of times    Now  as we work to reauthorize the many programs that compose our     valiant armed forces  it is the right time to heed the advice of Admiral     Guter and so many others of our top military lawyers who tell us that     eliminating basic legal rights undermines our fighting men and women  it     does not make them stronger  And the elimination of basic legal rights     undermines  not strengthens  our ability to achieve justice    It is from strength that America should defend our values and our way     of life  It is from the strength of our freedoms  our Constitution  and     the rule of law that we shall prevail  I hope all in the Senate      Republicans and Democrats  will join us in standing up for a stronger     America  for the America we believe in  and support the Habeas Corpus     Restoration Act of 2007                Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007        Republicans  Military Officials and Faith Leaders Support Bipartisan     Bill   Colin Powell  June 10  2007  Meet the Press  Guantanamo has become a major  major problem for Americas     perception as its seen  the way the world perceives America  And if it     was up to me  I would close Guantanamo not tomorrow  but this afternoon      Id close it    And I would not let any of those people go  I would simply move them     to the United States and put them into our federal legal system  The     concern was  Well  then theyll have access to lawyers  then theyll     have access to writs of habeas corpus  So what  Let them  Isnt that     what our systems all about  And  by the way  America  unfortunately      has two million people in jail all of whom had lawyers and access to     writs of habeas corpus  And so we can handle bad people in our system      And so I would get rid of Guantanamo and Id get rid of the military     commission system and use established procedures in federal law or in     the manual for courts martial  I would do that because I think its a     more equitable way to do it and its more understandable in     constitutional terms  I would alwaysI would also do it because every     morning I pick up a paper and some authoritarian figure  some person     somewhere is using Guantanamo to hide their own misdeeds    Colin Powell is a former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and     Secretary of State   Kenneth Starr  September 24  2006  Letter to the Senate Judiciary     Committee  Although S  3930 contains many laudable improvements to military     commissions procedure  section 6 of the bill effectively bars detainees     at the U S  Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba from applying for habeas     corpus review of their executive detention  I am concerned that     limitation may go too far in limiting habeas corpus relief    Article 1  section 9  clause 2 of the United States Constitution     provides that  t he Privilege of the Writ of Habeas Corpus shall not be     suspended  unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the public     Safety may require it  The United States is neither in a state of     rebellion nor invasion  Consequently  it would problematic for Congress     to modify the constitutionally protected writ of habeas corpus under     current events    Although no one wants the War on Terror to be litigated in the     courts  Congress should act cautiously to strike a balance between the     need to detain enemy combatants during the present conflict and the need     to honor the historic privilege of the writ of habeas corpus    Kenneth Starr is a former federal judge on the D C  Circuit Court     of Appeals and current Dean of Pepperdine Universitys School of Law    Richard A  Epstein  May 17  2007  Letter to Senator Arlen Specter     I am writing this short letter to you to express my strong support     for S  185  which seeks in a sensible fashion to undo much of the     serious damage to our constitutional structure that has been wrought by     the Military Commissions Act of 2006  insofar as it removed all of the     traditional protections that the writ of Habeas Corpus long supplied to     individuals  citizens and aliens alike  who seek to challenge the     legality of their detentions before an independent federal judge    As written  this provision draws no distinction among various kinds     of aliens  Those who are lawfully in the United States  even as     permanent aliens  are treated the same as enemy combatants found in     uniform abroad    Richard A  Epstein is the James Parker Hall Distinguished Service     Professor of Law at the University of Chicago Law School   David A  Keene  May 21  2007  Statement for the record for the     Senate Judiciary Committee  Earlier this year  I was pleased to join with a broad  bipartisan     group of more than forty five legal and policy experts in a statement     urging restoration of the habeas jurisdiction stripped by the MCA    Although I agree that our government must and does have the power to     detain foreign terrorists to protect national security  repealing     federal court jurisdiction over habeas corpus does not serve that goal      It is crucial that we maintain habeas corpus to ensure that we are     detaining the right people and complying with the rule of law    Therefore  I urge Congress to restore the habeas corpus jurisdiction     that was eliminated by the Military Commissions Act because of who we     are and what this great nation represents  Congress should act to     preserve our constitutional system of checks and balances  and restore     this established and traditional avenue of judicial review    David A  Keene is the Chairman of the American Conservative Union     and Co Chair of the Constitution Projects Liberty  Security Initiative      Dr  David P  Gushee  May 18  2007  Letter to the Senate Judiciary     Committee  Speaking as an individual  as a Christian citizen  I support the     effort you are making to restore habeas corpus for detainees in US     custody  I urge you to lead in the reconsideration of the full panoply     of legal and moral issues raised here  And in light of the fairly wide     support offered within the evangelical community to An Evangelical     Declaration Against Torture  Protecting Human Rights in an Age of     Terror  I believe that my convictions on this issue represent the views     of millions of evangelical Christians    Dr  David P  Gushee is University Fellow and Graves Professor of     Moral Philosophy at Union University and Chair of Evangelicals for Human     Rights   Former U S  Attorneys and Justice Department Officials  April 30      2007  Letter to Members of the Senate and House of Representatives   The right of habeas corpus was enshrined in the Constitution by our     Founding Fathers so that anyone the Executive detains may challenge the     lawfulness of his detention  It is a vital part of our system of checks     and balances  and an important safeguard against mistakes which may be     made even by well intentioned government officials  The rights the     American justice system provides to those imprisoned promote the     credibility and validity of the system itself  If the men at Guantanamo     are not provided these rights  a cloud will always remain over the     validity of their detention    Among others  this letter was signed by former Congressman and     U S  Attorney  Robert L  Barr Jr  of Georgia  and former Attorney     General Janet Reno    Former High Ranking Military Lawyers  March 7  2007  Letter to     the Senate Judiciary Committee  In discarding habeas corpus  we are jettisoning one of the core     principles of our nation precisely when we should be showcasing to the     world our great respect for the rule of law and basic rights  These are     the characteristics that make our nation great  These are the values     that our men and women in uniform are fighting to preserve    The denial of habeas corpus also threatens to harm our national     interests by placing American civilians at risk  Imagine if an enemy of     the United States arrested an American citizen  a nurse or interpreter     or employee of a military contractor  because they once provided     assistance to our armed forces  and held that American without charge or     opportunity to challenge their detention in court  We would be outraged      and rightly so  Yet  this is the precedent we are setting by holding     without charge those deemed to have aided the enemy and denying them     access to a court that could review the basis of their detention    A judicial check on the decision to detain is in the best tradition     of the United States  a tradition that ensures accountability      accuracy  and credibility  Restoring habeas corpus will help ensure that     we are detaining the right people and showcase to the world our respect     for the rule of law and the values that distinguish America from our     enemies    Along with others  this letter was signed by Rear Admiral Don     Guter  USN  Ret   and Rear Admiral John D  Hutson  USN  Ret    both of     whom have served as the Navys Judge Advocate General   Former Federal Judges  September 2006  Letter to Members of     Congress   D epriving the courts of habeas jurisdiction will jeopardize the     Judiciarys ability to ensure that Executive detentions are not grounded     on torture or other abuse  Senator John McCain and others have rightly     insisted that the proposed military commissions established to try     terror suspects of war crimes must not be permitted to rely on evidence     secured by unlawful coercion  But stripping district courts of habeas     jurisdiction would undermine this goal by permitting the Executive to     detain without trial based on the same coerced evidence    For two hundred years  the federal judiciary has maintained Chief     Justice Marshalls solemn admonition that ours is a government of laws      and not of men  The proposed legislation imperils this proud history by     abandoning the Great Writ to the siren call of military necessity  We     urge you to remove the provision stripping habeas jurisdiction from the     proposed Military Commissions Act of 2006 and to reject any legislation     that deprives the federal courts of habeas jurisdiction of pending     Guantanamo detainee cases    Along with other former U S  District and Circuit Appeals Court     Judges  the signers include former U S  District Judge and FBI Director     William Sessions and former Third Circuit Judges John Gibbons and     Timothy Lewis
