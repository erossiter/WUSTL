       Leahy Bill Bans Outsourcing Torture To Other Countries                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Leahy Bill Bans Outsourcing Torture         To Other Countries         Legislation Directs State Department        To Compile List Of Countries That Engage In Torture    WASHINGTON         Thursday  March 17   Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   introduced a bill        Thursday that would address the outsourcing of torture  or extraordinary        rendition  problem in a straightforward way by prohibiting the transfer of        individuals in United States custody or control to countries known to        engage in torture  The bill also would require the State Department to        annually produce a list of countries where torture is known to occur         Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary Committee  has        long been a leader on human rights issues  Leahy also is the ranking        member of the Senate Appropriations Committees Subcommittee on State         Foreign Operations and Related Programs  which handles the Senates work in        producing the State Departments annual budget  Also earlier this week         the House passed an Appropriations amendment sponsored by       Representative Edward        J  Markey  D Mass   that would halt the use of funds for outsourcing        torture  Leahys statement on the introduction of his bill is below    Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Convention Against Torture Implementation Act       March 17  2005 Mr  LEAHY  Mr         President  our Nation has a proud history as the leading advocate of human        rights around the world  Throughout this history  we have committed        ourselves to numerous international human rights treaties  including the        Convention Against Torture and Other Cruel  Inhuman or Degrading Treatment        or Punishment  The bill that I introduce today will reaffirm our        obligations under this Convention and reassure the world that we are a        nation committed to the rule of law  I want to thank my cosponsors         Senators Durbin  Kennedy  and Dodd  for working with me on this        legislation  and for their leadership on these issues   It has been nearly a year        since the first horrific images from Abu Ghraib prison appeared in the        media  shocking the world and shattering the image of the United        States  As the Administration circled the wagons and claimed the abuses        were committed by a few bad apples  new details about the widespread        abuse of detainees continued to emerge  I have spoken many times about the        need for a comprehensive  independent investigation into the abuse of        detainees  I have no doubt that such an investigation would be painful         but it also a necessary step to moving forward  Prisoner abuse by        U S  personnel is deeply troubling  but it is only one aspect of a broader        and serious problem  While we must ensure that prisoners are treated        humanely by our own personnel  we must also prohibit the use of so called        extraordinary renditions to send people to other countries where they        will be subject to torture  Article 3 of the Convention Against Torture        states that no State Party shall expel  return or extradite a person to        another State where there are substantial grounds for believing that he        would be in danger of being subjected to torture  The bill I introduce        today  the Convention Against Torture Implementation Act  will ensure        that we honor this commitment  We have addressed this        issue before  Congress implemented Article 3 of the Convention Against        Torture in the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998  but        this Administration has exploited loopholes in that law to transfer        detainees to countries where they are subjected to torture  Attorney        General Gonzales recently said that U S  policy is not to send detainees        to countries where we believe or we know that theyre going to be        tortured  but he acknowledged that we cant fully control what other        nations do  and added that he does not know whether countries have always        complied with their promises  In fact  they have not  My proposed legislation        does not broaden the obligations that we agreed to by ratifying the        Convention Against Torture  it simply closes the loopholes in the 1998 law        and ensures that we honor our commitment not to outsource torture to other        countries   The case of Maher Arar        provides a chilling example of extraordinary rendition  and illustrates why        this bill is necessary  Mr  Arar  a Canadian and Syrian citizen  was        stopped by immigration officers at John F  Kennedy International        Airport in September 2002 as he attempted to change planes on his way home        to Canada from Tunisia  He claims that he was interrogated by an FBI agent        and a New York City police officer  and that he was denied access to a        lawyer  He further claims that he repeatedly told U S  officials that he        feared he would be tortured if deported to Syria  After being detained for        nearly two weeks in a federal detention center in New York  Mr  Arar was        transferred by U S  authorities to Syria and held at the Bush        Administrations request  Mr  Arar claims that he was physically tortured        during the first two weeks of his detention in Syria  and that he was        subjected to severe psychological abuse over the following 10 months         including being held in a grave like cell and being forced to undergo        interrogation while hearing the screams of other prisoners   According to        Administration officials  the CIA received diplomatic assurances from       Syria that it would not torture Mr  Arar  But those assurances        amounted to little more than a wink and a nod  Unnamed intelligence        officials were later quoted in the press  saying that Arar confessed under        torture in Syria that he had gone to Afghanistan for terrorist training        Syria has a well documented history of state sponsored        torture  In fact  President Bush stated on November 7  2003  that        Syria has left a legacy of torture  oppression  misery  and ruin to its        people   Rather than rely on        assurances that a country will not torture an individual  we must make our        own unbiased determination  We already have the necessary information to        do so  Each year  as required by law  the State Department publishes        country reports on human rights practices  The most recent report on Syria        states that its torture methods include administering electrical shocks         pulling out fingernails  forcing objects into the rectum  beating         sometimes while the victim was suspended from the ceiling  hyperextending        the spine  bending the detainees into the frame of a wheel and whipping        exposed body parts  and using a backward bending chair to asphyxiate the        victim or fracture the victims spine   Some will argue that the        post 9 11 world is different  that we must use any and all means available        to extract information from suspected terrorists  Their argument might be        more credible if every person who turned up on a terrorist watch list were         in fact  a terrorist  I cannot say whether Mr  Arar had ties to terrorist        groups or not  but we do know that he was never charged with a crime         After enduring months of torture at the hands of the Syrians  he was        released and sent back to Canada   Nor was Mr  Arars        experience an isolated incident  A recent article in  The New Yorker titled        Outsourcing Torture provides disturbing details about how the        Administration embraced the use of rendition after the 9 11 attacks         Several press reports detail the CIAs use of its own Gulfstream V and        Boeing 737 jets to secretly transfer detainees to countries around the        world  where it is likely that they will be tortured  The Convention Against        Torture Implementation Act addresses the extraordinary rendition problem in        a straightforward manner  It requires the State Department to produce        annually a list of countries where torture is known to occur  The list        would be based on information contained in the State Departments country        reports on human rights practices  The bill prohibits the transfer of        individuals to any country on this list or to any other country if there        are substantial grounds for believing that the person would be tortured         It also provides reasonable exceptions to this prohibition to allow for        legal extraditions and removals  Most importantly  the        bill closes the diplomatic assurances loophole  We would no longer accept        assurances from governments that we know engage in torture  Our past        reliance on diplomatic assurances is blatantly hypocritical  How can our        State Department denounce countries for engaging in torture while the CIA        secretly transfers detainees to the very same countries for interrogation         The President says he does not condone torture  but transferring detainees        to other countries where they will be tortured does not absolve our        government of responsibility  By outsourcing torture to these countries         we diminish our own values as a nation and lose our credibility as an        advocate of human rights around the world   Last June  in the        aftermath of the Abu Ghraib scandal  the President was asked if he had        authorized abusive interrogation techniques  He replied  The        authorization I issued was that anything we did would conform to        U S  law and would be consistent with international treaty obligations         The legislation I introduce today will help us fulfill the Presidents        promise   The Senate gave its        advice and consent to the ratification of the Convention Against Torture        more than a decade ago  It is time to honor our commitment and show the        world that we will hold ourselves to the same standards that we demand of        others
