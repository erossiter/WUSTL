       Senate Floor Speech Of Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Senate   Judiciary Committee  On The Republican Leadership s Threatened Use Of The   Nuclear Option To Change Senate Rules On Judicial Nominations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Senate Floor Speech     Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Republican Leaderships Threatened Use    Of The Nuclear Option To Change Senate Rules    On Judicial Nominations    Wednesday  April 6  2005 Mr  President  we heard a distinguished leader of a country pushing     into democracy this morning  addressing a joint meeting of the Congress     over in the other body  I think every time a country moves into     democracy  and its leaders and citizens come to this country  one of the     things they are thrilled about is the independence of our Federal     judiciary and our judiciary overall  They say in their country  if they     ever want to have democracy  they have to have the independence of the     judiciary   I mention this because in recent weeks there seems to have been this     escalating verbal attack by political leaders  and I must say  with all     due respect  Republican political leaders  against Federal judges      including those who have been appointed by Republican Presidents  and     against the Supreme Court  where most of the justices have been     appointed by Republican Presidents   The Republican leader of the House has spoken seeking vengeance     against judges involved in the Terri Schiavo matter  A Senate Republican     has referenced the brutal murders in the State court in Georgia and of     Judge Lefkow s family in Illinois as if they were somehow connected to     judicial decisions that some people do not like and which lead to     pressures that explode in violence   Now  I know all Senators  Republicans and Democrats  including the     Senator who made those remarks  strongly agree there can be no     justification for violence against judges or their families  In Iraq      judges are being attacked by insurgents  In Columbia  honest judges were     murdered by drug dealing thugs  That is not a circumstance we want to     see anywhere in the world  especially here  We cannot tolerate or excuse     or justify it here in the United States   When I chaired the Judiciary Committee in 2001  one of the first     things I did was push for passage of the Judicial Protection Act  which     toughened criminal penalties for assaults against judges and their     families  I sponsored it with Senator Gordon Smith  We enacted it  We     were right to do so  Protecting our judges and Federal law enforcement     officers should be a top priority for us  I think sometimes the focus on     terrorism distracts us from the day to day dangers for judges   I remember the autumn of 2001  when Senator Daschle and I were each     sent anthrax laced letters in an environment in which high ranking     Republican leaders had criticized us unfairly during the sensitive weeks     leading up to that  People who touched the outside of the envelope     addressed to me  the envelope I was supposed to open  people who simply     touched it  doing their job  died as a result of that  And no     perpetrator was ever arrested or convicted for these anthrax attacks by     someone who may have thought himself a   super patriot   willing to will     to make his point   I do not want to see more attacks on our Federal and State judges  So     I urge those members of the other party who are making these attacks to     disavow the rhetoric and those attacks  They should not be creating an     atmosphere in which anyone will feel encouraged or justified in     attacking our judiciary if they do not like a particular decision   In this regard  I thank the Senator from Texas for the comments he     made Tuesday afternoon in which he expressed his regrets with regard to     certain remarks he made on Monday that he says were taken out of context     and misinterpreted  He has urged that the overheated rhetoric about the     judiciary be toned down and acknowledged that   our judiciary must not     be politicized     Mr  President  I became a Member of the Senate more than 30 years ago     at a time when the country was recovering from an abuse of power by     President Nixon  In the wake of the Watergate scandal  many of us were     elected to be a forceful check on executive power  It was a mindfulness     of the danger that absolute power corrupts that the Founders designed     our Constitution to contain a vital set of checks and balances among the     three branches of our Federal Government  Those checks and balances have     served to guarantee our freedoms for more than 200 years   Today  Republicans are threatening to take away one of the few     remaining checks on the power of the executive branch by their use of     what has become known as their   nuclear option    This assault on our     tradition of checks and balances and on the protection of minority     rights in the Senate and in our democracy should be abandoned   The American people have begun to see this threatened partisan power     grab for what it is and to realize that the threat and the potential     harm are aimed at our democracy  at the independent Federal judiciary     and  ultimately  at their rights and freedoms  A thoughtful editorial     appeared in one of my home State s newspapers today  In that editorial      The Barre Montpelier Times Argus observed    Abolishing the filibuster     for judicial nominees is another  more extreme  form of intimidation        I ask that a copy of that editorial be included in the record at the end     of my statement   Eliminating the filibuster by the nuclear option would violate and     destroy the Constitution s design of the Senate as an effective check on     the executive  The elimination of the filibuster would reduce any     incentive for a President to consult with home State Senators or seek     the advice of the Senate on lifetime appointments to the Federal     judiciary  It is a leap not only toward one party rule and absolute     majoritarianism in the Senate but to an unchecked executive   Recently Republican partisans have ratcheted up the vitriol even     further with their direct threats upon the judiciary  They spare no one      neither State court judges  nor Federal judges  nor Federal judges     appointed by Republican Presidents  nor the Supreme Court Justices     themselves  Their goal is intimidation and subservience to an     ideological agenda  rather than adherence to the rule of law  Worst of     all  some Republican leaders have taken their rhetoric to a level that     should concern all Americans  at a time when violence against judges      their families and courtroom personnel has shocked the nation  The     Republican leader of the House has recently spoken of seeking vengeance     against judges involved in the Terri Schiavo matter  I recall a similar     call by that House leader in 1997 in which he called for the     intimidation of judges  I spoke against it then and do so again today      It is essential that we preserve the independence of our judiciary and     protect it from intimidation   In my time in the Senate we have often faced issues directly relevant     to the separation of powers and the role this body plays as a check on     executive power  As ranking Democratic member of the Judiciary Committee     and as a former chairman of the committee  I have invested significant     time and energy on providing resources to our third branch of     Government  During the 17 months I chaired the committee  the Senate     confirmed 100 of President Bush s judicial nominees  In the other 34     months of the Bush administration  the Senate has confirmed but 104   The independent  nonpartisan role that judges play in our democracy     is vital  I agree with Chief Justice Rehnquist when he called the     independent judiciary the   crown jewel   of our democracy  It is the     envy of and the model for the world  In order to keep this branch of     Government independent and above politics  these nominations to lifetime     appointments should be of the caliber to garner wide consensus  not     political divisiveness  The goal should not consistently to be to see     how many controversial nominees can be confirmed by the narrowest of     partisan margins  Partisan passions must be kept in check when we are     addressing an independent branch of Government  and no President should     seek to pack the bench with unalloyed partisans or narrow ideologues      It is the Federal judiciary that is called upon to rein in the     political branches when their actions contravene the Constitution s     limits on governmental authority and restrict individual rights  It is     the Federal judiciary that has stood up to the overreaching of this     administration in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks  It is more     and more the Federal judiciary that is being called upon to protect     Americans  rights and liberties  our environment and to uphold the rule     of law as the political branches under the control of one party have     overreached  Federal judges should protect the rights of all Americans      not be selected to advance a partisan or personal agenda  Once the     judiciary is filled with partisans beholden to the administration and     willing to reinterpret the Constitution in line with the     administration s demands  who will be left to protect American values     and the rights of the American people  The Constitution establishes the     Senate as a check and a balance on the choices of a powerful President     who might seek to make the Federal judiciary an extension of his     administration or a wholly owned subsidiary of any political party   The Senate s role in advising the executive and determining whether     to consent to confirmation of particular nominees is a fundamental check     and balance on the executive  It is especially important with respect to     lifetime appointments to the judiciary  The Senate s rules  already     adopted and in place for this Congress  continue to provide for an     orderly procedure to end debate on matters before the Senate and an     orderly procedure for amending the Senate rules   Just as amending our fundamental charter  the Constitution  requires     supermajorities  so amending our Senate rules does  as well  When the     Senate rule for ending debate in the Senate has been amended in the     past  the rules for amending those rules have been followed  Previous     Senate majorities have followed the rule of law by amending rule XXII     only after a supermajority has agreed to end debate on amending the     rule  The nuclear option would circumvent rule XXII and would destroy     the equivalent of the rule of law in the Senate   Even the Senate s Republican majority should not be above the law      The Senate has always protected minority rights  The nuclear option     would bring an end to that tradition and to the comity and cooperation     on which the Senate depends  The Senate and the House were designed by     the Founders to serve different functions in our Government  The nuclear     option destroys the fundamental character of the Senate  Breaking so     fundamental a Senate rule by brute force is lawlessness  Over the past 2     years  the Republican majority has already bent  broken or ignored the     rules governing committee consideration of judicial nominees  This year     they are moving to destroy the one Senate rule left that allows the     minority any protection and any ability to protect the rights of the     American people   In political speeches we all talk about the importance of the rule of     law  In Iraq over the last 2 years  young Americans have given the     ultimate sacrifice seeking to help establish a democracy that upholds     the rule of law  The governing transitional law that the Bush     administration helped design for Iraq calls for a two thirds vote of the     Iraqi legislature to select the president and vice presidents  This was     created to protect the minority and encourage consensus  Just today we     hear that the long period of negotiations following the Iraqi elections     has yielded an agreement on the presidency council  which is the next     step in forming an Iraqi government  and that the Iraqi national     assembly expects to have the two thirds vote required to proceed to name     a Kurdish leader  a prominent Shiite Arab politician and a Sunni Arab     leader as the president and the two vice presidents of Iraq  While we     recognize and fight for consensus building and minority protection in     Iraq  Republican partisans here at home are threatening the nuclear     option to remove protection for the minority in the U S  Senate  That is     wrong   When President Bush last met earlier this year with President Putin     of Russia  he spoke eloquently about the fundamental requirements of a     democratic society  President Bush acknowledged that democracy relies on     the sharing of power  on checks and balances  on an independent court     system  on the protection of minority rights and on safeguarding human     rights and human dignity  What we preach to others we should practice      Destroying the protection of minority rights  removing the Senate as a     check on the President s power to appoint lifetime judges and     undermining our independent Federal judiciary are inconsistent with our     democratic principles and values but that is precisely what the nuclear     option would do   Breaching the Senate rules to eliminate filibusters of nominations     will only produce more division  bitterness and controversy  To date the     Senate has proceeded to confirm 204 lifetime appointments to the Federal     judiciary by President Bush  The Senate has refused to grant its consent     to only a handful of his most controversial and divisive nominees and     only after public debate and the votes of a substantial number of     Senators  Those who now threaten the nuclear option were willing to     forestall votes on more than 60 of President Clinton s moderate and     qualified judicial nominees if only one anonymous Republican Senator had     a secret objection   The way to resolve this conflict is for the President and Senate     Republicans to work with all Senators and engage in genuine  bipartisan     consultation aimed at the appointment of consensus nominees with     reputations for fairness who can gain wide support and join the more     than 200 judges confirmed during President Bush s first term  By last     December  we had reduced judicial vacancies to the lowest level  lowest     rate and lowest number in decades  since President Ronald Reagan was in     office   There are currently 28 judicial vacancies for which the President has     delayed sending a nominee  In fact  he has sent the Senate only one new     judicial nominee all year  I wish he would work with all Senators to     fill those remaining vacancies rather than through his inaction and     unnecessarily confrontational approach manufacture longstanding     vacancies   There are currently two of his nominees  Michael Seabright of Hawaii     and Paul Crotty of New York  who the Republican leadership refuses to     schedule for consideration  I believe that those nominees can be debated     and will be confirmed by overwhelming bipartisan votes  if the     Republican leadership of the Senate would focus on making progress     instead of seeking to manufacture a crisis  They can become the first     judges confirmed this year  Let us join together to debate and confirm     these consensus nominees   Rather than blowing up the Senate  let us honor the constitutional     design of our system of checks and balances and fill judicial vacancies     with consensus nominees without unnecessary delay   Republicans and Democrats are headed for a showdown in the Senate     over the Democrats  insistence that  for a handful of extreme and     ill suited judicial nominees  it will use the filibuster to block     action  Sen  Patrick Leahy  ranking Democrat on the Senate Judiciary     Committee  will be in the center of the fight  Republicans have responded to the prospect of Democratic filibusters     by threatening to throw out the rule allowing filibusters for judicial     nominees  Democrats say that if that happens they will halt all but the     most essential Senate action   The battle over the judiciary is a central political struggle of our     time  The congressional effort to meddle in the Terri Shiavo case was a     prelude to the battle over the courts  and it revealed the dangerous     degree to which the nation s Republican leaders intend to twist the     judiciary to their will   The party line among Republicans is that they favor judges who     interpret the law rather than making it  They don t want judges imposing     outcomes or crafting decisions to carry out a personal agenda   Yet the astonishing comments by Rep  Tom DeLay  House Republican     leader  show the Republicans  true aim  DeLay revealed that  above all      he wants to impose outcomes  The outcome in the Schiavo case didn t go     his way so he began talking of impeaching the judges involved  Judges     whose independence is curbed by that kind of intimidation will be forced     into outcomes demanded by politics  not by the law   The Schiavo case passed before judges in state and federal courts      the federal appeals court  even the U S  Supreme Court  and all those     judges  liberal and conservative  ruled that Terri Schiavo s expressed     wishes  as conveyed by her husband  should prevail  There has been much     debate about whether the husband was reliable and whether the medical     diagnosis was correct  But those questions went to judgment in the     courts  That is what courts are for  The judiciary is independent so     that courts can weigh facts in a calm and reasoned fashion  free of     political pressures or the enthusiasms of enflamed groups  Sometimes we     don t agree with the outcome  but citizens  like judges  are not     supposed to impose outcomes   Intimidation of the judiciary was also the approach of former     Attorney General John Ashcroft  who sought to discipline judges who     acted counter to his wishes  Abolishing the filibuster for judicial     nominees is another  more extreme  form of intimidation   The Republican critique of the judiciary suggests they believe judges     are somehow outside the democratic system  that they have no business     thwarting the workings of the legislative branch  But judges are an     essential part of the democratic system  For one  they are appointed by     the elected executive and confirmed by elected senators  And they exist     to safeguard our democratic system when the legislative or executive     branches try to ride roughshod over the law   In the Schiavo case  the executive and legislative branches sought to     abolish the constitutional role of the judiciary as an independent     branch  In those cases where President Bush s judicial nominees exhibit     similar lack of respect for the law  senators have the duty to oppose     them and to stand up against the intimidating tactics of the Republican     leadership
