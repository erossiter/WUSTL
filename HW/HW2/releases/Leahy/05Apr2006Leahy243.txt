       Leahy Wednesday  At Appropriations Hearing  To Press Gonzales And   Mueller                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy      Wednesday  At Appropriations Hearing      To Press Gonzales And Mueller     On FBIs  12 M  Contract To ChoicePoint      A Company With History Of Lax Security And Data Breaches    WASHINGTON  Wednesday  April 5          Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Wednesday plans to ask Attorney      General Alberto Gonzales and FBI Director Robert Mueller about the      revelation this week that the FBI has awarded a 5 year   12 million      contract to ChoicePoint Inc  ChoicePoint has a history of lax      security practices  including data breaches that have led the      government to impose millions of dollars in penalties against the      company    Leahy said he would press Attorney      General Gonzales and Director Mueller for answers Wednesday      afternoon when they appear before the Appropriations Subcommittee on      Commerce  Justice and Science  CJS   The two are scheduled to      testify on the Bush Administrations Justice Department and FBI      budget requests for Fiscal Year 2007  at 2 p m   in Room 192 of the      Dirksen Senate Building    Leahy will also question Gonzales and      Mueller on a new report by the Government Accountability Office       GAO  which concludes that federal agencies that use private      information services and data brokers do not follow even the scant      federal rules that protect Americans privacy  The Justice      Department and the Department of homeland security last year spent       30 million in contracts to private data brokers  GAOs findings      were the subject of a House hearing on Tuesday    The use of data brokers by federal      agencies has burgeoned in recent years  ChoicePoint officials last      year acknowledged that they serve in effect as a private      intelligence service for the government  The Washington Post      reported Wednesday in an article about the GAO report    Leahy  a senior member of the      Appropriations Committee and the CJS Subcommittee  Wednesday issued      the following statement on the ChoicePoint award    It is mind boggling that the FBI      would sign a five year   12 million contract with a company that has      become the poster child for lax identity protection  The FBI and      the Justice Department offer only a blind eye  a deaf ear and      stunning misjudgment with decisions like this that show such blatant      disregard for the privacy and security of the most sensitive      personal and financial information of the American people  Earlier      this year the FTC levied the largest civil penalty on record         a  10 million fine plus a  5 million restitution fund    against      ChoicePoint for its admission that it sold 163 000 consumer records      to identity thieves  During Senate Judiciary Committee hearings      that I requested on the ChoicePoint data security breach  we learned      that hundreds of Americans became victims of identity theft as a      result of ChoicePoints negligence    The FTCs investigation found that      ChoicePoint turned over personally identifiable information about      consumers to subscribers whose applications clearly raised red      flags  and that ChoicePoint failed to tighten its application      approval procedures even after receiving subpoenas from law      enforcement authorities alerting it to fraudulent activity  In      light of these troubling findings  it is unfathomable to me that the      FBI would entrust ChoicePoint with the handling of sensitive      investigative data about the operations of criminal enterprises   The ChoicePoint case and the series      of other data breaches over the last year clearly demonstrate the      need for firmer requirements to ensure data security  and these      incidents have begun to focus Congresss attention on this problem       The American people deserve to know why the FBI  with its own recent      history of poor judgment in wasting hundreds of millions of      taxpayers dollars on computer contracts  entered into this      contract  I look forward to discussing these concerns with Attorney      General Gonzales and Director Mueller during the hearing
