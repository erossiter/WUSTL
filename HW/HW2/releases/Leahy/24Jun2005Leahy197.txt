       Senate Approves Cornyn Leahy FOIA Reform                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT         Senate Approves      Cornyn Leahy FOIA Reform  Reform Bill Would Ensure That Any Future      Legislative FOIA Exemption Attempts Be Transparent WASHINGTON       Friday  June 24     Legislation passed by the U S  Senate on Friday      will bring increased sunshine to the federal legislative process       and was another step toward strengthening the Freedom of Information      Act  FOIA   its sponsors say  The reform  authored by U S  Sens       John Cornyn  R Texas   and Patrick Leahy  D Vt   creates additional      legislative transparency by requiring that any future legislation      containing exemptions to requirements be stated explicitly within      the text of the bill  The bill  S  1181  was the latest in a series      of FOIA reform bills filed by Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the Judiciary Committee  and Cornyn  a member of the panel       If Congress is      to establish a new exemption to FOIA  it should do so in the open      and in the light of day  and the unanimous passage of this      legislation makes clear that the Senate understands the need for      that reform  Cornyn said following the vote  The default position      of our government must be one of openness  If records can be open       they should be open  If good reason exists to keep something closed       it is the government that should bear the burden  not the other way      around  Leahy  a longtime      advocate in Congress for open government and a FOIA champion  said       In passing this bill  the Senate has taken a step toward helping      Congress be diligent in reviewing these exemptions to prevent      possible abuses  The American people deserve our ongoing diligence      in limiting undue exemptions that only serve to clog the plumbing      and limit the publics right to know  Sens  Cornyn and      Leahy introduced the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National      Government Act of 2005  OPEN Government Act  S  394  on Feb  16  and      a separate bill on March 10 to establish an advisory Commission on      Freedom of Information Act Processing Delays  Other co sponsors of      the OPEN Government Act include Sens  Russell Feingold  D Wisc         Lamar Alexander  R Tenn    Johnny Isakson  R Ga   and Ben Nelson       D Neb    Cornyn and Leahy      held a hearing on March 15 that examined the OPEN Government Act       The last time Congress approved major reforms to FOIA was nearly a      decade ago  and the Senate Judiciary Committee had not convened an      oversight hearing on compliance issues since 1992  The Senate      Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  which shares      jurisdiction over federal government information  has not held a      FOIA oversight hearing since 1980   Cornyn was      presented with the James Madison Award in 2001 for his efforts as      Texas Attorney General to promote open government by the Freedom of      Information Foundation of Texas  Sen  Cornyn served previously as      Texas Attorney General  Texas Supreme Court Justice  and Bexar      County District Judge  Leahy      sponsored the Electronic Freedom of Information Act Amendments       which updated FOIA for the Internet age  and in 1996 he was      installed in the Freedom of Information Act Hall of Fame  Leahy is      also the sponsor of the RESTORE FOIA Act  a bill that would restore      the biggest single rollback FOIA has suffered in its 38 year      history  by clarifying an overly broad provision that allows      corporate polluters and others to avoid public disclosure of      problems simply by stamping them critical infrastructure      information                     Below is Leahys Statement   Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy     On Passage of Section 8 of the Open Government Act     June 24  2005 MR  LEAHY  Earlier this month       Senator Cornyn and I introduced a simple and straightforward bill to      strengthen open government and the Freedom of Information Act  or      FOIA  It was the third commonsense proposal on government openness      that we have offered to the Senate this year  The Senator from      Texas has a long record of promoting open government  most      significantly during his tenure as Attorney General of Texas  He      and I have forged a productive partnership in this Congress to      support and strengthen FOIA  We introduced two bills earlier this      year and held a hearing on our bill  S 394  the Open Government Act       during Sunshine Week in March   The bill we pass today simply      requires that when Congress sees fit to provide a statutory      exemption to FOIA  it must state its intention to do so explicitly       The language of this bill was previously introduced as section eight      of the Open Government Act   No one argues with the notion that      some government information is appropriately kept from public view       FOIA contains a number of exemptions for national security  law      enforcement  confidential business information  personal privacy       and other matters  One provision of FOIA  commonly known as the       b  3  exemption  states that records that are specifically exempted      by statute may be withheld from disclosure  Many bills that are      introduced contain statutory exemptions  or contain language that is      ambiguous and might be interpreted as such by the courts  In recent      years  we have seen more and more such exemptions offered in      legislation  A 2003 Justice Department report stated that Congress      has been increasingly active in enacting such statutory      provisions  A June 3  2005  article by the Cox News Service      titled  Congress Cloaks More Information in Secrecy  pointed to      140 instances where congressional lawmakers have inserted such      exemptions into proposed legislation   Our      shared principles of open government lead us to believe that      individual statutory exemptions should be vigorously debated before      lawmakers vote in favor of them  Sometimes such proposed exemptions      are clearly delineated in proposed legislation  but other times they      amount to a few lines within a highly complex and lengthy bill       These are difficult to locate and analyze in a timely manner  even      for those of us who stand watch  As a result  such exemptions are      often enacted with little scrutiny  and as soon as one is granted       others are requested   The      private sector has sought many exemptions in exchange for agreeing      to share information with the government  One example of great      concern to me is the statutory exemption for critical infrastructure      information that was enacted as part of the Homeland Security Act of      2002  the law that created the Department of Homeland Security  In      this case  a reasonable compromise    approved by the White House         to balance the protection of sensitive information with the publics      right to know was pulled out of the bill in conference  It was then      replaced with text providing an overly broad statutory exemption      that undermines Federal and State sunshine laws  I have introduced      separate legislation  called the Restoration of Freedom of      Information Act  to revert to that reasonable compromise language       Not every statutory exemption is      inappropriate  but every proposal deserves scrutiny  Congress must      be diligent in reviewing new exemptions to prevent possible abuses       Focusing more sunshine on this process is an antidote to exemption      creep  The American people deserve our ongoing diligence in      limiting undue exemptions that only serve to clog the plumbing and      limit the publics right to know   When we introduced the Open      Government Act in February  we addressed this matter with a      provision that would require Congress to identify proposed statutory      exemptions in newly introduced legislation in a uniform manner       Today  we pass that single section as a new bill  I urge the House      to take action quickly and the President to sign this bill into law  I want to thank the Senator from      Texas for his personal dedication to these issues  and I thank all      Senators for their support of this bill
