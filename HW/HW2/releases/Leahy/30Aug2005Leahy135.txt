       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Discovery Of New  Unreleased   Documents Relating To Supreme Court Nominee John Roberts                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Comment Of Senator Patrick       Leahy  D Vt        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Discovery Of New  Unreleased Documents      Relating To Supreme Court Nominee John Roberts      August 30  2005  The Administrations handling of       information relating to this important nomination is extremely       disappointing  With less than a week to go before the hearings       begin  we learn that this Administration has even failed to live       up to its promise to produce all of the relevant files from John       Robertss time in the Reagan White House    This discovery comes late in this       process and after requests from Democratic members of the       Judiciary Committee for information on Judge Robertss record       have been delayed and denied  This Administration has set an       unsettling pattern of secrecy by slow walking relevant documents       and stonewalling a narrow request for key records  Still held       from the Senates view are work papers from John Robertss work       as a political appointee in the Office of the Solicitor General        in the Administration of former President Bush  Another file        on affirmative action  has gone missing   The Senate soon will decide on a       lifetime appointment to our highest court  and we have only one       chance to get it right  The hearings begin in less than a       week  The remaining documents should be provided immediately       and without any further delay  The Judiciary Committee has been       hard at work preparing for expedited hearings on this important       nomination  and there is no doubt that this last minute       revelation is a hindrance to that preparation
