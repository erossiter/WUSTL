       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Budget Point Of Order Raised   Against S 852                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Committee on the Judiciary     On the Budget Point of Order Raised Against S 852   February 14  2006 I      have great respect for the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate      Budget Committee  They do important work and are men of principle       Yet  I disagree with their position on the fiscal impact of the      asbestos legislation that we are continuing to debate today  And I      believe that a full reading of the text of our legislation and the      Congressional Budget Offices testimony and recent analysis on the      fiscal impact of the asbestos legislation does not support the      pending Point of Order or their opposition to this bill         Opponents of the asbestos bill claim that enactment of this      privately funded trust will add to the federal debt  Just this      week  the Congressional Budget Office made very clear that the      asbestos trust fund set up under S  852 would not add to the federal      debt  The CBO stated in a letter to the committee on Monday that      the legislation would be deficit neutral over the life of the      fund  The      CBO letter received yesterday is clear  It says  CBO      estimates that  so long as the funds administrator does not borrow      amounts beyond the means of the fund to repay  the governments      general funds would not be used to pay asbestos claims  Furthermore       section 406 of the bill states that the legislation would not      obligate the federal government to pay any part of an award under      the bill if amounts in the asbestos fund are inadequate  Thus  CBO      concludes that the legislation would be deficit neutral over the      life of the fund   I      ask unanimous consent that the February 13  2006 letter from CBO be      included as part of the record   This      is not a federal entitlement program  It is not subject to      discretionary appropriations from Congress and does not obligate the      federal government to pay victims of asbestos exposure  Some      opponents have argued that the federal government may be liable      because the bill allows borrowing from the Federal financing bank       Former Senator Nickles raised this concern and the Government      Accountability Office responded that  t o ensure that the      government incurs no liability for repayment of borrowing under the      act  Congress may wish to explicitly state that repayment of      borrowing is limited solely to amounts available in the fund  That      is precisely what we did in Section 221 b  of the FAIR Act    A      simple reading of the text of the bill reveals that defendants and      their insurers are obligated to pay  136 billion to the Fund  In      Sections 204 and 222  these private companies guarantee their own      funding obligations and additionally up to  4 billion of the assets      expected to be paid to the Fund from existing bankruptcy trusts  If      this level of funding proves to be insufficient  the Fund will      terminate and asbestos victims may return to the tort system  The      private companies are required under this legislation to continue      making payments to the Fund even after sunset until all of the      Funds obligations are satisfied under Section 405  Even the      administrative expenses are paid from this private money       Finally  the bill clearly states  Nothing in this Act shall be      construed to create any obligation of funding from the United States      Government  including any borrowing authorized             Senator Specter and I have been working on this issue for years       We have carefully considered the design of the compensation program      for asbestos victims and ways to avoid the pitfalls of other federal      compensation programs that have been enacted by Congress  Many of      the compensation programs cited by the opponents of S 852 were      created by Congress with mandatory federal spending and did not      contain a provision to sunset the program if it went under funded       We rejected such proposals for asbestos legislation  Many opponents      of our trust fund wanted the claims processing to be in a private      corporation  Labor groups and victims testified that operating this      trust fund in a new  private entity would delay compensation to sick      victims and would entail significant administrative costs       Accordingly  we agreed to house the asbestos trust fund within the      Department of Labor because it has expertise with compensation      programs  It has existing staff with relevant experience and      critical infrastructure and contracting capabilities to ensure an      accelerated pace to pay the sickest victims within months of      enactment        Members of the financial services community recently contacted my      office to rebut the conclusions made in the recent white paper      distributed by the minority staff of the Senate Budget Committee       The investment community indicates that this minority staff report      circulated last week dramatically overstates the financing expenses      to be expected under this legislation  This document alleges that       125 billion will be spent by the Fund on borrowing because it      vastly overstates claims projections and interest rates  The      minority staff document ignores the fact that section 221 of the      legislation provides that borrowing by the trust fund will be within      a 10 year time frame  The document alleges that the FAIR Act will      pay borrowing at an interest rate of a whopping 25 percent  This      assumes an interest rate SIX times higher than the current 10 year      Treasury bond rate  In fact  the financial community opines that      due to the structural aspects of the legislative language  it is      overwhelmingly likely that financial markets will treat the trust      fund as an investment grade credit and therefore it would have      access to highly favorable borrowing rates  I      ask unanimous consent to insert the financial institutions letter      in the Record  At      the heart of most arguments against the funding structure provided      under the FAIR Act are allegations that predictions about the number      of claims expected to come to the fund have been underestimated       Over the past five years  the Judiciary Committee received extensive      testimony from a variety of auditing companies  economic analysts      and existing asbestos trusts about claims projections  Three years      ago  a leading actuary with Tillinghast Towers Perrin testified that       108 billion appears to be more than adequate while other firms      estimated that  130 billion would be sufficient to cover the trust      fund expenses  It      is not surprising that projections about future behavior vary from      firm to firm because the assumptions are different  Some      professional analysts have estimated that we will experience      significantly less than  140 billion in claims and others have      estimated that we will experience more  Last weeks document      produced by some staff on the Budget Committee assumes that  160      billion will be paid out in claims based on a worst case scenario of      one projection of claims activity   The      Minority staff document circulated last week adopted claims      projections plainly at odds with the experience of the Manville      trust and without consideration for the medical criteria in S 852       The overwhelming majority of non malignant claims paid by the      Manville trust go to unimpaired claimants  The Fund created by the      FAIR Act would not compensate these claims so this significant      disparity must be taken into account  The Minority staff document      also fails to account for the different medical criteria for      malignant claims paid by the Manville trust  Thankfully  the CBOs      estimate takes the FAIR Acts specific medical criteria into account      when it considered its claims projections  The      CBO considered ALL relevant estimates and met with scores of stake      holders  financial experts  economists and auditors in determining      whether the compensation provided for victims under S 852 would be      adequate  After years of analysis  they found that while victim      compensation could range from  120 to  150 billion  its middle range      estimate using its chosen claims projections would yield      approximately  130 billion in claimant compensation  and that  140      billion  plus investment income  would be sufficient to cover all      claims payments  administrative costs  and borrowing costs    Of      course opponents can seize upon worst case scenarios in an eleventh      hour attempt to scuttle this bipartisan legislation  but  130      billion in expected claims is the CBOs middle range and is provided      for under our legislation       Finally  opponents of this legislation contend that the fund will      not actually receive  140 billion dollars from the private companies      obligated to contribute based on their previous asbestos      expenditures  In his testimony before the Senate Judiciary      Committee last Fall  then CBO Director Douglas Holtz Eakin clearly      stated that  CBO projects that total receipts to the fund over its      lifetime would amount to about  140 billion  including a small      amount of interest earnings on its balances  The FAIR Act contains      several provisions to ensure that the contributions will be      collected through numerous enforcement provisions which provide the      Administrator with subpoena power and the ability to pursue punitive      damages for nonpayment  In addition  our legislation contains a      funding guarantee so that other companies will make up the      difference if some companies are unable to pay their own      contribution  Even if the Fund sunsets and victims are allowed to      return to the tort system  the private companies are nonetheless      required to continue to pay into the Fund until all of the funds      obligations from borrowing costs and resolve victim claims are      satisfied   I      understand that some of my colleagues have raised this budget point      of order to sink the FAIR Act but I urge them to consider the      purpose of such budgetary mechanisms in light of the simple fact      that we have created a privately financed structure that the      Congressional Budget Office has estimated will NOT add to the      federal debt   This      point of order is a procedural mechanism intended to promote fiscal      discipline  In light of CBOs explicit statement that CBO      concludes that the legislation would be deficit neutral over the      life of the fund  no point of order should prevent such      important  completely privately funded legislation as the FAIR Act      This      latest analysis from CBO reinforces the fact that the asbestos trust      fund legislation would not add to the governments federal debt       The bottom line from CBO is that this bill is deficit neutral       There is no reason to sustain the budget point of order  The FAIR      Act is the right solution for victims and businesses  This      bipartisan bill offers fair and efficient relief to long suffering      victims of asbestos exposure while providing business with financial      certainty and an alternative to bankruptcy   I      recently received a letter from the International Association of      Heat and Frost Insulators and Asbestos Workers  The workers      represented by this union know first hand the devastation caused by      asbestos  and I know they would hate to see the unique opportunity      we have before us be destroyed by a technicality  They wrote  We      believe S  852 offers the best hope of providing fair and equitable      compensation on a national basis for those who have suffered or will      suffer from the devastating effects of asbestos exposure in decades      to come  For these reasons  we urge you to reject the budget point      of order  which holds the potential to kill this legislation that is      so important to our members  Let us not let down the very people      we are seeking to help  I ask unanimous consent that the letter      from the International Association of Heat and Frost Insulators and      Asbestos Workers of February 13   2006 be made part of the record  I      urge my colleagues to consider all the work that has gone into the      crafting of this legislation including the specific provisions I      have highlighted in this statement making it absolutely clear that      the federal government is simply not liable under this legislation       The Judiciary Committee received extensive testimony from economists      and experts in claims projections  All of this process and expertise      was considered as part of the Congressional Budget Office official      estimate  The CBO has testified that the FAIR Act is not predicted      to add to the federal debt therefore it should not suffer from the      budget point of order raised against it  I urge my colleagues to      waive the point of order  The victims of asbestos exposure will not      benefit from this latest tactic to stop this legislation
