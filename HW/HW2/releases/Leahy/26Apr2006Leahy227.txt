       Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  The National Defense Enhancement And   National Guard Empowerment Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Remarks Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Bill Introduction     The      National Defense Enhancement     And National Guard Empowerment Act Of      2006     April 26  2006 I am pleased today to join my friend and      co chair of the Senate National Guard Caucus  the Senator from      Missouri  Senator Bond  in introducing far reaching legislation that      will strengthen our Nations defense and the National Guard  which      is an inextricable part of the bedrock of our security  The      National Defense Enhancement and National Guard Empowerment Act of      2006 would empower the National Guard  It offers the Guard new      authorities and a greater and more fitting voice in policy and      budgetary discussions that is more line with the reliance that we      place on this force of proud men and women    The Nation asks the Guard to provide a large      part of the ground forces in Iraq  but then we give the force no say      in strategic planning and budget discussions  In fact  there have      been recent efforts within the armed services to cut the force      precipitously  We ask the Guard to carry out missions at home in      response to disasters and possible domestic attacks  but then give      the force no real ability to develop new equipment for this unique      mission  And  in a crunch  our senior defense leaders  including      the President  turn to the Chief of the National Guard for guidance      in addressing and responding to emergencies within the domestic      United States  yet those same senior Guard leaders receive only      mediated and filtered advice at other points  This gap between the      Guards real world missions and its institutional position is simply      unacceptable  It is not efficient  and it is not smart  It      violates basic notions of logic  and it hinders our ability to get      the full potential out of the National Guard    Our legislation directly addresses this      troubling missions to authorities gap in three very specific ways       First  the National Defense Enhancement and National Guard      Empowerment Act of 2006 would elevate the Chief of the National      Guard to the rank of General with four stars  also installing this      senior officer on the Joint Chiefs of Staff  The Joint Chiefs is      the highest military advisory body to the President and the      Secretary of Defense  Without a Guard representative at the      four star level  the Secretary and the President receive only      filtered advice from the Chiefs of Staff of the Army and the Air      Force about National Guard matters    The Army and the Air Force chiefs can provide      keen insights about the Guards role as a prime military reserve to      the active components  However  they are not responsible for  and      therefore are not experts on  disaster relief and homeland security      functions that the Guard carries out at the State level  often under      the command and control of the Nations governors  Placing a      National Guard General on the Joint Chiefs offers the fullest and      most sensible guidance to our leaders on all aspects of the Guard       and this arrangement would give the Nations governors a straight      line to the Joint Chiefs and the President on military matters         Creating a Guard senior advisor to the      Secretary of Defense and the President streamlines and formalizes an      arrangement that already arises in real emergencies  During the      darkest early days of Katrina  for example  the current National      Guard Bureau Chief General Steven Blum was by the side of the      Secretary of Defense and the President  A permanent Guard presence      on the Joint Chiefs ensures that this advisory relationship is in no      way last minute and ad hoc  The second way that this legislation puts the      National Guards authorities more in line with its real world      missions is by giving the force more budgetary authority  The Act      gives the National Guard the ability to research  develop and      procure equipment that is peculiar to its unique mission in the      realm of homeland security  This authority would be similar to the      authority of the Special Operations Command  given under the      Nunn Cohen legislation of the mid 1980s  to develop unique equipment      for the special forces    Last year  Congress appropriated almost  1      billion for the National Guard to procure equipment that has      application for homeland security  This legislation establishes      more formal structure for the Guard to refine such equipment      requirements and work in close coordination with the states to      ensure an adequate force structure  fully adequate in domestic      emergencies  is in place  The final way that this legislation brings      realistic authorities to the Guard is by ensuring that the Deputy      Commander of Northern Command is a three star general from the      National Guard  This Command is charged with planning for the      active militarys response to federal emergencies  as well as      coordinating the response with other federal agencies and civilian      authorities  Any military response in the domestic United States      will surely include the National Guard  in many cases with the State      governor overseeing the effort  Currently  there are few if any      senior Guard officers at the highest reaches of the Command  and the      legislation would ensure expertise on the force exists there    There has been a lot of discussion already      about this legislation after Senator Bond and I last month expressed      our intention to pursue it  To clear up any confusion  let me say      what this legislation does not do  This legislation does not affect      the National Guards role as one of the primary military reserves to      the Air Force and the Army  which we believe is beneficial for the      country  It also does not inflate the size of National Guard      headquarters here in Washington  We put a firm cap on the size of      the Guard Bureau in this legislation  The legislation further does      not create any new general office positions beyond the four star      Joint Chiefs position  It only ensures that the adequate seats of      representation is in place in key positions  in fact  the      legislation actually removes a less influential Major General      officer slot on the Joint Staff    What this bill does do  and with great      intensity  is to give the National Guard the institutional muscle      commensurate with the Guards missions  With this bill  we can ask      the Guard to do all that it does  but then say that  yes  it can      have a seat at the table during key discussions involving the      Guards missions and readiness  With this bill  we can tap into the      Guard for situations like the war in Iraq and the response to      Hurricane Katrina and tell these proud men and women that we take      are committed to taking real steps to keep the size of this force      steady and improve its stock of available equipment  With this      bill  we can ensure that our senior leaders  the Secretary of      Defense and the President  are making decisions about the National      Guard based on the best available information  With this bill  we strengthen the National      Guard  the military chain of command  and the Guards ability to      effectively serve each of the States and the entire Nation
