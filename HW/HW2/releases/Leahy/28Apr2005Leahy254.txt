women who have lost their         lives while serving as law enforcement officers   Statement Of Senator Patrick       Leahy       On The Introduction Of A Resolution       To Designate May 15  2005       As National Peace Officers Memorial Day       April 28  2005 I am proud to introduce today with my friend and colleague       Senator Specter a bipartisan resolution to designate May 15        2005  as National Peace Officers Memorial Day  Joining us in the       introduction of this resolution are Senators Hatch  Biden        Brownback  Cornyn  DeWine  Durbin  Feingold  Feinstein  Kennedy        Kohl  Kyl and Schumer   This is the ninth year running that I have been involved in       the introduction of this resolution to keep alive in the memory       of all Americans the sacrifice and commitment of those law       enforcement officers who lost their lives serving their       communities  For eight years I introduced this resolution with       my old friend and our former colleague Senator Campbell  a       former deputy sheriff who was a true leader on this issue  Now I       have teamed with Senator Specter  a former prosecutor who has       witnessed first hand the risks faced by law enforcement officers       every day while they serve and protect our communities  His       knowledge and experience in this area is a true asset to the       American people and I thank him for his leadership on it   I also want to thank each of our nations brave law       enforcement officers for their unwavering commitment to the       safety and protection of their fellow citizens  They are       real life heroes  too many of whom too often give the ultimate       sacrifice  and they remind us of how important it is to support       and respect our state and local police officers   Currently  more than 850 000 men and women who guard our       communities do so at great risk  Each year  1 in 15 officers is       assaulted  1 in 46 officers is injured  and 1 in 5 255 officers       is killed in the line of duty in the United States every other       day  After the hijacked planes hit the World Trade Center in New       York City on September 11  2001  72 peace officers died while       trying to ensure that their fellow citizens in those buildings       got to safety  That act of terrorism resulted in the highest       number of peace officers ever killed in a single incident in the       history of our country   In 2004  154 law enforcement officers died while serving in       the line of duty  well below the decade long average of 169       deaths annually  and a major drop from 2001 when a total of 237       officers were killed  A number of factors contributed to this       reduction including better equipment and the increased use of       bullet resistant vests  improved training and advanced emergency       medical care  And  in total  more than 17 500 men and women have       made the ultimate sacrifice  of that number 42 are police       officers who have already been killed in 2005 while serving in       the line of duty   In the 108th Congress  we shepherded into law a number of       measures to issues to make a difference in the lives of all       police officers and the communities they serve  We improved the       Justice Departments Public Safety Officers Benefits program by       making law the Hometown Heroes Survivors Benefits Act  P L  No        108 182   which allows survivors of public safety officers who       suffer fatal heart attacks or strokes while participating in       non routine stressful or strenuous physical activities to       qualify for federal survivor benefits   Also becoming law was the Campbell Leahy Bulletproof Vest       Partnership Grant Act  P L  No  108 372   which extends through       FY 2007 the authorization of appropriations for the Bulletproof       Vest Partnership Grant Program that helps State  tribal and       local jurisdictions purchase armor vests for use by law       enforcement officers  I hope that with the help of this Program       we can make sure that every police officer who needs a       bulletproof vest gets one   Last year  the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act  which       Senator Campbell and I championed in the Senate  was signed into       law  P L  No  108 277   This measure established national       measures of uniformity and consistency to permit trained and       certified on duty  off duty or retired law enforcement officers       to carry concealed firearms in most situations so that they may       respond immediately to crimes across State and other       jurisdictional lines  as well as to protect themselves and their       families from vindictive criminals   National Peace Officers Memorial Day will provide the people       of the United States with the opportunity to honor the       extraordinary service and sacrifice given year after year by our       police forces  More than 25 000 peace officers are expected to       gather in Washington to join with the families of their fallen       comrades  I hope my colleagues will join us in supporting       passage of this important bipartisan resolution
