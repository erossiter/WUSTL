                        U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy       Vermont Broadband Council Announce Grants  To Bring Broadband Service To Vermont      Communities        MONDAY  May 23     Sen  Patrick Leahy and the Vermont Broadband      Council Monday announced four grants totaling  125 000 to bring      high speed Internet service to Vermont communities that have been      left off the global Internet highway  The grants will assist local      initiatives in Gilman  Lowell  Ripton and a region in Central      Vermont that will bring affordable broadband service to residents      who have been bypassed by telecommunications providers        High speed Internet service will become a basic utility in the 21st      Century  and right now too many Vermont towns are in danger of      becoming second class communities  said Leahy  Our communities      recognize the need for broadband and are taking the initiative to      find affordable service  We need to build on this momentum and keep      pushing until broadband access is available everywhere in Vermont       Without affordable broadband service  our businesses  residents and      students will be left behind with severe economic and cultural      disadvantages        The grants will supplement the broadband community grants created      last year by the Vermont Legislature  which were championed by State      Sens  Matt Dunne  D Windsor   Hinda Miller  D Chittenden  and      Vincent Illuzzi  R Essex Orleans   That program awarded four grants      to the communities of Brandon  Grand Isle South Hero  Westmore  and      West Windsor Reading late last year  The grants announced by Leahy      and the Vermont Broadband Council are for wireless projects       allowing Internet service to be carried to homes and businesses      through radio waves         These grants are designed to complement the excellent community      broadband grant program that the Vermont Legislature established      last year  said Leahy  This is turning out to be a great      state federal community partnership  We need to continue to support      fledgling efforts that are beginning in communities around Vermont      to help make sure that no Vermonters become isolated when the      broadband superhighway comes through        Leahy helped establish the Vermont Broadband Council         as a public private resource to work on improving access and      affordability of broadband technologies  The councils first      demonstration project was MonptelierNet  a community cooperative      that has received national attention for bringing wireless Internet      service to city government  local businesses  the library and the      State House  That project has become a template for linking      communities with telecommunications providers and service companies      to provide wireless broadband service to their towns  The      Montpelier project also demonstrated the potential of wireless      service at lower costs    in that case providing broadband access at      rates that were up to a third less than rates available to many      businesses in Montpelier before the launch of MontpelierNet          The grants to Gilman  Lowell  Ripton and Central Vermont were      secured by Leahy  a senior member of the Senate Appropriations      Committee  in the Department of Housing and Urban Development FY05      budget    PROJECTS OVERVIEW       Ripton   25 000      Residents of Ripton      have formed a cooperative that has similarities to the one formed in      Montpelier with MontpelierNet  The cooperative has negotiated an      agreement with Middlebury College to use some of its facilities       The college is installing wireless equipment toprovide high speed      Internet connectivity to the Snow Bowl and the Breadloaf Campus       The signal will originate from the main campus in Middlebury  The      coop will install equipment to run parallel to the Middlebury      connection whichwill save the cost of having to build a towerat      the Snow Bowl as well as other equipment  The Ripton project will      initially provide wireless service to about 40users  and the local      school willbe one of the primary users   Gilman   25 000      This project      represents the kind of partnership anchor business model that has      been discussed in Vermont for the last few years  A local company       Dirigo Paper Company  has bought a bigger Internet connection than      it needs for its own use and will sell the excess bandwidth to the      community  The VBC grant will be used to provide connections to      local residents   Lowell        25 000  The town of      Westmore received one of the original state grants to develop a      wireless network in that community  Lowell will be able to      piggyback on the Westmore project  and this VBC grant will be used      to help purchase subscriber units for businesses and residents in      Lowell   Central Vermont        50 000  This      started out as a project to serve residents in Marshfield and      Plainfield  It hasexpanded to include East Montpelier and Calais       and groupsare forming in Worcester and Middlesex to join this      network  Among theoriginal four communities  there are more      than600 people who have expressed interest in wireless broadband      service
