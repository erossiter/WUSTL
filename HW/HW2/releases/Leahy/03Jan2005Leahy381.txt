       Leahy Statement On Torture                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT      Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy          D Vt         Ranking Democratic Member  Senate Judiciary Committee       On The Bush Administrations Revised Definition Of Torture        January 3  2005   I welcome the Administrations reversal on        this and hope it represents a true rejection of the White Houses        ill conceived effort to contort the definition of torture that was secretly        issued two years ago  This new memorandum  however  sidesteps two        significant sections of the original policy that claimed the President had        the power to override our torture laws and immunize from prosecution anyone        who commits torture under his order  It also does not adequately        repudiate other policy statements  such as the 2003 Department of Defense        Working Group memorandum  which was based in part on the original torture        document    The question is why it took two years to get        back to this point  after a devastating prisoner abuse scandal that has        increased the dangers to our own troops  It also is no coincidence that        this turnaround has suddenly appeared on the eve of the Senates        confirmation hearings on the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney        General    The upcoming hearings are a chance for some        accountability and for some answers that have been lacking from the        Administration about its policies on torture and about the prison abuse        scandals  There is much to answer for
