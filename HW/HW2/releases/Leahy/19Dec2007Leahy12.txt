       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Nomination Of Mark Filip To Be Deputy   Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Statement Of Sen  Patrick       Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary       Committee   Hearing On The Nomination       Of Mark Filip To Be Deputy Attorney General  December 19  2007              The Committee today will hear from       the Administrations nominee to be the Deputy Attorney General        the number two position at the Department of Justice  Indeed        in the absence of the Attorney General  the Deputy acts as the       Attorney General        The critical work of restoring the       Departments independence and credibility has been deterred by       the Administration  This Administration has known since at       least May 14  2007  when Mr  McNulty announced that he was       resigning  and should have known for weeks before  that there       was to be a vacancy in the important position we consider       today  Yet even after the former Deputy announced his       resignation and proceeded to resign months later  the       Administration failed to work with the Senate to fill this vital       position        Paul McNulty was one of many       high ranking Department officials  along with former Attorney       General Gonzales  who resigned during this Committees       investigation into the firing of well performing United States       Attorneys for partisan  political purposes  Those firings and       our investigation point to political operatives from the White       House interfering with and corrupting the Departments law       enforcement functions for partisan  political purposes  This       nomination comes during a crisis of leadership that has done       more than take a heavy toll on the Departments morale and       tradition of independence  It has also shaken the confidence of       the American people and Congress that the Department will uphold       the bedrock principle  deeply embedded in our laws and our       values  that no one  not even the President  is above the law              I announced that we       would hold this hearing today  before Congress adjourns for the       year  immediately upon receiving this nomination from the White       House and the necessary background materials  The Committee       will seek to move as expeditiously as possible  We will want to       know whether this appointment will help restore the independence       of the Department of Justice and strengthen the rule of law             Every time we seem to reach a new       low in this Administrations arrogant flaunting of the rule of       law and constitutional limits on Executive Power  we learn       startling new revelations about the extent to which some will go       to avoid accountability  undermine oversight and stonewall the       truth  Two weeks ago  we learned that the CIA destroyed       videotapes of detainee interrogations  And just this morning        in a regrettably familiar pattern  we learned that the       involvement of senior Administration officials seems to have       been much more significant than it appeared from their initial       denials  These revelations are leading to additional       investigations by Congress and the courts        As the Ranking Member on this       Committee from 2001 through 2006  I was not informed of the       existence of the videotapes or of their destruction  I do not       believe the Republican Chairmen were either  I have repeatedly       sought information about the Administrations interrogations of       detainees  including during the consideration of the Mukasey       nomination to be Attorney General and in my October 25  2007         which I ask be made part       of the record       Early last week I sent a       with Senator Specter to the Attorney       General seeking information about the involvement of the       Department of Justice with those matters before the public       revelation of the tapes destruction and how the Attorney       General intended to determine whether to appoint a special       counsel to conduct the investigation and potential prosecutions       for obstruction of justice and obstruction of Congress        Regrettably  the reply we received evidences none of the       commitment to work with this Committee that we heard during the       Attorney Generals recent confirmation hearing  The       showed no appreciation for the oversight role of       the Congress  I will make that exchange of letters part of the       record  Since then I have seen that the Department has also       demanded that the Intelligence Committees of the Congress cease       their independent investigations and that the courts not proceed       to determine whether this Administration has violated court       orders or been less than candid in court proceedings  That is       not the way to restore the Departments credibility  That all       appears to be an effort to prevent accountability and to       undermine checks and balances        U S  District Judge Henry Kennedy       yesterday rejected the Administrations demands  ordering the       Administration to appear in court this week to determine whether       it violated his 2005 order that it was to preserve all evidence       related to the mistreatment of detainees        Senator Specter and I are both       former prosecutors  We were not asking the Attorney General to       prejudice a criminal investigation and were not seeking to       intervene in it  Rather we and this Committee have       constitutional responsibilities that we need to fulfill  Those       duties are entitled to respect  as well        My fear is that the       pattern of unaccountability and excuse by this Administration       will continue  They have shown a proclivity to paper over       misconduct with legal opinions from the Department of Justice        These legal opinions  like the infamous  withdrawn Bybee memo on       torture  are wrong  In the words of Jack Goldsmith  a former       head of the Office of Legal Counsel  who discovered this legal       mess of extreme opinion  they have an unusual lack of care and       sobriety in their legal analysis  they rest on cursory and       one sided legal arguments that failed to consider Congresss       competing wartime constitutional authorities  or the many       Supreme Court decisions potentially in tension with the       conclusion  and could be interpreted as if they were designed       to confer immunity for bad acts        As we recently       learned not from the Administration but from  The New York Times        soon after the last Attorney General took over  the Department       of Justice secretly endorsed and reinstated combinations of the       harshest interrogation tactics as legal  They apparently gave       legal approval to brutal interrogation techniques  including       waterboarding  Former Deputy Attorney General James Comey       predicted that the Department would end up being ashamed of       such actions when the public learned of them        Whether Mark Filip will follow the       example of integrity and independence of others like Elliot       Richardson and William Ruckelshaus  who resigned or were fired       rather than interfere with the investigation of wrongdoing of       the Nixon Administration  is a critical question       We are reminded       by those examples that law enforcement officials must enforce       the law without fear or favor to their benefactors at the White       House or their political party  We have been reminded all too       recently by the Gonzales Justice Department what happens when       the rule of law plays second fiddle to a Presidents policy       agenda and the partisan desires of political operatives         In light of this Administrations       troubling record of thwarting checks and balances  I want to be       confident that this Deputy Attorney General will be independent       in enforcing the rule of law on crucial issues like the       destruction of the CIA tapes and the legal cover given to       torture  A newly independent Justice Department must reexamine       these issues guided only by the law and by our American values        not by the flawed policies and past acts of this Administration        I want to be assured that this Deputy Attorney General does       not envision a system where a Presidents overbroad and invalid       claims of executive privilege cannot be tested in a court of       law        I hope that Mark Filip reassures       us that he understands that the duty of the Deputy Attorney       General is to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law  not       to work to circumvent it  Both the President and the nation are       best served by a Justice Department that provides sound advice       and takes responsible action  without regard to political       considerations  not one that develops legalistic loopholes to       serve the ends of a particular Administration
