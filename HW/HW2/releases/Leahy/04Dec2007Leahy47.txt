       Leahy And Cornyn Introduce Revised OPEN Government Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Leahy And Cornyn Introduce       Revised OPEN Government Act       Urge Senate And House To Swiftly Pass FOIA Improvement Bill      To Increase Government Transparency     WASHINGTON  Tuesday  Dec  4  2007         Sens  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   and John Cornyn  R Texas  Tuesday       introduced bipartisan  revised legislation to increase       government transparency and provide the first major reforms to       the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA  in more than a decade        The Senate passed an earlier version of the Leahy Cornyn bill          the Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National  OPEN        Government Act    and the House has passed a counterpart       measure  but efforts to reconcile the two bills were stymied       over House concerns about pay go issues       Leahy and Cornyn first introduced       the OPEN Government Act in March during the annual Sunshine       Week  a weeklong effort by news organizations to raise public       awareness of the importance of open government  After months of       effort by Leahy and Cornyn  the Senate passed the bipartisan       legislation in August  Concerns from the House about payment of       attorneys and processing fees further stalled the Houses       consideration of the Senate legislation  Their revised bill       addresses those concerns  and both Leahy and Cornyn Tuesday       called for its prompt consideration in both the Senate and the       House       We have made a strong case for       the need to improve and strengthen FOIA  and there is strong        bipartisan support for doing that  said Leahy  Now we are       finally poised to pass meaningful FOIA reform before the end of       the year  We have a strong chance of Senate action on the bill       this week  and I hope the House also will swiftly pass this       legislation so the President can sign this important act before       years end       After years of bipartisan work        were close to enacting sweeping reforms to let more sunshine in       government and increase the peoples right to know  Cornyn       said  This legislation helps hold politicians and government       officials accountable  and will strengthen our democracy  These       efforts are embraced by people across the political spectrum        With these minor revisions  I hope the Senate will quickly adopt       the bill and our House colleagues will then pass this important       legislation without amendment       The OPEN Government Act would       Restore meaningful deadlines        for agency action under FOIA    Impose real consequences on        federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day statutory        deadline    Clarify that FOIA applies to        government records held by outside private contractors          Establish a FOIA hotline        service for all federal agencies  and   Create a FOIA Ombudsman to        provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a        meaningful alternative to costly litigation                         For Background            Openness Promotes Effectiveness in our National Government Act       of 2007          OPEN Government Act of 2007   Cornyn Leahy          Section by Section Analysis  revisions in italics       Sec  1  Short       Title  The Open Government Act of 2007       Sec  2        Findings  The findings reiterate the intent       of Congress upon enacting the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA         5 U S C  552 as amended  and restate FOIAs presumption in favor       of disclosure       Sec  3        Protection of Fee Status for News Media  This       section amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  A  ii  to make clear that       independent journalists are not barred from obtaining fee       waivers solely because they lack an institutional affiliation       with a recognized news media entity  In determining whether to       grant a fee waiver  an agency shall consider the prior       publication history of the requestor  If the requestor has no       prior publication history and no current affiliation with a news       organization  the agency shall review the requestors plans for       disseminating the requested material and whether those plans       include distributing the material to a reasonably broad       audience        Sec  4        Recovery of Attorney Fees and Litigation Costs   This section  the so called  Buckhannon fix        amends 5 U S C  552 a  4  E  to clarify that a complainant has       substantially prevailed in a FOIA lawsuit  and is eligible to       recover attorney fees  if the complainant has obtained relief       through a judicial or administrative order or if the pursuit of       a claim was the catalyst for the voluntary or unilateral change       in position by the opposing party  The section responds to the       Supreme Courts ruling in       Buckhannon Board and Care Home  Inc  v  West Virginia Dept of       Health and Human Resources  532 U S  598  2001         which eliminated the catalyst theory of attorney fee recovery       under certain Federal civil rights laws  FOIA requestors have       raised concerns that the holding in  Buckhannon could be       extended to FOIA cases  This section preserves the catalyst       theory in FOIA litigation   Adds House       pay go language to require that any attorneys fees be paid from       annually appropriated agency funds       Sec  5        Disciplinary Actions for Arbitrary and Capricious Rejections of       Requests  FOIA currently requires that when a       court finds that agency personnel have acted arbitrarily or       capriciously with respect to withholding documents  the Office       of Special Counsel shall determine whether disciplinary action       against the involved personnel is warranted   See 5 U S C        552 a  4  F   This section of the bill amends FOIA to require       the Attorney General to notify the Office of Special Counsel of       any such court finding and to report the same to Congress  It       further requires the Office of Special Counsel to report       annually to Congress on any actions taken by the Special Counsel       to investigate cases of this type        Sec  6  Time       Limits for Agencies to Act on Requests  The       section clarifies that the 20 day time limit on responding to a       FOIA request commences on the date on which the request is first       received by the appropriate agency component   Further  the section states       that if the agency fails to respond within the 20 day limit  the       agency must refund the FOIA search fees collected in connection       with that FOIA request   Adds House       pay go language to require that any attorneys fees be paid from       annually appropriated agency funds          Sec  7        Individualized Tracking Numbers for Requests and Status       Information  Requires agencies to establish       tracking systems by assigning a tracking number to each FOIA       request  notifying a requestor of the tracking number within ten       days of receiving a request  and establishing a telephone or       Internet tracking system to allow requestors to easily obtain       information on the status of their individual requests        including an estimated date on which the agency will complete       action on the request       Sec  8        Reporting Requirements  This section adds to       current reporting requirements by mandating disclosure of data       on the 10 oldest active requests pending at each agency        including the amount of time elapsed since each request was       originally filed  and requires additional breakdowns depending       on the length of delay  This section further requires agencies       to calculate and report on the average response times and range       of response times of FOIA requests   Current requirements       mandate reporting on the median response time   Finally  this       section requires reports on the number of fee status requests       that are granted and denied and the average number of days for       adjudicating fee status determinations by individual agencies       The       bill does not include the Specific Citations in Exemptions       provision that was set forth in Section 8 of S  849       Sec  9        Openness of Agency Records Maintained by a Private Entity       This section clarifies that agency records       kept by private contractors licensed by the government to       undertake recordkeeping functions remain subject to FOIA just as       if those records were maintained by the relevant government       agency       Sec  10        Office of Government Services  This section       establishes an Office of Government Information Services within       the National Archives and Records Administration  Within that       office will be appointed a FOIA ombudsman to review agency       policies and procedures  audit agency performance  recommend       policy changes  and mediate disputes between FOIA requestors and       agencies  The establishment of an ombudsman will not impact the       ability of requestors to litigate FOIA claims  but rather will       serve to alleviate the need for litigation whenever possible             Sec  11        Report on Personnel Policies Related to FOIA   This section requires the Office of Personnel Management to       examine how FOIA can be better implemented at the agency level        including an assessment of whether FOIA performance should be       considered as a factor in personnel performance reviews  whether       a job classification series specific to FOIA and the Privacy Act       should be considered  and whether FOIA awareness training should       be provided to federal employees
