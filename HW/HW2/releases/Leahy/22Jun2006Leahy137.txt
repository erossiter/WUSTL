       Statement of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On ATT And BellSouth Merger    What Does It Mean For Consumers                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       Hearing On      ATT And BellSouth Merger       What Does It Mean For Consumers       June 22  2006  I thank Chairman DeWine and       Ranking Member Kohl for holding this timely hearing  I was one       of five Senators to vote against the 1996 Telecom Act because of       concerns about the consequences of that bill  Back then  I       argued that the promise of competition between the long distance       and local telephone companies would prove to be a myth  I       argued in that the Act would allow the local regional bells to       reunite easily with unregulated local monopoly powers     Over the last decade  we have seen       massive consolidation in the industry  and here we are again        Just six months ago  two of the biggest local phone companies       acquired two of the biggest long distance companies  Where       will it end   When the ATT monopoly was broken       up  it was divided into 7 Bell Operating Companies  After this       merger  there would be 3  And the proposed merger we are       examining today would establish ATT as the dominant carrier in       22 states    It makes me question whether this       merger will spur on other consolidations  As soon as ATT and       BellSouth announced the merger  one analyst said that  Clearly        Verizon has to go after Quest now  Verizon will have to keep       ATT from getting it    Where will it end   Six years ago  I introduced a bill       to limit mergers among what were then called the RBOCs  the       Regional Bell Operating Companies  I recalled that at my farm       in Middlesex and at my house here  I have only one choice for       local telephone service  I know one thing for sure    this       unending wave of mergers is not helping rural       America get better phone service    When I introduced this bill I was       concerned that the concentration of ownership in the       telecommunications industry was proceeding faster than the       growth of competition  Old monopolies were simply regrouping and       getting bigger and bigger    It was true then and its true now          telephone companies should not be able to gain concentrated       control over huge percentages of the telephone access lines of       this country through mergers  but rather through robust       competition    As President Reagan used to say        Well  here you go again   If Congress  and this Committee       in particular  does not act to protect competition  consumers       will be the ones who suffer by having no choices     Where will a consumer  enraged       that her phone company has given the government records of her       phone calls  turn for an alternative    I am very concerned about the new       ATT policy reported today  in which ATT asserts that private       customer records are ATT property  which could allow ATT to       divulge that information to the highest bidder or just give it       to the Government  I have not seen the actual text of the new       policy  but I will be raising questions today on this matter   In the video services market  the       telecos argue that competition is necessary for innovation and       lowering prices for consumers  When it comes to broadband and       voice services  apparently they do not feel as strongly about       the need to compete   This merger  of course  is about       more than just two of the biggest remaining wireline       communications companies becoming one behemoth     The merger would also put       Cingular  the Nations largest wireless provider  in the hands       of the largest wireline company  So much for competition       between wireless and wireline companies  Where will it end   Cingular is currently operating       independently of ATT and BellSouth  It was a promising       competitor for voice services and was also a potential player in       the broadband access market  Following this proposed merger  it       would merely be part of the largest phone and broadband       provider    When SBC and ATT merged  ATT       agreed to a number of important  but temporary conditions        including offering voice and Internet services unbundled and       providing open access to the Internet    These conditions and commitments       only remain in effect for another 18 months  What happens       then    ATT has made clear its       intentions  Mr  Whitacre has infamously said that hes going to       charge online businesses  discriminating among services     This Committee must be vigilant to       protect the Internet from anticompetitive behavior     The Internet has opened windows on       the world in one room schoolhouses in Vermont  and       the Internet has opened new doors of knowledge and opportunity       to children from Africa to Indonesia  It is the ultimate       marketplace of ideas  where a better idea  a better service or a       better application can succeed on its merits  The Internet must       remain free and open   I am pleased that the CEOs of ATT       and BellSouth are here today to answer our questions and explain       how the merger of their two companies will benefit the public         We had expected to hold a hearing       with executives from ATT  BellSouth and other companies earlier       this month regarding their companies involvement in the       domestic surveillance activities conducted by the NSA without       court approval    I hope we still have that       hearing  I will ask some questions on those issues today  I       had my staff warn both companies that I intended to ask such       questions  This Committee  this Congress and the American people       have a right to know if their Government is brazenly ignoring       laws passed by Congress  and consumers deserve to know how       companies are using their information
