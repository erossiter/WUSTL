       Leahy  President Strikes Again In PATRIOT Act Bill Signing Statement                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                  Leahy              President Strikes Again In PATRIOT Act             Bill Signing Statement             Suggests He ll Pick And Choose Which             Parts Of Law To Follow                 Continuing A Disturbing Trend             President Again Cites  Unitary             Executive  Theory            In Picking Provisions Of PATRIOT Law He             Intends To Ignore              WASHINGTON  Wednesday  March 15               Senator Patrick Leahy  D Vt    the             ranking Democratic member of the             Judiciary Committee  raised concerns             Wednesday about President Bushs latest             attempt to use his bill signing             statements to select which provisions of             law he will follow and which he will             ignore                Leahy  who co authored the 2001 USA             PATRIOT Act  noted in remarks during the             Senate Judiciary Committees business             meeting Wednesday that the President             invoked the unitary executive theory             in his bill signing statement on the USA             PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization             Act of 2005 to suggest that he would             ignore provisions in the law that             require the Administration to submit to             audits and reports to Congress                 Leahy noted that this is not the first             time President Bush has used these bill             signing statements to add his own spin             to the interpretation of laws passed by             Congress  In a statement last year on             anti torture legislation passed by             Congress  the President invoked the             unitary executive theory to             selectively decide which provisions of             the anti torture law he would follow                           Leahy noted that it is not a unitary             executive theory but a unilateral             executive approach that violates the             Presidents constitutional             responsibility to see that all the laws             are faithfully executed                Below is Senator Leahys statement from             Wednesdays markup                            Opening             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy            Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee            On USA Patriot Improvement And             Reauthorization Act Of 2005            Executive Business Meeting            March 15  2006              Last week  the USA PATRIOT Improvement             and Reauthorization Act of 2005 was             signed into law  I was one of ten             Senators who voted against this             legislation  As a co author of the             original PATRIOT Act  and as someone who             supported reauthorizing an improved             version of the Act  this was a difficult             vote  The legislation enacted last week             contains several sunshine provisions             that I proposed to facilitate oversight             and ensure some measure of public             accountability for how the Government             uses its powers  Regrettably  other             provisions fell short of what the             American people expected and deserved               I would have liked to have voted for the             provisions that I felt improved the law              and against the provisions that give the             government too much power with too             little accountability  But that is not             the way the legislative process works              When it is time to vote  we have to vote             the whole bill up or down  So  with             some regret  I voted against the             defective reauthorization legislation               As I said in a floor statement on March             2  the defects in the reauthorization             legislation are particularly dangerous             because we currently have an             Administration that does not believe in             checks and balances and prefers to do             everything in secret  We know that the             Bush Cheney Administration has engaged             in secret  warrantless wiretapping of             Americans emails and telephone calls             contrary to the FISA law  we know that             it attempted to rush the Dubai Ports             deal through in secret  without             following legally required review             procedures  and we have reason to             suspect that it has secretly engaged in             extraordinary rendition and created             conditions for torture of prisoners              again contrary to law                I also remarked on the Presidents             claims that he need not fulfill his             constitutional responsibility to             faithfully execute the laws but can pick             and choose among the laws he decides to             recognize  Confronted with claims of             inherent and unchecked powers  I             concluded  the restraints we were able             to include in this reauthorization of             the PATRIOT Act were not sufficient                           It took no time at all for the             Administration to prove me right  In             the very act of signing the             reauthorization bill into law  the             President signaled that he intends to             follow that law only insofar as it suits             him  and to ignore its minimal             requirements of public accountability              Sections 106A and 119 of the Act             requires the Justice Departments Office             of the Inspector General to perform             comprehensive audits of the             effectiveness and use  including any             improper or illegal use  of two             investigative authorities provided to             the government by the original PATRIOT             Act  These audits must be presented in             unclassified form  although a classified             annex may be included  and must be             submitted to the Judiciary Committees of             the House and the Senate as well as the             Intelligence Committees               Sections 106A and 119 have been a part             of this reauthorization legislation             since last November  when the first             version of the House Senate conference             report circulated  During the months of             negotiation that followed  they remained             unchanged  Never  during all that time              did the Administration raise any             objection to these provisions  To the             contrary  it called on Congress to pass             the conference report without changes              and attacked the bipartisan group of             Senators who held out for further             improvements               But when the compromise crafted by             Congress reached the Presidents desk              there was an ambush waiting  In his             signing statement  the President             declared that he would construe sections             106A and 119 in a manner consistent with             his authority to supervise the unitary             executive branch  That means  he said              that his Administration would withhold             infor  mation the disclosure of which             could impair foreign relations  national             security  the deliberative processes of             the Executive  or the performance of the             Executive s constitutional duties  At             the same time  the President also             brushed off section 756 e  2   which             requires the Attorney General to submit             to the Congress recommendations for             further legislation  by saying that the             Administration will do so only when the             President judges it necessary and             expedient to do so               In other words  contrary to the express             requirements of the law he himself was             signing into effect  the President             declared that he will withhold             information from Congress and the             American people whenever he unilaterally             declares that disclosure could impair             the deliberative processes or             performance of any part of the federal             government  and that he will deign to             talk to the Peoples representatives in             Congress only when he sees fit  This is             the perfect expression of what Senator             Feingold has so aptly called the             Administrations pre 1776 mentality               The Presidents signing statement poses             two profound threats to our             constitutional system of checks and             balances  First  his unorthodox but             repeatedly invoked unitary executive             theory is really a unilateral executive             theory  This President appears to             believe that he can pick and choose             which laws to obey and need never submit             to congressional oversight  As we             learned in an earlier signing statement              the President believes that the law             against torture that he signed does not             entirely bind him  And as we were             reminded by Attorney General Gonzaless             recent stonewalling on the             Administrations domestic spying             program  the Administrations approach             to congressional oversight is that it             will tell Congress only what it chooses             to tell Congress  and will refuse to             divulge the evolution of its             activities and legal theories               Second  this President appears to hold a             strange and novel view of the             appropriate role of the President in the             legislative process  The Constitution             provides that legislation shall be             presented by Congress to the President              who shall then either sign it into law             or veto it  In other words  to borrow a             familiar phrase  he must vote it up or             down in its entirety  just as we do in             Congress  If he vetoes it  a two thirds             majority in both Houses can override his             veto               Despite various threats on stem cells             and Dubai Ports  for example  and             despite having signed profoundly             irresponsible fiscal and other             legislation that should never have been             enacted  this President has not vetoed a             single bill in 5 years  Instead  he has             repeatedly waited until legislation is             final to issue signing statements that             purport to pick and choose  usually on             unitary executive grounds  which             provisions he will deem himself bound             by                These signing statements are a clever             device if Congress will let him get away             with them  As he did with the torture             legislation  the President can publicly             take credit for signing popular             legislation while in fact fighting it             all the way and refusing to commit to             abide by it  At the same time  he can             sidestep a veto override  Instead of             engaging constructively with Congress in             the process of drafting and negotiating             legislation  he can duck the             responsibility of voting it up or down             and ambush the congressional compromise             after the fact               This Administrations unitary             executive doctrine and the signing             statements that articulate it are             nothing short of a radical effort to             re shape the constitutional separation             of powers and evade accountability and             responsibility for following the law              We in Congress have a constitutional             duty to prevent this  The Presidents             signing statements are not the law  and             we should not allow them to be the last             word  The Presidents constitutional             duty is to faithfully execute the laws             as written by the Congress  It is our             duty to ensure  by means of             congressional oversight  that he does             so               In connection with the legislation we             are now considering I have also recently             written the Attorney General asking what             the Bush Cheney Administrations             theories of executive power mean in             connection with our immigration laws  I             ask that a copy of that letter be made             part of the record  I have not received             a timely reply for purposes of this             Committees consideration of this             legislation
