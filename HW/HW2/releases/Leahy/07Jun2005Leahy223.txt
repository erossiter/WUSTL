       Senator Patrick Leahy  Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee  On Judicial   Nominations And Consultation                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     On Judicial Nominations And Consultation     Senate Floor Speech     June 7  2005       Recently 14 of our colleagues brought to us a bipartisan plan to      avoid the Majority leaders short sighted bid for one party rule       As part of that plan to avert the nuclear option  which would have      changed more 200 years of Senate tradition  precedent and rules      protecting minority rights  those Senators have agreed to vote for      cloture on this controversial and divisive renomination  I have no      doubt that they will follow through on their commitment  but it will      in all likelihood result in the appointment for life of a judge for      the Court of Appeals for the D C  Circuit whose disturbing view of      the Constitution would set back life for American workers and      consumers more than 100 years  and remove protections for people and      their communities we now take for granted   The preservation of our system of      checks and balances in connection with the appointment of lifetime      members of the federal judiciary requires that all Senators  both      Republicans and Democrats  take seriously the Senates      constitutionally mandated role as a partner in making these      determinations  Accordingly  I urge all Senators  Republicans and      Democrats  to take these matters seriously and vote their      conscience  Senators need to evaluate  with clear eyes  the      fitness of Justice Brown for this lifetime judicial appointment      before casting a difficult vote on this problematic nominee  My      opposition to Justice Browns nomination is based  as it has always      been  on her long and troubling record    The Senate has already considered one      of the three controversial nominees mentioned in Part  I  A  of the Memorandum      of Understanding our colleagues brought us  We are now beginning      consideration of the second  and I expect the third will follow      shortly  What I do not expect is any repeat by Democrats of the      extraordinary obstruction by Republicans of President Clintons      judicial nominees  For example  I do not expect any of the tactics      used by Republicans during the extensive delay in Senate      consideration of the Richard Paez nomination  Judge Paez waited      more than four years before we were able to get a vote on his      confirmation  and even then  Republicans mounted an extraordinary      motion after the filibuster of his nomination was broken to      indefinitely postpone the vote  a last ditch  unprecedented effort      that was ultimately unsuccessful    More than 60 of President Clintons      moderate and qualified judicial nominations were subjected to the      Republican pocket filibuster  Several of those pocket filibusters      were applied to outstanding nominees to the D C  Circuit  Allen      Snyder was a former clerk to Chief Justice Rehnquist and a      widely respected and highly regarded partner at the law firm of      Hogan  Hartson  Elena Kagan is now the Dean of the  Harvard Law School       They were each nominated to vacancies on the D C  Circuit and      neither received a Committee vote or Senate consideration by Senate      Republicans    The bipartisan coalition of Senators      who joined together last month to avert an unnecessary showdown in      the Senate over the White House inspired effort to invoke the      nuclear option was right to include in the agreement  the following      provision        We believe that  under Article II  Section 2  of the United States      Constitution  the word Advice speaks to consultation between the      Senate and the President with regard to the use of the Presidents      power to make nominations  We encourage the Executive branch of      government to consult with members of the Senate  both Democratic      and Republican  prior to submitting a judicial nomination to the      Senate for consideration         Such a return to the early practices of our government may well      serve to reduce the rancor that unfortunately accompanies the advice      and consent process in the Senate        We firmly believe this agreement is consistent with the traditions      of the United States Senate that we as Senators seek to uphold   I agree with their fundamental      point  I agree with their fundamental point  And it is a salient      point given the circumstances in which we consider this nominee      today  There was no meaningful consultation in connection with the      nomination of  Janice Rogers Brown  Neither of her      home state Senators supports her  There was no consultation with      them  or with the Senate Democratic leadership  The bipartisan      group of Senators is right in urging greater consultation on all of      these important judicial nominations   In that regard  I was pleased to see      the President respond to a question at a news conference last week      by agreeing to consult with the Senate about his nomination should a      vacancy arise on the Supreme Court  I see that as fruit of this      bipartisan process  as well  and a positive development     In the next few weeks      the United States Supreme Court will complete its current term       Speculation will soon accelerate  again  about the potential for a      Supreme Court vacancy this summer  In advance of any such vacancy       I urge the President to follow through on his commitment to consult      with Senate  Previous Presidents of both parties have set      constructive and successful examples by engaging in meaningful      consultation with the Senate  including those in the minority as      well as the majority  before deciding on nominees  It would be      short sighted to ignore such an established and successful      precedent    I stand ready to work with the      President to help select a nominee to the Supreme Court who can      unite Americans  I would welcome such a change from the Presidents      record in his first term  I know that the Democratic leader is      likewise ready to be helpful  After all  Senator Reid and I joined      in an April 11 letter to the President offering our help in      facilitating his identification  selection and nomination of lower      court judges to the 28 vacancies without a nominee that then existed      throughout the federal judiciary  Regrettably  the President did      not respond to our previous offer and the vacancies without a      nominee have since grown to 31    Some Presidents  including most      recently President Clinton  found consultation with the Senate in      advance of a nomination most beneficial in helping pave the way for      a smooth and successful process  President Reagan  on the other      hand  disregarded the advice offered by Senate Democratic leaders      and chose a controversial  divisive nominee who was ultimately      rejected by the full Senate    In his book  Square Peg  Senator      Hatch tells how in 1993  as the Ranking Minority Member of the      Senate Judiciary Committee  he advised President Clinton about      possible Supreme Court nominees  In his book  Senator Hatch      recounts that he warned President Clinton away from a nominee whose      confirmation he believed would not be easy  Senator Hatch goes on      to describe how he suggested the names of Stephen Breyer and Ruth      Bader Ginsburg  both of whom were eventually nominated and confirmed      with relative ease  Indeed  96 Senators voted in favor of Justice      Ginsburgs confirmation  and only three Senators voted against       Justice Breyer received 87 affirmative votes  and only nine Senators      voted against     In its report on the Supreme Court       Appointment Process the Congressional Research Service of the       Library of Congress has long noted  It is common practice for       Presidents  as a matter of courtesy  to consult with Senate       party leaders as well as with members of the Senate Judiciary       Committee before choosing a nominee  What I am suggesting has       been standard and accepted practice    Thorough bipartisan consultation       would not only make the choice a better one  it would also       reassure the Senate and the American people that the process of       selecting a Supreme Court justice has not become politicized        The Supreme Court often serves as the final arbiter and       protector of our individual rights and freedoms  Decisions       regarding nominees are too important to all Americans to be       unnecessarily embroiled in partisan politics    Though the landscape ahead is sown       with the potential for controversy and contention over vacancies       that may arise on the Supreme Court  confrontation is       unnecessary and consensus should be our goal  I would hope that       the Presidents objective will not be to send the Senate       nominees so polarizing that their confirmations are eked out in       narrow margins  This would come at a steep and gratuitous price       that the entire nation would have to pay in needless division        It would serve the country better to choose a qualified       consensus candidate who can be broadly supported by the public       and by the Senate    The process begins with the       President  He is the only participant in the process who can       nominate candidates to fill Supreme Court vacancies  If there       is a vacancy  the decisions made in the White House will       determine whether the nominee chosen will unite the nation or       will divide the nation  The power to avoid political warfare       with regard to the Supreme Court is in the hands of the       President  No one in the Senate is spoiling for a fight  Only       one person will decide whether this will be a divisive or       unifying process and nomination  If consensus is a goal        bipartisan consultation will help achieve it  I believe that is       what the American people want and what they deserve     Over the last several years I have       stressed the need for consultation and moderation as two guiding       principles for selecting judicial nominees  I have been largely       disappointed up to this point  but if there is a vacancy on the       Supreme Court of the United States  I hope that the President       will live up to his pledge to consult with Senators of both       parties to identify consensus nominees who will unite us instead       of divide us  There is no need to pit Republicans against       Democrats or to divide the American people    This is a difficult time for our       country and we face many challenges  Providing adequate health       care for all Americans  improving the economic prospects of       Americans  defending against threats  the proliferation of       nuclear weapons  the continuing upheaval and American military       presence in  Iraq  are all fundamental matters       on which we need to improve  It is my hope that we can work       together on many issues important to the American people        including our maintaining a fair and independent judiciary  I       am confident that a smooth nomination and confirmation process       can be developed on a bipartisan basis if we work together  The       American people we represent and serve are entitled to no less   The decisions of the Supreme Court       have a lasting effect on the meaning of the Constitution and       statutes intended by Congress to protect the rights of all       Americans  such as the right to equal protection of the laws and       the right to privacy  as well as the best opportunity to have       clean air and clean water ourselves and in future generations        This is the forum where federal regulations protecting workers       rights will be upheld or overturned  where reproductive rights       will be retained or lost and where intrusive government action       will be allowed or curtailed  This is the Court to which       thousands of individuals will appeal in matters affecting their       health  their lives  their liberty  and their financial well       being     If the President chooses a Supreme       Court nominee because of that nominees ideology or record of       activism in the hopes that he or she will deliver predetermined       political victories  the President will have done so with full       knowledge that he is starting a confirmation confrontation  The       Supreme Court should not be an arm of the Republican Party  nor       should it be a wing of the Democratic Party  If the right wing       activists who were disappointed that the nuclear option was       averted convince the President to choose a divisive nominee in       order to tilt the ideological balance on the Supreme Court  they       will not prevail without a difficult Senate battle  And if they       do  what will they have wrought  While they would celebrate the       ideological takeover of the Supreme Court  the American people       will be the losers  The legitimacy of the judiciary will have       suffered a damaging blow from which it may not soon recover        Such a contest would itself confirm that the Supreme Court is       just another setting for partisan contests and partisan       outcomes  People will perceive the federal courts as places in       which the fix is in     Our Constitution establishes an       independent federal judiciary to be a bulwark of individual       liberty against incursions or expansions of power by the       political branches  The independence of our federal courts has       been called by Chief Justice Rehnquist the crown jewel of our       justice system  but that independence is at grave risk when a       president seeks to pack the courts with activists from either       side of the political spectrum  One of the most serious       mistakes a president can make is the partisan engineering to       take over the Supreme Court  Even if successful  such an effort       would lead to decision making based on politics and forever       diminish public confidence in our justice system    I urge  respectfully that the       President in advance of any nomination consult with Senators       from both parties and seek consensus  The American people will       cheer if the President chooses someone who unifies the nation        This is not the time and a vacancy on this Supreme Court is not       the setting in which to accentuate the political and ideological       division within our country  In our lifetimes  there has never       been a greater need for a unifying pick for the Supreme Court        The independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our       American concept of justice for all  We should expect and       accept nothing less  We all want Justices who exhibit the kind       of fidelity to the law that we all respect  We want them to       have a strong commitment to our shared constitutional values of       individual liberties and equal protection  We expect them to       have had a demonstrated record of commitment to equal rights        There are many conservatives who can meet these criteria and who       are not rigid ideologues    Two years ago  I was invited to       address the National Press Club on this topic and noted       that the Supreme Court       confirmation process does not have to be a political       Armageddon  I continue to believe that and I urge the President       to take the course that would better serve the American people       and the Supreme Court  I was encouraged by the Presidents       recent statement indicating he will consult with leaders in the       Senate on both sides of the aisle in advance of a nomination        That should allow him to bring forward a consensus nominee able       to unite all Americans and who could be confirmed by the Senate       with 95 to 100 votes  At a time when too many partisans seem       fixated on devising strategies to force the Senate to confirm       the most extreme candidate with the least number of votes       possible  I have been urging cooperation and consultation to       bring the country together  There is no more important       opportunity than this to lead the nation in a direction of       cooperation and unity  I hope this president heeds the lesson       of history set by his predecessors who chose the good of the       country over the good of a political party
