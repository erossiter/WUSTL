       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy In Opposition To The Isakson Amendment   And In Support Of The Salazar Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick  Leahy  In Opposition To The Isakson       Amendment  SA 3961       And In Support Of The Salazar Amendment  SA 3994  to S 2611      May 16  2006  The Isakson Amendment is designed       to tear apart the interwoven fabric of a bill that many of us       have worked so hard in a bipartisan manner to pass in the       Senate    The Isakson Amendment asserts that       there can be no guest worker program and no legalization path       for undocumented immigrants currently in the  United States until security at       the borders is guaranteed  Sounds good  until you realize that       comprehensive immigration reform consists of several       interrelated steps  each depending on the rest in order to       maximize the prospects of the overall plan to get the job done        This amendment is a prescription for failure  by ripping a       comprehensive plan apart  That is why this amendment has been       described as a poison pill that would undermine the bipartisan       bill before the Senate   The Senate recently passed the       defense supplemental appropriations bill  a bill that included       nearly two billion dollars for border security  It seems that       what Senator Isakson wants the Senate to do is to wait until all       of those funds are expended  and then assess our security  Many       of us have been fighting for years to improve border security by       targeting more resources for technology on the borders and by       adding additional Border Patrol agents  The Bush Administration       repeatedly failed to fulfill Congresss directives in recent       years  but I was pleased to hear the President say last night       that he now supports increasing the number of Border Patrol       agents by 6 000  He made a statement last night that was       stronger and displayed a stronger commitment than we have heard       from him previously  and I hope he plans to follow through on       his words    The President also spoke about the       need to simultaneously implement guest worker programs and a       path to earned citizenship for the undocumented  This is       similar to the comprehensive approach that those of us who       supported the Judiciary Committee bill  and then the       Hagel Martinez compromise  still believe is necessary to reform       our broken system and to secure our borders  Do Senator Isakson       and the supporters of his amendment believe that the President       is taking the Nation in the wrong direction  I find it       troubling that with such strong bipartisan support for S 2611 in       the Senate  and the leadership of the White House on the core       principles of the bill  these Senators refuse to join in       constructive efforts to enact comprehensive reform  From the       beginning  many voices outside of the Senate have been intent on       bringing down this bill    Senator Salazar has offered an       alternative that supports the principles of S 2611 and that       reflects the goals laid out by the President in his statement       last night  I urge all members of the Senate to vote against       the Isakson Amendment and for the Salazar alternative  We must       work toward comprehensive solutions that secure our borders and       strengthen the Nation  not piecemeal gambits that undermine the       efforts of bipartisan progress toward a Senate bill
