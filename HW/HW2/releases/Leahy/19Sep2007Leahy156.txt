       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The  Material Support  Bar  Denying   Refuge To The Persecuted                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt       The Material Support Bar  Denying Refuge To The Persecuted     Senate Judiciary Committee    Subcommittee On Human Rights And The Law    September 19  2007    I am very pleased that the Judiciary Committees     Subcommittee on Human Rights and the Law is holding todays hearing  I     thank Senator Durbin for chairing it and our witnesses for appearing  The injustices caused by the expansion of the     material support bar to the admission to the United States deserve our     continuing attention  The material support bar is an issue that     involves the conscience of our Nation  and the role and reputation of     the United States as a leader in respecting human rights   Fortunately  the unintended yet tragic results of     this law and its implementation to date have not gone unnoticed  Human     rights advocates  scholars  and many nongovernmental organizations      liberal and conservative  have spoken out forcefully against this law     and have been working diligently to change it  No fewer than 10     editorials decrying the law have appeared in our countrys major     newspapers   I have said on many occasions that we need to bring     our laws back into alignment with our values  The revisions to the     material support provisions that were included in the Patriot Act and     the Real ID Act undermine our Nations commitment to human rights  They     represent a reactionary  blunt instrument approach to a complex issue      I am afraid that  as with so many other actions taken by this     Administration  fear has overcome common sense and our collective     conscience   We all recognize that today we face new threats     around the world  No government official wants to be responsible for     allowing someone into the United States who would do us harm  But the     current material support bar and its implementation lack the refinement     necessary to respect both our national security needs and our role as a     sanctuary for the oppressed and persecuted   This law and the strident opposition by some     against its sensible reform reflect a profound lack of confidence in the     ability of our government officials to distinguish those who would harm     us from those who need our help   Surely the young Colombian refugee forced to dig     graves for the victims of Colombian paramilitary soldiers cannot be     rationally said to have provided material support to his persecutors      Yet he was denied asylum   Nor can the Liberian woman who was raped and     abducted by rebels before being forced to cook and do laundry for them     be said to have provided material support in the manner the law     intended  But she was denied asylum  as well   There are numerous stories of such injustices  and     others involving former child soldiers and members of groups who fought     alongside the United States in Southeast Asia and elsewhere  I know     Senators Durbin  Coburn and Brownback have a particular concern about     child soldiers  as I do  We need to be sure that our law fully     addresses that concern  We will never succeed in stopping terrorists by     punishing our friends or the victims of terrorists   The perverse results of the material support bar     are but one example of several humanitarian crises that have been left     unattended by this Administration   The internal displacement of millions of Iraqi     citizens  and the flight of millions more to neighboring countries has     gone largely unaddressed  The Judiciary Committee held a hearing on     this matter as one of our first this year because the Administration had     ignored it  Still the Administration refuses to treat it like the     humanitarian catastrophe it has become   The Administration has also been painfully slow to     provide assistance to the many Iraqis who have risked their lives to     support the United States  In so many facets of the Iraq war effort      Iraqi citizens have bravely stepped forward to assist as translators and     in other ways  Instead of reciprocating by assisting these Iraqis to     relocate to the United States when their lives are threatened  the     Administration has made excuses  President Bush pledged to admit 7 000     Iraqis into the United States by the end of September  Like so many of     the Administrations promises  this too has gone largely unfulfilled      Still  I am hopeful that we can make progress  I     am encouraged that the Senate recently took an important first step in     the 2008 State  Foreign Operations Appropriations bill to restore some     sensibility to the issue of material support  This is a good start  and     I appreciate Senator Kyls staff working with mine to reach this     compromise   I look forward to seeing how the Administration     implements these changes once enacted  In the same bill I also included     a provision directing the State Department to establish a processing     center within Iraq to handle immigration applications  This should spur     the Administration to take action and accomplish what it has promised to     the many Iraqis who seek to escape the violence and persecution in their     country   I  once again  thank Senator Durbin for focusing     the attention of the Committee and the Senate on these matters  If we     work together  we can fix the law in a manner that protects the security     of the American people consistent with our values
