       Vermont Civil Liberties Leader Warns Leahy Panel Of Drawbacks Of REAL ID   Act On States  Citizens                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Vermont     Civil Liberties Leader Warns Leahy Panel      Of Drawbacks Of REAL ID Act On States  Citizens   Law     Mandating National ID Card System     Imposes Significant Unfunded Burdens On States  Raises Privacy Concerns  WASHINGTON  Tuesday  May 8   One of     Vermonts foremost civil liberties leaders warned the Senate Judiciary     Committee Tuesday of the broad privacy and fiscal implications of the     REAL ID Act of 2005 on individual citizens and states across the     country    Allen Gilbert  the executive director of     the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont  testified before Chairman     Patrick Leahys  D Vt   committee hearing  Will REAL ID Actually Make     Us Safer  An Examination of Privacy and Civil Liberties Concerns      Gilbert  a prominent advocate of civil liberties  has been a leading     voice in the state about REAL IDs impact on Vermont and Vermonters way     of life    People in Vermont have     a lot of unanswered questions about REAL ID  Seldom have I encountered     an issue that raises concerns among such a wide range of people  I can     talk with a legislator about REAL ID  and shell point out that the     National Conference of State Legislatures expresses misgivings about the     program  I can talk with a member of the National Gun Owners  and hell     worry about government intrusion  Gilbert told Leahys panel on     Tuesday    The cost  the     implementation  the risk of identity theft  these things worry     Vermonters  Vermonters are not convinced that REAL ID is a program that     will make Americans safer  It is a caution that I hope Congress will     heed Gilbert added    Gilbert testified as part of a panel of     leading civil liberties and security experts  including Jim Harper      Director of Information Policy Studies at the CATO Institute  Dr  James     Carafano  Assistant Director of the Kathryn and Shelby Collum Davis     Institute for International Studies at the Heritage Foundation  Bruce     Schneier  Founder and Chief Technology Officer of BT Counterpane  and     Janice Kephart  President of 9 11 Security Solutions  LLC   The REAL ID Act has generated significant     controversy across the country because of the implications it holds for     states that are forced to implement the unfunded mandate in the law that     effectively creates a national identification card system through the     licensing of residents to operate motor vehicles  Some estimates     suggest the law could cost more than  23 billion    Many States  including Vermont  have     expressed their concern about the mandates of the REAL ID Act by     enacting resolutions in opposition  Leahy said at the hearing  All     Americans recognize the critical importance of national security  But     for national security measures to be effective  they have to be smart as     well as tough  Forcing our states to bend to the federal will in this     area may not be as effective a strategy as engaging in a cooperative     process intended to serve a common goal    Leahy has cosponsored legislation that     would repeal the drivers license provisions of the REAL ID Act      replacing those provisions with negotiated rulemaking between the states     and the federal government to create minimum standards to improve the     security of state issued drivers licenses        Statement     Of Senator Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee     Will REAL ID Actually Make Us Safer      An Examination of Privacy And Civil Liberties Concerns    Tuesday  May 8  2007  Today the Committee turns its attention to     an issue of great concern to many States  and to Americans who value     their privacy in the face of the Federal governments expanding role in     their daily lives  I thank our witnesses for being here today  I am     especially pleased to welcome Allen Gilbert from Vermont     I look forward to gaining a better     understanding of the impact of the so called REAL ID Act  an assessment     that Congress should have done before this bill was passed  As     we approach the second anniversary of its enactment  it is time for the     Congress to come to grips with this significant policy     The REAL ID Act was legislation forced     through by the Republican Congress as an add on to the emergency     supplemental bill passed in May 2005  I do not recall hearing objection     to this sweeping substantive legislation being jammed into an emergency     supplemental from those who this year were so critical of the important     aspects of the U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans  Care  Katrina Recovery      and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act  This bill would have     provided for veterans care and Katrina relief and other needs in the     emergency supplemental legislation that Congress passed but the     President vetoed last week    The REAL ID Act was attached to a     must pass appropriations bill without Senate hearings or debate  Yet     the implications of the Act are enormous  The Federal government will     be dictating how the States go about the business of licensing residents     to operate motor vehicle  State motor vehicle officials will be     required to verify the legal status of applicants  adding to the     responsibilities of already heavily burdened State offices  While the     Federal government dictates responsibilities for what has traditionally     been a State function  and adding layers of bureaucracy and regulation     to effectively create a national identification card  there is no help     in footing these hefty bills  Thus  in addition to privacy and civil     liberties concerns  this Act is an unfunded mandate that could cost the     States in excess of  23 billion  The REAL ID Act imposes costs and     Federal responsibilities on State officers    Many States  including Vermont  have     expressed their concern about the mandates of the REAL ID Act by     enacting resolutions in opposition  Maine and Montana have gone so far     as to indicate that they intend to refuse compliance with it  The     National Conference of State Legislatures and the National Governors     Association have expressed concerns about the costs imposed on the     States  Opposition spans the political spectrum  from the right to the     left    The     Wall Street Journal noted in an editorial that Real Id was     always more about harassing Mexican illegals than stopping Islamic     terrorists and continued to explain how in an effort to placate noisy     anti immigration conservatives amid the GOPs poll driven election     panic  the Republican House in the last Congress attached this REAL ID     bill onto a must pass military spending bill without hearings or much     debate  and Mr  Bush made the mistake of signing it  That is from the    Wall Street Journal       Given my own concerns  I have joined with     Senators Akaka  Sununu  and Tester to introduce a bill that would repeal     the drivers license provisions of the REAL ID Act  and replace those     provisions with the negotiated rulemaking provisions of the Intelligence     Reform Act of 2004  Senator Collins introduced a similar bill to direct     the Secretary of Homeland Security to reconstitute the rulemaking     committee established by the 9 11 Commission Implementation Act  a bill     that she managed through Senate consideration when she chaired the     Homeland Security Committee    In 2004  Congress passed the Intelligence     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and set up a process of negotiated     rulemaking between the States and the Federal government to create     minimum standards to improve the security of State issued drivers     licenses  This process provided for the States to play an active and     equal role in developing greater security measures  and to ensure that     privacy concerns were addressed  This process was underway at the time     the REAL ID Act passed and halted progress  Those negotiations would     likely have been completed and we would already have stronger     requirements for identification documents by now had the REAL ID Act not     been forced through    All Americans recognize the critical     importance of national security  But for national security measures to     be effective  they have to be smart as well as tough  Forcing our     States to bend to the Federal will in this area may not be as effective     a strategy as engaging in a cooperative process intended to serve a     common goal  The reaction to the unfunded mandates of the REAL ID Act     is a pretty good example of what happens when the Federal government     imposes itself rather than working to create cooperation and     partnership    There are also civil liberties concerns     involving this hasty Act  Americans deeply value their privacy      Americans have traditionally recognized the danger of an overreaching     government  When Americans put their trust in the Federal government to     exercise the immense powers conferred by the PATRIOT Act  only to see     that trust terribly abused  it shakes the confidence of all Americans in     a government sworn to uphold the Constitution and the rule of law    I note  too  that today is the day that     comments on the proposed REAL ID regulations are due to the Department     of Homeland Security  In addition to the numerous stakeholders that I     understand have made substantial comments  I hope that the DHS will pay     close attention to the sentiments expressed by members of this Committee     and by the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee  which     held an oversight hearing on REAL ID in March  The days of Congress     rubberstamping any and every idea cooked up by this Administration are     over  We need to see real solutions with demonstrable results before we     just throw away billions of dollars  or more accurately push those     costs onto the States  in the name of some vague claims of enhanced     security    I look forward to hearing from our     witnesses so the Committee can better understand the implications for     individual privacy rights and national security of this law                         Testimony Of Allen Gilbert     Executive Director     American Civil Liberties Union Of Vermont     On The Topic Of        Will REAL ID Actually Make Us Safer      An Examination Of Privacy And Civil Liberties Concerns     U S      Senate Committee on the Judiciary       May 8  2007  10 a m      Dirksen     Senate Office Building  Room 226   My name is Allen     Gilbert  I live in Worcester  Vermont  Ive been a journalist  a     teacher  and I ran a small business for 15 years  Im currently the     executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Vermont       Thank you  Chairman     Leahy  and Committee Members for this invitation to testify     People in Vermont have     a lot of unanswered questions about Real ID  Seldom have I encountered     an issue that raises concerns among such a wide range of people  I can     talk with a legislator about Real ID  and shell point out that the     National Conference of State Legislatures expresses misgivings about the     program  I can talk with a member of the National Gun Owners  and hell     worry about government intrusion    A member of an advocacy     group for victims of domestic and sexual violence worries that Real ID     threatens protection programs for women and children  The Ancient Order     of Hibernians doesnt like Real ID  and neither does the American     Friends Service Committee    Earlier this year  the     Government Operations Committee of the Vermont House of Representatives     passed  unanimously  a resolution opposing Real ID  The resolution was     subsequently approved  also unanimously  by the full House  The     longest serving member in the Vermont House sits on the Government     Operations committee  Rep  Cola Hudson was born when a fellow Vermont     Republican  Calvin Coolidge  was president  Rep  Hudson just shook his     head no when Real ID was described    Our Motor Vehicles     commissioner testified in another committee about the re enrollment     process required by Real ID  Everyone will have to visit a DMV office     with proper documents  For some people in Vermont  that means a long     trip  And when they get to the DMV office  our commissioner said  The     jokes about waiting in line at DMV are no longer going to be jokes but     reality    Long time residents     will feel like suspects when theyre required to report and show their     papers  Our commissioner noted that her father is 82 years old  Hes had     a drivers license for years  Its going to be hard to tell him  she     said  that he has to prove his identity before he can get his license     renewed  People in Vermont pride themselves on being part of tightly     knit communities  Questioning who someone is  is seen as a sign of     unfriendliness    Birth records are kept     by town clerks in Vermont  The clerks  some of whom work part time        are already in a frenzy over the thought of complying with the myriad     requests for records that theyll get because of Real ID     A state senator who in     his other life runs a construction company and races stock cars  said      Im not sure if its the budgetary concern or the privacy concern or     the nightmare its going to create that concerns me most about this       A series of data     breaches this winter in Vermont led people to wonder about the security     of stored data anywhere  DMV officials acknowledge that there are     hundreds of unauthorized attempts daily to get at the departments     information database    Increasingly      Vermonters are worried that too much data is being collected about too     many things  Its not just a sense that privacy is eroding  Vermonters     are worried that their identities will be stolen by identity thieves       Vermonters are pretty     responsible people  They generally step up to the plate when asked to do     the right thing  But many people arent so sure that Real ID is the     right thing  It seems too big  too expensive  and too centralized  Real     ID has hit a nerve with people    Mr  Bruce Schneier will     testify later this morning  Ive heard him lecture  and one thing that     hes said has really stuck with me  He has said that security is an     equation  with one side being what youre giving up and the other side     what youre getting in return  Im afraid that with Real ID  were     giving up too much and not getting much  if anything  in return     Real ID is also going     to cost the states a lot of money  The cost in Vermont is now estimated     at around  8 million  That is a substantial expenditure for us  Some of     our state senators want to raise license fees and call the increase a     congressional Real ID tax    The cost  the     implementation  the risk of identity theft  these things worry     Vermonters  Vermonters are not convinced that Real ID is a program that     will make Americans safer  It is a caution that I hope Congress will     heed    People are saying that     we need minimum licensing standards  and we agree  That s why the ACLU     participated in the negotiated rulemaking created by the Intelligence     Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  If Rep  Sensenbrenner     hadn t interfered  we would have had those standards by September 2005     and they would have been created in a cooperative fashion  But  what     Janice Kephardt and Jim Carafano are proposing is to push forward with a     system that the states are rejecting en masse and that    because of its     impracticality  extraordinary costs  and constitutional infirmities        will be delayed years and years  if its ever built at all     Theres a better way      On behalf of the ACLU  its 53 affiliates and hundreds of thousands of     members nationwide  I urge you to mark up and move S  717  the     Akaka Sununu Leahy Tester bill  That bill would replace Real ID with     sensible  cost effective drivers license standards  The problems with     Real ID would be fixed  and the standards could be achieved in a     cooperative fashion with state officials  federal government agencies      and privacy and civil liberties experts  S  717 paves the way for a     better system  one that complies with the 9 11 Commissions minimal     statement    And S  717 will not     threaten to change the quality of life of Vermonters  in all the ways     that Real ID will    The written testimony I     am submitting includes the ACLUs comments on the rules proposed by     Homeland Security to implement Real ID  a map showing state by state     actions regarding Real ID  and Vermont news articles on Real ID     Again  thank you for     this opportunity to testify before you
