Specter       Orrin Hatch  and others reauthorizing the landmark Violence Against      Women Act  The bill ensures that the vital federal assistance and      training provided to state and local officials working to stop      domestic violence and child abuse under the original law will      continue  The legislation is set to expire at the end of the      month  The renewal bill also includes improvements to these vital      programs that aid law enforcement officers and prosecutors and      established training programs for victim advocates and counselors       as well as probation and parole officers who work with released sex      offenders   Leahy  the ranking Democratic member      of the committee  included two provisions in the bill that would      help Vermont officials and agencies working on the front lines to      prevent acts of violence and help survivors        Rural Grants Program       Reauthorizes and expands the existing education  training and      services grant programs that address violence against women in rural      areas  This provision includes new language that expands the      program coverage to sexual assault  child sexual assault and      stalking  It also expands eligibility from rural states to rural      communities  increasing access to rural sections of otherwise highly      populated states  This section authorizes  55 000 000 annually for      2006 through 2010  which is an increase of  15 million per year             Transitional Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic      Violence  Dating Violence  Sexual Assault or Stalking       This program authorizes grants for transitional housing and related      services for people fleeing domestic violence  sexual assault or      stalkers  At a time when the availability of affordable housing has      sunk to record lows  transitional housing for victims is needed now      more than ever  Today more than 50 percent of homeless individuals      are women and children fleeing domestic violence    Our governments most crucial role      is that of protecting and helping those who need it most  and now      more than ever is the time when Congress should be moving to protect      the most vulnerable members of our population   whether they are      those who have endured domestic violence or sexual assault or those      who have survived the devastationwrought by Hurricane Katrina       said Leahy    The bill now moves to the full      Senate for consideration  Below is Leahys statement from the      committees hearing today  followed by an article from The      Burlington Free Press on the rise in forcible rapes in Vermont                        Statement of Senator Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee     Consideration of the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women      Act     September 8  2005 I am pleased that      today our Committee has turned to consideration of the      reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act  S  1197       bipartisan legislation that will further our goal of ending domestic      violence  dating violence  sexual assault and stalking  The      enactment of the Violence Against Women Act over a decade ago marked      an important national commitment to survivors of domestic violence      and sexual assault  I am proud to join Senators Biden  Hatch       Specter and others as an original cosponsor of this important      measure  I want to especially recognize Senator Biden for his      continued commitment to ending violence against women and children  Earlier in my      career as a county prosecutor in Vermont  I witnessed the      devastating effects of domestic violence  Violence and abuse affect      people of all walks of life every day and regardless of gender       race  culture  age  class or sexuality  Such violence is a crime      and it is always wrong  whether the abuser is a family member       someone the victim is dating  a current or past spouse  boyfriend       or girlfriend  an acquaintance or a stranger  The National Crime      Victimization Survey estimates there were 691 710 non fatal  violent      incidents committed against victims by current and former spouses       boyfriends or girlfriends  also known as intimate partners  during      2001  Of those incidents  85 percent were against women  The rate      of non fatal intimate partner violence against women has fallen      steadily since 1993  when the rate was 9 8 incidents per 1 000      people  In 2001  the number fell to 5 0 incidents per 1 000 people       nearly a 50 percent reduction  but still unacceptably high       Tragically  however  the survey found that 1 600 women were killed      in 1976 by a current or former spouse or boyfriend  while in 2000      some 1 247 women were killed by their intimate partners   Our Nation has      made remarkable progress over the past 25 years in recognizing that      domestic violence and sexual assault are crimes  We have responded      with better laws  social support and coordinated community      responses  Millions of women  men  children and families  however       continue to be traumatized by abuse  leading to increased rates of      crime  violence and suffering   The Violence      Against Women Act has provided aid to law enforcement officers and      prosecutors  helped stem domestic violence and child abuse       established training programs for victim advocates and counselors       and trained probation and parole officers who work with released sex      offenders  Now we on the Judiciary Committee and then the rest of      our colleagues in Congress have the opportunity to reauthorize VAWA      and make improvements to vital core programs  tighten criminal      penalties against domestic abusers  and create new solutions to      other crucial aspects of domestic violence and sexual assault  This      is an opportunity to help treat children victims of violence       augment health care for rape victims  hold repeat offenders and      Internet stalkers accountable  and help domestic violence victims      keep their jobs   Included in VAWA      2005 are reauthorizations of two programs that I initially sponsored      that are vital to helping rural communities battle domestic violence      in a setting in which isolation can make it more difficult for both      victims and law enforcement  In a small  rural state like Vermont       our county and local law enforcement agencies rely heavily on      cooperative  interagency efforts to combat and solve significant      problems  That is why I sought to include the Rural Domestic      Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program as part      of the original VAWA  This program helps make services available to      rural victims and children by encouraging community involvement in      developing a coordinated response to combat domestic violence       dating violence and child abuse  Adequate resources combined with      sustained commitment will bring about significant improvements in      rural areas to the lives of those victimized by domestic and sexual      violence   The Rural Grants      Program section of VAWA 2005 reauthorizes and expands the existing      education  training and services grant programs that address      violence against women in rural areas  This provision renews the      rural VAWA program  extends direct grants to state and local      governments for services in rural areas and expands areas to include      community collaboration projects in rural areas and the creation or      expansion of additional victim services  This provision includes      new language that expands the program coverage to sexual assault       child sexual assault and stalking  It also expands eligibility from      rural states to rural communities  increasing access to rural      sections of otherwise highly populated states  This section      authorizes  55 000 000 annually for 2006 through 2010  which is an      increase of  15 million per year   The second grant      program initiative on which I have focused is the Transitional      Housing Assistance Grants for Victims of Domestic Violence  Dating      Violence  Sexual Assault or Stalking  This program  which became      law as part of the PROTECT Act of 2003  authorizes grants for      transitional housing and related services for people fleeing      domestic violence  sexual assault or stalkers  At a time when the      availability of affordable housing has sunk to record lows       transitional housing for victims is needed now more than ever       Today more than 50 percent of homeless individuals are women and      children fleeing domestic violence  We have a glaring problem that      is in dire need of a solution and this program is part of the      solution   Transitional      housing allows women to bridge the gap between leaving violence in      their homes and becoming self sufficient  Our bill  VAWA 2005       amends the existing transitional housing program by expanding the      current direct assistance grants to include funds for operational       capital and renovation costs  Other changes include providing      services to victims of dating violence  sexual assault and stalking       extending the length of time for receipt of benefits to match that      used by Housing and Urban Development transitional housing programs       and updating the existing program to reflect the concerns of the      service provision community  The provision would increase the      authorized funding for the grant from  30 000 000 to  40 000 000       The Violence      Against Women Act passed the Senate in 1994 and with it we declared      that the United States takes the problem of violence against women      seriously  The law declared that  a ll persons within the United      States shall have the right to be free from crimes of violence      motivated by gender  and we enacted meaningful reform       Regrettably  in United States v  Morrison  the Supreme Court      struck down portions of the Act  That case involved a young woman      who was allegedly raped by two classmates while attending college       Our law allowed a victim of violence to seek civil remedies when      the violence was motivated by gender based animus  Congress showed      in its findings that justice is too often denied to women and a      majority of states supported our law and the civil remedy it      provided  By a narrow 5 to 4 vote  the Supreme Court struck down      this portion of the Violence Against Women Act and second guessed      the judgment of Congress on this remedial cause of action    This is a stark      reminder of what is at stake as we soon consider nominations to fill      the current two vacancies on the United States Supreme Court       Consistent with our oaths of office and allegiance to the      Constitution  a majority of the United States Senate  the House of      Representatives  the President of the United States and four of the      nine Justices on the Supreme Court thought the remedial action we      provided to victims of violence constitutional  Sadly  it was not      enough to save this important aspect of our legislative program from      a declaration of unconstitutionality by an activist Supreme Court       Regrettably  there      are members of our Committee who plan to offer amendments today that      serve as nothing more than poison pills to sink this bill  Notably       they object to the inclusion of Title VIII  which improves and      expands the immigration protections for battered women  It also      ensures that victims of trafficking are supported with measures such      as permitting their families to join them in certain circumstances       expanding the duration of a T visa  and providing resources to      victims who assist in investigations or prosecutions of trafficking      cases brought by state or federal authorities  I find it shameful      that someone would move to strike provisions that aim to protect the      most vulnerable members of our population  particularly as we are      reminded so vividly by the devastation of Hurricane Katrina that      governments most crucial role is that of protecting and helping      those who need it most  I will oppose these amendments   According to the      annual Vermont Crime Report  the number of forcible rapes reported      in Vermont increased in 2004 to the highest level in seven years       while the amount of violent crime remained unchanged and overall      crime fell by about 5 percent from 2003  Reported incidents of rape      rose by 58 percent  from 117 in 2003 to 185 in 2004  The average      age of the victim was 21  47 percent of victims were younger than 18      years old  in 74 percent of the cases the perpetrator was an      acquaintance of the victim  and in a quarter of the cases the      defendant was a family member or intimate partner of the victim  In      only 1 percent of the cases was the perpetrator a stranger  These      figures cause me concern because violent crime has declined      throughout our nation during that same time period  Numbers like      these are why reauthorizing VAWA is so vital  Now it is time to      strengthen the prevention of violence against women and children and      its devastating costs and consequences  This legislation is an      important part of our efforts to increase awareness of the problem      of violence  to save the lives of battered women  rape victims and      children who grow up with violence and to continue progress against      the devastating tragedy of domestic violence  I urge prompt action      on this legislation              Rape Cases rise 58      Percent  Overall Crime Drops  According to State Report  Copyright      2005 The Burlington Free Press  Burlington  VT      All Rights Reserved      The Burlington Free Press  Vermont   August 25       2005 Thursday  By Adam      Silverman      WILLISTON    The number of forcible rapes reported in Vermont      increased in 2004 to the highest level in seven years  the amount of      violent crime remained unchanged  and overall crime fell by about 5      percent from 2003  according to a state report released Wednesday       Reported incidents of rape rose by 58 percent  from 117 in 2003 to      185 in 2004  according to the annual Vermont Crime Report  Violent      crime    which includes murders  rapes  robberies and aggravated      assaults    continued at its 2003 level  with 738 reported      incidents       Those figures cause concern among Vermont public safety officials      because violent crime declined elsewhere in the Northeast and across      the country from 2003 to 2004  said Max Schlueter  director of the      Vermont Criminal Information Center        If we look at the national data  this information is not so      encouraging  he said at a news conference Wednesday morning at the      Vermont State Police barracks in Williston       The state needs further data and research to help determine why the      number of forcible rapes increased  said Public Safety Commissioner      Kerry Sleeper  He said the problem is one we need to address  and      address quickly  Part of the increase could be attributed to more      women feeling comfortable reporting rapes  but that might not      explain the jump in reported cases  Sleeper said       We need to make sure one year isn t an anomaly  he said  We      really need to rely on a span of years       Increase in rapes      Schlueter said the 2003 number of reported rapes was unusually low       so state experts also compared the 2004 number to the five year      average  That number  154  is 20 percent below the 2004 level       At the Women s Rape Crisis Center in Burlington  staff members have      been seeing an increase in reported rapes for years  said Cathleen      Wilson  the assistant director  The center provided assistance to      555 rape survivors and loved ones in 2004  an increase of 29 percent      from 2003  Wilson said       The center has responded by hiring more staff  but the 10 employees      and 60 volunteers remain overwhelmed  Wilson said       We re so busy right now that it s hard to keep up  she said       Center employees  like state officials  are wondering what is      causing the increase       More survivors are reaching out for help and feel comfortable      reporting  but we re sort of scratching our heads  too  and      wondering if something more violent is going on  Wilson said       Advocates are trying to combat the rising number of reported rapes      through education  providing money to support agencies and working      to ensure accountability and treatment for offenders  Wilson said       The report says 30 percent of the reported rapes occurred in      Chittenden County  the average age of the victim was 21  47 percent      of victims were younger than 18  in 74 percent of the cases the      perpetrator was an acquaintance of the victim  and in a quarter of      the cases the defendant was a family member or intimate partner of      the victim  In only 1 percent of the cases was the perpetrator a      stranger       More data      Other crime data in the report painted a mixed picture       Total crime fell to 59 570 reported incidents in 2004 from 62 569      the previous year  a drop of 4 7 percent  The decline was due      largely to reductions in reported vandalisms  family and child      offenses and various other crimes       Total violent crime remained steady in Vermont  while it decreased      1 7 percent nationally and 2 5 percent in the Northeast       Homicides decreased to 11 from 15       Robberies increased from to 102 from 82       Aggravated assaults decreased to 439 from 523  ending four years of      increases       Property crime    burglaries  thefts and vehicle thefts    remained      unchanged in Vermont  while it decreased by 1 7 percent nationally      and 2 5 percent in the Northeast  The crimes accounted for losses of       18 million statewide  with the largest chunk     4 25 million         coming from vandalism  Vandalism did decrease in 2004 by 18 percent       Also Wednesday  the Criminal Information Center unveiled a      comprehensive  public Web site that tracks and displays crime data       Vermont Crime On Line is the first such system in the country       Schlueter said       The project  which took one year and  60 000 to develop  allows the      public  state policymakers and law enforcement to evaluate crime      data before making decisions  Sleeper said  The information could be      helpful  for instance  in a discussion about the need for increased      police patrols  Sleeper said
