Senate Judiciary Panel      Holds Hearing On Iraqi Police Training     With Members Of The Iraq Study Group       WASHINGTON  Wednesday  January 31   The Senate Judiciary Committee      today is holding a hearing Examining The Iraq Study Groups      Recommendations   For      Improvements To Iraqs Police And Criminal Justice System  with      Iraq Study Group members Lee Hamilton  former Congressman who served      as co chair of the group  and Edwin Meese  former Attorney General      who served as a member of the group  Below is Chairman Patrick      Leahys statement  as prepared  from the hearing     Statement Of Sen       Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      Hearing On Examining The Iraq Study Groups Recommendations      For Improvements To Iraqs Police And Criminal Justice System     January 31  2007     The Committee today continues to focus      its attention on the enduring conflict in Iraq  Just yesterday       Senator Feingold chaired an important hearing on the powers of      Congress to contribute to finding a better solution  Today  we will      concentrate on the challenges of training the Iraqi police and      building a working criminal justice system  A competent police      force and a functioning criminal justice system are crucial      benchmarks in getting the Iraqi government to stand on its own    I would like to welcome Congressman      Hamilton and Attorney General Meese for appearing before the      Committee  and for the work they have done in helping to find a      better way forward in Iraq    Regrettably  the situation in Iraq      continues to worsen on all fronts  In the last couple of days  the      Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction    the office that      some congressional Republicans tried to shut down    released      reports indicating that the U S  Government has squandered millions      intended for police training programs because of rampant problems      overseeing contractors  as The Washington Post summarized it in      its story this morning  The article details an unauthorized      Olympic sized swimming pool  VIP trailers  shoddy construction and      unsanitary conditions at the Baghdad Police College  as well as      evidence of fraud  as millions  if not tens of millions  are      wasted  Not only does this undercut efforts in Iraq  it is doubly      shameful in view of the lack of progress in restoring New Orleans      and the Gulf Coast here in this country   This is an issue of overriding      importance  In the most recent congressional elections  the      American people spoke loudly and clearly  They voted for a new      direction and a change in leadership in the Congress  This week       the Democratic leadership in the Senate is charting that new      direction by considering better ways to serve our national      interests    At its outset  the Iraq Study Group      report states that the situation in Iraq is grave and      deteriorating  I appreciate their honesty  This grim assessment      should have been a wakeup call to President Bush and his advisors       and a clear message that it was time to not only to listen to      others  but to act upon their sound advice  Instead  the President      has rejected much of the hard work and advice of the Iraq Study      Group and  again  decided to go it alone  During the last few days      the Vice President went further  by rejecting contrary views as      hogwash and seeking to trumpet enormous successes supposedly      made in Iraq    We now know that the predictions by      the Vice President and others of being welcomed as liberators in      Iraq and an easy transition to a Western style  secular  peaceful       pluralistic democracy were a costly fantasy  As the Study Group      report indicates  the best we can salvage may be the safe return of      our soldiers and some measure of stability for the people of Iraq       The damage already done in terms of providing Al Qaeda with new      recruits and the alienation the extended occupation by American      forces has caused among young people in the Middle East will be felt      for decades and generations  Moreover  we have lost focus on the      effort to bring Osama bin Laden to justice    As Senator Webb and many others I      trust from both sides of the aisle have said  it is time for      Congress to help guide the way  I hope the President will take good      advice when offered    no matter the source  I urge him to work      with Congress rather than defy it and to listen to the will of the      American people in order to avoid a confrontation     I am also grateful to the Iraq Study      Group for its express recognition that Americans can and must enjoy      the right of robust debate within a democracy  I agree  The scare      tactics and attacks on the patriotism of those who question the      Presidents flawed plan are corrosive  and they are wrong  The work      of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group is in the best tradition of      America  The hearings this Committee held on the Iraqi refugee      crisis  and this week on congressional authority under our      Constitution as well as this hearing on the Iraq Study Groups      recommendations for improvements to Iraqs police and criminal      justice system are likewise a part of that critical democratic      debate    Thoughtful postwar planners would have      recognized the importance of law and order in Iraq  Men like Jay      Garner and Richard Mayer drew up extensive plans to train and      support an Iraqi police force to maintain law and order  only to be      pushed aside and see their plans discarded by Pentagon leadership       The result is a disorganized criminal justice system and a weak      Iraqi police force with an attrition rate of 30 percent  according      to information released by the Pentagon    More recently we have witnessed the      Administrations discontinuation of Iraqi police training at a key      training facility in Jordan  and the failure of government      contractors to build the Baghdad Police College    If the Administration had been serious      and competent about establishing a functioning democracy in Iraq  it      would have seen the need for a trustworthy criminal justice system      in which all Iraqis could have confidence  But we have seen very      little in the way of progress in establishing the rule of law in      Iraq  The Study Group recognizes the importance of this issue  The      Iraq Study Groups report includes a dozen recommendations in this      area that we can explore today    To my dismay  in the two major      addresses to the Nation President Bush has given recently    his      escalation announcement of January 10th  and his recent      State of the Union address  the President barely mentioned the Iraq      Study Groups work and said nothing about the critical importance of      Iraqs civilian police  Of course he also failed to make any      mention of the continuing suffering in Louisiana and the Gulf Coast       perhaps the largest domestic disaster and displacement of people in      our history    Todays hearing gives this Committee      and the country an opportunity to explore further the Study Groups      recommendations and to engage in a robust debate  I hope that we      can discuss better ways to contribute to peace and stability      throughout the Iraqi neighborhoods that have been torn apart by      violence  How can we better ensure that police forces serve the      intended purposes of maintaining law and order rather than serving      partisan militias and as death squads  How can we better ensure      that the principles of the Leahy Law  which prohibits American      financial assistance to those forces that engage in human rights      violations  are honored rather than ignored    There is much at stake  as we all      know  I look forward to our discussion  and to making progress on      finding answers to these questions so that the Iraqi government can      be a self sustaining one  And most importantly  I look forward to      our troops coming home
