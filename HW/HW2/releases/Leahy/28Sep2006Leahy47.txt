       Leahy Opposes  Flagrantly Unconstitutional  Military Commission Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Republican Led Senate Endorses White     House Backed Bill  65 34   Leahy Opposes Flagrantly     Unconstitutional Military Commission Bill      Passing laws that remove the few checks     against mistreatment of prisoners will not help us win the battle for     the hearts and minds of the generation of young people around the world     being recruited by Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda  Authorizing indefinite     detention of anybody the Government designates    without any proceeding     and without any recourse    is what our worst critics claim the United     States would do  not what American values  traditions and our rule of     law would have us do    This is not just a bad bill  this is a     dangerous bill               Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy    On the Military Commissions Act  S  3930    September 28  2006  It is from strength     that America should defend our values and our Constitution  It takes     commitment to those values to demand accountability from the     Government  In standing up for American values and security  I will     vote against this bill   A Giant Step Away From Fairness And     Accountability Senator Smith spoke     stirringly earlier today of the dangers of this bills most dangerous     provision  the elimination of the independent judicial check on     Government overreaching and lawlessness  He quoted from great defenders     of liberty  It was Justice Robert H  Jackson who said in his role as     Chief Counsel for the Allied Powers responsible for trying German war     criminals after World War II  That four great nations  flushed with     victory and stung with injury stay the hand of vengeance and voluntarily     submit their captive enemies to the judgment of the law is one of the     most significant tributes that Power ever has paid to Reason  He     closed the Nuremberg trials about which Senator Dodd spoke earlier by     saying  Of one thing we may be sure  The future will never have to ask      with misgiving  What could the Nazis have said in their favor      History will know that whatever could be said  they were allowed to     say  They have been given the kind of a trial which they  in the days of     their pomp and power  never gave to any man  But fairness is not     weakness  The extraordinary fairness of these hearings is an attribute     of our strength  He was right and his wisdom was echoed this week at     our Judiciary Committee hearing when Admiral Hutson and Lieutenant     Commander Swift testified that fairness and lawfulness is our greatest     strength  Regrettably  this legislation does not live up to that     standard  It is a giant step away from fairness and a further leap away     from any accountability for actions by the United States Government      This Administration      for all its talk of strength  has made us less safe  and its proposal     before us today is one that smacks of weakness and fear  Its     legislative demands reflect a cowering country that is succumbing to the     threat of terrorism  I believe that we are better than that  I believe     that we are stronger than that  I believe that we are fairer than     that  I believe that America should be a leader in the fight for human     rights and the rule of law   We have taken our eye     off the ball in the fight against the terrorists  That is essentially     what all of our intelligence agencies concluded in the National     Intelligence Estimate that the Administration has had for six months      but that the rest of us just learned about this weekend  Our retooled     and reorganized intelligence agencies  with leadership hand picked by     this Administration  have concluded  contrary to the campaign rhetoric     of the President and Vice President  that the Iraq War has become a     cause celebre that has inspired a new generation of terrorists      Surely  the shameful mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo  at Abu     Ghraib  at secret CIA prisons and which were facilitated by torturers in     countries where the U S  Government shipped people  have become other     causes celebre and recruiting tools for our enemies  Surely  the     continued occupation of Iraq  when close to three fourths of Iraqis want     U S  forces to depart  is another circumstance being exploited by our     enemies to mischaracterize America   Passing laws that     remove the few checks against mistreatment of prisoners will not help us     win the battle for the hearts and minds of the generation of young     people around the world being recruited by Osama bin Laden and al     Qaeda  Authorizing indefinite detention of anybody the Government     designates  without any proceeding and without any recourse  is what our     worst critics claim the United States would do  not what American     values  traditions  and our rule of law would have us do  This is not     just a bad bill  this is a dangerous bill   I have been asking     Secretary Rumsfelds question for the last several weeks  whether our     actions are eliminating more of our enemies than are being created  Any     reasonable doubt that anyone might have had on that score was eliminated     by last Aprils National Intelligence Estimate  Our intelligence     agencies agree and confirm what many of us have been saying and what the     American people know intuitively  The global jihadist movement is     spreading and adapting  it is increasing in both number and geographic     dispersion  If this trend continues  that is  if we do not wise up     and change course and adopt a winning new strategy  threats to U S      interests at home and abroad will become more diverse  leading to     increasing attacks worldwide  Attacks have been increasing worldwide     over the last five year of these failing policies and are  according to     the judgment of our own  newly reconstituted intelligence agencies      likely to increase further in the days and months and years ahead  It     goes on to note ominously that  n ew jihadist networks and cells  with     anti American agendas  are increasingly likely to emerge  And further      that the operational threat will grow particularly abroad  but also     in the Homeland  This is chilling  The Bush Cheney Administration has     not only failed for five years to bring Osama bin Laden to justice      having yanked our special forces that had him on the run out of Tora     Bora and diverting them to Iraq  but  in answer to Secretary Rumsfeld      has witnessed the spread of additional enemies with anti American     agendas   And what do our     intelligence agencies suggest is the way out of this dangerous quagmire      The National Intelligence Estimate suggests we have to go well beyond     operations to capture or kill terrorist leaders and we must foster     democratic reforms  When America can be seen abandoning its American     democratic values  its checks and balances  its great legal traditions     and becoming more autocratic and less accountable  how is that going to     help foster democratic reforms elsewhere  Do as I say and not as I do     is not a motto that has ever successfully inspired trust or credibility   Rushing Through A Bill That Would Have     Devastating Effects On Security And Values  This Administration     has yet to come clean to the Congress or the American people in     connection with the secret legal justifications it has generated and     secret practices it has employed in detaining and interrogating     hundreds  if not thousands  of people in the war on terror  Even they     cannot dismiss the practices at Guantanamo as the actions of a few bad     apples  With Senate adoption of the anti torture amendment last year     and the recent adoption of the Army Field Manual  I had hoped that five     years of Administration resistance to the rule of law and to the U S      military abiding by its Geneva obligations might be drawing to a close      Despite the resistance of the Vice President and the Administration  the     new Army Field Manual appears to outlaw several of what the     Administration euphemistically calls aggressive tactics and that much     of the world regards as torture and cruel and degrading treatment  In     rejecting the Kennedy amendment today  the Senate has turned away from     the wise counsel and judgment of military professionals  Of course  the     President in his signing statement already undermined enactment of the     anti torture law  The Administration is now obtaining license to engage     in additional harsh techniques that much of the world will see as     abusive  as cruel and degrading and even as torture   What is being lost in     this debate is any notion of accountability and the guiding principles     of American values and law  Where are the facts of what has been done     in the name of the United States  Where are the legal justifications and     technicalities the Administrations lawyers have been seeking to exploit     for five years  The Republican leaderships legislation strips away all     accountability and erodes our most basic national values without so much     as an accounting of these facts and legal arguments  Senator     Rockefellers amendment to incorporate some accountability in the     process through oversight of the CIA interrogation program was     unfortunately rejected by the Republican leadership in the Senate      Secrecy for all time is to be the Republican rule of the day      Congressional oversight is no more  Checks and balances are no more      The fundamental check that had been provided by the Supreme Court is     effectively to be excised from the constitutional landscape  This is     wrong  This should be unconstitutional  This is certainly not the     action of any Senate in which I have served or one that is worthy of the     United States of America  We are rushing     through legislation that would have a devastating effect on our security     and on our values  I implore Senators to step back from the brink and     consider the truly devastating consequences of this bill   The President     recently said that time is of the essence to pass legislation     authorizing military commissions  Time was of the essence when this     Administration took control in January 2001 and did not act on the dire     warnings of terrorist action  Time was of the essence in August and     early September 2001 when the 9 11 attacks could still have been     prevented  This Administration ignored warnings of a coming attack and     even proposed cutting the anti terror budget on September 10  the day     before the worst foreign terrorist attack on U S  soil in our history      This Administration was focused on Star Wars  not terrorism  Time was     of the essence when Osama bin Laden was trapped in Tora Bora  But this     Administration was more interested in going after Sadaam Hussein  who     the President recently admitted had nothing to do with 9 11   After five years of     this Administrations unilateral actions that have left us less safe      time is now of the essence to take real steps to keep us safe from     terrorism  Real steps like those included in the Real Security Act  S      3875  We should be focusing on getting the terrorists and securing the     nuclear material that this Administration has allowed for the last five     years to be unaccounted for around the world  We should be     strengthening our special forces as Senator Kerry has advised and trying     to win the peace in Afghanistan  where the Taliban has regrouped and is     increasing in strength   Instead  the     President and the Republican Senate leadership call for rubberstamping     more flawed White House proposals in the run up to another election  I     had hoped that this time  for the first time  the United States Senate     would act as an independent branch of the government and finally serve     as a check on this Administration  After this debate and the rejection     of all amendments intended to improve this flagrantly unconstitutional     measure  I see that day has long passed  I will continue to speak out      but I mourn for the country and for the American values and principles     on which I was raised and which I took a solemn oath to uphold       Going forward  the bill departs even more radically from our most     fundamental values  And provisions that were profoundly troubling a     week ago when the Armed Services Committee marked up the bill have     gotten much worse in the course of closed door revisions over the past     week  For example  the bill has been amended to eliminate habeas corpus     review even for persons inside the United States  and even for persons     who have not been determined to be enemy combatants  It has moved from     detention of those who are captured having taken up arms against the     United States on a battlefield to millions of law abiding Americans that     the Government might suspect of sympathies for Muslim causes and who     knows what elsewithout any avenue for effective review  This is the     Government whose incompetence was demonstrated in historic dimensions in     the lack of preparation and response to Hurricane Katrina  This is the     Government that had Senator Kennedy and Congressman Lewis on terrorist     watch lists and could not get them off  This is a Government that     repeatedly failed to protect confidential information about our armed     forces and veterans  And this is a Government that is loathe to admit     mistakes or make course corrections  instead regarding all of its     representatives from Donald Rumsfeld to Michael Brown as doing a     heckuva job       The proponents of this bill talk about sending messages  What message     does it send to the millions of legal immigrants living in America      participating in American families  working for American businesses  and     paying American taxes  Its message is that our Government may at any     minute pick them up and detain them indefinitely without charge  and     without any access to the courts or even to military tribunals  unless     and until the Government determines that they are not enemy combatants      a term that the bill now defines in a tortured and unprecedentedly broad     manner  And that power and any errors cannot be reviewed or corrected     by a court  What message does that send about abuse of power  What     message does that send to the world about Americas freedoms    Administrations Attempt to Remove     Judicial Checks After Courts Have Rejected Its Flawed Policies     Numerous press accounts have quoted Administration officials who believe     that a significant percentage of those detained at Guantanamo have no     connection to terrorism  In other words  the Bush Cheney Administration     has been holding for several years  and intends to hold indefinitely     without trial or any recourse to justice  a substantial number of     innocent people who were turned in by anonymous bounty hunters or picked     up by mistake in the fog of war or as a result of a tribal or personal     vendetta  The most important purpose of habeas corpus is to correct     errors like that  to protect the innocent  It is precisely to prevent     such abuses that the Constitution prohibits the suspension of the writ     of habeas corpus unless when in Cases of Rebellion or Invasion the     public Safety may require it  But court review has now embarrassed the     Bush Administration  as the United States Supreme Court has three times     rejected its lawyers schemes  And  so how does the Administration     respond  It insists that there be no more judicial check on its actions     and errors  When the Senate accedes to that demand  it abandons     American principles and Americans  I will not be a party to that     retreat from constitutional values   Senator Smith      speaking this morning about the habeas provisions of this bill  quoted     Thomas Jefferson  who said  The habeas corpus secures every man here      alien or citizen  against everything which is not law  whatever shape it     may assume  Jefferson said on another occasion  I would rather be     exposed to the inconveniences attending too much liberty than to those     attending too small a degree of it  With this bill  the United States     Senate reverses that profound judgment of history  chooses against     liberty  and succumbs to fear       When former Secretary of State Colin Powell wrote last week of his     concerns with the Administrations bill  he wrote about doubts     concerning our moral authority in the war against terrorism  This     General  former head of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and former Secretary     of State  was right  Now we have heard from a number of current and     former diplomats  military lawyers  federal judges  law professors and     law school deans  the American Bar Association  and even the first     President Bushs Solicitor General  Kenneth Starr  that they have grave     concerns with the habeas corpus stripping provisions of this bill      I agree with Mr  Starr that we should not suspend  and we should     certainly not eliminate  the Great Writ  I also agree with more than     300 law professors  who described an earlier  less extreme version of     the habeas provisions of this bill as unwise and contrary to the most     fundamental precepts of American constitutional traditions  And I     agree with more than 30 former U S  Ambassadors and other senior     diplomats  who say that eliminating habeas corpus for aliens detained by     the United States will harm our interests abroad  and put our own     military  diplomatic  and other personnel stationed abroad at risk  We     cannot spread a message of freedom abroad if our message to those who     come to America is that they may be detained indefinitely without any     recourse to justice       In the wake of the 9 11 attacks  and in the face of the continuing     terrorist threat  now is not the time for the United States to abandon     its principles  Admiral Hutson was right to point out that when we do      there would be little to distinguish America from a banana republic or     the repressive regimes against which we are trying to rally the world     and the human spirit  Now is not the time to abandon American values      to shiver and quake  to rely on secrecy and torture  Those are ways of     repression and oppression  not the American way   The Presidents Empty Call For Clarity         Bill Makes Sweeping Changes To War Crimes Act  We need to pursue the     war on terror with strength and intelligence  but also to do so     consistent with American values  The President says he wants clarity as     to the meaning of the Geneva Conventions and the War Crimes Act  Of     course  he did not want clarity when his Administration was using its     twisted interpretation of the law to authorize torture and cruel and     inhumane treatment of detainees  He did not want clarity when spying on     Americans without warrants  And he certainly did not want clarity while     keeping those rationales and programs secret from Congress  The     Administration does not seem to want clarity when it refuses even to     tell Congress what its understanding of the law is following the     withdrawal of a memo that said the President could authorize and     immunize torture  That memo was withdrawn because it could not     withstand the light of day   It seems that the     only clarity this Administration wants is a green light from Congress to     do whatever it wants  That is not clarity  it is immunity  That is     what the current legislation would give to the President on     interrogation techniques and on military commissions  Justice OConnor     reminded the nation before her retirement that even war is not a blank     check when it comes to the rights of Americans  The Senate should not     be a rubberstamp for policies that undercut American values and make     Americans around the world less safe   In reality  we     already have clarity  Senior military officers tell us they know what     the Geneva Conventions require  and the military trains its personnel     according to these standards  We have never had trouble urging other     countries around the world to accept and enforce the provisions of the     Geneva Conventions  There was enough clarity for that  What the     Administration appears to want  instead  is to use new legislative     language to create loopholes and to narrow our obligations not to engage     in cruel  degrading  and inhuman treatment   In fact  the new     legislation muddies the waters  It saddles the War Crimes Act with a     definition of cruel or inhuman treatment so oblique that it appears to     permit all manner of cruel and extreme interrogation techniques      Senator McCain said this weekend that some techniques like waterboarding     and induced hypothermia would be banned by the proposed law  But     Senator Frist and the White House disavowed his statements  saying that     they preferred not to say what techniques would or would not be     allowed  That is hardly clarity  it is deliberate confusion   Into that breach      this legislation throws the Administrations solution to all problems      more Presidential power  It allows the Administration to promulgate     regulations about what conduct would and would not comport with the     Geneva Conventions  though it does not require the President to specify     which particular techniques can and cannot be used  This is a formula     for still fewer checks and balances and for more abuse  secrecy  and     power grabbing  It is a formula for immunity for past and future abuses     by the Executive   I worked hard  along     with many others of both parties  to pass the current version of the War     Crimes Act  I think the current law is a good law  and the concerns     that have been raised about it could best be addressed with minor     adjustments  rather than with sweeping changes  In 1996  working with     the Department of Defense  Congress passed the War Crimes Act to provide     criminal penalties for certain war crimes committed by and against     Americans  The next year  again with the Pentagons support  Congress     extended the War Crimes Act to violations of the baseline humanitarian     protections afforded by Common Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions      Both measures were supported by a broad bipartisan consensus  and I was     proud to sponsor the 1997 amendments   The legislation was     uncontroversial for a good reason  As I explained at the time  the     purpose and effect of the War Crimes Act as amended was to provide for     the implementation of Americas commitment to the basic international     standards we subscribed to when we ratified the Geneva Conventions in     1955  Those standards are truly universal  They condemn war criminals     whoever and wherever they are   That is a critically     important aspect of the Geneva Conventions and our own War Crimes Act      When we are dealing with fundamental norms that define the commitments     of the civilized world  we cannot have one rule for us and one for them      however we define us and them  As Justice Jackson said at the     Nuremberg tribunals  We are not prepared to lay down a     rule of criminal conduct against others which we would not be willing to     have invoked against us   In     that regard  I am disturbed that the legislation before us narrows the     scope of the War Crimes Act to exclude certain violations of the Geneva     Conventions and  perhaps more disturbingly  to retroactively immunize     past violations  Neither the Congress nor the Department of Defense had     any problem with the War Crimes Act when we were focused on using it to     prosecute foreign perpetrators of war crimes  I am concerned that this     is yet another example of this Administration overreaching  disregarding     the law and our international obligations  and seeking to immunize     others to break the law  It also could well prevent us from     prosecuting rogues who we all agree were out of line  like the soldiers     who mistreated prisoners at Abu Ghraib   The President said on     May 5  2004 about prisoner mistreatment at Abu Ghraib  I view those     practices as abhorrent  He continued  But in a democracy  as well      those mistakes will be investigated  and people will be brought to     justice  The Republican leader of the Senate said on the same day  I     rise to express my shock and condemnation of these despicable acts  The     persons who carried them must face justice  Many of the     despicable tactics used in Abu Ghraib  the use of dogs  forced nudity      humiliation of various kinds  do not appear to be covered by the narrow     definitions this legislation would graft into the War Crimes Act      Despite the Presidents calls for clarity  the new provisions are so     purposefully ambiguous that we cannot know for sure whether they are     covered  If the Abu Ghraib abuses had come to light after the     perpetrators left the military  they might not have been able to be     brought to justice under the Administrations formulation   The President and the     Congress should not be in the business of immunizing people who have     broken the law  making us less safe  turning world opinion against us      and undercutting our treaty obligations in ways that encourage others to     ignore the protections those treaties provide to Americans  We should     be very careful about any changes we make   If we lower our     standards of domestic law to allow outrageous conduct  we can do nothing     to stop other countries from acting the same way  This change in our     law does not prevent other countries from prosecuting our troops and     personnel for violations of the Geneva Convention if they choose  it     only changes our domestic law  But it could give other countries a     green light to change their own law to allow them to treat our personnel     in cruel and inhuman ways  Let me be clear      There is no problem facing us about overzealous use of the War Crimes     Act by prosecutors  In fact  as far as I can tell  the Ashcroft Justice     Department and the Gonzales Justice Department have yet to file a single     charge against anyone for a violation of the War Crimes Act  Not only     have they never charged American personnel under the Act  they have     never used it to charge terrorists either   This bill does not     clarify the War Crimes Act  It authorizes and immunizes abhorrent     conduct that violates our basic values  Perhaps that is why more than     40 religious organizations and human rights groups wrote to urge the     Senate to take more time to consider the effects of this legislation on     our safety  security  and commitment to the rule of law  and to vote     against it if the serious problems in the bill are not corrected   Chilling Implications The proposed     legislation would also allow the admission of evidence obtained through     cruel and inhuman treatment into military commission proceedings  This     provision would once again allow this Administration to avoid all     accountability for its misguided policies which have contributed to the     rise of a new generation of terrorists who threaten us  Not only would     the military commissions legislation before us immunize those who     violated international law and stomped on basic American values  but it     would allow them then to use the evidence obtained in violation of basic     principles of fairness and justice   Allowing in this     evidence would violate our basic standards of fairness without     increasing our security  Maher Arar  the Canadian citizen arrested by     our government on bad intelligence and sent to Syria to be tortured      confessed to attending terrorist training camps  A Canadian commission     investigating the case found that his confessions had no basis in fact      They merely reflected that he was being tortured  and he told his     torturers what they wanted to hear  It is only one of many such     documented cases of bad information resulting from torture  We gain     nothing from allowing such information   The military     commissions legislation departs in other unfortunate ways from the     Warner Levin bill  Early this week  apparently at the White Houses     request  Republican drafters added a breathtakingly broad definition of     unlawful enemy combatant which includes people  citizens and     non citizens alike  who have purposefully and materially supported     hostilities against the United States or its allies  It also includes     people determined to be unlawful enemy combatants by any competent     tribunal established by the President or the Secretary of Defense  So     the Government can select any person  including a United States citizen      whom it suspects of supporting hostilities  whatever that means  and     begin denying that person the rights and processes guaranteed in our     country  The implications are chilling   I am sorry that the     Republican leadership squandered the chance to consider and pass     bipartisan legislation that will make us safer and help our fight     against terrorism  There was an opportunity today for the Senate to     provide the tools we need to fight terrorism while showing the world the     values we cherish and defend  the same values that make us a target  I     will not participate in a legislative retreat out of weakness and fear     that undercuts everything this nation stands for and that makes us more     vulnerable and less secure  Consistent with my oath of office  my     conscience  my commitment to the people of Vermont and the nation  I     cannot and will not support this bill
