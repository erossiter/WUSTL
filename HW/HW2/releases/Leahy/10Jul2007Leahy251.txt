       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Attorney General Misleading Senate   Concerning Abuses Of NSLs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Attorney General Misleading Senate      Concerning Abuses Of NSLs      July 10  2007       WASHINGTON  Tuesday  July 10    Below is Judiciary Chairman Patrick      Leahys comment on reports that the Attorney General misled the      Senate regarding the timing of his knowledge of widespread abuses by      the FBI that resulted in violations of Americans privacy and civil      liberties    In addition to the      comments the Attorney Generals provided to the Senate Intelligence      Committee in 2005  detailed in The      Washington Post story today  the Attorney General also failed      to provide the Senate Judiciary Committee with the accurate      information regarding the timing of his knowledge of abuses of      National Security Letters  NSLs   In answers to questions posed by      Chairman Leahy to the Attorney General following the Committees      April 2007 oversight hearing  the Attorney General indicated that he      first learned of the NSL abuses through drafts of the Office of      Inspector Generals report on NSL abuses  justprior to the public      release of that report in March 2007  The Judiciary Committee      received the Attorney Generals answers last week     Each day seems to      bring with it another example of this Administrations troubling      pattern of misleading or stonewalling Congress and the public       The reports today      that the Attorney General misled Congress regarding violations of      Americans privacy and civil liberties by his department are deeply      disturbing and warrant further inquiry  In addition to the Attorney      Generals misleading statements to the Senate Intelligence Committee      prior to the reauthorization of the PATRIOT ACT  it appears the      Attorney General also failed to disclose the truth about when he      first knew of widespread abuses by the FBI of National Security      Letters  NSLs  in questions I posed to him following his hearing      before the Senate Judiciary Committee earlier this year    Unfortunately       this Administrations penchant for secrecy makes it difficult to      work in a cooperative way  and it is only through dogged oversight      or Freedom of Information Act lawsuits  such as the one that      revealed these inconsistent statements  that Congress and the      American people learn the truth about this Administrations      activities   This      inconsistency is a disturbing addition to a growing list of      misleading answers by the Attorney General to questions from the      Judiciary Committee  and it is unacceptable  I intend to pursue      this matter with the Attorney General prior to his appearance before      the Judiciary Committee later this month
