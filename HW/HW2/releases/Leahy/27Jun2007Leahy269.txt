       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Subcommittee Hearing On Oversight Of The Federal Death Penalty                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Subcommittee Hearing On Oversight Of The Federal Death Penalty    June 27  2007   I would like to thank Senator Feingold for his leadership on the issue of    the death penalty and for this important contribution to the Judiciary    Committees work this year to restore oversight to the Department of Justice     oversight that is long overdue  I have long shared Senator Feingolds    concerns about the federal death penalty  and I am pleased to join him in    working to ensure that decisions about capital punishment are made carefully    and are subject to real oversight from Congress      More than seven years ago  I came to the Senate floor to call attention to a    national crisis in the administration of capital punishment  I noted that    since the reinstatement of capital punishment in the 1970s  85 people had    been found innocent and released from death row  And I urged Senators on    both sides of the aisle  both those who supported the death penalty and    those who opposed it  to join in seeking ways to minimize the risk that    innocent persons will be put to death      At that time  I introduced the Innocence Protection Act of 2000  and I    worked with many others for years until its passage as part of the Justice    For All Act of 2004  That legislation made key strides in ensuring that    capital defendants had access to DNA testing and to effective counsel  which    greatly reduces the chance of innocent people being sentenced to death  That    was an important achievement      Since that time  though  as in so many other areas  the Bush Administration    has proceeded on its own path and in secrecy  They have sought to increase    the use of the federal death penalty nationwide  even in states that do not    want it  they have consistently failed to allocate funding for Innocence    Protection Act  and most disturbingly  they have apparently insisted on    requesting the death penalty in cases lacking strong evidence over the    strenuous objections of dedicated United States Attorneys      I was struck by the testimony today of former U S  Attorney Paul Charlton     who reports that he vigorously opposed seeking the death penalty in one case    with no forensic evidence  but that his opposition was dismissed without any    opportunity for him to discuss the matter with the Attorney General  Even    more troubling  as Deputy Attorney General McNultys chief of staff Michael    Elston told Mr  Charlton at the time  Mr  McNulty and Attorney General    Gonzales had spent a significant amount of time on this issue   perhaps as    much as 5 or 10 minutes      It is beyond obvious to say that 5 or 10 minutes is not sufficient to make a    careful decision about whether to seek to execute a person in a difficult    case  But I worry that the Attorney General and the Deputy Attorney General    may also have taken no more than 5 or 10 minutes in deciding to accept the    recommendation from the White House or elsewhere that Mr  Charlton be fired    in spite of his courageous and diligent service      I also appreciate the testimony of Roberto Sanchez Ramos  the Secretary of    Justice for Puerto Rico  for sharing his concerns about the imposition of    the death penalty by the federal government on jurisdictions like Puerto    Rico that have chosen not to have the death penalty in their state systems     I am sympathetic because Vermont  like Puerto Rico  is a non death penalty    state that nonetheless has seen this Justice Department seek the death    penalty in that jurisdiction      Through all of this  the leadership of the Department of Justice has kept    its decision making on these life or death issues quiet  out of the light of    day  It is time for us to shine some light on these issues  and this hearing    is an important start
