       Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Chief Justice Roberts s Year End   Report On The Federal Judiciary                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Comments Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      D Vt   Incoming Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Chief Justice Robertss Year End Report     On The Federal Judiciary     January 1  2007  Chief Justice Roberts has tackled a      touchy but timely topic that has been a chronic sticking point      between the Judicial and Legislative Branches  He has discussed the      issue of judicial compensation plainly and passionately  and I      commend him for it  He is right that the issue of judicial      compensation relates to the issue of the independence of the      judiciary  which is important to all Americans and to our system of      government    Some of us have tried over the years      to improve the compensation of judges  and I intend again to do what      I can to convince Congress to fairly evaluate this issue and the      Chiefs arguments  so that we can see what solutions may be      possible   In the last congressional session I      supported a cost of living increase for judges that was not enacted      but should have been  That step should be an early item of business      that the new Congress can accomplish  About four years ago  the      last time Congress missed making a scheduled cost of living      adjustment for the judiciary  I sponsored remedial legislation that      was enacted  I have also joined in introducing bills for general      increases in judicial compensation  which the Republican led      Congress failed to enact  I hope Congress and the President will      reconsider such measures this year and will do their duty when it      comes to fair compensation for the independent judiciary
