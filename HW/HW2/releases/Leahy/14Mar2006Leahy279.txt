       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The Court s Decision To Limit Data   Released To The Justice Department Undert Its Subpoena Of Internet Search   Records                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Reaction of        Sen  Patrick Leahy         Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee         To The Courts Decision To Limit Data Released        To The Justice Department        Under Its Subpoena Of Internet Search Records       March 14  2006    The privacy        protections of millions of law abiding Americans who search        the Internet have been vindicated by this decision  By        scaling back the amount of search data that the Government        is allowed to obtain from Google  the Court preserved the        basic privacy rights of so many of us who use the Internet        every  day      This case        demonstrates the serious potential for personal data held by        Web sites like Google to attract the interest of the        Government and other parties  The Department of Justices        collection and use of data relating to the search queries of        law abiding Americans raises serious privacy and civil        liberties concerns     The Courts        ruling makes clear that the Governments broad request for        this sensitive information could chill fundamental Freedom        of Speech rights so important to Americans and erode basic        privacy protections  The Justice Department must take steps        to adequately address these privacy concerns because once we        lose these protections they are hard to win back  I hope        that the Justice Department will carefully consider the        privacy implications posed by requests for such sensitive        information in the future               NOTE         Leahys earlier letter to the Justice Department about the        Google case is available on the
