       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The Introduction Of The AGJOBS Bill                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                     Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The Introduction     Of The Agricultural Job Opportunities  Benefits  And Security Act Of      2007   AGJOBS      January 18  2007  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  today I      join  again  with a bipartisan group of Senators to introduce a bill      to reform our immigration laws concerning foreign agricultural      workers  America s farmers are calling for a greater number of legal      foreign workers  and an improved system for obtaining those workers       We need to likewise ensure meaningful benefits and protections to      the workers who will fill these jobs    I am especially pleased that measures      are included to help dairy farmers  who in my home State of Vermont      are an integral part of our economy  our history  and our culture       Indeed  it is difficult to think of the Green Mountain State without      conjuring up the image of verdant rolling hills dotted with Holstein      cows  The provisions in this bill make the H 2A program more      workable for dairy farmers by lengthening the time period a foreign      worker may remain in the country  providing a process by which an      employer can extend the stay of a worker  and by ensuring that      workers may ultimately apply for an adjustment to permanent legal      resident status    The bill we introduce today goes a      long way toward reforming our H 2A visa program  Along with measures      to help streamline procedures for labor certification by employers       the bill will make it easier for employers to meet their      responsibilities to ensure that available agricultural jobs are      offered first to domestic workers  The bill also makes the process      easier for an employer to apply for an extension to a worker s stay       and makes it easier for a foreign worker to switch jobs during their      stay    The bill includes greater protections      for workers  including the requirement that employers meet the same      motor vehicle safety standards for H 2A workers that are required      for domestic workers  A limited Federal right of action is provided      for H 2A workers to enforce the economic benefits provided under the      H 2A program  or those provided in writing by their employers  More      flexibility is provided for workers and employers by permitting      employers to elect to provide a housing allowance  instead of      housing  These are but a few of the positive reforms contained in      the bill    The bill also contains a procedure by      which undocumented workers who have been working in agriculture can      apply for a   blue card    a system where through consistent      employment  a fine  proof of the payment of taxes  and proof of no      serious criminal history  an undocumented worker can continue his or      her contribution legally  and eventually adjust his or her status       The   blue card   program encourages family unification by making      special provisions for spouses and children of the card holder  The      program also has a numerical cap and the built in safeguard of a      sunset provision    These reforms are a commonsense      response that should help meet the needs of our farmers without      burdening them with an unduly  time consuming procedure for securing      legal workers  The bill represents an effort to meet both the needs      of agricultural employers while respecting the rights and interests      of agricultural workers  and is an example of a bipartisan group of      legislators listening and responding to the interests of all parties      affected    I join with other Senators in      recognizing the needs of our modern economy  and the needs of the      American farmer as well as the rights of the individuals who make up      the backbone of many farming operations  Working together we can      ensure that no American farmer is put in the position of having to      choose between obeying the law and making a living  and that no      willing worker is denied a chance to work
