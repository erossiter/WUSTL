       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Nomination Of William Myers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy        On The Nomination Of William Myers        March 1  2005 Last week  Chairman Specter held a news conference and        demonstrated his determination  his statesmanship and his ambitious agenda        for this Committee in the months ahead  Democrats and Republicans on the        Judiciary Committee are delighted to see him back so soon in such fine form        and good humor  He outlined the bipartisan progress that we are making        together on several efforts  including asbestos legislation and hearings        the committee will hold on privacy and identity theft issues  He also        talked about the conflict between the White House and the Senate over        controversial judicial nominees   I welcome the improved tone he has brought to this        last topic  and I think he and I agree that this conflict is unnecessary         I think we agree that it would serve the country far better to have        nominees who do not divide the Senate and the American people  and that the        President should    as I have been urging him to for some time    work more        closely with the Senate to avoid problems before they arise here  The        Chairman was correct to recognize the role the Constitution envisions for        the Senate in the lifetime appointment of federal judges  and to defend the        right of the minority to express itself in a democracy  As Senator Isakson        explained just a few weeks ago in remarks on the Senate floor  those        minority rights in general  and the filibuster in particular  are crucial        to maintaining a democratic government and fair society  Since the President began his first term  in 2001         Democrats in the Judiciary Committee and in the Senate have been        cooperating to a remarkable degree in confirming the Presidents judicial        nominees  In his first term 204 judges were confirmed to lifetime        appointments on the federal circuit and district courts  That is more than        were confirmed in his fathers term  more than in either of Ronald Reagans        terms  and more than in President Clintons second term  When I became        Chairman in June of 2001 and held the first judicial nomination hearing of        the term  there were 110 vacancies on the federal courts  most due to the        delay and inaction on President Clintons nominees  Through hard work and        cooperation over the last four years  that number has plummeted  and at the        end of the last Congress had reached a 14 year low of 27  There no longer        is a vacancy crisis in the federal courts  and each of us on this Committee        ought to be proud of our part in solving it   However  much as we have worked together on both sides        of the aisle to fill an impressive number of vacancies by any measure         President Bush continues to insist on a handful of extreme  activist        nominees to key positions on some circuit courts  Even after the Senate         through the use of long standing rules  has denied confirmation to these        nominees and has made clear that they are highly controversial within the        Senate and to the American people  the President has continued to support        them and send them back time and again to the Senate  He did it again just        a few weeks ago  when he renominated 20 candidates for federal judgeships         seven of whom have already been considered by the Senate  and others about        whom he knows there is great controversy and disagreement  By sending        these nominations back to the Senate he is choosing partisan politics over        good policy and obstructing our ability to fill the few remaining        vacancies   The nominee before us today  William Myers  is among        those already examined  and the Senate has withheld its consent to his        lifetime appointment  This nomination was rejected for its partisanship        and lack of distinguished qualifications  Instead of trying to change the        vote on this nomination  the President would be well advised to work with        the Senate to find a consensus nominee to fill the vacancy on the Ninth        Circuit  That would go a long way toward avoiding the kind of debacle the        Chairman so rightly predicts could ensue if we continue on the path this        nomination represents  I agree with what the Democratic Leader has said about        the already considered judicial nominees  and I too expect that the outcome        of this nomination will not change if we are pushed to consider it again in        Committee and on the Senate Floor  I still oppose the confirmation of Mr         Myers to the Ninth Circuit for all of the reasons I laid out last July  I        still believe Mr  Myers to be perhaps the most anti environmental judicial        nominee sent to the Senate in my 30 years in representing Vermont in the        U S  Senate  I still believe that the nomination of William Myers to the        United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit is an example of how        this President has misused his power of appointments to the federal bench         I still believe Mr  Myers is not independent enough to receive confirmation        for a lifetime appointment to this federal circuit court  Nothing has        changed   To the contrary  since we last had the opportunity to        talk about Mr  Myers nomination  more questions have arisen  Today the        nominee will be given another opportunity to make his case and explain why        he is entitled to a lifetime appointment to the federal court  Today we        will resume the process of seeking answers to questions about this        nomination  The Committee is right to follow regular order through this        hearing   In particular  I have questions about Mr  Myers        relationship with and role in rewarding a lawyer who worked for him  and        who was recently found by the Department of Interiors Inspector General to        have been responsible for arranging a sweetheart deal to a politically        well connected rancher  I was not satisfied with his answers to our        previous questions about his total disregard for the concerns of the Native        Americans of the Quechen Tribe in the Glamis Mine case  and I have some        questions for him about recent developments in the Oil Dri case where a        state court has just rejected his legal arguments that would have protected        big business over the objections of another Native American tribe  Let me remind those listening of the basis for my        opposition to this nomination  Mr  Myers hometown newspaper warned that        as Solicitor at the Department of the Interior   Mr   Myers sounds less        like an attorney  and more like an apologist for his old friends in the        cattle industry  He has a record of extremism when it comes to his        opposition to environmental protections  having gone as far as comparing        the federal governments management of public lands to the tyrannical        actions of King George over the American colonies         Anti Environmental Activism I have carefully reviewed the record that Mr  Myers has        logged in private practice and in the Bush Administration  I asked him a        series of questions at his hearing last February and later in writing         after that hearing  Last year we afforded Mr  Myers the opportunity to be        heard and to make his case that he would be a fair and impartial        adjudicator if confirmed to the federal bench  Based on the record  the        only conclusion I was able to reach was that  if confirmed  Mr  Myers would        be an anti environmental activist on the bench  despite President Bushs        claim that the President opposes judicial activism  Apparently not  it        seems  when the judicial activism is aimed against the environment or is        tinged with ideology that this Administration favors  Todays hearing        gives Mr  Myers an additional opportunity to be heard and to make his        case  He should explain his consistent record of using whatever position        and authority he has had to fight for corporate interests at the expense of        the environment and at the expense of the interests of the American people        in environmental protections   For 22 years  Mr  Myers has been an outspoken        antagonist of long established environmental protections  usually wearing        the hat of a paid lobbyist for industry  This is not a case of a        representation of a defendant in a single case  He has chosen this career        for which he has been amply rewarded both monetarily and by positions in        the Bush Administration  An attorney also has a duty to follow the law and  on        more than one occasion  Mr  Myers advocacy has pushed the limits of the        law  As The New York Times editorialized  Mr  Myers regularly took        positions that     would have had a devastating impact on the environment         As the chief lawyer at the Department of the Interior         Mr  Myers disregarded the law in order to make it easier for companies to        mine on public lands  a position consistent with his prior role lobbying        for mining interests while he was in private practice  He interpreted the        mining law in a way that would have allowed the reversal of Secretary        Babbitts rejection of a permit for Glamis Mining Co  on land in the        Southeastern California desert  Fortunately  an independent review by a        federal court concluded that Mr  Myers interpretation was wrong  The        court called into question his ability to interpret a statute as he        violated three well established canons of statutory construction  In        addition  he acted without government to government consultation with the        Quechan Indian Nation  a federally recognized tribe  or other Colorado        River Tribes  before taking action to imperil their sacred places   As Solicitor General at the Interior Department  Mr         Myers encouraged two Northern California congressmen to sponsor legislation        that would have given a private firm eight acres of valuable federal land        in Yuba County  California  Recognizing that the government did not have        the right to turn over the land without compensation  he told the        landowners that the department would support private relief legislation        to accomplish that goal  The Department has since withdrawn its support        for the private relief bill after its own agents produced readily available        documents that conclusively proved that the government owned the land  Mr  Myers record on the environment would raise        serious concerns no matter where he would be sitting as a judge  However         it is especially disturbing given the court to which he has been        nominated  William Myers has been nominated to a circuit court with        jurisdiction over an area of the country which contains hundreds of        millions of acres of national parks  national forests and other public        lands  tribal lands  and sacred sites  Judges on the Ninth Circuit decide        legal disputes concerning the use and conservation of many of the most        spectacular and sacred lands in America and often make the final decision        on critical mining  grazing  logging  recreation  endangered species         coastal  wilderness  and other issues affecting the nations natural        heritage  Judges on the Ninth Circuit are also the arbiters on treaty         statutory  trust relationship  and other issues affecting American Indian        tribal governments  Native Americans  and Alaska Native groups  The Ninth        Circuit plays an enormous and pivotal role in interpreting and applying a        broad range of environmental rules and protections that are important to        millions of Americans  and to future generations of Americans   At stake is the longstanding acceptance of the        Constitutions commerce clause as the source of congressional authority to        enact safeguards to protect our air  water  and land  In Solid Waste        Agency of Northern Cook County v  U S  Army Corps of Engineers  Mr  Myers submitted an amicus brief arguing that the Commerce Clause does        not support the United States Army Corps of Engineers jurisdiction over        isolated  intrastate waters on the basis that they are or have the        potential to be migratory bird habitat  Mr  Myers position raises        concerns whether his extremely narrow view of the scope of the        Constitutions commerce clause would undermine our nations environmental         health  safety  labor  disability and civil rights laws   At stake are environmental protections which can be struck        down if taxpayers do not pay polluters  according to the extreme expansion        of the takings clause that some judges have begun to adopt  Mr  Myers has        taken this extreme view by arguing that property rights should receive the        same level of constitutional scrutiny as free speech  His position raises        concerns that he will interpret as takings the very laws implemented by        Congress to protect our lands and our environment   At stake is the true meaning of the Constitutions Eleventh        Amendment and the right of citizens to sue to enforce environmental        protections  In an era of ballooning government deficits and cuts in        environmental enforcement budgets  there is much at stake if courts        eliminate or minimize the critical role of private attorneys general who        are needed to ensure that polluters are complying with federal mandates         Mr  Myers has gone so far as to argue that judges should take a more active        role in reducing lawsuits brought by environmentalists by requiring        non profit environmental organizations to post a bond for payment of costs        and damages that could be suffered by any opposing party  He wrote         Environmentalists are mountain biking to the courthouse as never before         bent on stopping human activity wherever it may promote health  safety and        welfare  These positions raise concerns that plaintiffs in his courtroom        who are members of environmental organizations will not be treated fairly  Systematic Use        Of Courts To Undermine Environmental Protection For the last four years  the Bush Administration has        systematically  and often stealthily  set out to undermine the basic        safeguards that have been used by administrations of both parties to        protect the environment  One way the Bush Administration has demonstrated        its contempt for our nations environmental laws is in the court system  A        Defenders of Wildlife study covering the Administrations first two years        noted how its agencies argued in court  Amazingly  in cases where the        Administration had a chance to defend the National Environmental Protection        Act  NEPA   more than 50 percent of the time it presented arguments in        court which would weaken NEPA  Similarly  the Administration argued to        weaken the Endangered Species Act  ESA  more than 60 percent of the time  Despite the Administrations arguments against the        environmental laws it is entrusted with protecting  and despite the        deference customarily paid to Executive agencies in federal court  the        independent federal judiciary  thus far  has generally upheld our        longstanding environmental laws  The courts ruled against the        Administrations arguments to weaken NEPA 78 percent of the time  and ruled        against the Administrations arguments to weaken the ESA an astounding 89        percent of the time  Further illustrating how important the judiciary has        become for environmental protection    particularly in the absence of a        commitment to environmental protection by Executive agencies    the League        of Conservation Voters for the first time included a vote on a judicial        nominee on its 2003 scorecard of Senate votes  In the past few years  our        federal courts resisted efforts to weaken the Clean Water Act  the Clean        Air Act  and the Endangered Species Act  The courts protected our National        Monuments from challenges by extremist groups trying to strip them of their        status  upheld air conditioning standards which save energy and money for        consumers  and stopped Administration rollbacks that benefited industry at        the expense of our forests  The result of these court decisions is that        our vital wetlands and rivers are not decimated  diverse species are        protected from extinction  and the standards for air quality are brought        into compliance with the law  There are  however  dark clouds on the horizon  There        are cases pending where the outcomes could affect whether our air is        threatened by toxic chemicals and whether our water and health are        threatened by pollution and pesticides  There are cases pending whether to        allow snowmobiles in our National Parks  whether to allow the        Administration to open up 8 8 million acres of important wildlife habitat        and hunting and fishing grounds in Alaska for oil and gas leasing  whether        pumping dirty water into the Everglades violates the Clean Water Act  and        whether the Administration can open our nations largest National Forest to        logging   How will these cases be decided  Will the federal        courts continue to stand as a bulwark against the Administrations assault        on environmental protection  Consider that in two recent cases  judges        appointed by President Bush dissented  arguing against environmental        protections  In one case  a Bush appointed judge indicated that he might        find the Endangered Species Act unconstitutional  and  in the other case  a        Bush judge would have ruled to make it harder for public interest groups to        prevent irreparable environmental harm through injunctive relief while        claims are pending  What if President Bush succeeds in appointing more        like minded judges and these Bush judges become the majority next time         positioned to strike down vital environmental protections  This is the        type of judicial activism against established precedent that President Bush        says he deplores  yet he nominates and appoints judges who engage in        wholesale judicial activism  The Bush Administration has already proposed more        rollbacks to our environmental safeguards  aiming to benefit industry at        the expense of the publics interest in clean air and water  our public        lands  and some of our most fragile wildlife populations  While today we        have a federal judiciary which has in many instances prevented this        Administrations attempts to roll back important environmental laws and        protections  in the future we may not be so fortunate  Today  the        appellate courts in this country have tilted out of balance with Republican        appointees  The American people expect good stewardship of the nations        air  water and public lands  and the American people deserve that  Judges        have a duty to enforce the protections imposed by environmental laws  The        Senate has a duty to make sure that we do not put judges on the bench whose        activism and personal ideology would prevent fair and impartial        adjudication and would circumvent environmental protections that Congress        intended to benefit the American people and generations to come   An editorial in The Boston Globe recognized         When the White House is in the clutches of the oil  coal  mining  and        timber companies  as it is now  the best defenders of laws to protect the        environment are often federal judges  The editorial concludes that if the        Senate confirms William Myers  the judicial check in this administrations        unbalanced policies will be weakened  For almost his entire 22 year legal career  Mr  Myers        has worked in Washington    in political positions for Republican        Administrations and as a lobbyist  He received a partial Not Qualified        rating from the American Bar Association  the ABAs lowest passing grade         He has minimal courtroom experience  having never tried a jury case and        having never served as counsel in any criminal litigation  It seems clear        that William Myers was nominated not for his fitness to serve as a lifetime        member of the federal judiciary but rather as a reward for serving the        political aims of the Administration   The Swoosh Of The Revolving Door When Mr  Myers was appointed to his legal post at the        Department of the Interior  some described it as putting a fox in charge of        the henhouse  Another metaphor that comes to mind is the revolving door        that is emblematic of so many of this Administrations appointments         especially to sensitive environmental posts  Mr  Myers Interior        appointment was the first swoosh of the revolving door  His nomination        by President Bush to one of the highest courts in the land completes the        cycle  Mr  Myers is one of several nominees who have come before us        because they are being awarded lifetime appointments to the federal courts        based not primarily on their qualifications for the office  but as part of        a spoils system for those who are well connected and have served the        political aims of the Bush Administration   So many of President Clintons judicial nominees upon        whom the Senate took no action seemed to have been penalized for their        government service or for having supported the President  Elena Kagan         James Lyons  Kent Markus and so many others never received hearings  and        their nominations were defeated through Republican inaction and        obstruction  without explanation  With a Republican President  Senate        Republicans have reversed their field and position  We have already        confirmed to lifetime appointments a number of Administration and        Republican connected candidates  including Judge Prost  Judge McConnell         Judge Cassell  Judge Shedd  Judge Wooten  Judge Chertoff  Judge Hudson         Judge Clark  and Judge Bybee  On that last nomination  it is clear we        moved too hastily and without knowing enough about his involvement in        devising legal interpretations governing detention and interrogation that        have led to a national and international scandal   The list of those who are deeply concerned about  and        who have felt compelled to oppose this nomination has been long and it        continues to lengthen  More than 172 environmental  Native American         labor  civil rights  disability rights  womens rights and other        organizations have signed a letter opposing Mr  Myers confirmation to the        Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals   The National Congress of American Indians  a coalition        of more than 250 tribal governments  unanimously approved a resolution        opposing Mr  Myers nomination  The National Wildlife Federation  which        has never opposed a judicial nomination by any president in its 68 year        history  wrote   Mr  Myers has so firmly        established a public record of open hostility to environmental protections        as to undermine any contention that he could bring an impartial perspective        to the issues of wildlife and natural resource conservation that come        before the court  Indeed  Mr  Myers is distinguished precisely by the        ideological rigidity that marks his positions on these issues  A letter from the California Legislature  signed by        the Senate President Pro Tem  the Chair of the Senate Natural Resources        Committee  and the Chair of the Senate Environmental Quality Committee         strongly opposing Mr  Myers nomination  told the Judiciary Committee  Mr  Myers record as        Interior Solicitor of favoring the interests of the grazing and mining        industries over the rights of Native Americans and the environment  coupled        with his long history as an extreme advocate for those industries  cause        serious doubts on his willingness or ability to put aside his personal        views in performing his official duties  I have great regard for the Senators from Idaho  I        have affection for the former Senator from Wyoming  who was my colleague on        the Judiciary Committee for many years and who I consider a friend  In        deference to them  I have examined Mr  Myers record and asked myself        whether I could support this nomination  I could not last year  and I        cannot now
