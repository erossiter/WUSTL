       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Testimony Of Ms  Sara Taylor  Former   Director Of White House Office Of Political Affairs                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Testimony Of Ms  Sara Taylor       Former Director Of White House Office Of Political Affairs      July 7  2007       WASHINGTON  Saturday  July 7   The attorney representing Sara      Taylor  former Director of the Office of Political Affairs in the      White House       today to Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt       In the letter  Neil Eggleston wrote that he expects the White House      attempt to prevent Ms  Taylor from testifying before the Committee      on Wednesday  July 11  pursuant to a subpoena that was issued to Ms       Taylor as part of the panels ongoing investigation into the      unprecedented firings of several prosecutors and politicization      within the Department of Justice  Below is Chairman Leahys comment      on the letter   I look forward to      Ms  Taylor testifying next week to comply with a subpoena authorized      bythe Judiciary Committee It is unfortunate that the White House      is trying to interfere with Ms  Taylors testimony before the Senate      and with Congresss responsibility to get to the truth behind the      unprecedented firings of several U S  Attorneys  There is clear      evidence that Ms  Taylor was one of several White House officials      who played a key role in these firings and the Administrations      response to cover up the reasons behind them when questions first      arose  There is also clear evidence that Ms  Taylor was part of      more than 66 000 RNC e mails that have been kept hidden from the      public as part of a White House wide effort to avoid oversight by      ignoring the laws meant to ensure a public record of official      government business   The White House      continues to try to have it both ways  to block Congress from      talking with witnesses and accessing documents and other evidence      while saying nothing improper occurred  I hope the White House      stops this stonewalling and accepts my offer to negotiate a workable      solution to the Committees oversight requests  as so many previous      White Houses have done throughout history
