Foremost Right To Know Law  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  June     27   Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt       Wednesday noted the upcoming 41st anniversary of the Freedom     of

FOIA for the     first time in ten years    Introduced jointly by     Senators Leahy and John Cornyn  R Texas   the bill has broad support in     the Senate  The Judiciary Committee approved it earlier this year  but     the bill has been stalled on the Senate floor since then by a Republican     hold   Responsive government and     transparent decision making are bedrock American values  Leahy said      FOIA honors and helps translate those values into practice  and the     OPEN Government Act will help FOIA work better in serving the publics     interest    Statement    Of     Senator Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  Commemorating  The 41st     Anniversary    Of The Freedom of Information Act    And Urging Passage  Of  The OPEN Government Act    June 27  2007  Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  on July 4th      the Nation will celebrate the 41st anniversary of the Freedom     of Information Act  FOIA   landmark legislation that has guaranteed     the publics right to know for generations of Americans  Regrettably      the Senate will mark this very important anniversary without having     passed the Openness Promotes     Effectiveness in our National Government Act  the OPEN     Government Act   S 849  comprehensive legislation that Senator Cornyn     and I introduced earlier this year to strengthen and reinvigorate FOIA     for all Americans    Responsive government and transparent     decision making are bedrock American values  FOIA honors and helps     translate those values into practice  and the OPEN Government Act will     help FOIA work better in serving the publics interest   The Judiciary Committee favorably reported     this bipartisan legislation in April  But a Republican hold is delaying     consideration of this important FOIA reform bill  The Senate Republican     leadership has also ignored requests to debate this bill on the Senate    Floor      needlessly stalling     these long overdue  bipartisan reforms to strengthen FOIA    The     Timeless Legacy of FOIA  For more than four decades  FOIAs     timeless values of openness and transparency in government have ensured     access to government information  Just this week  we witnessed the     great value of FOIA in shedding light on a controversial policy within     the Office of the Vice President regarding the handling of classified     information  with news reports that a FOIA request to the Justice     Department first revealed that the Attorney General may have delayed a     review into the legality of this troubling policy   Although FOIA remains an indispensable     tool in shedding light on bad policies and government abuses  this open     government law is being hampered by excessive delays and lax FOIA     compliance  Today  Americans who seek information under FOIA remain     less likely to obtain it than during any other time in FOIAs 40 plus     year history  According to the National Security Archive  an     independent research institute  the oldest outstanding FOIA requests     date back to 1989  before the collapse of the Soviet Union     Moreover  more than a year after the     Presidents FOIA executive order to improve agency FOIA performance      FOIA backlogs are at an all time     high  According to a recent report by the Government Accountability     Office  federal agencies had 43 percent more FOIA requests pending and     outstanding in 2006 than in 2002  In addition  the percentage of FOIA     requestors who obtained at least some of the information that they     requested from the Government declined by 31 percent in 2006  according     to a study by the Coalition of Journalists for Open Government    A Wise Investment in     our Democracy  As the first major reform to FOIA in    more than     a decade  the OPEN     Government Act would help to reverse these troubling trends and to     restore the publics trust in their government  In so doing   this bill is a fitting tribute to FOIA and a wise investment in     our American Democracy   The OPEN Government Act promotes and     enhances public disclosure of government information under FOIA by     helping Americans to obtain timely responses to their FOIA requests      This bill also improves transparency in the federal governments FOIA     process by     Restoring      meaningful deadlines for agency action under FOIA      Imposing real      consequences on federal agencies for missing FOIAs 20 day statutory      deadline     Clarifying that      FOIA applies to government records held by outside private      contractors     Establishing a FOIA      hotline service for all federal agencies  and    Creating a FOIA      Ombudsman to provide FOIA requestors and federal agencies with a      meaningful alternative to costly litigation     Let me also be clear about what this bill     does not do  This bill does not harm or impede in any way the     Governments ability to withhold or protect classified information      Classified  national security and homeland security related information     are all expressly exempt from FOIAs disclosure mandate and this bill     does nothing to alter these important exemptions  Senator Cornyn and I     have also offered an amendment to this bill that would preserve the     right of federal agencies to assert these and other FOIA exemptions      even if agencies miss the 20 day statutory deadline under FOIA   The OPEN Government Act is cosponsored by     a bipartisan group of 13 Senators  including the bills lead Republican     cosponsor  Senator Cornyn  This bill is also endorsed by more than 115     business  public interest  and news organizations from across the     political and ideological spectrum  including the American Library     Association  the U S  Chamber of Commerce  OpenTheGovernment org  Public     Citizen  the Republican Liberty Caucus  the Sunshine in Government     Initiative and the Vermont Press Association  I thank all of the     cosponsors of this bill for their commitment to open government  I also     thank the many organizations that have endorsed the OPEN Government Act     for their support of this legislation    The OPEN Government Act is a     good government bill that Democrats and Republicans  alike  can and     should work together to enact  If there are legitimate concerns with     this bill  those concerns should be openly debated and the Senate should     promptly pass this legislation    Senator Cornyn and I both     know that open government is not a Democratic issue or a Republican     issue  It is an American issue  It is in this bipartisan spirit that I     urge the Senate to promptly consider the OPEN Government Act and that I     encourage all Senators to support this important FOIA reform     legislation     I ask unanimous consent that     a list of the bills supporters be printed in the  Record     following my remarks
