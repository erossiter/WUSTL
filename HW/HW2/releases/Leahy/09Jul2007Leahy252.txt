       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Confirmations                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee    On Judicial Confirmations    July 9  2007  The Senate continues to make progress today with     what I anticipate will be four more confirmations of lifetime     appointments to the federal bench  The judicial nominations include     three nominations for lifetime appointments to     the District Court for the Western District of Michigan  Janet T  Neff      Paul Lewis Maloney  and Robert James Jonker     All three are for vacancies that are     judicial emergency vacancies that should have been filled long ago  All     three have the support of the Michigan Senators  Today we also consider     the nomination of Liam OGrady to the District     Court for the Eastern District of Virginia  another seat determined by     the Administrative Office of the U S  Courts to be a judicial     emergency  I thank Senators Levin  Stabenow  Warner and Webb for     their work in connection with these nominations   It is unfortunate that the three nominees for the     Western District of Michigan are not already on the bench helping to     ease the backlog of cases in that district  All three were reported out     of Committee last fall  but were left pending on the Senates Executive     Calendar when some on the other side of the aisle blocked their     nominations  All three are for vacancies that are judicial emergency     vacancies  three emergencies in one federal district  The Senators     from Michigan had worked with the White House on the Presidents     nomination of three nominees to fill those emergency vacancies  Working     with then Chairman Specter  the Democratic Members of the Committee     cooperated to expedite their consideration and reported them to the     Senate last year  But last year Republicans were objecting to Senate     votes on some of President Bushs judicial nominees  According to press     accounts  Senator Brownback had placed a hold on Judge Neffs     nomination  apparently related to her attendance at a commitment     ceremony held by some family friends several years ago in     Massachusetts   The Michigan nominations were not returned to the     Senate by the President at the beginning of this year  Instead  their     renominations were inexplicably delayed for months  When they were     renominated  Senator Brownback sought another hearing on the nomination     of Judge Neff  As Chairman  I honored his request  At that second     hearing in May  Senator Brownback again questioned Judge Neff     extensively about her attending the commitment ceremony of a family     friend  I then placed the nomination on our agenda and the Judiciary     Committee reported it favorably for a second time   It is time to act on the group of Michigan     nominations at long last  There is a dire situation in the Western     District of Michigan  Judge Robert Holmes Bell  Chief Judge of the     Western District  wrote to us about the situation in that district      where several judges on senior statusone over 90 years oldcontinue to     carry heavy caseloads to ensure that justice is administered in that     district  Judge Bell is the only active judge   The four nominations before us will bring this     years judicial confirmations total to 25  It is our first day back     after the July 4th recess  and we have already confirmed one     and a half times as many judges as were confirmed during the entire 1996     session when President Clintons nominees were being reviewed by a     Republican Senate majority  That was the session in which not a     single circuit court nominee was confirmed  We have already confirmed     three circuit court judges in the early months of this session  As I     have previously noted  that also puts us well ahead of the pace     established by the Republican majority in 1999 when to this date not a     single circuit court nomination had yet been confirmed  This also     exceeds the total of 22 judges confirmed in all of 2005   With these confirmations  the Senate will have     confirmed 125 judges while I have served as Judiciary Chairman  During     the more than six years of the Bush Presidency  more circuit court     judges  more district court judges  and more total judges have been     confirmed while I served as Judiciary Chairman than during the tenures     of either of the two Republican Chairmen working with Republican Senate     majorities   I have listed another four judicial nominations on     the agenda for our business meeting later this week and will be noticing     another hearing on judicial nominations on July 19  I do not intend to     follow the Republican example and pocket filibuster more than 60 of this     Presidents nominees as they did President Clintons nominees   The Administrative Office of the U S  Courts lists     47 judicial vacancies after these nominations are confirmed  yet the     President has sent us only 22 nominations for these vacancies  Twenty     five of these vacancies  over half  have no nominee  Of the 13     vacancies deemed by the Administrative Office to be judicial     emergencies  the President has yet to send us nominees for eight of     them  That means over half of the judicial emergency vacancies are     without a nominee  Of the 15 circuit court vacancies  two thirds are     without a nominee  If the President had worked with the Senators from     Rhode Island  New Jersey  Maryland  California  Michigan  and the other     states with the remaining circuit vacancies  we could be in position to     make even more progress   As it is  we have cut the circuit vacancies nearly     in half  from 26 to 15  Contrast that with the way the Republican led     Senates lack of action on President Clintons moderate and qualified     nominees resulted in circuit court vacancies increasing from 17 to 26     and beyond  During most of the Clinton years  the Republican led Senate     engaged in strenuous efforts to keep circuit judgeships vacant in     anticipation of a Republican President  To a great extent they     succeeded   The Judiciary Committee has been working hard to     make progress on those nominations the President has sent to us  Of     course  when he sends us well qualified  consensus nominees with the     support of his home state Senators like those before us today  we can     have success   Judge OGrady is a Magistrate Judge in the U S      District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia  where he has sat     since 2003  Previously  he was a partner in the
