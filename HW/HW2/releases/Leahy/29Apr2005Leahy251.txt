       Leahy Presses For Comprehensive Probe Of Prisoner Abuse                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT          Leahy Presses For Comprehensive      Probe Of Prisoner Abuse A Year Later  Inquiries      Have Focused on Rank And File     Rather Than Higher Chain of Command  WASHINGTON       Friday  April 29     Marking the passage of one year since the      discovery of disturbing photos of prisoner abuse inside Abu Ghraib      prison  Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt   has pressed for a candid and      comprehensive investigation into the scandal that shocked the world      and tarnished the nations reputation as human rights leader       Leahy  the ranking Democratic member of the Senate Judiciary      Committee  has been a persistent critic of the piecemeal      investigations into the detainee abuse scandal and renewed earlier      calls for a wide ranging inquiry that looks beyond the rank and file      and up the chain of command  Below is Leahys statement placed in      the Congressional Record on Thursday      Statement of Senator Patrick Leahy      Marking Passage of One Year Since The Discovery      Of Abuse At Abu Ghraib Prison     April 28  2005 One year ago today  the horrific photos of      detainee abuse at Abu Ghraib prison shocked the nation and tarnished      our reputation as the worlds human rights leader  One year later       we should be able to assure the world that the detainee abuse      scandal has been independently and comprehensively investigated and      that all those involved  from the people who committed abuses to the      officials who set these policies in motion  have been held      accountable  Sadly  we cannot give the world this assurance  The      Administration continues to stonewall on the prisoner abuse scandal      and Congress continues to abdicate its oversight responsibility on      this issue   Those of us in the Congress who strongly      believe that oversight and accountability are paramount to restoring      Americas reputation as a human rights leader remain stymied in our      efforts to learn the truth about how this Administrations policies      trickled down from offices in Washington to cellblocks in Abu Ghraib       This Senate refuses to consider an independent commission  relying      instead on the piecemeal investigations conducted by the military       none of which adequately address the significant role of the Central      Intelligence Agency in interrogations  With the completion of each      of the Pentagon investigations  the need for a comprehensive       independent investigation becomes all the more evident  I am particularly disturbed by recent press      reports about the Army Inspector Generals investigation into the      Abu Ghraib abuse scandal  Although the report has not yet been      publicly released  the press accounts state that Lt  Gen  Ricardo      Sanchez has been cleared by the Army of all allegations of      wrongdoing and likely will not face punishment   In order to understand why the reported      findings of the Army Inspector General are troubling  and why an      independent investigation is necessary  we need only consult the      reports of prior investigations  The Jones investigation  referring      to the Combined Joint Task Force led by Lt  Gen  Sanchez  stated       Inaction at the CJTF 7 staff level may have  contributed to the      failure to discover and prevent abuses before January 2004  The      Jones report concluded that Lt  Gen  Sanchez failed to ensure      proper staff oversight of detention and interrogation operations  The Schlesinger investigation is even more      critical of Lt  Gen  Sanchezs role in the detainee abuse scandal       The Schlesinger panel described how Lt  Gen  Sanchez relied upon the      interrogation policy from Guantanamo Bay to develop interrogation      procedures for Iraq  The result of this  as the Schlesinger panel      correctly states  was that policies approved for use on al Qaeda      and Taliban detainees who were not afforded the protection of  Enemy      Prisoner of War  status under the Geneva Conventions now applied to      detainees who did fall under the Geneva Convention protections       The Schlesinger report continued  Despite lacking specific      authorization to operate beyond the confines of the Geneva      Conventions   Lt  Gen  Sanchez  nonetheless determined it was within       his  command discretion to classify  as unlawful combatants       individuals captured during  Operation Iraqi Freedom   The panel      also found that Lt  Gen  Sanchez was responsible for establishing      the confused command relationship at the Abu Ghraib prison and the      unclear chain of command established by CJTF 7  combined with the      poor leadership and lack of supervision  contributed to the      atmosphere at Abu Ghraib that allowed the abuses to take place  The findings of the Jones and the Schlesinger      investigations regarding the decisions of Lt  Gen  Sanchez are      troubling on their own  Equally troubling is the indication that      Lt  Gen  Sanchez gave inaccurate testimony before the Senate Armed      Services Committee  In an Armed Services Committee hearing on May      19  2004  Senator Jack Reed asked Lt  Gen  Sanchez if he had      approved sleep deprivation  intimidation by guard dogs  excessive      noise  and inducing fear as interrogation methods for use in Abu      Ghraib prison  Lt  Gen  Sanchez replied that  I never approved any      of those measures to be used within CJTF 7 at any time in the last      year  His statement is seemingly contradicted by a document      recently released by the Pentagon in response to litigation under      the Freedom of Information Act  A September 14  2003  memo from Lt       Gen  Sanchez authorized specific interrogation methods for use in      Iraq  including the use of military working dogs to exploit Arab      fear of dogs  the use of sleep management and stress positions  and      inducing fear through yelling  loud music  and light control  There has been some speculation in the media      about whether Gen  Sanchezs actions in Iraq will stand in the way      of his promotion and fourth star  But involvement in the prisoner      abuse scandal is hardly a career ending event in this      Administration  Alberto Gonzales  the central figure in formulating      the Administrations interrogation and detention policies  was      promoted to Attorney General  Former Assistant Attorney General Jay      Bybee  author of the deeply flawed and now repudiated torture      memo  received a lifetime appointment to the Court of Appeals for      the Ninth Circuit  Defense Department General Counsel William J       Haynes insisted that the Pentagon Working Group use the Bybee      torture memo  rather than the Geneva Conventions  as the legal      foundation for interrogation techniques  he has been nominated to      the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  Former CIA Director      George Tenet authorized the extraordinary rendition of detainees      to countries where they were reported to have been tortured  he was      awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom  Secretary Rumsfeld      personally approved objectionable interrogation techniques and      admitted to hiding detainees from the International Committee of the      Red Cross  he is one of the few cabinet members asked to remain in      the second Bush term  Allowing senior officials and military officers      to avoid accountability sets a dangerous precedent  It is time for      Congress  even this Republican led Congress  to recognize its      constitutional obligation to conduct vigorous oversight  We must      send a message that no one in the chain of command  from an      enlisted private stationed in Iraq to the commander in chief  is      above the laws of our Nation  Many Republicans argue that another      investigation will hurt the morale of our troops serving overseas       On the contrary  I believe that morale is hurt when the only      individuals who have been punished for detainee abuse are      low ranking soldiers and those fighting on the front lines  while      those at the highest levels of power continue to set policy and act      with impunity   Chairman Warner recently announced that he will      hold an Armed Services Committee hearing to examine the adequacy of      the various Pentagon and military investigations  I commend the      Chairman for announcing this hearing  and hope that the supporters      of an independent investigation are given the opportunity to testify      before the Committee  In a letter last September  eight retired      generals and admirals asked President Bush to appoint a prisoner      abuse commission modeled on the 9 11 Commission  In that letter       the officers stated  internal investigations by their nature       suffer from a critical lack of independence  Americans have never      thought it wise or fair for one branch of government to police      itself  I hope that Members of the Armed Services Committee will      consider these words when they evaluate the Pentagons      investigations  April 28  2004  will remain a dark day in      American history  but the Administrations handling of this scandal      only adds to our disgrace  There will always be scandals and      tragedies in a nations history  What makes America special is that      we do not hide from these issues  we investigate them  learn from      our mistakes  and make sure they do not happen again       Unfortunately  one year after the disclosure of the Abu Ghraib      photos  we still have much to learn
