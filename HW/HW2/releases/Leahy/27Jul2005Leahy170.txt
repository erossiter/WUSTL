       Statement Of Senator Patrick leahy On The Designation Of Robert G    Roberts Jr  To Be Nomiated To The United States Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of      Senator Patrick Leahy     Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee      On The Designation Of John G  Roberts Jr      To Be Nominated To The  United States      Supreme Court  Senate Floor Remarks      July 27  2005  It is now more than a week since      President Bush made a dramatic evening announcement of his intention      to nominate John G  Roberts Jr  to succeed Justice Sandra Day      OConnor on the United States Supreme Court  Though the Senate has      not yet received the nomination  we are well along in our      preparatory work for the Senates process in considering the      nomination  During the past week some of us have met with Judge      Roberts and urged him to be forthcoming at his upcoming hearing       The Judiciary Committee has already sent the nominee a questionnaire      seeking background information  And  most importantly  Chairman      Specter and I have already begun laying the groundwork for full and      fair hearings  which we are both committed to holding  I expect      that we will soon be able to announce the Judiciary Committees      schedule for those hearings    The process of Senate consideration of      the nomination to fill the vacancy that will be created by the      retirement of Justice OConnor presents obligations to both the      Senate and to the President  It is only through cooperation that      the Senate will be able to fulfill its constitutionally mandated      duty to ensure that those who receive lifetime appointments to our      highest court will protect the rights and liberties of all      Americans  uphold our Constitution and our laws  and apply the law      impartially and independently    Late yesterday the White House      provided some documents from Mr  Robertss time when he served as a      special counsel to Attorney General William French Smith during the      Reagan Administration  Though we had not requested these particular      documents  we appreciate receiving them    There are at least three categories of      documents from Mr  Robertss years in the Executive Branch that are      relevant to this nomination  The second group relates to Mr       Robertss work from 1982 to 1986 as an Associate White House      Counsel  under the supervision of White House Counsel Fred      Fielding  Those are apparently kept in the Reagan Library in  California   Yesterday  in our continuing effort to      expedite the process  we sent a letter to the White House asking      that files from those years be made available without delay  To      speed the process  we identified by name the files we wished to      prioritize  I hope that the reported statements by White House      officials over the last couple of days indicating that they expect      that it will take three to four weeks to make these materials      available are in error and that they can be made available on a      prompt basis  Otherwise it would appear the White House will not be      making those documents available until right before the Senate      hearings  leaving no time to review them  I trust they understand      that would be the wrong way to proceed and risk adding more time to      the process    The third category of files is from      Mr  Robertss work as a political appointee in the Justice      Departments Office of  the Solicitor General       He served as Ken Starrs principal deputy during the prior Bush      Administration  The President alluded to this work in his      statements as contributing to his basis for selecting Judge Roberts      as his nominee  It clearly is appropriate that the Senate also be      entitled to vital information the White House weighed in making its      decision about this nomination  Of course  understanding his work      in this position may be the most informative of the documents      Senators will seek  We could get a practical sense of how  when and      why politics and the law intersect for him  I do not expect for us      to seek production of all of the files on the hundreds of matters on      which Mr  Roberts worked in those critical years  Rather  in our      efforts to cooperate and expedite the process  we are constructing a      targeted catalog of documents  and we hope to work with Chairman      Specter to send a reasonable bipartisan request for a selected group      of those files  I ask that a copy of the letter sent to the White      House yesterday be included at this point in the Record   As we review the documents volunteered      by the White House  we will see whether it is more than the old      trick of flooding us with stacks of unimportant materials in order      to divert attention from those that matter the most  I hope that      the White House will begin to work with us instead of acting      unilaterally and that it will promptly supply the documents we      request    Here is the bottom line so far  The      White House is eager to supply documents it has selected and      provided with great fanfare  We have yet to receive the documents      that we have  in fact  requested  This is a familiar and      unfortunate pattern we have seen too often before in this      Administration  Of course  the White House has available to it all      the documents  The President has spoken about the designees work      in the Reagan White House and at the Bush Justice Department  But      the Executive Branch has yet to share those materials with the      Senate  Other nominations have run into trouble when this White      House has decided to let the Senate see only what the White House      wants the Senate to see   The Senate is supposed to be separate      from the White House under our system  The Constitution gives the      Senate separate responsibilities  requirements and prerogatives in      this process  It is for the Senate    not the White House    to      decide what documents the Senate will need to fulfill its      responsibilities in the confirmation process  The process of      identifying the documents that will help the Senate do its job has      already begun  Such requests  when made  will be reasonable and      limited  I hope the White House will provide the information      requested promptly  Just as the Senates advice and consent      function is one of the great checks and balances embodied in the      Constitution  so  too  is it particularly important in this case to      ensure that a Supreme Court nominee whose government experience has      been dominated by service in the Executive Branch will fulfill the      Supreme Courts independent role as a check on the Executive and a      protector of the rights and liberties of the American people     The Senate will be asked to consider a      lifetime nomination to our highest court  a court established by      the Constitution to exercise the judicial power of the  United States  I have called      the Supreme Court the ultimate check and balance  The Senate has a      duty to the American people of today and tomorrow to get it right       I hope the White House will help and not hinder the Senate in      getting it right  Due diligence on behalf of the American people is      the reason that the Senate examines the document trail that leads a      nominee to the Senates door for consideration   If the White Houses  midnight announcement on Monday  that      was reportedly embargoed to deny Democratic Senators an opportunity      to comment  is nonetheless intended to begin a dialogue about      documents  I welcome it  If it is intended to unilaterally pre empt      a discussion about documents the Senate may need and is entitled to       then this is regrettable    Past administrations have been willing      cooperatively to work with the Senate to accommodate its requests      for documents  and there are ample precedents documenting such      cooperation  The Senate will need the White Houses full      cooperation to expedite the scheduling of this process  as the      President has requested   Now that the White House has gotten      stagecraft out of the way  let us move to the substance of the      Senates work on this important nomination  The President has      announced his choice  Now the Senate must rise to the challenge and      do its work  To fulfill our constitutional duties we need to      consider this nomination as thoroughly and carefully as the American      people deserve  That will take time and the cooperation of the      nominee and the Administration  That will take Republicans as well      as Democrats taking seriously our constitutional obligations on      behalf of the American people    Justice OConnor serves as a model      Justice  She decided cases brought before the Supreme Court without      a political agenda  Justice OConnor cast the critical deciding      vote in a number of cases  and her legacy of fairness is one that      all Americans want to see preserved  Justice OConnor is widely      respected by America as      a jurist with common sense and practical values who brought no      agenda from the far right or the far left  She did not prejudge      cases  For 24 years on the Supreme Court  she has tried to decide      them fairly  I thank her for her service to the country and her      gracious gesture of agreeing to serve until her successor is      considered and confirmed by the Senate and appointed by the      President  I regret that some on the extreme right have been so      critical of her and so adamantly opposed to her successor sharing      her judicial philosophy and qualities  Their criticism reflects      their own narrow mindedness and agenda  It does nothing to tarnish      the record of the first woman Justice of the United States Supreme      Court    As the Senate begins it consideration      of the Presidents selection  we need to ensure that the Supreme      Court remains a protector of all Americans rights and liberties      from government intrusion and that the Supreme Court understands the      role of Congress in passing legislation to protect ordinary      Americans from abuse by powerful special interests    No one is entitled to a free pass to a      lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court  There are far different      considerations for circuit court nominations than for those to the      Supreme Court  How the nominee views precedent  what the nominee      regards as settled law  and how the nominee will exercise the      incredible power of a Supreme Court Justice to be the final arbiter      of the meaning of the Constitution  all of these raise very      different considerations than those for lower court nominees  In      this regard I note that Attorney General Gonzales recently told the      Associated Press that the testimony Judge Roberts gave at his      confirmation hearing two years ago should not be viewed as binding      him into the future  If this is the view of the Administration  it      makes it all the more important to know what Judge Robertss real      view is of what is settled law    The Judiciary Committee must be given      the time it needs to perform due diligence on Judge Roberts record      and judicial philosophy  and the Senators on the Committee must be      given time to prepare for fair and thorough hearings  Our      preparation can be assisted by cooperation from the White House or      delayed and disrupted by lack of cooperation  I hope the      Administration will choose to cooperate and I urge all Senators       Republicans and Democrats  to be mindful of the Senates fundamental      role in this process    The Senate has a responsibility to all      280 million Americans and to millions of future Americans  The      independence of the federal judiciary is critical to our American      concept of justice for all  The Supreme Court provides a      fundamental check in our system of government to protect the rights      and liberties of all Americans  and we must ensure that it remains a      bulwark of individual liberty against incursions or expansions of      power by the Executive branch  We must also ensure that the Supreme      Court respects the role of Congress when it acts to protect      Americans from those with great power  to improve their lives      through environmental laws and by reigning in powerful special      interests  The Supreme Court should not be a wing of the Republican      Party or one of its factions  nor should it be an arm of the      Democratic Party    Justice OConnor has served for 24      years  Chief Justice Rehnquist for 34  In fact  the average tenure      of Supreme Court justices since 1970 is 25 years  Thus  we are      considering a nomination not just for the period remaining to the      Bush Administration  which will end in 2008  but for our childrens      and grandchildrens futures and likely to 2030 and beyond  This is      a matter of fundamental importance to the American people now and in      the years ahead  This nomination fills the seat that Justice      OConnor has occupied while serving as the swing or decisive vote      on so many cases and issues  If her successor does not share her      judicial philosophy  her successor could radically change the Court      and the way our Constitution is interpreted    It is critical to the Senates      performance of our duties that we not prejudge a nominee and that      the Judiciary Committee be accorded the time to develop a full      record on which Senators can base an informed judgment  The      Constitution calls on the Senate carefully to examine nominations to      the courts  not to rubber stamp them  I hope that working together      Chairman Specter and I will be able to allow the kind of thorough      consideration a lifetime nomination to the Supreme Court deserves       I hope that the White House and the nominee will work with us and      cooperate so that all relevant matters can be constructively      explored as we begin this important process
