       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Judicial Nominations And National   Priorities                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick      Leahy      Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Judicial Nominations     And National Priorities     September 5  2006 The Senate returns      today from recess with less than four weeks left in this legislative      session  With so little time remaining  I hope that we can join      together to make real progress on the issues that have languished       unresolved the real issues that matter most to the American people        I once again urge the      Administration and this Republican leadership to recognize the      failures that have set us back as a Nation  so that we might work      together to rectify them  Secretary Rumsfeld and Vice President      Cheney struck the wrong note when they recently labeled as appeasers      the majority of Americans who recognize the disastrous war in Iraq      as a distraction from winning the war on terror  Again this week      the Democratic leadership reached out to the President on this      important issue  Rather than name calling and seeking to divide      Americans  rather than fostering fear and seeking to scare Americans      into staying the disastrous course on which the Government remains      headed  I join them in urging the Republican leadership to join with      us to fight a smarter war on terror so that we can make America      safer  The cronyism and incompetence that brought us the      devastating aftermath of Hurricane Katrina cannot continue to      misguide American policy   With more Americans      in poverty and extreme poverty and more children without health      care  we must do better  With rising interest rates  rising      mortgage rates  rising health care costs  rising insurance costs  we      must do better for Americas working families  While corporate      profits are taking a greater and greater share of our GNP  wages are      stagnant and those in charge refuse to allow a long overdue raise to      the minimum wage  We have just come through a summer of record high      gas prices  and for many families  the threat of record high home      heating prices this winter looms around the corner  As      we approach the fifth anniversary of the attacks of September 11       2001  we are more aware of the painful failure of the Federal      Government in neglecting to protect the Nation from those attacks       And in these last five years  the Administrations decision to send      hundreds of thousands of Americans into Iraq  and to divert      attention and resources from the hunt for Osama bin Laden and the      fight against Al Qaeda  looms largest among the many mistakes made      that have created a more dangerous and threatening world    How      sad  how discouraging  how needless  and how ominous it has been in      the past five years to see the national and international unity      immediately following those horrific attacks squandered by this      Administrations crass politics  arrogant unilateralism and      misguided policies  It      was around the time of the second anniversary of September 11 that      Defense Secretary Rumsfeld put his finger on a key question in the      fight against terrorism  when he asked whether we were creating or      eliminating more terrorists through our actions  There can now be      little doubt what the honest answer to the question is  about the      actions taken by this Administration over the last five years  Does      anyone doubt the impact of the occupation of Iraq  the images from      Abu Ghraib  the international scandal of Guantanamo and the war      profiteering by huge defense contractors   Our      own State Department had to revise its reports on international      terrorism in order to reflect a more honest assessment of the      growing incidents of terrorism violence  Hamas and Hezbollah are      winning elections as are hardliners in Iran and elsewhere throughout      the Middle East  Even those the Administration has supported in      Iraq are praising Hezbollah  talking of amnesty for those who have      killed U S  soldiers  and declaring their country to have descended      into civil war  We see American soldiers trapped in the sectarian      violence in Iraq and see the situation in Afghanistan      deteriorating  Meanwhile  we have lost precious time to confront      growing threats from Iran and North Korea and the Middle East that      are more threatening than at any time in recent memory    The      Administration resisted congressional efforts to examine what led to      the tragic events of 9 11  resisted creation of a Department of      Homeland Security  resisted formation of the 9 11 Commission       resisted the efforts of the 9 11 Commission and failed to implement      many of its most important recommendations   Of      course last year the Nation witnessed another sort of devastation in      the aftermath of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast and the appalling lack      of responsiveness by the Government  At another critical time  their      Government failed the American people  Eventually  even the      President acknowledged that failure of leadership  preparation       responsiveness and competence  Four years after the Government      failed to connect the dots or demonstrate the vision needed to head      off the attack on September 11  the Government failed  again  and      its failures have still not been overcome  We have seen a      Government that could not prepare for a typical winter flu season      struggle to face up to the threat of an avian flu pandemic  We have      witnessed repeated incompetence in the Department of Veterans      Affairs as it has allowed sensitive data on our veterans and active      service forces to be compromised again and again        Recently  President Bush held a press conference  He conceded that      Iraq had nothing to do with the attack on the World Trade Center       He skipped quickly over the main reason we went into Iraq namely      his erroneous contention that Iraq had weapons of mass      destruction  A growing roster of conservative Republicans  from      William Buckley on  are now acknowledging the failure of this      Administrations strategy in Iraq  Yet even as sectarian violence      has continued to grow among Iraqis  as the losses and costs to      America continues to mount  the Administration tolerates no      criticism or fresh perspectives on a deteriorating situation and      stubbornly insists it will simply stay the course for another two      and a half years  This  from a President who  during his 2000      election campaign  argued against nation building and foreign      military entanglements   Most      surprising was the Presidents declaration that he is rarely      surprised  His justification for turning from fighting Al Qaeda to      concentrating our forces  resources and efforts in Iraq was      nonexistent weapons of mass destruction  His vice president assured      the American people that our troops would be greeted as liberators       His vice president assured us long ago that the insurgency was it      its last throes and refuses to acknowledge that he has been wrong      about Iraq from the start and at every step along the way  as the      violence and divisions have continued to wreak tragic costs    It      is difficult to come together on a way forward when the      Administration will not acknowledge its historic miscalculations      that led to the current situation  When they are not ignoring the      past  they are excusing it  Their excuses for their failures are      mockingly the same       In May 2002  the      National Security Advisor said  I dont think anybody could have      predicted that these people would take an airplane and slam it into      the World Trade Center       that they would try to use an airplane      as a missile  a hijacked airplane as a missile  Of course  that      was not true and the 9 11 Commission detailed many of the pre 9 11      warnings       In September 2005       President Bush responded to the destruction of New Orleans by      saying  I dont think anybody anticipated the breach of the      levees  Of course  that was wrong and the local papers and      professors had discussed this hurricane disaster scenario for years      Earlier this summer       Vice President Cheney  said  I dont think anybody anticipated the      level of violence that weve encountered  And just last month a      military spokesman was sent out to proclaim  I dont think anyone      could have anticipated the sectarian violence  Of course  neither      of those statements was accurate since sectarian violence was a      known risk  even a predicted one    from the outset   How      are we to account for these catastrophic developments during this      Administrations watch when the President now says that he is      rarely surprised  Just as the Administrations justifications for      U S  involvement in Iraq have continued to shift from one to the      next  its excuses ring hollow when they refuse to acknowledge their      errors and instead claim infallibility  Just trust us long ago      proved its failure as a Bush Administration policy  Ours      is the strongest and best military in the world  but there are      limits to military power  The Presidents father knew that       General Powell knew that  President Eisenhower  the military hero      of World War II and a Republican President  knew that  This      Administration is having to learn that in what has proven to be a      disaster of historic proportions        Imagine how different our situation would be today if we had not      shifted our elite forces from Afghanistan to Iraq at the critical      moment when we were close to finding Osama bin Laden  In the years      since then the Iraq war has stretched our military to the breaking      point  sapped hundreds of billions of dollars  and preoccupied our      attention  The White House has even disbanded the intelligence unit      that for years was dedicated to tracking down Osama bin Laden  The      diversion to Iraq has only succeeded in creating a new breeding      ground for terrorists and in emboldening the rogue states that      harbor and supply them  Starting an unnecessary war in Iraq has      made us all less secure   We      need to adjust our course in order to effectively meet the threat of      terrorism  We need honesty and determination  We need not just      conventional military might but better intelligence  stronger      alliances and better information sharing  We need to use our      resources for homeland security  to protect our ports  our planes       our industrial plants and our vital resources  Let us function as a      constitutional democracy and act within a moral framework and      legitimate legal rules  Let us be that democratic model to the      world that America should be  Let us show the strength and resolve      of a free people not a fearful people  Let us set a new direction      to counter terrorism on our own terms  with American skill and with      American values   This      summer we expressed our gratitude to British authorities for      disrupting a plot that reportedly endangered the citizens of both      our countries  That episode and the fifth anniversary of the      attacks of 9 11 are reminders that there is little margin for error      in countering terrorism  We need to refocus our attention and      resources from the divisions that plague Iraq to eliminating the      misdirection and mismanagement that still divert us from an      effective international strategy to protect the American people from      terrorism  We need to be smarter and stronger to make America      safer  For almost five years  since the Government failed to      protect us from 9 11  Bush Administration officials in charge of      security have been saying that it is not a question of whether al      Qaeda will attack us again but when  We need to do better     Americans Deserve Progress On Our Nations      Real Priorities The full agenda      before us as we enter the final weeks of this legislative session      reflects how little this Republican leadership has accomplished       even with control of the White House and both Houses of Congress  A      steady course of misguided priorities including weeks spent on      constitutional amendments to restrict Americans rights and the      misuse of Congresss time and authority to interfere in a court      battle over the medical treatment of Terri Schiavo have cost      Americans progress on real issues that matter most        These failures to focus on our real priorities have left America      less secure  I look forward to a representative Congress that      focuses on the Nations real priorities  The Republican controlled      Congress has yet to enact a federal budget  We are in violation of      the statutory deadline of April 15  We have passed but one      appropriations bill  and we are required by law to pass 13  We have      yet to reconcile and enact lobbying reform and ethics legislation       We have yet to deal with the skyrocketing cost of gasoline and      health care  We have yet to reconcile and enact a bipartisan and      comprehensive immigration reform bill  On that issue in particular       all agree that real presidential leadership will be needed  And for      the second year in a row the Republican led Senate will not even      take up the annual intelligence authorization bill   As we commemorated      the one year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina last week  we were      reminded that the situation in the Gulf Coast remains a tragedy with      serious human consequences  We need to commit ourselves and our      resources to helping our fellow citizens who are still in need after      the appalling lack of responsiveness by this Administration  We      need to provide the assistance to that region of our country where      rubble remains a fixture of the landscape one year later  Many      residents still do not have homes to return to or jobs waiting for      them when they get there   We must also prepare      for the threat of an avian flu pandemic so that we do not see a      repeat of last winter when the government was unprepared for a      typical winter flu season  We should take action to preserve and      improve rather than pollute the environment  Protecting our      environment has become a pressing issue that has public safety and      health consequences for all Americans  today and tomorrow  and it      demands immediate attention  We cannot ignore the destruction      already wrought by this Administrations ill advised      head in the sand policies  We must provide resources needed that      our returning veterans need at home    Re Nominations of Controversial Nominees Americans would be      better served if we used our remaining time in this Congress to      address these vital issues than to focus on political fights over a      handful of divisive and failed nominations  The President has      chosen to renominate five of the most controversial judicial      nominations  They pose a dangerous distraction  The President      re nominated Judge Terrence Boyle to the Fourth Circuit despite the      fact that  as a sitting United States District Judge and while a      circuit court nominee  Judge Boyle ruled on multiple cases involving      corporations in which he held investments  The President should      have heeded the call of North Carolina Police Benevolent      Association  the North Carolina Troopers Association  the Police      Benevolent Associations from South Carolina and Virginia  the      National Association of Police Organizations  the Professional Fire      Fighters and Paramedics of North Carolina  as well as the advice of      our former colleague  Senator John Edwards  to withdraw this      ill advised nomination  Law enforcement officers from North      Carolina and across the country oppose the nomination  Civil rights      groups oppose the nomination  Those knowledgeable and respectful of      judicial ethics oppose this nomination  This nomination had been      pending on the calendar in the Republican controlled Senate since      June of last year when it was forced out of the Committee on a      party line vote  The Senate did the President a favor by returning      this nomination to the White House before the summer recess  The      President should not have re nominated Judge Boyle   The President also      re nominated William Myers to the Ninth Circuit  This is another      Administration insider and lobbyist whose record has raised serious      questions about his ability to be a fair and impartial judge  I      opposed this nomination when it was considered by the Judiciary      Committee in March 2005  This was a nomination that the so called      Gang of 14 expressly listed as someone for whom they made no      commitment to vote for cloture  and with good reason  Mr  Myers      anti environmental record is reason enough to oppose his      confirmation  His lack of independence is another  If anyone      sought to proceed to this nomination  there would be a need to      explore any connections to the lobbying scandals associated with the      Interior Department and Republican lobbyist Jack Abramoff    It is particular      troubling to see Mr  Myers re nominated because the President missed      an opportunity to be a uniter  I had suggested that he re nominate      Norman Randy Smith for the vacancy created by the retirement of      Judge Thomas G  Nelson from Idaho  Instead  the President has again      nominated Judge Smith to a California seat on the Ninth Circuit       effectively stealing Californias seat  That is wrong  I support      Senators Feinstein and Boxer in their opposition to this tactic  I      again urge President Bush to resolve this impasse and turn Idahos      vacancy into a judge by withdrawing the tainted Myers nomination and      nominating Judge Smith for the Idaho vacancy to which he could be      easily confirmed   It is distressing      that the President chose to re nominate William James Haynes to the      Fourth Circuit despite bipartisan concern about this nomination  As      General Counsel at the Defense Department  Mr  Haynes has been      deeply involved in shaping this Administrations now discredited      policies on the treatment of enemy combatants  the interrogation and      torture of detainees  and the creation of military commissions  In      two hearings  Mr  Haynes has refused to answer questions from      Committee members about these policies despite disturbing      developments that have come to light that relate to those policies       including the Abu Ghraib scandal and scores of other incidents of      detainee abuse in Afghanistan  Iraq  and Guantanamo Bay  In      addition  new press reports  declassified memoranda and letters from      former high ranking military officials have detailed Mr  Hayness      disregard for legal concerns raised by senior military and civilian      lawyers within the Armed Services about his policies and his efforts      to subvert their advice  It is deeply concerning that Mr  Haynes      ignored the policy concerns raised by military officers about the      effect of his policies on the safety of American troops and American      credibility around the world   I have found      inconsistencies between Mr  Haynes testimony and that of the      uniformed JAGs relating to the level of JAG involvement in the      development of detainee interrogation policies to be particularly      troubling  Although Mr  Haynes sought at his hearing in July to      allay some of these concerns regarding his disregard of the advice      of uniformed JAGs  his statements regarding consultation with them      were flatly contradicted by several JAGs who testified before the      Senate Armed Services Committee  Subsequently  Mr  Haynes sought to      reconcile his testimony with that of the JAGs in a letter to the      Committee  Unfortunately  even this letter turned out to be      inaccurate  as set forth in a subsequent letter from Daniel      DellOrto  Mr  Haynes deputy  This re nomination is a poke in the      eye to anyone who wants to close this disgraceful chapter in our      nations history  The President had an opportunity to move beyond      this controversy by sending the Senate a more qualified  consensus      nominee  Unfortunately  he squandered that opportunity with this      re nomination   Finally  the      President has re nominated Michael Wallace to a vacancy on the Fifth      Circuit even though he received the first ABA rating of unanimously      not qualified that I have seen for a circuit court nominee in 25      years  The hearing on his nomination scheduled for July 19 was      cancelled  though not before the Committee received written      testimony from the ABA regarding his rating  This testimony  which      was confidential until leaked to a conservative website  details the      significant concerns raised by numerous jurists around the country      regarding Mr  Wallaces judicial temperament  lack of commitment to      equal justice for the poor and minorities  lack of tolerance  and      open mindedness  The report details concerns from judges and      lawyers that Mr  Wallace may not follow the law  and is driven by      his personal agenda and that he lacks common courtesy  Of course       the troubling issues raised in the ABAs testimony echo significant      concerns about Mr  Wallaces terrible record on civil rights  his      opposition to the Voting Rights Act  his support for tax exemptions      for Bob Jones University  his opposition to prison safety      regulations  and his attempt as President Reagans director of the      board of the Legal Services Corporation to undermine efforts to      provide legal services to low income clients    Senate Should Not      Rubberstamp Lifetime Judges The Senate can make      progress  but it requires working together  Today  the Senate      considers the nomination of Kimberly Ann Moore for a lifetime      appointment to the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit  In the      weeks before recess  we confirmed several nominees to the Nations      important circuit courts  Working together  the Senate confirmed      two circuit nominees and two federal trial court nominees in a      matter of minutes in one afternoon  That is the kind of progress we      can make when the President nominates qualified consensus nominees  When she is      confirmed  Ms  Moore will be the seventh Circuit Court nominee and      the 30th judge overall confirmed this year  Compare this      with those left unconfirmed in the 1996 congressional session  when      Republicans controlled the Senate and stalled the nominations of      President Clinton  In the 1996 session  Republicans would not      confirm a single appellate court judge    not one    and moved      forward on only 17 district court judges all session  That is the      only session of the Senate I can remember in which the Senate simply      refused to consider appellate court nominations  That was part of      their pocket filibuster strategy to stall and maintain vacancies so      that a Republican President could pack the courts and tilt them      decidedly to the right   Judge Arthur Gajarsa       one of President Clintons well qualified nominees to the Federal      Circuit  the court to which Ms  Moore has been nominated  was among      the many circuit court nominees that the Republican controlled      Senate refused to confirm in 1996  President Clinton first      nominated Judge Gajarsa on April 18  1996  but he was not confirmed      until July 31  1997  despite the support of both home state Senators      and a growing backlog of cases created by the extended vacancy       Another one of President Clintons nominees to the Federal Circuit       Timothy Dyk  was nominated April 1  1998  but was not confirmed      until May 24  2000  over two years later  The slow pace of these      nominations stands in stark contrast to the speed with which Ms       Moores nomination has proceeded  She was nominated on May 18 and      she stands to be confirmed after only two and a half months       Democratic nominees to the same court were stalled for more than two      years  With her confirmation  Ms  Moore will bring the total of      Republican appointed judges on the Federal Circuit to 8  double the      number appointed by Democratic presidents   During the last two      years under Republican control  the Senate will have confirmed 52      judges  Of course  during the 17 months I was Chairman of the      Judiciary Committee and the Senate was under Democratic control  we      confirmed 100 of President Bushs nominees  The fact that the      Senate has now confirmed more nominees in the past five and a half      years  257  than in the last five and a half years of the Clinton      Administration is due in no small part to the faster pace of      confirmations of this Presidents nominees when Democrats controlled      the Senate  Given the claims by      the Bush Cheney Administration to nearly unfettered Government      power  it is imperative that the other two branches of government      serve as an effective check and balance  I have urged that we      exercise effective oversight of the Executive branch  and I have      supported efforts to get to the bottom of the NSAs unprecedented      program of domestic spying on Americans without warrants  However       I am concerned that we are far away from restoring accountability      and checks and balances in our government  The Senate must not      rubberstamp judicial nominees who will fail to act as a      constitutional check on the Administrations unprecedented power      grab   The court to which      Ms  Moore has been nominated  the Federal Circuit  is a unique and      important court with nationwide jurisdiction in a variety of subject      areas  including international trade  government contracts  patents       trademarks  certain money claims against the United States      Government  federal personnel  and veterans  benefits  Because the      Supreme Court takes up only a small number of appeals  the Federal      Circuit is often the court of last resort making decisions in those      areas  I hope that she will take her responsibility seriously and      act judiciously  I congratulate Ms  Moore on her confirmation today      and hope that she will be the kind of judge who will apply the law      fairly and protect the rights of all litigants appearing in her      courtroom
