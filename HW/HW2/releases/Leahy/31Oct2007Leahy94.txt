       Statement Of Sen  Leahy  Hearing On FISA Amendments  How To Protect   America s Security And Privacy And Preserve The Rule Of Law And Government   Accountability                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      Chariman  Senate Judiciary Committee    Hearing On   FISA Amendments  How To Protect America s Security And Privacy       And Preserve The Rule Of Law And Government Accountability  October 31  2007    The Foreign Intelligence      Surveillance Act  FISA  is intended to protect both our national      security and the privacy and civil liberties of Americans       Changes to that law must      be considered carefully and openly  not eviscerated in secret      Administration interpretations or compromised through fear or      intimidation  The so called Protect America Act       passed just before the summer recess  was an example of the worst      way to consider changes to FISA      It was hurriedly passed under intense  partisan      pressure from the Administration  It provides sweeping new powers      to the government to engage in surveillance  without warrants  of      international calls to and from the United States involving      Americans  and it provided no meaningful protection for the privacy      and civil liberties of the Americans who are on those calls          Fortunately  the Protect America Act will expire early next year      This is the      Committees second hearing to inform our consideration of possible      legislation to take the place of that flawed Act  Of course we must     accommodate legitimate national security concerns and      the need for flexibility in surveillance of overseas targets  but      Congress should do that in a way that protects the civil liberties      of Americans          I commend the House Committees and the Senate Select Committees on      Intelligence for seeking to incorporate the better ideas from our      work this summer into their current legislative proposals  The      House of Representatives is considering the RESTORE Act  which      appears to take a fair and balanced approach    allowing flexibility      for the Intelligence Community while providing oversight and      protection for Americans privacy  The Senate Select Committee on      Intelligence has also reported a bill that makes improvements to the      current temporary law  Increasing the role of the FISA Court and      oversight by the Inspector General and the Congress are matters we      should have incorporated this summer           At the outset I should acknowledge the grave concern I have with one      aspect of S 2248  It seeks to grant immunity  or  as Senator Dodd      has called it  amnesty    for telecommunications carriers for      their warrantless surveillance activities from 2001 through this      summer  which would seem to be contrary to FISA and in violation of      the privacy rights of Americans           Before even considering such a proposal  Senator Specter and I have      always been clear with the Administration that we would need the      legal justifications  authorizations  and other documents that show      the basis for the actions of the government and the carriers          Since the existence of the President s secret wiretapping program      became public in December 2005  this Committee has sought that      relevant information through oral and written requests and by      conducting oversight hearings  After our repeated requests did not      yield the information the Committee requested  we authorized and      issued subpoenas for documents related to the legal justification      for the Presidents program                Finally  this week  the Administration has belatedly responded       Senators on the Committee and designated staff have begun to receive      access to legal opinions and documents concerning authorization and      reauthorization of the program  This is a significant step  though      long overdue                I am considering carefully what we are learning from these      materials  The Congress should be careful not to provide an      incentive for future unlawful corporate activity by giving the      impression that if corporations violate the law and disregard the      rights of Americans  they will be given an after the fact free pass       If Americans privacy is to mean anything  and if the rule of law      is to be respected  that would be the wrong result                A retroactive grant of immunity or preemption of state regulators      does more than let the carriers off the hook  Immunity is designed      to shield this Administration from any accountability for conducting      surveillance outside the law  It could make it impossible for      Americans whose privacy has been violated illegally to seek      meaningful redress               The lawsuits that would be dismissed as a result of such a grant of      immunity are perhaps the only avenue that exists for an outside      review of the governments program and honest assessment of its      legal arguments  That kind of assessment is critical if our      government is to be held accountable  One of my chief inquiries      before deciding to support any legislation on this subject is      whether it will foster government accountability  Anyone who      proposes letting the telecommunications carriers off the hook or      preempting state authorities has a responsibility to propose a      manner to test the legality of the governments program and to      determine whether it did harm to the rights of Americans      Safeguarding the new      powers we are giving to our government is far more than just an      academic exercise  The FISA law itself is testament to the fact      that unchecked government power leads to abuse  The FISA was      enacted in the wake of earlier scandals  when the rights and privacy      of Americans were trampled while no one was watching  We in the      Senate  and on this Committee  have a solemn responsibility to      hundreds of millions of our fellow citizens  Because the American      peoples rights  freedom and privacy are easily lost  but once lost       they are difficult to win back               I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and thank them for      appearing
