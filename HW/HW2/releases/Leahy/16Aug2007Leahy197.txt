       Leahy Asks Justice Department s Inspector General To Investigate   Conflicting Testimony By Attorney General                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Leahy Asks Justice      Departments Inspector General     To Investigate Conflicting Testimony     By Attorney General  WASHINGTON  Thursday  August 16        Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy  D Vt   Thursday      asked the Justice Departments Inspector General to investigate      potentially false or misleading testimony given by Attorney General      Alberto Gonzales during his appearances before various congressional      committees       In a letter to Department of Justice Inspector General Glenn A       Fine  Leahy lists several apparently contradictory and disputed      statements the Attorney General has made to congressional committees       about warrantless wiretapping  the use of National Security      Letters  and the mass firing of U S  Attorneys    and asks for an      inquiry of whether the Attorney General engaged in any misconduct or      violated any duties of his office       I have given the Attorney General an opportunity to clarify and      revise his testimony  but he has not meaningfully addressed our      significant concerns  said Leahy  who gave the Attorney General an      opportunity to correct contradictory statements made during a July      24 hearing before the Judiciary Committee   Below is the text of the letter sent      to the Office of the Inspector General        August 16  2007  Honorable Glenn A  Fine     Inspector General     The Department of Justice      950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW     Washington  D C  20530 0001  Dear Inspector General Fine   I am writing to ask that you      investigate and evaluate potential misleading  evasive  or dishonest      testimony by Attorney General Alberto Gonzales before the Senate      Judiciary Committee on July 24  2007  and in previous hearings      before this and other congressional Committees  I have identified      numerous instances in which the Attorney General appears to have      contradicted his own previous testimony or the statements or      testimony of other senior officials  or where he appears to have      engaged in efforts to mislead  I have given him an opportunity to      clarify and revise his testimony  but he has not meaningfully      addressed our significant concerns   I ask that you review the Attorney      Generals testimony and compare it with other testimony and evidence      to determine whether his testimony was in any instances      intentionally false  misleading  or inappropriate  Consistent with      your jurisdiction  please do not limit your inquiry to whether or      not the Attorney General has committed any criminal violations       Rather  I ask that you look into whether the Attorney General  in      the course of his testimony  engaged in any misconduct  engaged in      conduct inappropriate for a cabinet officer and the nations chief      law enforcement officer  or violated any duty  including the duty      set out in federal regulations for government officials to avoid any      conduct which gives the appearance of a violation of law or of      ethical standard  regardless of whether there is an actual violation      of law   Potential misleading statements that      you may wish to examine include  but are not limited to the      following instances        1      Attorney General Gonzales testified on July 24  2007       that the Gang of Eight  consisting of members of Congress  told      him that despite the recommendation of the Deputy Attorney      General  who as Acting Attorney General had found a warrantless      surveillance program to be without legal basis  the government      should go forward with these very important intelligence      activities  According to press accounts  at least three members of      Congress who were present for the described meeting dispute the      testimony that they recommended proceeding with the program over the      Acting Attorney Generals objections        2      Attorney General Gonzales testified before the Senate      Judiciary Committee on February 6  2006  that neither former Deputy      Attorney General James Comey nor other officials had concerns about      the Terrorist Surveillance Program  TSP  that was confirmed by the      President  In a June 5  2007  press conference  Attorney General      Gonzales stated that a dispute with Mr  Comey concerned this very      program  though he later retracted that statement  At his July 24      hearing  Attorney General Gonzales said that there was no dissent      about the TSP  and that the disagreement concerned other      intelligence activities  Numerous officials  including members of      the Gang of Eight and FBI Director Robert Mueller have indicated      that the disputes did concern the TSP  and that there was only one      program  Attorney General Gonzales in an August 1  2007  letter to      me set out a legalistic explanation stating that the disputed      activities and the TSP were separate components of a single program        3      Attorney General Gonzales said in April 27  2005       testimony before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence with      regard to National Security Letters  NSLs  and other      information gathering techniques that statutory civil liberties      safeguards had been effective and that  t here has not been one      verified case of civil liberties abuse  Similarly  his responses      to written questions following his April 19  2007  Senate Judiciary      Committee hearing indicated that he had not learned of problems with      NSLs prior to your March 2007 report on the issue  Documents      obtained in a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit indicated that the      Attorney General had in fact received numerous reports in 2005 and      2006 of violations in connection with NSLs and other surveillance      tools  The Attorney General in his July 24 testimony suggested that      his prior testimony and answers were premised on the fact that he      was not aware of any intentional violations   The Washington Post has      reported that at least one intentional violation was reported in the      relevant time period        4      In March press appearances  Attorney General Gonzales      said that he had not been involved in deliberations as to which      United States Attorneys should be fired  Documents and testimony      obtained by the Senate Judiciary Committee showed that the Attorney      General attended a November 27  2006  meeting at which the firings      were approved  In subsequent testimony  Attorney General Gonzales      has taken responsibility for the firings and said that he attended      this meeting  but he has maintained that he does not know who was      responsible for selecting the names of U S  Attorneys to be fired      and does not remember what was said at the November 27 meeting  He      has at times placed primary responsibility for which U S  Attorneys      were selected to be fired on his former Chief of Staff Kyle Sampson      and former Deputy Attorney General Paul McNulty  each of whom denies      making the determinations        5      In his April 19  2007  testimony  Attorney General      Gonzales said  I havent talked to witnesses because of the fact      that I havent wanted to interfere with this investigation  In May      23  2007  testimony to the House Judiciary Committee  former White      House liaison Monica Goodling testified that the Attorney General      had a discussion with her that made her uncomfortable in which he      set out his version of events regarding the process of firing U S       Attorneys and asked for her reaction  In his July 24 testimony       Attorney General Gonzales said he had a conversation with Goodling      to console and reassure an emotionally distraught woman and to      reassure her that as far as I knew  no one had done anything      intentionally wrong here   These and other examples suggest a      possible pattern of misleading answers and an effort to avoid      disclosing the full truth  I look forward to your review and report      as to the propriety of the Attorney Generals testimony  Thank you      for your prompt attention to this matter   Sincerely    PATRICK      LEAHY      Chairman
