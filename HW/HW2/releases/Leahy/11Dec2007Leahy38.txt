       Statement Of Sen  Leahy On The Sunshine In Litigation Act  Does Court   Secrecy Undermine Public Health And Safety                   U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt     Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee  On The Sunshine In Litigation Act  Does Court      Secrecy   Undermine Public Health And Safety   December 11  2007        Todays hearing will address the detrimental affect that secret      court filings can have for American consumers              Allowing certain court documents to be kept secret in cases where      public health and safety is at stake can and does put lives in      jeopardy  The tragic events leading up to the Bridgestone Firestone      recall of 6 5 million tires seven years ago demonstrated the dire      consequences of sealing records in court cases when product safety      is at issue              The national recall of Firestone tires resulted  in part  from the      disclosure of internal corporate documents which demonstrated      numerous consumer complaints of tire defects and design errors       These documents were discovered in litigation against Bridgestone      and Firestone but kept from the public  The release of additional      documents revealed that the company had known for several years that      recurring problems with their tires were linked to numerous      accidents  however  information pointing to this deadly pattern of      product defects had been kept out of the publics view in dozens of      cases because of confidentiality agreements that      Bridgestone Firestone  Inc  had secured in out of court settlement      deals              Hundreds of deaths  injuries and accidents could have been avoided      if information about the danger of Firestone tires had instead been      made public  A report issued by the National Highway Transportation      Safety Administration found that defective Firestone tires were      linked to 174 fatalities and 700 injuries  many of which could have      been avoided if information about the faulty tires was made public       Unfortunately  in this case and many others  corporate regard for      public safety took a back seat to corporate regard for profits              We need to make sure that consumers have access to information that      affects their health and safety  and that is why I     am a cosponsor of Senator Kohls      Sunshine in Litigation Act  This      legislation would make it more difficult for courts to seal records      in cases that reveal threats to public health and safety  It      would prohibit judges from sealing court records  information      obtained through discovery  and certain details of a settlement      unless the public health or safety interest is outweighed by a      specific and substantial interest in maintaining confidentiality       And it would require that when issued  protective orders could be no      broader than necessary to protect the privacy interest asserted             I urge Senators to support this legislation   Congress should act to      make sure that the public has access to court documents that reveal      when a product poses a public heath or safety risk  The American      consumer deserves nothing less
