       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Hearing On Presidential Signing   Statements                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Judiciary Committee       Hearing On Presidential Signing Statements      June 27  2006  Today  the Committee turns its       attention to the important issue of presidential signing       statements  The evolving use of these statements by the       Bush Cheney Administration has become a serious concern of mine       and I commend the Chairman for holding this hearing     We are at a pivotal moment in our       Nations history  where Americans are faced with a President who       makes sweeping claims for almost unchecked Executive power  One       of the most troubling aspects of such claims is the Presidents       unprecedented use of signing statements  Historically  these       statements have served as public announcements containing       comments from the President  on the enactment of laws        But this Administration has taken what was otherwise a press       release and transformed it into a proclamation stating which       parts of the law the President will follow and which parts he       will simply ignore   I have long objected to this       Presidents broad use of signing statements to try to rewrite       the laws crafted and passed by the Congress  because I firmly       believe that this practice poses a grave threat to our       constitutional system of checks and balances  During his five       years in office  President Bush has quietly    yet consistently          used his bill signing statements to assign his own       interpretations to laws passed by Congress  and signal which       provisions he intends follow and which ones he does not  As if       to say it  makes it so   According to a review of these       statements conducted by The      Boston Globe  President Bush has employed signing       statements to ignore or disobey more than 750 laws       enacted by the Congress since 2001 more than all previous       presidents in the history of our Nation combined  That is       breathtaking   In 2002  when the President signed       the Sarbanes Oxley law combating corporate fraud  he used his       signing statement to attempt to narrow a provision protecting       corporate whistle blowers in a way that would have afforded them       very little protection  Senator Grassley and I wrote a letter       to the President stating that his narrow interpretation was at       odds with the plain language of the statute  and the       Administration reluctantly relented on this view but only after       much protest  We also witnessed the Presidents fondness for       signing statements earlier this year  when after months of       debate and negotiations in Congress  the President issued a       signing statement for the USA PATRIOT ACT Reauthorization       language in which he stated his intentions not to follow the       reporting and oversight provisions contained in that bill  I       noted this abuse at the time    This President has also used       signing statements to challenge laws banning torture  on       affirmative action and prohibiting the censorship of scientific       data  In fact  time and again  this President has stood before       the American people  signed laws enacted by their       representatives in Congress  while all along crossing his       fingers behind his back  And  while this President proudly       boasts being the first modern President to have never vetoed a       bill  he has cleverly used his signing statements as a  de facto line item       veto to cherry pick which laws he will enforce in a manner not       contemplated by our Constitution    Under our constitutional system of       government  when Congress passes a bill and the President signs       it into law  that should be the end of the story  It is the law       of the land unless and until repealed by Congress or invalidated       by the courts  For this reason  there are grave and inherent       dangers to the extensive and unprecedented use of signing       statements   When the President uses signing       statements to unilaterally rewrite the laws enacted by the       peoples representatives in Congress  he creates doubt about       what the rule of law means in our Nation   The excessive use of signing       statements also creates a novel  and perhaps  dangerous view of       the appropriate role of the President in the legislative       process  Signing statements intrude upon the legislative       function and also upon the constitutional role of our courts        Under our system of government  the President is to faithfully       execute the laws enacted by Congress  He may veto or sign a       bill  If he signs it  it is the law  If he vetoes it and his       veto is overridden  it is the law  He does not get to act as a       super legislator with a line item veto  He is not the final       word on its constitutionality   These signing statements are a       diabolical device and the President will continue to use and       abuse them  if Congress lets him  So far  this Congress has       done exactly that  Whether it is torture  warrantless       eavesdropping on American citizens  or the unlawful detention of       military prisoners  this Republican led Congress has been more       than happy to turn a blind eye and rubber stamp the questionable       actions of this Administration regardless of the consequences to       our Constitution or civil liberties  But  we in Congress have a       constitutional duty to conduct meaningful oversight on behalf of       all Americans  Artful deception is no substitute for the rule       of law    I approached this hearing with the       hope that it would signal a new beginning  Instead  we see the       low regard with which this Administration holds the Congress        the Senate and  in particular  this Committee   Not only does the Vice President       intervene to instruct witnesses not to testify and to tell       Republican Senators what oversight he will allow  but  we have       an Attorney General who will not answer our legitimate questions       after having assured us at his confirmation hearing that he       would be responsive    Today  again  the Department of       Justice and the Administration have treated our concerns       contemptuously  We will not be joined by the Attorney General          or even the Deputy Attorney General    who we confirmed in a       bipartisan way  We will not hear from a spokesperson for the       White House  although they are all too willing to spin to the       press or to friendly audiences  We will not even hear from the       acting Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal       Policy  who we were initially told would be attending  Instead        the Administration is  again  seeking to send forward a young       deputy to parrot the Administrations line  not answer our       questions  witness our frustration and hear our criticisms  I       wish her well and believe that she is being abused by her       superiors in this role and this Committee is being shown utter       contempt   I thank our other witnesses for       coming and the American Bar Association for its work and views       in connection with these important matters
