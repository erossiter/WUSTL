       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  Tribute To Suphada Rom                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT              Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     Tribute To Suphada Rom    June 21  2007 Mr  LEAHY  I want to speak briefly about a remarkable event that     happened last Friday  June 15  2007  in the small town of Windsor in my     home State of Vermont  But first a bit of history   In January 1989  a member of my staff  Tim Rieser  traveled to the     Thai Cambodia border to locate a young Cambodian woman whose mother and     two brothers  all of them survivors of the Khmer Rouge holocaust  had     resettled in Vermont  The woman  Rhumdoul Rom  had been kidnapped and     smuggled back into Cambodia  but she had escaped and was in a Thai     refugee camp   When Rhumdoul was located she was holding her 5 day old baby     daughter  whose name was Suphada  A few days and several long airplane     rides later  the two of them arrived in Vermont where they were reunited     with the rest of their family  Sadly  Suphada s grandfather and other     family members were among the 2 million Cambodians who were murdered or     starved to death by the Khmer Rouge  One of Rhumdoul s sisters survived      and is living in Cambodia today   Adjusting to Vermont was not easy  Imagine traveling for the first     time on an airplane and arriving from the tropics in a foreign land in     the middle of winter  ice and snow everywhere  and not speaking a word     of English   But the family persevered  supported by the generosity of the Windsor     community  As the years passed  Rhumdoul learned English  graduated from     high school and then community college  and became a skilled medical     technician  at the same time that she was raising her daughter as a     single mother   Suphada  coming to America so young  learned English easily and over     time became an outstanding student and athlete  She won a prize for her     writing  learned to play the flute  served meals at a local nursing     home  and this year she was the captain of the Windsor girls  basketball     team  She is also a very outgoing and friendly person   Recently  tragedy struck the family again  when Rhumdoul s mother and     Suphada s grandmother  Prak Soy  died suddenly of meningitis  My wife     Marcelle and I had the privilege of meeting Prak Soy  for whom living in     the Unites States was not easy  I will always remember her as a selfless     person who cared deeply for her children and grandchildren  They meant     the world to her   This is a family that has experienced great loss  but they are also     an example for those of us who have never known what it is to live     through something as horrifying as genocide   On June 15  Suphada graduated from Windsor High School  and I     understand that she has been accepted to several colleges  including  I     am proud to say  my own alma mater  St  Michael s College in Colchester      VT  It is also the alma mater of another accomplished Cambodian refugee      Loung Ung  who years ago resettled in Vermont and has since become a     world renowned author for her book   First They Killed My Father    and     a tireless campaigner against the scourge of landmines   I  Marcelle  and my staff would have liked to attend Suphada s     graduation  but it was not possible due to the Senate s schedule and     other commitments  But I want to congratulate her and her mother for her     outstanding scholastic and athletic achievements  and wish her the best     in the coming year at whichever college she chooses
