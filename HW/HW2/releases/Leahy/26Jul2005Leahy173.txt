       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On The White House s Position On Documents   Relating To The Roberts Nomination                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt        Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On The White Houses Position     On Documents Relating To The Roberts Nomination     Tuesday  July 26  2005  This is a lifetime nomination to our      highest court  a court that is supposed to protect the rights of      all Americans  The Senate has a duty to the American people of      today and tomorrow to get it right  I hope the White House will      help and not hinder the Senate in getting it right   If the White House announcement is      intended to begin a dialogue about documents  I welcome it  If it      is intended to unilaterally pre empt a discussion about documents      the Senate may need and is entitled to  then this is a regrettable      beginning    The Senate is supposed to be separate      from the White House under our system  The Constitution gives the      Senate separate responsibilities  requirements and prerogatives in      this process  It is for the Senate and not the White House to      decide what documents the Senate will need to fulfill its      responsibilities in the confirmation process    The process of identifying the      documents that will help the Senate do its job has only just begun       but such requests  when they are made  will be reasonable and      limited  I hope they will also be bipartisan   Past administrations have been      willing to cooperatively discuss Senate requests for documents  and      there are ample precedents documenting such cooperation  The      nomination has not yet been formally made to the Senate  and the      Senate will need the White Houses full cooperation to expedite the      scheduling of this process  as the President has requested
