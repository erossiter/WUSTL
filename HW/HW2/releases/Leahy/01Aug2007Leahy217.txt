       Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On FISA Fix Proposal                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT                 Comment Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       D Vt       Chairman  Senate Judiciary Committee      On FISA Fix Proposal     August 1  2007   Judiciary Committee Chairman      Patrick Leahy has been working closely with Intelligence Committee      Chairman Jay Rockefeller  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and      other Democratic House and Senate members to develop a responsible       targeted reform to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act  FISA       that would address an immediate need with our nations foreign      intelligence collection  Below is Chairman Leahys comment on the      reform   The Congress is      willing and able to responsibly reform FISA when changes are needed       and now is such a time  In the last decade alone  Congress has      amended FISA on many occasions  and I believe we should make this      targeted and responsible fix now  The reform we have proposed to      the Administration will improve the governments ability to collect      intelligence  while protecting the civil liberties of Americans by      maintaining oversight of the FISA Court when calls to or from the      United States are involved  The Administration  instead  would      shift this oversight role and additional authority away from the      expert FISA Court to the Attorney General  It is essential to      preserve the crucial role of the FISA Court in protecting civil      liberties of Americans while providing our intelligence agencies the      flexibility they need  It is not wise to expand the authority of      this Attorney General  or any Attorney General  in this regard  I      urge the Administration to support this reasonable solution that      ensures checks and balances while strengthening our national      security
