       Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Reaction Of Senator Patrick Leahy        To Secretary Rices Determination That The Indonesian Government And        Military       Are Cooperating With The FBIs Investigation Of The August 2002 Timika        Massacre        In Which Two American Citizens And One Indonesian Citizen Died  The Secretarys determination is premature and unfortunate  The only        reason there has been any progress in this case is due to pressure from        Congress and Patsy Spier  the widow of one of the victims  Now the        Secretary  in one of her first acts  has thrown away the last bit of        leverage we had  Why hasnt the one person indicted by the U S   who has confessed to the        crime  been indicted and arrested in Indonesia  One can only surmise that        since he has implicated the Indonesian military  they dont want the FBI to        interview him  This is not cooperation with the FBI  no matter what the        Administration says  We should not forget that two of the murder victims        were Americans   In his inaugural address  President Bush spoke of standing        up for human rights  but when it comes to the cold blooded murder of two        American teachers and one Indonesian  the Secretarys decision will be seen        as a pat on the back by the Indonesian military who have tried to obstruct        justice
