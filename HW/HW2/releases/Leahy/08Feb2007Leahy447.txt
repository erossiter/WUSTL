       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy on The Revised Continuing Appropriations   Resolution For FY 2007                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT            Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy      Chairman  Appropriations Subcommittee On State And Foreign Operations     On H J  Res 20     The Revised Continuing Appropriations Resolution For FY 2007    February 8  2007     Mr      President  two weeks ago the Senate and House Appropriations Committees     finished drafting H J Res 20  the joint spending resolution which     provides funding for federal programs through the remainder of Fiscal     Year 2007    The House     passed the joint resolution on January 31 by a vote of 286 140  The     current continuing resolution expires on February 15  It is now the     Senates turn to act    Total funding     in the joint resolution is within the ceiling imposed by President Bush     and the Republican Congress last year for Fiscal Year 2007  However      H J Res 20 makes some adjustments from the Fiscal Year 2006 funding     levels in the continuing resolution approved by the Republican     Congress    During the     past month  we worked together on a bipartisan basis to make these     adjustments in order to prevent severe hardship to the most vulnerable     people or layoffs of federal employees    As Chairman     of the State and Foreign Operations Subcommittee  I am gratified that     programs of particular concern within the jurisdiction of this     Subcommittee will receive additional funding under H J Res 20 to ensure     that urgent humanitarian needs are met  I want to especially thank     Chairman Byrd and Ranking Member Cochran for their help in making this     possible  I also want to thank the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee      Senator Gregg  and his able staff  for their support and cooperation     during this process   These     adjustments include additional funding to combat HIV AIDS  Under the     continuing resolution enacted last year by the Republican Congress      funding within State and Foreign Operations to combat HIV AIDS totaled      2 57 billion  including  445 million for the Global Fund to Fight     HIV AIDS  Tuberculosis and Malaria    Under     H J Res 20  those amounts would increase to  3 84 billion and  625     million  respectively  I want to thank Senator Durbin  Senator     Brownback  and others who strongly supported this additional funding   Currently  only 20     percent of the people needing AIDS drugs in poor countries are getting     them  and only 10 percent of the people at risk of infection are     receiving services to help them protect themselves    Continued funding at the     Fiscal Year 2006 level would have prevented us from providing     life saving antiretroviral drugs to an estimated 350 000 HIV infected     people  According to the Office of the Global AIDS Coordinator  110 000     to 175 000 people would die of HIV related causes if the Fiscal Year     2006 funding levels had not been increased in the joint resolution   Funding to combat     malaria would have been frozen at the Fiscal Year 2006 level of  105     million under the continuing resolution drafted by the Republican     majority last year    Malaria is both     preventable and treatable  yet it kills more than one million people per     year  mostly African children  Expansion of programs to combat malaria     would be stalled and the eight additional countries targeted for the     next round of malaria prevention and treatment would be placed on hold       The additional funding     in H J Res 20 will enable us to meet our commitment to cut     malaria related deaths by 50 percent in 15 of the hardest hit countries     in Africa  These funds will go to support the purchase of lifesaving     drugs  the distribution of insecticide treated bed nets  and treatment     of pregnant women at risk for malaria       Under H J Res 20  funding for international peacekeeping operations will     receive an  additional      113 million above the amount in the continuing resolution enacted last     year  This will ensure that our assessed dues to the United Nations are     paid in Fiscal Year 2007 and we do not fall further behind in our     support for troops in 13 countries including Lebanon  Sudan  Haiti and     the Congo    The joint     resolution also includes  50 million to support the African Union troops     in Darfur and Southern Sudan  These funds  which were omitted by the     Republican Congress in the continuing resolution enacted last year  are     needed for the 7 000 troops at 34 camps throughout Sudan and to support     a transition to a hybrid AU UN force   The     joint resolution increases assistance for refugees by  75 million over     the amount enacted last year   These funds     are needed because current resources would have been exhausted well     before the end of Fiscal Year 2007  resulting in great hardship to the     worlds most vulnerable people    This includes      20 million to support Iraqi refugees  an amount which unfortunately     will only begin to address the catastrophe that is unfolding      Additional aid will be needed for Iraqi refugees in the Fiscal year 2007     Supplemental    Mr      President  the clock is ticking and the urgency with which the Senate     must act to pass the joint funding resolution can be measured in human     lives  As the     members of the Senate and the American people can readily see  this     legislation involves issues of life and death    If we     continue to delay we will deny critical life saving treatment to people     living with HIV AIDS  and prevent relief aid and protection for     desperate people in Darfur and those fleeing Iraq    These     additional funds were designated by the Chairmen and Ranking Members of     the Senate and House Appropriations Committees to support the priorities     of both Democratic and Republican Senators  without exceeding the total     funding ceiling set by the President    I urge the     Senate to pass H J Res 20 without further delay
