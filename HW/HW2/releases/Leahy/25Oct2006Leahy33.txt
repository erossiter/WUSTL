       Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy To The President s News Conference On   Iraq                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Reaction Of Sen  Patrick Leahy  D Vt      To The Presidents News Conference On Iraq    Wednesday  Oct  25  2006 For years the     President has said his policy in Iraq is to stay the courseand he     ridiculed anyone who urged him to change course  Now  as the crisis     worsens and November nears  he declares that stay the course is no     longer operative  He has conveniently changed his words  but not his     policies  It is appalling     that after spending hundreds of billions of taxpayers dollars and     sacrificing 2 700 American lives  our country is less secure today  The     Bush Cheney Administrations bad decisions and poor planning have     squandered our resources and our opportunities to make America safer      Their stubborn unilateralism has undermined accountability and fostered     incompetence  Congresss current leadership has made things worse by     going AWOL on Congresss duty to provide oversight  Imagine how     different todays world would be if the Bush Cheney Administration had     not diverted our forces to Iraq and if we had put muscle into capturing     Osama bin Laden and rebuilding Afghanistan at that critical early     juncture  Meanwhile  the     situation in Iraq is worsening  while new threats like North Korea and     Iran are getting messier  Real oversight by     Congress is desperately needed to help move America forward in a new     direction  The President also should begin listening to and working     with both parties in Congress in forging answers to these worsening     problems
