       Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On The Questionnaire For Harriet Miers   To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Comment Of Senator Patrick Leahy   D Vt       Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee     On The Questionnaire For Harriet Miers     To Be Associate Justice Of The Supreme Court     October 18  2005        These answers do not help the Senate much in reaching an informed      decision about this nomination  In order to conduct a fair and      thorough review  the Senate needs information about Ms  Miers       including her experience  her judgment  her views on the      Constitution  and her independence  So far  these answers heighten       rather than lessen  concerns about whether  as a Supreme Court      justice  she would be able to maintain independence from this      administration and future administrations  Lack of responsiveness      only adds to the burden she will have in the hearings
