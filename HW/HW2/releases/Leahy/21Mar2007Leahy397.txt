       Senate Judiciary Panel Probes FBI s Misuse Of PATRIOT Act Powers                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Senate Judiciary Panel     Probes FBIs Misuse Of PATRIOT Act Powers    Inspector General Testifies About      Incredibly Sloppy Practice     That      Repeatedly Invaded Privacy Of Americans  WASHINGTON  Wednesday  March 21   The      Senate Judiciary Committee Wednesday held a hearing  Misuse of      Patriot Act Powers  examining the recent report by the Department      of Justice Inspector Generals office that found widespread misuse      of PATRIOT Act powers by the Federal Bureau of Investigation     The Inspector Generals report found      instances of improper use of National Security Letters  NSLs  in      more than one in five of the files reviewed  suggesting the      potential for thousands of violations among the tens of thousands of      NSLs the FBI issues each year  NSLs allow the FBI to request      sensitive personal information  phone toll records  email      transaction records  bank records  credit records  and other related      records  without a judge  a grand jury or even a prosecutor      evaluating the requests   This report of abuses on the NSL      authority  along with the abuses we have seen in the mass firings of      U S  attorneys  and the Justice Departments failure to provide the      data mining report that is now past due  reinforce my concerns about      this Administrations corrosive unilateralism and deep aversion to      any checks and balances  said Sen  Patrick Leahy D Vt   chairman of      the committee    Leahy  working with then Chairman      Arlen Specter  R Pa    pushed during the process of reauthorizing      the PATRIOT Act the sunshine provisions that mandated the audit      and report by the Justice Departments Inspector General of the      FBIs use of National Security Letters    While being questioned by Leahy at the      hearing  Inspector General Fine described the FBIs practice as      incredibly sloppy       Statement of      Senator Patrick Leahy  Chairman  Committee on the Judiciary     Hearing on Misuse of Patriot Act Powers     March 21  2007     I welcome Inspector General Fine to      the Committees hearing today  I am grateful for the important work      that his office has done in shining light on significant abuses of      the broad powers Congress gave the FBI to obtain information through      National Security Letters   Six years ago  in the wake of the      September 11 attacks  I worked hard with Democrats and Republicans      to ensure that the government had the powers it needed to protect us      from terrorism  I also knew that it was vital to include safeguards      and checks and balances to be sure that the government did not abuse      its powers  violate civil liberties  or needlessly invade the      privacy of Americans   In the years since  the governments      powers have increased steadily  One safeguard that I fought hard to      keep in the 2005 PATRIOT Act reauthorization was the mandate for      this review by the Department of Justice Inspector General of the      FBIs use of National Security Letters  Some of us wanted more      safeguards  but this is the best we could do and the most we could      get  Keeping the PATRIOT Acts sunset provisions and adding new      sunshine provisions to improve oversight and accountability were      among my highest priorities during that reauthorization process       Working with then Chairman Specter  we insisted on this Inspector      General review  The Inspector General issued the report earlier this      month   I am deeply troubled by the results of      this report  but I am glad that we insisted on it  We would not      know of the egregious errors and violations that Inspector General      Fine documented  extending back years   if not for these sunshine      requirements we were able to put into the 2005 rewrite of the      PATRIOT Act  These abuses might be continuing were it not for our      insistence on reporting and oversight    The Judiciary Committee must now      continue its oversight we initiated until we get to the bottom of      what went wrong and what needs to be done to prevent these abuses      from recurring  Along with this hearing  the Committee has      scheduled an oversight hearing with the FBI Director for March 27       and we are planning a hearing with the Attorney General in April       We will hold whatever other hearings we need to fulfill our      oversight role and shut down abuses and invasions of privacy   I have long been troubled by the scope      of National Security Letters  NSLs  and the lack of accountability      for their use  As the Inspector Generals report makes clear  these      concerns were well founded  NSLs allow the FBI to request sensitive      personal information  phone toll records  email transaction      records  bank records  credit records  and other related records       without a judge  a grand jury  or even a prosecutor evaluating the      requests  In the PATRIOT Act and other recent legislation  Congress      expanded the scope of information the FBI could request with NSLs      and reduced the procedural and substantive requirements for the FBI      to use them  In light of this report  we need to consider whether      Congress went too far   The Inspector General found instances      of improper use of National Security Letters in more than one in      five of the files reviewed  suggesting that there could be thousands      of violations among the tens of thousands of NSLs the FBI sends each      year  In some cases  the requests were not appropriately authorized      or did not go through proper procedures  In other cases  more      disturbingly  the FBI requested and got information it was not      entitled to under the relevant laws  The report found widespread      confusion  frequent failures to check whether agents were      requesting the information they were approved to request  and      failures to review the information when it was received  In some      cases  the FBI failed to connect the request with any ongoing      investigation in the NSL  so it is impossible now to know whether      the FBI was entitled to the information received or not   Amazingly  the Inspector Generals      report found that  of the more than 143 000 National Security Letter      requests the FBI issued from 2003 through 2005  FBI field divisions      self reported only 26 possible violations of law and policy  The      Inspector General found almost as many violations in his independent      review of only 77 case files from that period  None of the errors      the Inspector General found had been self reported by the FBI  The      FBI massively failed to find or to report its own mistakes and      abuses connected with NSLs  and documentation was incomplete in 60      percent of the files the Inspector General reviewed   I was particularly distressed by the      Inspector Generals findings about the FBIs use of so called      exigent letters  The FBI sent these letters  which are not      authorized in any statute  in at least 739 instances to telephone      companies in place of NSLs or grand jury subpoenas  Essentially       the FBI told these companies  This is an emergency  so give us      these records voluntarily  without the regular legal process  Each      letter went on to say  Subpoenas requesting this information have      been submitted to the U S  Attorneys Office who will process and      serve them formally  Only  in reality  no subpoena had been      submitted to any U S  Attorneys Office in any of the cases the      Inspector General examined  and often there was not even any      emergency  Sometimes the letters were followed up with an NSL       sometimes they werent  and sometimes the FBI did not know one way      or the other  The letters were often sent by FBI personnel who were      not authorized to sign NSLs    These abuses are unacceptable  We      cannot have the FBI requesting information under false pretenses and      proceeding with total disregard for the relevant laws  That this      lawless technique continued for years in hundreds of instances is      alarming  That it continued into 2006 despite the FBIs Office of      General Counsel becoming aware of it as early as 2004 is      astonishing  According to the Inspector Generals Report  FBI      attorneys raised concerns about the practice  suggested ways of      modifying it  but never once instructed agents to stop     Senator Grassley  who has long      bemoaned abuses and inefficiencies at the FBI and championed      whistleblowers there  wrote letters about this issue both to      Inspector General Fine and to FBI Director Mueller  He specifically      focused on Bassem Youssef  the current Chief of the unit that      produced many if not all of the exigent letters  Senator Grassley      has highlighted Mr  Youssefs whistle blower role in the past  and      Mr  Youssef has said to the press recently that he raised concerns      about exigent letters in early 2005  and senior officials were      unreceptive  I know that Senator Grassleys inquiries will help our      understanding of this issue   I want to make clear that this is not      a matter of technical violations  The FBI obtained private and      personal information about Americans and others including phone      numbers  bank records  and credit information  The FBI apparently      got this information without following the proper safeguards  and at      times agents requested and received personal information to which      they were not entitled  This information was then placed in      databases and distributed within the FBI and beyond  The Inspector      Generals report makes clear that the FBIs record keeping in      connection with NSLs was so poor that we cannot even determine what      has happened to any improperly obtained information  It may be      impossible to put that genie back into the bottle  This is not      acceptable  We cannot have unwarranted and unauthorized invasions      of Americans privacy   I hope that Inspector General Fine       and next week Director Mueller  will help us to understand the scope      of the problem  Then we must determine what to do to make sure that      the FBI does not improperly and illegally obtain information about      Americans  Trusting the FBI to fix the problem and proceed properly      from now on is not an option  We tried that already  That is why      we are holding this hearing   Real oversight will be a start  The      oversight that we managed to get into the PATRIOT Act      reauthorization led to this report and this hearing  We look      forward to the Inspector Generals follow up report  due at the end      of this year  We have already heard that the FBI  in 2006    after      the period considered in the Inspector Generals report    attempted      to cover for its improper exigent letters with blanket NSLs       each covering multiple prior requests and multiple investigations       This is another violation of the law and only compounded the      problem  I am eager to learn more about that new violation once the      Inspector General has had a chance to examine it  We will press the      FBI for more information  and we will consider what future audits      and reviews need to be legislated   We will need to explore whether the      law should require higher level review and approval  perhaps from      FBI headquarters or from Department of Justice attorneys  before      NSLs can be sent out  We should come up with an appropriate and      regulated procedure for obtaining information in an emergency  and      make clear that false and inaccurate exigent letters are not      acceptable  We should look at how to ensure that records are kept      in a way that NSLs can be connected to investigations and the      records they generate can be traced  Those whose records are      collected improperly should be able to rest assured that the problem      will be corrected and the records destroyed  Finally  we should      think about whether we need to reexamine the PATRIOT Acts expansion      of the types of information that can be obtained through NSLs and      the circumstances where they can be used  I look forward to the      insights of Senator Feingold  who has been a leader on this issue   I worked hard with Senators Specter       Feingold  Durbin and others to amend and reauthorize the PATRIOT Act      in 2005  This Committee reported a bipartisan bill that the Senate      passed  Regrettably the conference with the House was hijacked by      the Administration    I did not vote for the final version      of the Act that came out of that conference  I did not trust this      Administration to implement it fairly or honor its safeguards  I      noted at the time  this is an Administration that does not believe      in checks and balances and prefers to do everything in secret  I      had seen enough of the presidential signing statements and practices      of this Administration to be concerned  In voting against the      PATRIOT Act reauthorization  I explained  Confronted      with this Administrations claims of inherent and unchecked powers       I do not believe that the restraints we have been able to include in      this reauthorization of the PATRIOT Act are sufficient     This report of abuses on the National      Security Letter authority  along with the abuses we have seen in the      mass firings of U S  attorneys  and the Justice Departments failure      to provide the data mining report that is now past due  reinforce      those concerns    We must combat terrorism without      sacrificing individual liberties and privacy
