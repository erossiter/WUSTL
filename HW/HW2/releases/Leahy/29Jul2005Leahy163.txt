       Statment Of Senator Patrick Leahy On Senate Passage Of The USA PATRIOT   Act Improvement And Reauthorization Act                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Senator Patrick      Leahy      D Vt   Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee      On Senate Passage     Of The USA PATRIOT Act Improvement And Reauthorization Act     Friday  July 29  2005    The Senate passed      its version of the USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization bill     on Friday night at about 8 10 p m  Leahy  a co author of the bill       supported the bill    Mr  LEAHY  Mr  President  last week       the Committee on the Judiciary did something that the Administration      has been urging us to do all year  we reported a bill that      reauthorizes every expiring provision of the USA PATRIOT Act  This      achievement was particularly notable for its bipartisanship       Following months of intense negotiations involving members from both      sides of the aisle  we produced a consensus bill that won the      support of every member of the Committee  I commend Chairman      Specter and all Members of the Committee for their work on this      important legislation  We made possible something that many of us      would have thought impossible just a few weeks ago  A PATRIOT Act      improvement and reauthorization package approved by every member of      the United States Senate   The bill we pass today    S 1389  as      reported    has three key elements   First  the bill protects the privacy      interests of Americans  It requires the government to convince a      judge that a person is connected to terrorism or espionage before      obtaining their library records  medical records or other sensitive      personal information  It also requires the government to notify the      target of a sneak and peek search within seven days  instead of      the undefined delay that is currently permitted by the PATRIOT Act   Second  the bill enhances judicial      oversight and protects free speech rights  It gives the recipient      of an order for sensitive personal information the right to      challenge the order in court on the same grounds as they could      challenge a grand jury subpoena  It also provides a right to      challenge the gag order that currently prevents people who receive a      request for records from speaking out even if they feel the      government is violating their rights   Third  the bill increases transparency      and ensures accountability  One of my principal objectives in this      reauthorization process has been to introduce more sunshine into the      PATRIOT Act  The reported bill requires increased reporting by the      Department of Justice on its use of several PATRIOT Act powers       including roving wiretaps  business record orders  and sneak and      peak search warrants  It also sets a 4 year sunset on three      domestic surveillance powers with great potential to affect civil      liberties   Like the PATRIOT Act itself  S 1389 is      not the bill that I  or any Member  would have written if compromise      were unnecessary  I would have liked the bill to include additional      checks and balances on certain government surveillance powers      granted or expanded by the PATRIOT Act  I would have liked the bill      to include more sunshine provisions  as well as additional sunsets       I regret that the bill repeals a sunset provision that Congress      enacted just last year and that is not due to expire until the end      of 2006   While far from perfect  S 1389 is a      good bill  which moves the law in what I believe is the right      direction  The bill is also substantially better  from a civil      liberties perspective  than either the House bill  H R 3199  or the      bill reported by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence       S 1266  And as the product of true bipartisanship    an 18 to 0      vote is something you do not see every day in the Senate Judiciary      Committee  it is a bill in which the American people can and should      have confidence  I hope that the bipartisan effort that got us to      this point will carry over to the conference and speed this bill to      final passage
