       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On S J  Res 1  The Marriage Protection   Amendment                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT             Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy       Ranking Member  Committee On The Judiciary      S J  Res  1  Marriage Protection Amendment      Executive Business Meeting      May 18  2006  That this Committee is meeting       this morning when so many of us are trying to focus on       comprehensive immigration reform  and other members of the       Intelligence Committee are heading to the confirmation hearings       on a new nominee to head the CIA  is testament to the misplaced       priorities of the  Senate Republican leadership  We are       taking time away from making progress on comprehensive       immigration reform and debating an important nomination in order       to push through a purely political piece of legislation aimed at       shoring up a faction of the fraying Republican base  We saw       earlier this week on the front page of  The New York Times a       detailed report about how this proposed constitutional amendment       is being used to satisfy the most extreme right wing supporters       of Republican politicians     The Constitution is       too important to be used for such base  partisan politics  I       agreed with First Lady Laura Bush when she told Fox News that       this proposed amendment should not be used as a campaign tool        obviously  But  obviously  that is exactly what Karl Rove and       others are doing  That is why we only vote on such partisan       measures months before elections     I have heard many       people describe this amendment as writing discrimination into       the Constitution  I agree  That is exactly what we are being       asked to decide today     This debate and the       Republican leaderships strenuous contortions to move this       proposed amendment to the Senate for further debate shows how       important it is to the Republican leadership of the Senate to       cater to the extreme right wing and to special interest groups       that are agitating for a fight over this issue  They intend to       stir up an election year fight and use it as a campaign tool       and a political strategy    At a time when the Senate should       be addressing Americans top priorities  including ways to make       America safer  the war in Iraq  rising gas prices and record       deficits  health care costs  stem cell research  comprehensive       immigration reform and the reauthorization of the Voting Rights       Act  the Presidents political strategists and his Senate allies       instead are actively trying to divide and distract from fixing       real problems by pushing forward with this controversial       amendment  This is a strategy to divide  America  not to unite America         As a nation we are currently       facing many pressing issues  the persistent deadly violence in       Iraq  stunning investigations  indictments and convictions over       government corruption  a complicated drug program that now       penalizes our seniors  a burgeoning national debt  historically       high gas prices  and on and on  This Committee has been       conducting hearings but has yet to get to the bottom of the       Administrations warrantless wiretapping and other programs that       have been gathering information on Americans  The Senate had       been debating comprehensive reform to our countrys immigration       laws  We need to turn our attention to reauthorizing the       expiring provisions of the Voting Rights Act     But this morning in this       Committee  and soon after Memorial Day on the Senate Floor  we       are being made to turn  again  to a divisive measure that will       do nothing to correct the weaknesses in our homeland security        will do nothing to enact a budget that is now overdue  will do       nothing to lower gas prices and will do nothing to respond to       the most pressing issues facing hardworking Americans that are       front and center on the publics agenda  but not on the       Senates   As the Members of this Committee       surely remember  proponents of the Federal Marriage Amendment in       2004  the last election year  could not assemble a majority of       Senators to move to consider the proposed amendment  In 2004        we were warned that immediate action was required to protect the       fragile institution of marriage  which was said to be under       immediate threat   In the past two years  no States       have been forced to recognize same sex marriages  Rather        several States voted to amend their State constitutions to       define marriage  The Defense of Marriage Act remains the law of       the land  There was then  and is now  no imminent crisis that       demands this political diversion of Congresss attention from       all these other urgent problems  I have believed  and continue       to believe  there is no justification for altering our founding       document to federalize marriage for the first time     We have heard and will hear a lot       of rhetoric about judicial activism  The proponents of this       constitutional amendment claimed that we had to pass it in order       to prevent courts from inflicting same sex marriage on the       American people against their will  Does anyone really believe       that Chief Justice Roberts is going to preside over a United       States Supreme Court that will override State law in this       regard    Ironically  the proposed       amendment  now renamed the Marriage Protection Amendment  would       itself produce a wide range of litigation that judges  the very       boogeymen that proponents of the proposed amendment demonize        would be required to resolve  It would be judges who would be       resolving the ambiguities and the meaning of this measure         The proposal we are being required       to consider is exceedingly confusing and subject to       interpretation  Its sweeping language will inevitably create       uncertainty  For example  who would be bound by the provisions       of the Marriage Protection Amendment  State actors  private       citizens  or religious organizations  What would constitute the       legal incidents of marriage  Can a legislature pass a civil       unions law that mirrors its marriage law  so long as it does       not use the word marriage  Can the people of a State put       protections for civil unions in their State constitution  What       State actors are forbidden from construing their own       constitutions  the judiciary only  or State executive branch       officials as well    I am particularly concerned about       the fate of the       Vermont civil unions that have been formed under the color of       State law  Despite an initially contentious debate  this State       law remains on the books after five years  There has been no       ensuing crisis in the lives of Vermont families  It is not       clear to me  however  whether the proposed amendment would make       the Vermont law unconstitutional  In short  while the language       of the amendment before us has changed slightly from the       original version  it raises the same concerns    During the subcommittee hearing on       this amendment  we received testimony that illuminated the       problems with the proposed language  While academic discussion       of the proposed language was helpful  I am still not clear where       President Bush stands on this matter  He spoke more clearly       this week on the elements of immigration legislation than ever       before  I have praised him for that  But in connection with       this proposed amendment  he is still having it all ways  For       some time now I have been asking the President to explain what       language he supports when he gives speeches on the need for a       constitutional amendment  My letters have gone unanswered  So       I must continue to ask whether the language that this Committee       is considering today is endorsed by the President  I note for       the record that the White House has not sent a representative to       offer the Presidents support or concern for the scope of this       drastic proposal   I remember a time when leaving       States in control of issues such as family law was an easy       decision for Members on both sides of the aisle     I am disappointed that Senators       would endorse this broadly drafted amendment since it so clearly       violates the traditions of Federalism and local control that       many have claimed to respect and cherish    It reminds me of last year when we       were called into emergency session to try to overturn very       competent state courts that had thoroughly and repeatedly       reviewed Terri Schiavos medical decisions  What happened to       conservatives who would oppose the federal governments       intrusion on the prerogative of the states  The states have       traditionally set the laws on marriage  They say what age you       have to be to marry  whether you have to have your parents       permission  and so on  The states have done that  And what we       ought to do is allow the states to do that    Most states are going to say       marriage is between a man and a woman  My own State of  Vermont  because of our       Constitution  was given a question  Would we support gay       marriage  Our State said no  We have civil unions  which give       gay couples legal rights of inheritance and so on    In addition to my concerns that       this effort will trample on State authority and responsibility        I am concerned that this proposal is writing       discrimination into the Constitution  How will this measure       affect American families that currently exist in this country       who seek the protection of civil unions and the acknowledgment       of their committed relationships  I hope that those who claim       to care about families will turn away from wedge politics and       scapegoating and diminishing others  Instead  we should join       together to work on the many pressing issues already piling up       on Congresss doorstep    On Monday evening  President Bush       spoke eloquently about this country and our values  He       emphasized something I wish that the White House and the       Republican leadership of the Congress would keep in mind in       connection with their efforts to demonize lesbians and gays        The President said  We cannot build a unified country by       inciting people to anger  or playing on anyones fears  or       exploiting the issue of  and here I insert marriage for       immigration for political gain  We must always remember that       real lives will be affected by our debates and decisions  and       that every human being has dignity and value          As an American who has been       married for more than 40 years  I am a great fan of the       institution of marriage  I also believe it is important to       encourage and to sanction committed relationships  I respect       and admire my State of  Vermont for the careful and civil       manner in which the Green Mountain State has resolved this       matter by recognizing civil unions  For all these reasons  I       continue to oppose measures such as this proposed constitutional       amendment  and I am saddened by the cynicism that sometimes       propels such divisive efforts to the fore
