       Leahy Seeks Answers For NASA s Elimination Of To Understand And Protect   Our Home Planet From NASA s Mission Statement                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Leahy     Seeks Answers For NASA s Elimination     Of To Understand And Protect Our Home Planet     From NASA s Mission Statement      May 15  2007  The Hon  Robert J  Portman    Director    Office of Management and Budget    Executive Office Building    Washington  D C  20503  Dear DirectorPortman   In the Senates oversight capacity on the     Appropriations Committees panel that handles the Senates work in     writing the annual appropriations bills for NASA  I write to ask about     the Administrations unilateral deletion from NASAs mission statement     of this phrase   To     understand and protect our home planet   Though this action came to light last     year  it still has not been adequately explained by the Administration   My understanding is that NASAs mission     statement had been forged in 2001 and 2002 through an inclusive process     that involved the work of representatives from the NASA centers  with     further input from the general NASA workforce  Elimination of the home     planet phrase apparently first occurred in an Administration spending     report delivered to Congress in February 2006  the same report that     retroactively slashed the Earth Science research budget    and in the     wake of the controversy surrounding the muzzling of NASA scientists like     Dr  James Hansen  Director of NASAs Goddard Institute for Space     Studies  This unfortunate action came amid rising concern about the     effects of the Administrations intended reductions for NASAs earth     sciences budget    I have seen Administrator Griffins letter     to The New York Times  7 25 06  on this topic  which does not     satisfactorily answer several questions that I have about this change       I ask that you supply answers to these     questions   What     process was followed in making this change  Who first suggested this     change  and when  What reasons were first used  internally  in     attempting to justify this change  Was this decision adequately     communicated and explained to the NASA workforce  and if so  how was     this done    In its substance and in its timing  this     change gave every appearance of being another unilateral and politically     motivated tangent of what has sometimes been called the Administrations     war on science  This abrupt change was also an affront to NASAs     employees  who in good faith participated in the process of constructing     NASAs Mission Statement  They  and the American people  deserve to     know how this happened  who initiated it  and why   I make these requests without the     knowledge of Dr  Hansen or any other employee of NASA  and I look     forward to your prompt reply   Sincerely    PATRICK LEAHY    Member  Subcommittee On Commerce  Justice  Science  And Related Agencies    Committee On Appropriations  cc The Hon  Barbara Mikulski   Chair   Subcommittee On     Commerce  Justice  Science  And Related Agencies   Committee On     Appropriations  The     Hon  Richard Shelby     Ranking Member     Subcommittee On Commerce  Justice  Science  And Related     Agencies     Committee On Appropriations  The     Hon  Michael Griffin  Administrator  NASA
