       Statement Of Senator Leahy On Confirmation Hearings Of Alberto Gonzales                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT     Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy         Ranking Member  Senate Judiciary Committee         Confirmation Hearings On The Nomination        Of Alberto Gonzales        To Be Attorney General Of The United States        January 6  2005  Judge Gonzales  welcome to the Senate Judiciary Committee  In the 109th         Congress we also welcome a very experienced member of the committee            Senator Specter    as our new chairman    We are entrusted by the American people  the Senate and our         Constitution to do a thorough and fair job in considering nominations for         the Executive Branch of government  At the outset  I want to make clear how inspiring your life story is         The recent Washington Post profile of your lifes journey touched me        in particular as few articles have  The road you have traveled from being a        twelve year old boy selling soft drinks at football games  all the way to        the State House in Texas and our White House  is a tribute to you and to        your family   I am sure today we will hear more about your life story  We are also        here to learn more about Alberto Gonzales as counsel to the President  And        we are here to try to glean a portrait of the kind of Attorney General you        would become if confirmed by the Senate    The Role Of Attorney General  The Attorney General should represent the interests of all Americans and        is the nations chief law enforcement officer  As Justice James Iredell        wrote in 1792  the person who serves as Attorney General  to quote him  is        not called Attorney General of the President  but Attorney General of the        United States   This post is quite distinct from the position Judge Gonzales has        performed for the President in which he acted as a spokesman for the        Administration and appeared as chief defense lawyer for the White House on        a range of important and politically sensitive matters   A key question before this hearing is whether the nominee shares this        view of the crucial role of the U S  Attorney General   When he was designated for this position by the President  Judge        Gonzales said that he was looking forward to  in his words  continuing to        work with friends and colleagues in the White House in a different capacity        on behalf of our President   But there may be times when the Attorney General of the United States        has to enforce the law and cannot be worried about friends  colleagues and        benefactors at the White House  At a time when the Republican Party has taken control of all three        branches of the Federal Government  my worry is that our system of checks        and balances may become short circuited by too few checks on assertions of        Executive Branch authority  My concern is that during several high profile matters in your        professional career you have appeared to serve as a facilitator  rather        than an independent force in the policy making process  The job of Attorney        General is not about crafting rationalizations for ill conceived ideas  It        is a much more vital role than that  It is about being a forceful         independent voice in our continuing quest for justice and in defense of the        constitutional rights of each and every American    Need For A Fresh Start  We have now seen what happens when the rule of law plays second fiddle        to a Presidents policy agenda  With John Ashcroft as Attorney General and        with a White House Counsels office that has impulsively facilitated rather        than cautiously vetted serious constitutional issues  the Administration        has taken one untenable legal position after another regarding the rule of        law in the war against terror   The few times that Attorney General Ashcroft consented to appear before        this Senate oversight committee  he brandished intimidation as a weapon         sometimes going so far as to say that questioning the Administrations        policies was giving aid and comfort to our enemies   By contrast  Judge Gonzales nomination seems to offer the possibility        of a new era   But as I told the nominee when we met within days of the announcement of        his nomination  these hearings matter  We need to know more about his        judgment and actions in connection with the tragic legal and policy changes        formulated in secret by this Administration that are still hidden from        proper congressional oversight and public scrutiny    Policy Changes Leading to Torture  Those policies include this nominees role in developing interpretations        of the law to justify harsh treatment of prisoners tantamount to torture         Americas troops and citizens are at greater risk because of those actions        and the terrible repercussions throughout so much of the world  The searing        photographs from Abu Ghraib have made it harder to create and maintain the        alliances we need to prevail against the vicious terrorists who threaten        us  Those abuses serve as recruiting posters for the terrorists  The scandal of Abu Ghraib  allegations of mistreatment at Guantanamo         and charges from cases in Iraq and Afghanistan are serious matters with        lingering questions and unresolved accountability  These hearings are about        a nomination  but these hearings are also about accountability   From the outset of public disclosure of the Abu Ghraib photographs  the        Bush Administration maintained that any wrongdoing was the action of a few        bad apples   As bits of information has been made public by the press over the last        year  it has become clear to all that these incidents at U S  facilities        around the world are not just the actions of a few low ranking members of        the military  Rather  in the upper reaches of the Executive Branch a        process was set in motion that rolled forward to produce scandalous        results   The Army Field Manual reflects our nations long held policies toward        prisoners  It says  The goal of any interrogation is to obtain reliable        information in a lawful manner  U S  policy expressly prohibit s  acts of        violence or intimidation  including physical or mental torture  threats         insults  or exposure to inhumane treatment as a means of or to aid        interrogation   The policies are in place for good reason  The Field Manual continues         The use of torture is a poor technique that yields unreliable results  may        damage subsequent collection efforts  and can induce the source to say what        he thinks the interrogator wants to hear        It also may place U S  and        allied personnel in enemy hands at greater risk   Yet senior officials in the Bush White House  Ashcroft Justice        Department and Rumsfeld Pentagon set in motion a systematic effort to        minimize  distort and even ignore our laws  policies and agreements on        torture and the treatment of prisoners  Defense Secretary Rumsfeld and         later  Lt  Gen  Ricardo Sanchez  authorized the use of techniques that were        contrary to both U S  military manuals and international law  Former CIA        Director Tenet requested and Secretary Rumsfeld approved the secret        detention of ghost detainees in Iraq so that they could be hidden from        the International Committee of the Red Cross  Still unexplained are        instances where the U S  Government delivered prisoners to other countries        known to utilize torture  Where is the responsibility and accountability        for these abuses   We are the most powerful nation on earth  the most powerful nation the        earth has ever known  a country that cherishes liberty and human rights  a        nation that has been a beacon of hope and freedom to the world  We face        vicious enemies in the war on terrorism  but we can and will defeat them        without sacrificing our values or stooping to their levels  I believe there        are several people in the audience who are themselves survivors of torture        committed by the armed forces and secret police of other countries that do        not share our values  They continue to struggle to overcome those        horrifying experiences  and they are very concerned that we not retreat        from the high standards against torture that we have held up to the world        in the past  I appreciate being made aware of their presence here today          Opportunity For Accountability  These hearings are an opportunity at long last for some accountability        for this meltdown of longstanding U S  policy on torture  As White House        Counsel  Judge Gonzales was at the center of discussions on the        applicability of the Geneva Conventions to the wars in Afghanistan and        Iraq  and the legality of detention and interrogation methods that have        been seen as tantamount to torture  He oversaw the formulation of this        Administrations extreme views of unfettered executive power and        unprecedented government secrecy   I hope things will be different if you are confirmed  Judge Gonzales  I        hope that you will be accessible to Members of this Committee  and more        responsive  Judge Gonzales  I welcome you and your family   I know the President asked our incoming Chairman to proceed        expeditiously with these hearings  and I have worked with him and other        Members of the Committee to do just that
