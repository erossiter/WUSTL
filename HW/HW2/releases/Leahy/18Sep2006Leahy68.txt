       Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy On Sri Lanka                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT           Statement Of Sen  Patrick Leahy     On     Sri Lanka     September 18  2006 Mr  LEAHY  I want to take a moment to discuss      the situation in Sri Lanka  which not long ago was one of promise      after a ceasefire agreement was signed in 2002 between the former      government and the LTTE Tamil Tigers  The ceasefire was never      perfect  but for several years negotiations on a political      settlement offered a ray of hope for an end to the conflict  After      April 2006  however  there was escalating violence and an increasing      pattern of violations of the ceasefire agreement by both sides   On July 20  the LTTE closed a reservoir sluice      gate in an LTTE controlled area near the eastern town of Trincomalee       cutting the water supply to about 60 000 people in      government controlled territory  In response  Sri Lankan government      forces conducted air strikes over several days against LTTE      positions in the area and on July 30 began a ground offensive to      capture the reservoirs control point  This increase in violence      contributed to the more than 800 deaths reported between January and      August  including some in which large numbers of civilians were      killed in flagrant violations of international law by both sides       and hundreds more combatants and civilians have died since then  Politically motivated killings  the recruitment      of child soldiers  indiscriminate raids on civilians  targeting of      international aid workers  and torture in police custody are only      some of the human rights abuses that have been recently committed as      reported by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch       Additionally  a looming humanitarian crisis exists as the number of      Sri Lankans displaced within the country by fighting this year has      passed the 200 000 mark  and an estimated 8 700 citizens have fled      to India  Road  air and sea links to the Tamil population in the      north have been cut  and food  water and fuel shortages are severe  We should be deeply concerned with the collapse      of the peace process and escalating violence in Sri Lanka  Although      it is apparent that neither the government nor the LTTE can defeat      the other militarily  nor have they demonstrated the political will      to stop the fighting and resolve this conflict peacefully  A report      on September 13 that the government and the LTTE have proposed new      peace talks is welcome  But the Sri Lankan people have been      disappointed countless times before  Several steps should be taken      immediately  most importantly to prevent further harm to civilians      who have suffered disproportionately   It is critical that humanitarian aid be allowed      to reach those who have been displaced  whether as a result of the      conflict or the lingering effects of the December 2004 tsunami       Relief agencies need unimpeded access to the affected populations       and civilians should be allowed to leave contested areas  The LTTE has been designated a terrorist      organization by the United States Government on account of its      wanton attacks against civilians and forced recruitment of      children  These abusive tactics  which flagrantly violate      international law  should be universally condemned   There is also the issue of United States      support to Sri Lankan Government security forces  who have been      responsible for violations of human rights  The Department of State      needs to be doubly sure that the Leahy Amendment  which prohibits      U S  assistance to units of foreign security forces who violate      human rights  is being strictly complied with   In addition  we should reaffirm our support for      the Sri Lanka Monitoring Mission  which reports on violations of the      ceasefire by both sides  A stronger monitoring presence would deter      abuses  provide systematic documentation of violations  and help to      address the problem of impunity that has contributed to the      recurrent cycles of violence and reprisal in Sri Lanka  Mr  President  Sri Lanka is a divided country       but its people  whether Sinhalese  Tamil or Muslim  are as gentle       industrious and peace loving as any in the world  The Tamils have      legitimate demands  but the LTTEs tactics are deplorable  The      government has been divided  and it has not been able to provide the      sustained leadership necessary to reconcile the interests of the      conflicting parties  The chairs of the Tokyo Donors Conference       Japan  the European Union  Norway and the United States  need to      find more effective ways to convince both sides to return to the      bargaining table  There is no other way to end this conflict  The      longer it takes to resume a process of good faith negotiations the      more responsibility the LTTE and the government will bear for the      needless deaths of innocent civilians   I yield the floor
