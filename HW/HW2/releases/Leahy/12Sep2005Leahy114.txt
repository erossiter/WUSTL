       Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy On S J  Res  20  A Resolution To   Disapprove The Administration s Mercury Rule                  U S  SENATOR PATRICK        LEAHY                  VERMONT               Statement Of Senator Patrick Leahy     On S J Res  20  A Resolution To Disapprove     The Administration s Mercury Rule     September 12  2005 If we ever      wondered what a mercury pollution rule would look like if it were      written by the polluters  now we know  This is pretty much it       Given the trust that people have justifiably had in the      Environmental Protection Agency since its creation during the Nixon      Administration  it is sad  and it is appalling  to see how the      agency has been captured by polluting special interests in decisions      about limiting mercury pollution  And it is      regrettable that the American people and many of their      representatives in Congress have been forced to the conclusion that      the mercury rule has been so mishandled and so co opted by special      interests that this rare effort to override this rule has become      necessary  But it HAS become necessary  And today the United      States Senate will have a choice to make about the future of toxic      mercury pollution     Do we follow the      Bush Administration  and the well funded special interests who are      creating most of this mercury pollution  in taking several steps      backward  forcing the American people to wait at least another      decade before cleaning up the toxic mercury that is spewing out of      old dirty power plants across the country   Do we allow this      new rule to let toxic mercury    a substance so harmful that it      causes birth defects  IQ loss and mental retardation  continue to      poison children and pregnant women  while costing taxpayers billions      in healthcare costs  Shouldnt the proliferation of warnings that      our states and the federal government have had to give to sportsmen      and women and to the general public about the consumption of fish       fish caught in streams and lakes and rivers all across America    be      enough to shame our government into action   Do we allow this      rule to move forward when EPAs own Inspector General has said it      does not comply with EPA and Executive Order requirements  And when      the General Accountability Office has said there are major      shortcomings in the economic analysis  Or do we uphold      the bipartisan work that produced the Clean Air Act  protect the      health of pregnant women and children  and begin now to clean up the      toxic mercury emissions now   The Clean Air Act      requires the EPA to control each power plant s emissions of mercury      and other toxics by 2008 at the latest  The Act requires each plant      to use the maximum achievable control technology on every      generating unit  That is the law of the land  Anything less means      more pollution  But instead of      working to enforce and implement the Clean Air Act  as two previous      Administrations had  the Bush Administration has turned the Clean      Air Act on its head  With this rule the Administration revokes an      earlier EPA finding that it is necessary and appropriate to      require that each power plant apply technology to reduce mercury      emissions   Let me repeat      those plain  startling facts  By revoking the earlier EPA finding      and deciding instead to coddle the biggest mercury polluters  the      Administration is saying it is no longer necessary or appropriate to      adequately control mercury emissions  Although I am somewhat      impressed that they can make this statement with straight faces  I      am appalled at their audacious disregard for the health of the      American people  and  like the scientific community  I am baffled by      their gymnastic arguments   As this chart      demonstrates  the plain and simple truth is that this rule will      allow more mercury into our environment than does the current law       Hundreds of the oldest  dirtiest power plants will not even control      mercury emissions for more than a decade  That is what this rule      gives us  More pollution  for longer than the Clean Air Act allows       This rule is all      the more shameful because the evidence of public health and      environmental damage from mercury and other toxics is clear enough      for action right now  Look at EPAs  own      estimate of the number of newborns at risk of elevated mercury      exposure  which has doubled to 630 000  EPA also found that one in      six pregnant women has mercury levels in her blood above EPAs safe      threshold   The National      Academy of Sciences has confirmed scientific research showing that      maternal consumption of unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause      neuro developmental harm in children  resulting in learning      disabilities  poor motor function  mental retardation  seizures and      cerebral palsy   Just last week a      new peer reviewed study by the Mount Sinai School of Medicines      Center for Childrens Health and the Environment  found that our      country loses two billion dollars each year from the impact of      mercury on childrens brain development   Mercury emissions      have also contaminated ten million acres of lakes and 400 000 miles      of streams  and they have triggered advisories in 45 States warning      Americas 41 million recreational fishermen that the fish they catch      may not be safe to eat    Yet it      seems that many in Congress have wanted to join the Administration      in trying to avoid any public      daylight on this flawed rule  The Environment and Public Works      Committee has refused to even hold a single hearing on this rule   One reason for      the Administrations lack of candor clearly is the discovery that      this rule has polluting industries fingerprints all over it  EPAs      first proposal for these rules lifted exact texts from memoranda      provided by utility industry lobbyists  Another reason may be      because the American people would find a process where the lobbyists      are shut in and the public is shut out  where the scientific and      economic analysis was manipulated  and where the publics health was      ignored   EPAs own      Inspector General and the General Accountability Office criticized      almost every aspect of how EPA drafted this rule  Unfortunately       their recommendations to improve it were also ignored  So were more      than 680 000 public comments  a record for any EPA rule  So were      the comments of many state environment departments  attorneys      general  doctors  educators  sportsmen groups and EPAs own advisory      committees  And  although it should not come as a surprise after      four years working with this Administration  the comments of 45      Senate and 184 House members were also ignored  Instead they      produced a rule that will do nothing for at least a decade  despite      years of analysis by EPA showing the need for quick action       According to EPAs own Regulatory Impact Analysis  we will be lucky      if one percent of power plant capacity will have mercury controls by      2015  and only three percent by 2020   As a Vermonter I      know it is appropriate and necessary to limit the pollution plumes      from grandfathered power plants  You cannot even see my state on      EPAs maps showing mercury pollution because so much of it is being      dumped on us from upwind power plants  Vermonters and New      Englanders have been waiting for decades for EPA to take action so      that our lakes can be cleaned up   For all      their talk of family values  the Administration has again put the      value of corporate contributions    not families    first  It is      not a family value to tell a whole generation of women that their      health is not important  It is not a family value to put another      generation of young kids at risk of learning disabilities  These      mercury rules do just that  It is time to put      people first  and to stop letting the big polluters and the special      interests write the rules and run the show over at EPA  The people we      represent in the United States Senate will be watching the choice      that the Senate    and that we as individual Senators    will make      in this vote  Will we side with the American people  or with the      big polluters   If we      let the Administrations rollback of mercury limits stand  what will      we say to the families and the communities who live downwind of      these mercury plumes  And what will we say to the families who live      in the hotspots of today  or of tomorrow   This      rule would leave mercury pollution from power plants  the largest      emitter of mercury in the United States  as the only source of toxic      air pollution that is allowed to avoid rigorous emissions standards      under the Clean Air Act  That is a daily  tangible and dangerous      risk to the health of the American people that we need not  and we      should not  accept    The      Administrations mercury rule is a danger to Americas women and      children  It is time to do it over  and to get it right  I urge      support of the motion to proceed
