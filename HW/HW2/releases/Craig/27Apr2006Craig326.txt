CUTTING EDGE OF PROSTHETICS
  A new type of prosthetic hand was demonstrated today at a hearing of the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. Chairman Larry Craig even got to use the device himself as electrodes were hooked to his upper forearm. Within a few seconds he was able to have the prosthetic hand hold a glass of water. 
   Craig is an advocate for more research and development by VA scientists, especially to meet the needs of those who have been injured in combat. During a hearing today[1] on VA research, he noted the past accomplishments of VA researchers.
   "VA research has played a major role in a number of historic breakthroughs: the first successful liver transplant, the development of the first cardiac pacemaker, and the technology that led to the development of the CT scan - to name a few," Craig said.
   Dr. Dennis Stevens, Associate Chief of Staff for Research and Development at the Boise, Idaho, VA Medical Center told the committee about the research being conducted there. One Boise researcher is studying anthracyclines - chemotherapy drugs that are also antibiotics - while another is working on what is causing the increasing number of streptococcal infections.
   Dr. Jon Perlin, the Under Secretary of Health for the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, told Craig and other members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs that further developments are in the pipeline.
   "Can we develop artificial retinas so that wounded soldiers and our aging veterans can regain their sight? Can we use our computerized medical record system and genetic samples to individualize drug and clinical treatments, or identify those veterans who may have a predisposition for a particular disease and prevent the onset of, rather than treat, the symptoms?," Perlin asked, rhetorically. "The answers to these questions must be 'yes.'"
   Sen. Craig, the committee's chairman, and Sen. Daniel Akaka (D-Hawaii), the committee's lead Democrat, were recently joined by a bipartisan group of 60 other senators who are seeking increased funding VA research. Their request now awaits action in a subcommittee of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   The prosthetic hand Craig was able to demonstrate today was developed by Dr. Richard Weir[2], a research scientist who works at the VA Prosthetics Research Laboratory in Chicago. The ultimate goal is to produce artificial hands and legs which can feel - providing sensory feedback to the brain.
