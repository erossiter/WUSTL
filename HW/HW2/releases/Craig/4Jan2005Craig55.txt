SEN. CRAIG HIRES NEW STAFF FOR IDAHO FALLS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced the hiring of Michael T. "Mick" Webster as a Constituent Services Representative in his Idaho Falls Regional Office.  
 Webster replaces Knut Meyerin, who was recently promoted to Regional Director of the Idaho Falls Office. 
   "Mick was born and raised in Eastern Idaho, on the family ranch near Mud Lake," said Craig. "I'm very confident that he has a strong grasp on the issues that are important to Idahoans and will do an outstanding job on their behalf. I am very pleased to have him join our team, and we all look forward to working with him." 
   "Growing up in Idaho, and coming from an agricultural background, I have always admired Senator Craig's conservative, western approach to politics, and am pleased to have an opportunity now to be on his team," said Webster. "Coming from this area has given me knowledge of the concerns of our constituents, which I feel will be of benefit to the Idaho Falls office." 
   Webster graduated from West Jefferson High School and earned his B.S. Degree in Political Science from Idaho State University. He currently resides in Idaho Falls with his wife and son.
