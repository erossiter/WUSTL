PROJECTS APPROVED FOR SALMON, WATER, FIRST RESPONDERS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Commerce, Justice, State, Judiciary (CJSJ) and Foreign Operations Appropriations bills today. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Committee, announced that several projects were included for Idaho.  
   Craig said, "The Senate supported projects today that will improve life for Idahoans by making Idaho safer, improving water delivery, and recovering salmon." 
   Below are projects in the CJSJ bill:
   * Criminal Information Sharing Alliance Network ($750,000): The Network is considered a model for collection and secure sharing of law enforcement information, and an excellent example of cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Idaho will make it the central intelligence-gathering system for their homeland security efforts. 
   * Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund ($6 million): The Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund was created in 1999 for the purpose of meeting obligations of the Pacific Salmon Treaty and recovering threatened and endangered salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. In Fiscal Year 2004, Idaho was finally included in the fund through the appropriations process, and it strives to accelerate salmon recovery in the Northwest. 
   * Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Bi-State Safety Project ($1.25 million): The Project will address the continuing staffing needs in the eight counties in Idaho and Montana (deputies and reserve deputies, dispatchers, search and rescue, overtime, etc.) that are directly involved in the Bicentennial celebration. In order to ensure public safety, there are serious needs in these counties for increased staffing, so first responders will receive needed training, equipment, and supplies. 
   * Improving local water delivery ($495,000): Idaho State University will work to transfer geospatial research and remote sensing technology to federal, state, and local water resource organizations with the goal being to improve water delivery. More efficient delivery of water will result in benefits to all Idaho water users, including increasing the water available to the Idaho Water Bank, which will make the water available to augment both consumptive and non-consumptive uses. 
   The CJSJ bill also would benefit jobs and communities by supporting several Idaho priorities within the federal Economic Development Administration, including the Idaho Rural Partnership's "business clusters" and rural development projects; the University of Idaho's Food Processing Entrepreneurship Assistance project; Boise State University's Youth Summit that educates about international trade; development of a comprehensive economic plan by the Nez Perce Tribe; and multi-purpose facilities planning at the Eastern Idaho Fairgrounds. Department of Justice support would also continue for a Nez Perce child education program. 
   The Foreign Operations Appropriations bill includes $500,000 for the Peregrine Fund Neotropical Raptor Center, which is operated by the Boise-based Peregrine Fund. The Center utilizes the successful recovery methods pioneered by the Peregrine Fund to recover neo-tropical birds in Central and South America. 
   Both bills now will be considered by the full Senate.
