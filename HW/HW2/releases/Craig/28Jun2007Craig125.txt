SEN. CRAIG: IMMIGRATION REFORM NEEDED
  The United States Senate failed to put a time limit on debate on S. 1639, the Immigration Reform bill today. The vote on cloture, which required 60 votes to pass, was 45-52. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig supported cloture.  
   Following the vote, he issued the following statement: 
   "Everyone can agree there is a problem that needs to be solved. Idahoans didn't elect me to be a Dr. No - I came here to solve problems, and I have worked for the past 8 years to solve our immigration problems, especially as they relate to agriculture. 
   "Despite today's vote, we still have a problem that needs to be solved. We have seen and will continue to see our farmers suffer from a labor crisis. We need to help them sooner rather than later, and I will continue to work towards that end. 
   "For the past several years, I and others have worked to shore up border security. As an appropriator who helps to shape national spending priorities, I will continue that work. However, to fix our immigration system, we also need a workable temporary guest worker program and a way to deal with the estimated 12 million undocumented workers already in our country. Focusing solely on border security will only exacerbate the problems we have. 
   "If there are further efforts in the future on immigration, I hope they will include a number of positive reforms that the American people demanded and were included in the bill that stalled today: 
   * Makes significant additional improvements in border security; 
   * Recognizes that agricultural workers have unique requirements; 
   * Limits chain migration; 
   * Requires workers to return to their home countries to apply for a green card; 
   * Establishes a workable guest worker program; 
   * Implements a merit-based system to ensure immigrants add value to our economy and country."
