SENS. CRAIG/BAUCUS INTRODUCE BILL TO PAY-OUT LUMBER TARIFFS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Montana Sen. Max Baucus, ranking member of the Senate Finance Committee, introduced legislation today to require that tariffs collected from Canadian lumber companies be paid to injured U.S. companies. 
   Upon introducing the bill, the Softwood Lumber Duties Liquidation Act, Craig exclaimed, "I rise today with a heavy heart because it has been more than four years since the expiration of the Canadian Softwood Lumber Agreement, and we have very little to show for it except a U.S. industry that is still a victim of the situation. For every log truck that comes across the border from Canada, another light at a U.S. timber company goes out permanently."
   The U.S. Commerce Department determined that Canadian timber policies amounted to an unfair subsidy and led to the dumping of artificially cheap softwood lumber into the U.S. market. Meanwhile, the U.S. International Trade Commission ruled that the subsidies and dumped imports injured the U.S. lumber industry, warranting the imposition of tariffs.
   Under current U.S. law, the deposits sitting in escrow are eligible for liquidation. Nearly $3 billion has been collected since the duties were first imposed in May 2002, when the United States slapped antidumping and countervailing tariffs amounting to more than 27% on Canada imports.
   Craig continued, "I am hopeful for a resolution. However, in the meantime, I will continue to uphold U.S. laws and the determinations of our trade agencies to ensure fair trade and to protect our industries from illegally subsidized products."
