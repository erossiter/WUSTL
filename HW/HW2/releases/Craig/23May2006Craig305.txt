IDAHO DELEGATION REACTS TO JUDGE REDDEN'S RULING
  The Idaho Congressional Delegation issued the following reaction to today's ruling by Judge Redden invalidating the Snake River Biop: 
   "Once again, a federal judge is trying to run the river with blatant disregard for the critical needs of the Northwest. He is clearly advocating for one side while ignoring the necessary balance between people and the environment. Not only does this ruling jeopardize the careful and long collaboration process between the federal, state, and local governments and the Tribes, but it also jeopardizes the potential for a long-term solution.
   "We do note that the judge put the remand of the Upper Snake and Federal Columbia River Power System Biops on the same schedule and agreed they should remain segmented. With these objectives in mind, we will watch very carefully the way that the region responds to the judge's ruling, particularly with regard to the way the remand order is implemented."
   "Let there be no mistake: We will protect Idaho's water and the Nez Perce Agreement."
