CONGRESS POISED TO APPROVE DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS
  Congress will approve funding for the Department of Defense this week. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson are members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, respectively, which wrote the bill.  
   Craig said, "Providing this funding improves our military's technology capabilities, helping them better protect us at home and abroad. The legislation recognizes that our armed services have needs now, but also need to prepare for the future through research and development - much of which will be done in Idaho." 
   Simpson said, "The projects included in this bill are a testament to the vital contribution Idahoans make to the security of our nation," said Congressman Simpson. "We can all be proud of the work that's being conducted across our state to better equip our troops, bring innovative new technologies to the battlefield, and expand Idaho's high-tech industry."
