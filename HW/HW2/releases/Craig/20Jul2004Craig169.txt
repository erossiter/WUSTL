SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVES FLAG AMENDMENT; SEN. CRAIG VOTES TO SUBMIT MEASURE FOR FULL SENATE APPROVAL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, voted today with a majority of the committee to approve S.J.Res 4, which would amend the Constitution and allow Congress to pass laws protecting the flag from desecration.  
 The legislation was approved by the full committee, 11-7, sending the measure to the full Senate for consideration. 
   "Because the flag holds a unique place in the hearts of Americans, the people continue to demand, overwhelmingly, unique protection for it," said Craig. "However, the Supreme Court has said that a constitutional amendment is necessary to protect the flag. I'm pleased that we are now one step closer to meeting the will of the American people in sending this amendment to them for ratification." 
   Constitutional amendments require a two-thirds majority for approval in both the House and Senate before being sent to the states for approval. Three-fourths of all state legislatures (38) must then approve the measure.
