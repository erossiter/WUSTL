ECONOMY CONTINUES TO CLIMB
  The U.S. Department of Labor released June's jobs numbers and the outlook continues to be rosy. 
   Idaho is seeing consistent economic growth which started in November 2003. Since then Idaho has gained 16,100 jobs, 2,000 of which came in June. Idaho's unemployment rate, at 5%, is below the national average of 5.6%, which is lower than the average rate during the either the 1970s, 80s, or 90s.
   Additionally, Americans are seeing more money in their pockets. After-tax income has grown 11% since President Bush took office, household wealth is near an all-time high, and more Americans own homes than ever before. In fact, with 74.4% of Idahoans owning their own homes, Idaho outshines the national average of 68.3%.
   Senator Larry Craig, who voted for all of the President's proposed tax cuts, had the following comment, "The President's economic policies are accelerating our economy out of the terror-induced recession. We are once again proving what history and economics tells us - reducing tax rates and fostering business are the most effective means to economic growth."
   More information on the economy and President Bush's policies is available at the White House (http://www.whitehouse.gov/) and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/).
