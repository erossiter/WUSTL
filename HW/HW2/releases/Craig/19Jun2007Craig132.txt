SPECIAL OLYMPIC WORLD WINTER GAMES IN IDAHO RECEIVE FEDERAL SUPPORT
  The Labor-HHS-Education Appropriations Subcommittee approved its fiscal year 2008 bill today. Included is $3 million to support the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games, to be held in Idaho. The $3 million represents the federal taxpayer contribution to the $23 million budget for the Games and will be used for: housing, meals, security, communications, education, facility rentals, and transportation.  
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Subcommittee and Honorary Chairman of the Games, said, "There is so much that Special Olympics offers beyond promoting physical and mental fitness, pride, and dignity for the athletes. From inspiring civility to training volunteers to supporting families of athletes, the benefits we see from Special Olympics is just the tip of the iceberg.
