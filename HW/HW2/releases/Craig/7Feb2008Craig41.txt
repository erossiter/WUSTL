SEN. CRAIG OPPOSES DEBT-BLOATING ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROPOSAL
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig issued the following statement on the economic stimulus package approved by the U.S. Senate today:  
   "Standing on the street corner and handing out checks for Americans to purchase foreign goods is the wrong approach to stimulating our economy. It will only increase our already bloated national debt. We must look at the housing sector, which is why I have cosponsored legislation to provide tax credits to homebuyers purchasing homes currently in the inventory. It mirrors a successful program from the 1970s, when America faced a similar situation. 
   "Because I oppose the economic stimulus as proposed, I voted against all of the proposals today. While there were some ideas I supported - such as including senior citizens on Social Security and disabled veterans, and ensuring that illegal aliens do not receive rebates - those ideas could not change a misguided giveaway into the kind of responsible, targeted solution our economy needs."
