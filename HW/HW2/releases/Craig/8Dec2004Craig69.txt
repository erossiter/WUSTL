COMMODITY MARKETING, RESEARCH PROGRAMS BILL CLEARS CONGRESS
  Late last night the United States Senate unanimously passed the Commodity Assessment Protection and Reform Act.  
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined colleagues in introducing the Senate legislation, which strengthens commodity research and marketing programs for grain producers in Idaho and other states. 
   The legislation clarifies the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which authorizes the collection of assessments on commodities through voluntary participation from state commissions. The assessments support research and marketing that benefits all producers. These projects fund extensive research that boosts productivity, disease resistance, and quality of crops. 
   "I am glad that this legislation will now be sent to the President and signed into law. It is vital that Idaho's grain producers retain the flexibility to change the assessment rates which generate funds for critical marketing and research programs," said Senator Craig. 
   To ensure its continued use and effectiveness, legislation is needed to clarify the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) authority if a State wishes to modify the assessment rate originally agreed to between the State and the USDA. This legislation allows the States the ability to modify the rates. It also enables USDA to collect the assessment should the producer default on a marketing loan which uses the crop as collateral. 
   H.R. 4620, which is the House version of S. 2866, will be sent to the President. For more information, please visit the Library of Congress. To read more about what Senator Craig is doing for Idaho agriculture, please read his Ag Action Plan Issue Brief.
