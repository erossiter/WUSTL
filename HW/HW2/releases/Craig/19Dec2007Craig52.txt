HOUSE, SENATE APPROVE FINAL SPENDING PACKAGE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson today praised the bi-partisan work of the Senate and House of Representatives in passing a final spending package that delivers on many critical priorities for the State of Idaho and provides $70 billion in funding for the Wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. President Bush has indicated he will sign the legislation into law. 
   "This bill is the result of some fierce Congressional debates, but reflects a victory for the President and Republicans in Congress, who forced Democrats to restrain federal spending," said Senator Larry Craig. "The President exercised his veto authority to hold down spending, resulting in a final package that meets his requirements for fiscal restraint while providing support for worthwhile programs in Idaho and elsewhere." 
   "The Special Olympics World Winter Games will see a significant infusion of cash with the passage of this legislation and it couldn't come at a better time," said Congressman Simpson. "It's also important to note the broad impact this legislation will have on Idaho's schools, colleges, hospitals, roads, fields, forests, and communities. The bill will touch virtually every Idahoan in some way."  
   The bill contains critical funding for the following Idaho priorities: 
   * Special Olympics World Winter Games will receive $7.5 million. 
   * The Treasure Valley Detox Center will receive $565,000. 
   * The Idaho Department of Agriculture's Potato Cyst Nematode Program gets $9.6 million. 
   * The Idaho National Laboratories Next Generation Nuclear Plant receives $116 million. 
   * Environmental remediation efforts at the Idaho National Laboratory receive $513 million. 
   * The Boise Airport effort to construct a new Air Traffic Control Tower receives $8.9 million.

   * Agriculture Research funding for Idaho commodities amounts to more than $15.5 million. 
   * The Historic Wilson Theater in Rupert will receive $350,000. 
   * Gowen Field's Training Area Railhead will receive $7.615 million.

   * The University of Idaho, Boise State University, Idaho State University, the College of Southern Idaho, Lewis-Clark State College, Northwest Nazarene University, and the College of Idaho will share millions of dollars in higher education research projects. 
   * St. Luke's, St. Alphonsus, Madison Memorial Hospital, Teton Valley Hospital, Gritman Medical Center, Franklin County Medical Center, and the North Idaho Rural Health Consortium will share millions of dollars in funding for improved health care services in throughout Idaho.
