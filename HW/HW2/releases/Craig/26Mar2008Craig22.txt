SEN. CRAIG ANNOUNCES STUDENT CONGRESS SELECTION
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig today announced the selection of Jennifer L. Graham of Boise as the Idaho student representative to the Inaugural Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship Student Congress in Lexington, Kentucky, later this summer. 
   The one-week course will take place at the University of Kentucky Patterson School of Diplomacy and International Commerce beginning July 19th.
   Miss Graham is a junior at the College of Idaho in Caldwell majoring in Business-International Political Economy with minors in Journalism and Spanish. In addition to her extensive leadership experience in the College of Idaho's Greek community, she's been involved with student government elections, debate, and will participate in a Model United Nations in New York City this year. Miss Graham has been a Presidential Scholar at the College of Idaho since 2005.
   "This event gives one college junior from each state the opportunity to experience and explore debate, communications and compromise - all vital elements of diplomacy," Craig said. "I am pleased Idaho has such a qualified nominee to represent our state in this program's inaugural class."
   Senator Henry Clay, known as the "Great Compromiser," is regarded as one of America's greatest statesmen. He is best known for crafting the Missouri Compromise in 1820 and several other treaties that helped the nation avoid civil war for over 40 years.
   The Henry Clay Center for Statesmanship promotes Clay's timeless principles of diplomacy to the next generation of leaders. "The Student Congress is one important way in which those principles can be advanced throughout the country, including Idaho," Craig said.
