SENATE APPROVES TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS
  The United States Senate cleared the Fiscal Year 2006 Treasury-Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill this afternoon.  
   Yesterday, the Senate adopted a measure to the bill to ease matching requirements for high-priority federal transportation projects in Idaho. The amendment, sponsored by Senator Craig and cosponsored by Senator Crapo, adds Idaho to a list of states eligible under the "sliding scale" match ratio. The scale, enacted with the passage of the transportation reauthorization bill earlier this year, provides lower matching requirements for high-priority projects in qualified rural states. Targeted toward states with large tracts of federal land, the scale currently only applies to Alaska, Montana, Nevada, North Dakota, Oregon, and South Dakota. 
   Craig emphasized the importance of the language, "Idaho is now able to focus its limited dollars on a more diverse range of critical highway projects without increasing the burden on taxpayers." 
   Also included in the bill are a number of projects for Idaho, such as: 
   * Boise Airport Control Tower ($7.7 million)
   * Public transportation projects through the Idaho Transit Coalition ($4 million) 
   * Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Project Planning and Implementation ($1 million) 
   * BSU Environmental Science and Economic Development Building ($1 million) 
   * Statewide Intelligent Transportation System ($200,000) 
   * Burley Community Center ($1 million)
