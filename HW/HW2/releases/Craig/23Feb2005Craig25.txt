SEN. CRAIG ISSUES STATEMENT ON CUBA TRADE RESTRICTIONS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig issued the following statement on the U.S. Treasury Department Office of Foreign Assets Control's (OFAC) new rule tightening restrictions on agriculture sales to Cuba: 
   "OFAC's ruling is a slap in the face to American farmers, shippers, ports and the legislative branch working to open markets for our producers," Craig said.
