SEN. CRAIG HAILS PASSAGE OF JOBS BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised the passage today of the conference report on H.R. 4520, also known as the American Job Creation Act of 2004.  
 The bill brings the United States into compliance with WTO rules on export subsidies and taxes, and creates tax deductions for domestic manufacturers and U.S. businesses that reinvest earnings of their foreign corporations back into the United States.
   The bill also includes several tax incentives for energy companies to conduct research and development, as well as production, of certain alternative fuels and renewable energy sources.
   "This bill is yet another accomplishment by this President and this Congress to save, restore, and create jobs for American workers," said Craig. "This bill will help U.S. employers and workers compete in tough international markets."
   Craig continued, "Many American jobs have been lost in recent years because of unfair trade practices by other countries and because U.S. businesses who export are taxed more heavily than their competitors in other countries. This has amounted to a tax on American jobs. This bill is an important step in the right direction, to help level that playing field. This is another important step on our road to economic recovery and toward supporting more and better jobs for our workers and their families."
   H.R. 4520 now goes to President Bush for his signature.
