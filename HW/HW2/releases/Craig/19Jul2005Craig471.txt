SEN. CRAIG RESPONDS TO SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig had the following reaction tonight to the nomination of John G. Roberts to the United States Supreme Court:  
   "The President's nomination tonight is reflective of his commitment to select a nominee who recognizes that the judiciary is a third branch of government, not an extension of Congress - a nominee who realizes judges interpret law; they don't create new law. 
   "As the Senate considers this nomination, I will be urging my colleagues to consider the merits of Judge Roberts and to move both judiciously and quickly. It is vital that a nominee be confirmed before the new session of the Court begins. Politically-driven delay tactics would be a disservice to the American people. 
   "The Senate took steps today to improve the readiness of our military and to take care of our veterans."
