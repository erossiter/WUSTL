SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS EXTENDING MANDATORY RETIREMENT AGE FOR PILOTS
  Last night, the Senate passed legislation extending the mandatory retirement age for commercial pilots from 60 to 65 years old. Craig has been a long-time supporter of making this change, and he cosponsored the Senate bill, S. 65. The Senate passed a House version of the legislation, H.R. 4343, and the President is expected to sign the bill.  
   Craig said, "Commercial pilots expend tremendous time and money training for their careers. Their income earning potential should not be arbitrarily cut off at age 60 as long as they continue to meet the FAA Medical Certification requirements. We should capture the value of their experience - it will make our skies safer." 
   The mandatory retirement age for pilots was adopted in 1959. On November 23, 2006, the International Civil Aviation Organization changed the mandatory retirement age to 65.
