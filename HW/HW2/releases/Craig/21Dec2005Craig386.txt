SENATE APPROVES DEFICIT REDUCTION PACKAGE
  For the first time in eight years the United States Senate approved a deficit reduction package.  
 Among other things, the Work, Marriage, and Family Promotion Reconciliation Act of 2005 provides for $40 billion in deficit reduction over the next five years. 
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig was among the 50 Senators voting in favor of the measure. Vice President Cheney cast the deciding vote. Craig, the long-time sponsor of the Balanced Budget Amendment, commented after the vote, "Current federal spending is spiraling out of control and needs to be reined in. That means we need to tighten our belt, which translates to tough choices. While the other side of the aisle spouts about excessive spending, they don't act to curb it. This bill does that, and it is the right thing to do. " 
   In addition to deficit reduction, the legislation improves Medicare and Medicaid, strengthens education for low-income students, provides assistance for needy families, and offers assistance with heating costs for low-income families.
