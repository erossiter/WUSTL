JUDGE SMITH APPROVED BY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  This morning the United States Senate Judiciary Committee approved Judge Randy Smith's nomination to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Smith currently serves as a District Judge in Pocatello, Idaho. 
   Following the vote, Idaho Senator Larry Craig observed, "I have known Randy for a long time, and have always been impressed with his thoughtfulness, fairness, and integrity. The Committee sees that, and I am pleased another hurdle has been cleared in his confirmation process."
   "Randy Smith will make a superior judge for the Ninth Circuit Court," said Idaho Senator Mike Crapo. "Many issues that face Idahoans are decided on the Ninth Circuit and I'm pleased to see an Idahoan with Randy's capabilities fill this seat. He has the experience and qualifications needed, and I look forward to a full and prompt debate and vote on his nomination on the Senate floor."
   The Committee vote was along party lines, 10-8. A vote before the full Senate has not been scheduled, but Craig and Crapo vowed to push for a timely vote.
