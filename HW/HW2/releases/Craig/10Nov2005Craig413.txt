SEN. CRAIG, REPS. SIMPSON, OTTER HONOR IDAHO HERO
  Sen. Larry Craig and Reps. Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter were proud to attend a Capitol Hill ceremony on Thursday honoring Idaho Marine Sergeant Luke B. Miller, who received the Non-Commissioned Officers Association's Vanguard Award for his heroic actions while serving in Iraq.  
   While serving on a mission in Karabilah, Iraq, members of Sgt. Miller's platoon came under enemy fire. In the ensuing action, Miller jumped to the rescue of three critically wounded Marines in a nearby tank. After securing the injured Marines safety and seeing them airlifted out of the area, Sgt. Miller fought off enemy combatants and continued his mission for 40 additional hours. 
   "The honor was ours to meet, thank and congratulate Sgt. Luke Miller," said Craig, Simpson and Otter. "This fine young man is an example of the courage shown every day by the fine men and women from Idaho and throughout America who defend our country. With Veterans Day upon us, please take the time to thank this new generation of heroes, just as we remember those who secured our liberty in generations past." 
   Located at Gowen Field, Sgt. Miller, of Boise, serves in Charlie Company, 4th Tank Battalion. He has also been nominated for the Bronze Star Medal which is awarded for heroic or meritorious achievement of service in connection with operations against an opposing armed force.
