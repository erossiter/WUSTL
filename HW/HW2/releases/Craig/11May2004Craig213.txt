SEN. CRAIG PRAISES PASSAGE OF ENERGY TAX PROVISIONS, JOBS BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised Senate approval of the JOBS bill and the accompanying tax provisions of the Energy bill.  
   "Between the trade provisions and the incentives for energy conservation and development, we will create 650,000 new jobs," said Craig. "We now must focus on passing the other half of the Energy bill to complete the package and secure our energy future." 
   The United States Senate passed S. 1637, the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) bill, which included the tax provisions of S. 2095, the Energy bill.
