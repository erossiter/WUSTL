SENS. CRAIG, CRAPO COMMENT ON MYERS' WITHDRAWAL
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo offered the following comments on William G. Myers' request not to be renominated by President Bush to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals:  
   "Bill is a well-qualified legal talent who would have served America with distinction on the federal bench. We appreciate his willingness to put his private life on hold while his nomination was considered over the past three years. 
   "He was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee twice and received a majority vote of the full Senate, but remained unconfirmed because of the judicial filibusters undertaken in recent years. It is unfortunate that he will be denied a full opportunity to pursue this Presidential appointment, and we commend him for his efforts in the last few years to be cooperative with the demands of the confirmation process."
