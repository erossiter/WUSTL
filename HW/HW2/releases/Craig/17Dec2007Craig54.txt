FINAL CONGRESSIONAL SPENDING PACKAGE CONTAINS $7.5 MILLION FOR IDAHO SPECIAL OLYMPICS GAMES
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson announced today that the House and Senate have agreed to a final funding amount of $7.5 million for the 2009 Special Olympics World Winter Games in Idaho on the final version of legislation funding most agencies of the federal government for fiscal year 2008.  
   "I am very pleased that Members of both parties recognize how significant this contribution is to ensuring the success of the Special Olympics Winter Games in Idaho," said Craig. "This commitment of federal assistance was critical to helping jumpstart efforts to raise the remaining money needed from the private sector. With this commitment in place, Idaho can look forward to putting on a world-class event." 
   "While it's unfortunate that the President's veto of a previous bill has cost the Idaho Games $500,000 I am still gratified that my Congressional colleagues on both sides of the aisle have done everything they could to provide us with the most funding possible," said Simpson. "We'll now turn our attention to securing additional private sector contributions, gathering as many volunteers as possible, and putting on Games that will make all of Idaho and our nation proud." 
   According to the organizers of the Games, holding the event in Idaho will require at least $28 million in total contributions, with the federal government's share representing just a portion of the total needs. The event will attract more than 3,000 athletes from over 100 nations to compete in seven Winter Olympic-type sporting events. This will be the largest multi-sport event ever held in the state of Idaho. 
   Craig and Simpson are members of the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations which crafted the year-end spending package. Once the bill is approved by the House and Senate, it will be sent to President Bush for his consideration.
