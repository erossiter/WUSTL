SPECIALTY CROP BILL SENT TO PRESIDENT
  Late last night, the United States Senate unanimously approved H.R. 3242, the Speciality Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004, clearing the bill for the President.  
 The legislation, similar to S. 2092, introduced by Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, seeks to promote a comprehensive approach to the challenges faced by specialty crop farmers. It specifically focuses on six areas of federal policy affecting the industry including marketing, international trade, research into crop production and pest and disease problems, and conservation practices. 
   "This is a leap forward for the speciality crop industry. The legislation provides the foundation needed to recognize the value that speciality crops play in our agricultural economy and the health of American consumers." explained Senator Craig. "Maintaining domestic diversity in agricultural production is essential, and I look forward to building on this success." 
   The bill also authorizes the United States Department of Agriculture to provide $270 million in block grants to states over five years to support production-related research, commodity promotion, nutrition, food safety and inspection, and other programs to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops. 
   Idaho is the fourth largest producer of specialty crops in the nation.
