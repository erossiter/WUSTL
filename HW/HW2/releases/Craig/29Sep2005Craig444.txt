SEN. CRAIG VOTES TO CONFIRM JUDGE ROBERTS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig voted today to confirm Judge John Roberts as the 17th Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.  
   Craig spoke in favor of Judge Roberts during debate on September 27, 2005. During his speech, he reflected on the fact that Roberts was one of the first judges he considered as a member of the Judiciary Committee. At the time, Roberts was being considered to serve on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. 
   Craig said, \"Undoubtedly, one of the most serious duties of a Senator is the constitutional obligation and opportunity to confirm the President\'s judicial nominees. At that time I was satisfied that John Roberts was a superior candidate for the job. A review of his record for the past 20 months only proves that decision to have been the correct one. Not a single question has been raised as to his competence or his character during that time serving on the DC Circuit. Furthermore, in his time on the court, John Roberts has shown he does not bring an agenda to work with him in the morning. Rather, he takes an intellectual approach to each case, basing his rulings on the facts and the law, not any personal bias.\" 
   Craig continued, highlighting the character of the debate surrounding Roberts\' nominations: \"To the extent there has been a debate over the nomination, it has not been about Judge Roberts\' qualifications to sit on the Supreme Court. Rather, he has been subject to an ideological litmus test.\" 
   During debate over judicial nominations, Craig has consistently not applied an ideological litmus test and criticized colleagues who do, \"Let me suggest that a Member who votes against this nominee because he will not state his position on a specific case or ruling is voting against an unbiased judiciary.\" 
   Craig ended his remarks calling on every Senator to support Roberts, \"He deserves my vote. He will get my vote. He deserves the vote of every Senator serving in the Senate.\" 
   The Senate confirmed Roberts on a ___ to ___ vote. To view Senator Craig\'s full statement, please visit the Special Report on Judicial Nominations at http://craig.senate.gov/report_judicialnom.htm
