SEN. CRAIG: NEW VA CLINIC WILL BE BASED IN COEUR D'ALENE
  A new Community-Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) for veterans will soon open in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, Sen. Larry Craig announced today. Craig learned of the decision while traveling in Europe with U.S. Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson.  
   "I am very pleased that VA has decided to locate the clinic in northern Idaho. The fact that they were able to move swiftly in deciding which community to place it in is indicative that our veterans in Idaho need the service now," said Craig. "The specific location in Coeur d'Alene is the next big step." 
   Tonight, Craig is with VA Secretary Jim Nicholson and several other members of congress at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany. Tomorrow, Craig's group will meet with wounded servicemembers at the Landstuhl Army Hospital, located just a few miles away. 
   "It's always troubling to see the wounded when they first come in from the front lines in Iraq and Afghanistan. But it's important that we be there, to see them and let them know that we support them and that we are dedicated to providing them with the best medical care available," Craig said. 
   It was just a few days ago that Nicholson announced that a new medical clinic would open somewhere in northern Idaho, and that 37 additional community-based outpatient clinics would soon open in 21 other states. 
   "Earlier this week, Secretary Nicholson announced a new clinic in the northern part of Idaho and I am pleased that he quickly made a decision as to its location. The decision was based on demographics. Simply put, the highest concentration of veterans in northern Idaho live in the Coeur d'Alene area," Craig said. 
   "VA is committed to providing world-class health care to the men and women of Idaho who have served our nation," Nicholson said. "This new clinic will bring VA's top-notch care closer to the veterans who have earned it."
