IDAHO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS APPROVED BY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE
  Several Idaho transportation projects were included in the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005, which was approved today by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, Idaho Senator Larry Craig announced. 
   "I am very pleased that the Appropriations Committee sees the importance of these projects in improving transportation infrastructure all across Idaho," Craig said. "Moving people and products quickly and efficiently is a necessary part of creating and preserving good jobs in a thriving economy.
   "As Idaho's economy continues to grow, so too will our demands on critical infrastructure. Even our national defense and homeland security are dependent on maintaining and improving a sound infrastructure. I will continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to make sure Idaho's needs are met as this legislation moves forward in the process."
   Approved projects include:
   * $6 million to upgrade and relocate the air traffic control tower at Boise Airport;
   * $250,000 to refurbish the air terminal at Pocatello Regional Airport;
   * $180,000 for Phase 1 of the modernization of the air traffic control tower at Twin Falls Airport.
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for approval.
