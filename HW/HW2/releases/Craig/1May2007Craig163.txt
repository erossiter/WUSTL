DELEGATION GIVES CONGRESSIONAL HONORS TO IDAHO POTATOES, PRODUCERS
  Resolutions honoring Idaho potatoes, growers and the Idaho Potato Commission are being introduced in the U.S. Congress by Idaho's Congressional Delegation. The resolutions designate May 2007 as "Idaho Potato Month" and recognize the 70th Anniversary of the Idaho Potato Commission. 
   "The Idaho potato 'brand' is recognized throughout the world for its high quality and is an identifying characteristic of the great State of Idaho," the Delegation wrote in the Congressional Resolutions. "May 2007 marks the 70th consecutive year that Idaho potatoes have been promoted by the Idaho Potato Commission, an Idaho potato industry group? recognized nationally and internationally as a top promotional authority for Idaho's potatoes and potato products."
   The Potato Month and Potato Commission resolutions are being introduced simultaneously in both the U.S. Senate and U.S. House of Representatives. The Delegation noted that Idaho's potato industry contributes approximately $2.7 billion to the Idaho economy. Idaho produces roughly one-third of all the potatoes grown in the United States, harvesting an average of between 12 and 14 billion pounds annually. Idaho's potato industry employs 39,000 state residents and many license plates in Idaho contain the phrase "Famous Potatoes."
