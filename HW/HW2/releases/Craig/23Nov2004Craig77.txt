CONGRESS APPROVES PROJECTS FOR SOUTH CENTRAL IDAHO
  The Conference Report for the Omnibus Appropriations bill which passed both houses of Congress Saturday included dozens of important Idaho projects. The state is represented by two members on the Congressional Appropriations Committees that wrote the bill - Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson. They, along with Sen. Mike Crapo and Rep.C.L. "Butch" Otter, all worked on the projects as a united Idaho Delegation, and praised the bill's support for the projects. 
   The Omnibus legislation includes virtually all discretionary federal spending for Fiscal Year 2005, except for defense and homeland security spending. To keep the bill fiscally responsible, Congressional leaders and the President agreed to essentially freeze spending, overall, at the same level as that for 2004. Included in the Omnibus were several projects important to South Central Idaho, including, but not limited to:
   * Idaho's Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds -$500,000 
  * Idaho Wolf Recovery - $1,200,000 
  * Agricultural Research Services operations at Billingsley Creek - Research on westslope cutthroat trout, redband trout, and other species - $1,000,000 
  * Sustainable feeds research for aquaculture - Development of grain-based, low-pollution fish feeds - $395,000 
  * Sugarbeet research at Kimberly - $533,000 
  * Idaho One-Plan - A unique collaboration to assist Idaho farmers and ranchers in their natural resource stewardship responsibilities - $200,000 
  * Tri-State Predator Control - $1,300,000 
  * Continue Idaho participation in the Criminal Information Sharing Alliance Network - $750,000 
  * Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund - $4,500,000 
  * Little Wood River feasibility study for flood control - $50,000 
  * Rural Idaho Water Projects - Projects in Bonners Ferry, Rupert, Spirit Lake, Emmett, and Coolin - $3,750,000

  * I-84/US-93 Interchange Stage 2 - $1,000,000 
  * College of Southern Idaho (CSI) Student Traffic Safety Initiative - $530,000 
  * Transportation technology for Variable Dynamic Message Signs and real-time incident reporting - $2,250,000 
  * CSI Partnership to Build Capacity for Latino Access and Leadership Project - $250,000 
  * Caring Foundation for Children, to implement a program of enrolling low-income children in underserved, rural areas, in dental care (Idaho and Utah) - $300,000 
  * CSI Enhanced Paraprofessional Training Program - $200,000 
  * City of Burley Waterwater Treatment System - $2,000,000 
  * Auger Falls Wastewater Treatment Project - $600,000 
   This Wednesday, the House of Representatives is expected to clear the final version of the bill, which differs slightly from the version approved on Saturday. The President is expected to sign the legislation into law after Congress worked to meet his demands for fiscal responsibility.
