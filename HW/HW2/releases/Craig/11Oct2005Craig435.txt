SEN. CRAIG: ACADEMY APPLICATION DEADLINE NEARS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig would like to remind potential applicants that deadlines to apply for nomination to one of the nation's service academies are fast approaching.  
 The initial application (the first three pages) is due on Monday, October 31. 
   "Idaho has a long and proud tradition of students attending the nation's service academies and achieving great success," said Craig. "I encourage those who have begun the application process to complete the necessary requirements ahead of time, to allow for any possible delays or unforeseen challenges. It would be a shame to miss this opportunity." 
   Remaining materials, such as a photograph, letters of recommendation, SAT or ACT scores, academic transcripts, the principal/counselor form, and an essay, are due on December 1. 
   All applications should be mailed to Senator Craig's regional office in Coeur d'Alene:
