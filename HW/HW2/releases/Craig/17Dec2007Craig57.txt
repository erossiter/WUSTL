SEN. CRAIG, REP. SIMPSON SECURE FUNDS FOR IDAHO'S HOSPITALS, BOISE DETOX CENTER AND EDUCATION PROGRAMS
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson announced today that the House and Senate have agreed on the final version of legislation to fund most federal government agencies for fiscal year 2008. In the bill, many Idaho healthcare and education issues were addressed. 
   "Education and healthcare help form the foundation of a strong community and a thriving state," said Craig. "Healthy, well-educated children will be in a better position to succeed when they enter the workforce, and this bill recognizes that. I'm confident these projects will have a direct impact - for the better - on the quality of life here in Idaho."  
   "By investing in our children, we shape our future," said Simpson. "We need to address some critical needs of education, healthcare, and safety - not only for Idaho, but for the entire nation. This bill addresses the growing concern we have about sexual predators by providing funding to web-based offender programs. These three components are essential for our children's well-being." 
   The Community Detox Center of the Treasure Valley will receive $390,000 to pay for a 24-hour facility. The proposed center will contain 36 beds for indigent patients to be treated by professionals. A typical stay for sobering is 12 hours and typical stays for detoxification will be 5-6 days. "The Treasure Valley is growing rapidly and there is a great need for a Community Detox Center," said Craig and Simpson. "We are grateful to be part of directing federal funding to projects that impact Idaho."
