SEN. CRAIG WELCOMES NEW FOREST SERVICE CHIEF
  As he prepared to return home to Idaho for the weekend, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig bid farewell to the old and welcomed the new, regarding the announced changes in U.S. Forest Service leadership. Current Chief of the Forest Service, Dale Bosworth, is retiring, and Gail Kimbell was introduced as Bosworth's replacement. Kimbell moves up from her current position as Regional Forester for the Forest Service's Region 1. Headquartered in Missoula, MT, Region 1 includes national forests and grasslands in North Idaho, Montana and the Dakotas.  
   Craig reflected on Bosworth's tenure. "Dale Bosworth is a man of integrity who has restored a common sense approach to public lands management," Craig said. "I am proud of the work he has accomplished and believe he is leaving the Forest Service better off than he found it. I will miss working with Dale and wish him and his family all the best." 
   Craig also expressed optimism for Bosworth's successor, who will be the first woman to head the agency. "Gail Kimball is a solid choice to be the next Chief of the Forest Service and I am honored to be working with her. She has front line experience and understands the challenges that face the Forest Service, both internally and externally. Like Dale, I expect Gail will listen to all interest groups and work with them to address issues on the ground, not get tied up in bureaucracy. 
   "I've worked with Gail as the Regional Forester for North Idaho, and I know firsthand that she is a natural leader. She understands Idaho's forests. She's firmly rooted in her principles, and knows how to foster collaboration to get work accomplished on the ground. She has definitely earned her stripes."
