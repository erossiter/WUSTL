IDAHO NATIONAL LABORATORY, WATER PROJECTS RECEIVE SENATE SUPPORT
  The Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee approved its fiscal year 2008 spending bill today.  
   As its name implies, the bill funds programs related to energy and water development, and is therefore an especially important bill for Idaho. Included in the bill are a number of initiatives for the Idaho National Laboratory in addition to water infrastructure projects around Idaho. 
   Craig, a member of the subcommittee that wrote the bill, said, "The INL is the nation's premier nuclear power research laboratory, and this bill reflects that important mission. This bill provides strong support to construct the nuclear power plant of the future at INL and, just as important, over $500 million for continued cleanup activities at the Site. Nuclear power is reemerging as a vital part of our energy mix in the future. It is a proven technology that can meet our demands without emissions."
