SEN. CRAIG COSPONSORS FERTILIZER SECURITY BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig today announced that he is cosponsoring S.1141, the Secure Handling of Ammonium Nitrate Act of 2005. The bill, introduced by Sen. Thad Cochran (R-Miss.), would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security to regulate the handling and purchase of ammonium nitrate to prevent its misappropriation or use in violation of law. Ammonium nitrate, an agricultural fertilizer, can be mixed with other chemicals to create powerful explosives.  
   "It is essential to protect access to this substance for legitimate purposes in any system for the control of its purchase and distribution," Craig said. "This bill will help ensure that this fertilizer is not sold to those with evil intentions, while at the same time guaranteeing its availability to our ag producers." 
   The bill directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to develop regulations to require ammonium nitrate handlers to register their facilities; sell or distribute ammonium nitrate only to handlers and purchasers registered under this Act; and maintain records of sale or distribution that include the name, address, telephone number, and registration number of the immediate subsequent purchaser of ammonium nitrate. Failure to comply with these requirements would be punishable by law.
