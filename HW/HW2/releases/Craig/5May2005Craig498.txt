ROADLESS RULE FINALIZED
  The Bush Administration released the final roadless area rule today.  
 The rule affects 9 million acres in Idaho, second only to Alaska in total land affected. 
   Idaho's Congressional Delegation issued the following statement: 
   "We congratulate the Bush Administration for taking such a positive step toward resolving the roadless debate. This rule recognizes that a broad dictate over 60 million acres is simply unacceptable. By empowering states to offer suggestions on the management of roadless area in their states, the Forest Service can craft management plans to local conditions, reflecting local priorities while maintaining the lands for everyone. 
   "This rule will assist the Forest Service in the daunting job of managing 192 million acres to meet the demands of a vast array of users while conserving the health of the forest."
   More information on the rule can be found on the Forest Service's website at www.roadless.fs.fed.us/
