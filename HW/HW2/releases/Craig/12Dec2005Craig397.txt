IDAHO CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION ISSUES STATEMENT ON REOPENING OF JAPANESE BORDERS TO U.S. BEEF
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo and Idaho Reps.  
 Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter reacted to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns' announcement today that Japan has reopened its borders to U.S. beef products. The Idaho Congressional Delegation issued the following joint statement: 
   "We are very pleased with this announcement, as are many Idaho cattle producers. Reopening this market is an important step toward reestablishing safe, high-quality U.S. beef products in Japan and other Asian markets. We would like to thank President Bush, Secretary Johanns, U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and many others who listened to concerns expressed by the Idaho delegation and who worked on a personal level to lift this ban. This is a great day for U.S. and Idaho producers, and we will continue to put pressure on other countries in the region to follow Japan's lead." 
   This development is expected to have a huge impact on the U.S. cattle producers and the domestic cattle market, as all cattle 20 months of age or younger will now be allowed into Japanese markets. The USDA reports that in 2003, the United States exported $1.4 billion worth of beef and beef products to Japan.
