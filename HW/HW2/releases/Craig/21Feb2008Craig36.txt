SEN. CRAIG PRAISES DECISION TO DELIST GRAY WOLVES
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig issued the following statement on today's decision by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to delist gray wolf population in the Northern Rocky Mountains, which includes Idaho:  
   "This is a decision that is long overdue. We reached the delisting goals in the recovery plan years ago, and Idaho is ready to manage wolves. 
   "Unfortunately, if history is a guide, radical preservationists will sue the federal government over this decision. Because the wolves have been so successful in recovery, far exceeding the goals set by the Clinton Administration, their opposition to delisting is a signal that they never want them delisted. They want the noose of the ESA to hang around the neck of States, ranchers, and others more than they want wolves to recover and be managed in a way that balances the many uses of our resources. The noose gives them control over land and wildlife management under the guise of protecting the wolves. 
   "I hope they realize that balancing management will help bring more support to the wolves, benefiting them in the end."
