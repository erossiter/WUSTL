SEN. CRAIG ENCOURAGES FLU, PNEUMONIA SHOTS
  Each year an average of 200,000 Americans are hospitalized by the flu, and 36,000 U.S. citizens will die from complications of the disease. With that reality, this year Sen. Larry Craig is encouraging citizens to consider getting a flu shot and perhaps the pneumonia vaccine. 
   "Getting a flu shot and pneumonia inoculation is a means of protection and I strongly encourage older veterans, senior citizens and others to seriously consider being vaccinated. Of course, this is an individual decision, but I believe vaccination is a smart move to make," said Craig, who chairs the U.S. Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs.
   Veterans enrolled in VA health care can locate their nearest VA medical facility by calling 1-800-827-1000. Ask your facility when they will be offering flu shots over the next few weeks.
