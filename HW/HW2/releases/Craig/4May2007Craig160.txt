SEN. CRAIG, REP. SALI PRAISE MOUNTAIN HOME AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Bill Sali, both of Idaho, were on hand at the Pentagon yesterday as Mountain Home Air Force Base was recognized as the top United States Air Force base in the world. Mountain Home will be vying for the Commander-in-Chief's Installation Excellence Award for all branches of the military. On hand for the ceremony were representatives from the Base along with the Chief of Staff of the Air Force and the Secretary of the Air Force.  
   Craig said, "Idaho has an airbase we can be proud of. While the facilities are top notch, including a world-class training range, this award speaks about the people at the Base. It is their ingenuity and hard work that is recognized here. It is what they do that separates them from other Bases around the world." 
   Sali said, "We are so proud of the men and women who work at Mountain Home Air Force Base. Not only do they work everyday in defense of our country, they also contribute enormously to their community and the state of Idaho. We are thankful - and truly grateful - for their service."
