SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S IRAQ STRATEGY
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig offered the following comments following the President's address to the nation on the war in Iraq:  
   "President Lincoln and President Bush understand one thing very clearly. President Lincoln said, "With public sentiment, nothing can fail; without it nothing can succeed." The President made a major step forward tonight in telling the American people the steps forward in Iraq. That is critical to the survival of this foreign policy. 
   "He also did something I was very pleased about - he put the onus on the Iraqi government. It is time for them to stand up. It is time for them to stop the civil strife going on in their country. They've got to be strong, and if they are we will back them up. 
   "The American people heard a path forward tonight. It is certainly one that I can support in the short term. We will watch it, we will measure it, and we will see if the Iraqi government can perform with the troops we have there, the troops we will add, and the new flexibility our troops have in engaging the enemy."
