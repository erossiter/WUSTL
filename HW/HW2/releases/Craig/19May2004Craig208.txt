TAX CODE REPEAL BILL INTRODUCED IN SENATE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined Sen. Sam Brownback and other colleagues today in introducing legislation to repeal the Internal Revenue Code on December 31, 2007.  
 The legislation would mandate a new code that: 
   * Applies a low rate; 
  * Provides tax relief for working Americans; 
  * Protects taxpayers' rights; 
  * Eliminates bias against savings and investment; 
  * Promotes economic growth and job creation; and 
  * Treats married couples the same as singles. 
   "Our tax code is in desperate need of overhaul and this legislation is a catalyst to ignite the fire in Congress," said Senator Craig. "Without a clear and present deadline, Congress will continue to lollygag along with piecemeal fixes." 
   Senator Craig continued, "Americans spend about 6 billion hours and $200 billion a year to comply with the Internal Revenue Code - or about $700 for every man, woman, and child in America. Combined, the federal tax code and its regulations number 7 million words in more than 700 separate sections. We must have a fairer, simpler tax code. When Americans are not strapped down by excessive taxes and red tape, they work, save, spend, and invest according to their needs - and their dreams. This means more secure jobs, better wages, innovative products and services, and a stronger nation."
   The legislation outlines broad principles for a future tax code, but leaves the specifics to future discussion.
