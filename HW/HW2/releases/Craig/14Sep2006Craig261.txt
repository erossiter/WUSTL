FORMER IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DIRECTOR RECOMMENDED FOR INTERIOR
  The former director for Idaho's Department of Environmental Quality could soon join his former boss at the U.S. Department of Interior. Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo today introduced C. Stephen Allred before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee as Allred has been nominated to become Assistant Secretary of the Interior under Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. 
   Craig, who chaired the hearing, commented, "I have known Steve for a number of years and look forward to working with him as the Assistant Secretary of Lands and Minerals. I have found Steve to be direct, decisive, and knowledgeable when it comes to energy and natural resource issues. I have no doubt that he will bring new ideas to the Department and will ensure success on every level."
   "Steve brings a distinguished background in public service, environmental protection, and private sector know-how to this post," Crapo said. "His long experience shows a commitment to the principle of collaboration in solving environmental challenges--a skill that is unfortunately all too rare."
   Crapo noted Allred's many years of service at both Morrison-Knudsen in Boise and in state government. He noted that as DEQ director, Allred "challenged himself and his staff with finding solutions to problems, opportunities for shared interest in results, and a process that sought collaboration over discord."
