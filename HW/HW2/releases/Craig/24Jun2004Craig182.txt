SAFARI CLUB INTERNATIONAL HONORS SEN. CRAIG
  Safari Club International's Washington Metro Chapter recognized Idaho Sen.  
 Larry Craig for his years of service fighting for sportsmen. They awarded him with their first-ever Lifetime Achievement Award. 
   The award was presented during last night's annual banquet for the Chapter. Suzie Brewster, past president, and her husband Bill, a former congressman from Oklahoma, presented the award. "No other Member of Congress has played such a significant role in issues important to sportsmen," noted Suzie Brewster following the presentation. 
   The inscription on the plaque reads, "Throughout his public service Senator Larry Craig has been a strong supporter of Sportsmen's rights and a defender of our Second Amendment freedoms. Sportsmen and gun owners across America have benefitted from his leadership in protecting our hunting heritage. We, the Washington Metro Chapter of Safari Club International, salute Senator Larry Craig with our Lifetime Achievement Award." 
   "When you think about Idaho and what Idaho is, hunting and fishing rise to the surface. It is ingrained into our lives, which is why protecting and promoting these sports is vital," said Craig. "In addition, when you think about sportsmen's organizations, Safari Club is at the top, which is why I am so humbled by this recognition." 
   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo was recognized last night as Federal Legislator of the Year for the Safari Club International Washington Metro Chapter.
