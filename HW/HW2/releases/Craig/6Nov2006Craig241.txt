SEN. CRAIG CLARIFIES: 'YES' ON MARRIAGE AMENDMENT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig said today that he will be voting "Yes" on HJR 2, the proposed amendment to the Idaho Constitution defining marriage as between a man and a woman. Craig wanted to clarify his position after a mass-mailing from a group called "Families for a Better Idaho" was sent to voters over the weekend, suggesting that he does not support the amendment. 
   "A statement of mine has been quoted out of context to suggest I am opposing the proposed marriage amendment to Idaho's constitution," Craig said. "On the contrary, I intend to vote in favor of HJR 2, consistent with the longstanding position I have taken in the U.S. Senate that the appropriate definition of marriage is a union between one man and one woman. The misquoted statement only reflects my belief that each State should be allowed to make its own decision on the definition of marriage, instead of being forced to accept another State's definition."
   The mailer used only the middle sentence of the following passage to suggest that Senator Craig will not support HJR 2: "I fully support DOMA [the Defense of Marriage Act] and still believe the appropriate definition of marriage is a union between one man and one woman, consistent with Idaho's law on the subject. I also believe States must have the ability, if they choose, to create civil unions or grant benefits to persons in different kinds of relationships. I felt that the Senate's marriage amendment would have secured those goals, effectually placing the final determination with the people of Idaho and every other State, where it belongs."
   That passage was part of a letter Senator Craig sent to constituents who contacted him to express their opinions on the Federal Marriage Amendment, which the Senate voted on earlier this year.
