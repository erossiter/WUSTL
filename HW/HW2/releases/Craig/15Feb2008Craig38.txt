IDAHO DELEGATION PRAISES FOREST SERVICE
  The Idaho Congressional Delegation praised the U.S. Forest Service today on its decision regarding snowmobile access in the Mt. Jefferson area in Idaho. The collaborative decision calls for snowmobilers to access Mt. Jefferson through Idaho, while maintaining wilderness area on the north side of the mountain. In a letter sent to Regional Forester Tom Tidwell, the delegation said: 
   "We are pleased to see the Forest Service selected Alternative 6 as its preferred alternative. Mt. Jefferson is the 'draw' that brings snowmobilers, and the hundreds of dollars they spend daily, to the recreation dependent economies in Island Park, West Yellowstone, and Eastern Idaho.
   "This revision represents a true compromise by allowing for the recommended wilderness in the north half of the Mt. Jefferson area while leaving the south half open to access from Idaho. Thank you for acknowledging that all Americans need areas of roadless and wild lands that offer a range of recreation opportunities."
