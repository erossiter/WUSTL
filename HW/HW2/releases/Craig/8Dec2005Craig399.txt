SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS MINING REFORM EFFORTS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig issued the following statement today on his support for efforts to reform the 1872 Mining Act:  
   "It has come to my attention that some have interpreted statements I made recently to mean that I would oppose efforts to reform the 133-year old 1872 Mining Act. This is not the case. While I do have concerns about the intent of the language, I will be working with my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the Senate to improve the bill and alleviate these concerns. In short, I will be working to improve, not oppose reform language. 
   "Mining is an important part of Idaho's heritage, but it also continues to be a vital part of our state's economy. Congress' 11-year moratorium on patenting is a very real threat to Idaho's mining industry, and I will continue to work to help the reform efforts meet the procedural hurdles that lie ahead."
