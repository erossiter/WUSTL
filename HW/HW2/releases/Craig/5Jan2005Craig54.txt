SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig named Jared Tate of Arco, Idaho, to be Idaho's U.S. Senate page for the Spring 2005 term.  
 He is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Spring Page Program. 
   Jared is currently a junior at Butte County High School, where he is an honor roll student and the junior class president. He participates in a number of extracurricular activities, including football, basketball, track and field, academic decathlon and Advanced Natural Helpers. Jared is currently awaiting approval to become an Eagle Scout, and has also earned his student pilot certificate. He is a member of the Eagle Rock Composite Squadron - Idaho Wing, Civil Air Patrol, and hopes to obtain an appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. 
   "Jared will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships he will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime." 
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the House and Senate Chambers for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk. 
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be sixteen years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. In addition, information and an application are available on Senator Craig's website at http://craig.senate.gov.
