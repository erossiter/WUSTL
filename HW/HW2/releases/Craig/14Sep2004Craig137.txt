IDAHO DELEGATION ANNOUNCES ACADEMY DAY
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo, and Reps. Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter today announced Service Academy Day will take place on Saturday, October 2, 2004. Information sessions on the nomination process for the Service Academies will be held in Coeur d'Alene, Boise and Idaho Falls on that day, from 9:30 A.M.-12:00 noon. Representatives from each academy will be present to discuss the nomination and admissions processes. 
   The initial application form, for the academies of the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Merchant Marines, is due on October 31, 2004. Nominees will be announced by the end of December.
   "I'm always pleased to take part in the nomination process for our nation's military academies," said Craig. "I consider these nominations to be both a privilege and one of my most enjoyable responsibilities as a member of the United States Senate. I encourage those who are interested to attend the Academy Day sessions and get started with the process as early as possible."
   "Each year, it is an honor to encourage Idaho students to attend our nation's service academies," Crapo said. "The academies offer one of the finest educational experiences available in the country, and I urge students who are thinking about their higher education options to seriously consider one of the service academies. The learning environment and opportunities to serve our country are unparalleled."
   "Academy nominations give Idaho's finest students the opportunity to serve their country, receive an elite college education and get a jump-start on a good career," said Simpson. "Idaho consistently ranks among the top states in the quality of its nominations and we'll be looking to continue that record."
   "America's service academies offer a first-rate education, the opportunity to serve your country and a place from which to launch a career that's as important as it is prestigious," said Otter. "What's more, the academies are proving grounds for tomorrow's leaders, where tradition and honor are the building blocks of integrity and valor. Academy Day is a great chance for the young men and women of Idaho to explore just how far the future can take them."
