SEN. CRAIG, REPS. SIMPSON, OTTER VISIT IRAQ
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Reps. Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter arrived in Germany today after visiting Idaho troops in Iraq during the weekend.  
 They spent two days in the region visiting Idaho soldiers serving in the Idaho National Guard's 116th Cavalry Brigade and other branches of the military. On the return trip, the three members of the Idaho Congressional Delegation, accompanied by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson, stopped today in Ramstein, Germany to visit with wounded soldiers at Landstuhl military hospital. 
   Earlier this year, while members of the 116th were preparing for deployment at Fort Bliss, Texas, and Fort Polk, Lousiana, members of the Idaho Congressional Delegation promised to come visit the 116th in Iraq. This trip, which was not disclosed until now for security reasons, fulfilled that promise to Idaho's soldiers. 
   Craig, Simpson, and Otter issued the following statement: "Throughout our time in Iraq, we were impressed, but not surprised, by the determination and achievements of our Idaho soldiers. These fine young people are using their civilian skills not only to provide for the security of Iraqis, but to busily tackle the task of training the Iraqi people and their leaders on how to build a free society from the ground, up. 
   "We were proud to visit with our young men and women as they carry out these dual roles with such enthusiasm and skill. They already have earned a strong reputation with their active-duty counterparts and commanding officers, and we were honored simply to share their company." 
   Craig, Otter and Simpson held a press conference via telephone earlier today. The audio file is available at http://craig.senate.gov/mediaclips.htm.
