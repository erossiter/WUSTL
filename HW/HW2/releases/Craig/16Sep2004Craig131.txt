FEDERAL GRANT WILL DELIVER HEALTH CARE TO UNINSURED, UNDERINSURED
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced that the Family Practice Residency of Idaho (FPRI) will receive $2 million in federal grant money to launch a community health clinic in Garden City to serve the underinsured and uninsured in the Treasure Valley Region.  
   The Department of Health and Human Services Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) is providing the $2.02 million in federal funds over a three year period. The funds were awarded as part of HRSA's Health Communities Access Program. 
   "The Family Practice Residency of Idaho has consistently stepped up to serve our constituents who either are uninsured or underinsured," said Senator Craig. "Groups like FPRI, Terry Reilly Health Services, and the Garden City Community Clinic set the standard for community health clinics in our state." 
   The clinic will be a collaborative venture of Family Practice Residency of Idaho, Terry Reilly Health Services, and the Garden City Community Clinic. Joining these groups to formalize a Health Communities Access Program will be Saint Alphonsus Regional Medical Center, St. Luke's Regional Medical Center, the Central District Health Department, and the United Way of Treasure Valley. 
   Dr. Ted Epperly, Chairman and Program Director of the Family Practice Residency of Idaho (FPRI), said that, "This is a tremendously important grant to set the wheels in motion and develop the ground work needed for a future community health center in Ada County. This grant is a giant leap forward in that collaborative endeavor."
