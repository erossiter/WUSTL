SEN. CRAIG HAILS SENATE SRBA APPROVAL
  The United States Senate tonight passed S.2605, the Snake River Water Rights Act of 2004.  
 The bill was brought to the Senate floor on a motion by Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and approved by unanimous consent. The legislation, which was introduced in the Senate by Craig and Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo, codifies a long sought-after agreement to settle water rights claims on the Snake River by the Nez Perce Tribe.
   Senator Craig said, "The support and efforts of Mike Crapo were indispensable in bringing this legislation before the Senate. Thanks to the help of Idaho's Congressmen Mike Simpson and Butch Otter in working to add this bill to the Omnibus Appropriations bill now pending in Congress, we have a high degree of confidence this bill will become law in the coming days." Votes on the Omnibus are expected in both the House of Representatives and the Senate as early as Saturday.
   Craig said, "This bill directs the federal government to facilitate compliance with the terms of the Settlement Agreement by authorizing federal funds and land exchanges. When this bill is signed into law, the Idaho State legislature will have the responsibility of determining whether this agreement should be executed."
   Craig continued, "The Idaho Delegation also is very pleased with the cooperation we received from the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, Senators Ben Nighthorse Campbell and Daniel Inouye. I want to thank them, and all our colleagues for their help in expediting passage of this important piece of legislation."
