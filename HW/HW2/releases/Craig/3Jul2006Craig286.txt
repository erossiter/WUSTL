SEN. CRAIG PRAISES NEW FOSTER CARE, ADOPTION LAW
  President George W. Bush today signed into law H.R.5403, the Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Foster Children Act of 2006, which is intended to improve the process for helping foster and adoptive children join safe, permanent, and loving families across state lines. 
   Idaho Senator Larry E. Craig, a longtime advocate of improving adoption and foster care, and an adoptive parent himself, applauded the new law.
   "State borders should not be barriers to children seeking safe and loving, permanent homes," Craig said. "This new law will improve the lives of foster children by providing resources and requirements to help speed up the interstate placement process."
   Currently, interstate placements take an average of one year longer than placements within a single state, delaying the safe placement of thousands of abused and neglected children. The Safe and Timely Interstate Placement of Children Act addresses this problem by not only authorizing incentives to state agencies but setting more timely deadlines for home studies to be completed, which will improve the placement process in significant ways.
   Craig co-chairs the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. For more information on adoption and foster care issues, please read Craig's Adoption Resources Issue Brief.
