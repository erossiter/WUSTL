IDEA REAUTHORIZATION PASSES SENATE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised Senate passage of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) reauthorization through a unanimous consent request Friday night.  
 Originally passed in 1975, IDEA established a framework of requirements for special education and was designed to foster a collaborative approach between school districts and parents of children requiring special education. 
   "I am pleased to join with my colleagues in voting to renew and improve IDEA," Craig said. "This approach focuses on doing what works, as well as increasing choices and meaningful involvement for parents. When the original IDEA was signed into law, the federal government committed to contribute up to 40 percent of the costs associated with special education, but has yet to meet this level of support. I am glad to see Congress has now laid out a path to meet the federal government's obligations to local schools." 
   The House-Senate Conference Report establishes a clear seven-year path to reach the 40 percent funding goal through the discretionary appropriations process by 2011, and aligns IDEA with the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) to raise expectations and accountability for all students, including those with disabilities. 
   The bill now goes to President Bush to be signed into law.
