SEN. CRAIG ANNOUNCES NEW MEDICAL FACILITY FOR VETERANS IN CALDWELL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced today that the U.S. Department of Veterans Affair opened a new Community-Based Outpatient Clinic in Caldwell. The facility opened its doors on Monday.  
   "Idaho is a fast growing state and the Department of Veterans Affairs is growing with us. I'm glad that VA will be able to provide more services closer to home for many Idaho and eastern Oregon veterans ," said Craig, the immediate past Chairman and now top Republican on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. "I had asked VA officials to do an analysis of the growth rates in Idaho and the data proved our case that southwestern Idaho is one of the fastest growing areas of the country." 
   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, there are now more than 1.4 million people in Idaho and of those over 130,000 are veterans. 
   The new clinic in Caldwell is now housed in a 2,500 square foot facility, but VA officials have already informed Craig that they want to expand to more than twice that space within the next year or two. It is located at 120 East Pine Street, Caldwell, near the West Valley Regional Medical Center. 
   The Caldwell center will offer basic medical and mental health care for veterans, including primary care, office visits for management of chronic medical illnesses and acute minor illnesses. Staff there will also collect routine blood tests and other lab samples. Specialty care and services beyond the scope of the Caldwell center will be referred to the Boise VA Medical Center. 
   A grand opening for the Caldwell facility will take place later this spring.
