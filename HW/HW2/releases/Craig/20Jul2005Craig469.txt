IDAHO LAND EXCHANGE BILL HEARD IN SENATE
  A bill to consolidate public land holdings in Idaho and to help conserve the Boise Foothills cleared a hurdle today in the United States Senate.  
   S. 1131, the Idaho Land Exchange Act, was the subject of a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests. Idaho Senator Larry Craig, chairman of the Subcommittee, offered the following in support, "I am always thrilled to see common sense and efficiency in government. This legislation epitomizes that ideal by consolidating holdings and organizing land to be more reflective of the mission of each land management agency." 
   Idaho State Controller Keith Johnson testified in favor of the legislation. During his testimony, he stated, "The exchange encourages both common sense and improved economics. In addition, the people of Idaho, particularly those living in the Boise Valley, will get more open space, a precious commodity in one of this nation's fastest growing communities." 
   Johnson, a member of the Idaho State Land Board, reminded Senators that the Land Board voted unanimously in support of the exchange.
