CONFEREES REACH AGREEMENT ON SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS
  Conferees have approved supplemental funding for the war in Iraq and Afghanistan, tsunami relief, and border security, among other items.  
 A conference committee for the Senate and the House of Representatives approved the $82 billion measure. 
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Representative Mike Simpson, both members of the Appropriations Committee, issued the following statement upon the approval of the bill: 
   "This is a fiscally responsible bill that provides our troops with the resources they need to secure freedom in the Middle East and to assist those ravaged by the tsunami. In addition, it recognizes the need to increase our homeland security efforts, including border protection." 
   The bill provides $1.2 billion in domestic appropriations to fight the war on terror and increase homeland security. Included is language to add 500 new border patrol agents, 1950 new detention beds, and 218 other new investigators and enforcement personnel. The language, known as the Byrd/Craig amendment, was originally adopted by the Senate on a 65 to34 vote. 
   Craig and Simpson added, "Securing our borders is a key component of homeland security. These additional resources strive to meet the goals of the 9/11 Commission and will catapult us forward in our efforts to ensure better control of who enters our country." 
   The Conference Report will now go before the House and Senate for final approval by each. It cannot be amended.
