SEN. CRAIG SPONSORS BILL TO LIMIT MILK PROTEIN IMPORTS
  Idaho Sen. Larry E. Craig and Sen. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., introduced the "Milk Import Tariff Equity Act of 2005" (MITEA) today.  
 The legislation imposes Tariff-Rate Quotas (TRQs) on imports of milk protein concentrate (MPC) and casein-based food and animal feed products. 
   Currently U.S. trade laws provide minimal to no protection from the importation of these products - although U.S. TRQs do apply to related dairy products including nonfat dry milk and cheese. 
   "Idaho's dairy producers continue to face volatile prices due to heavily-subsidized foreign dairy products and other factors," Craig said. "This legislation provides added stability to the marketplace, fair treatment relative to other commodities, and a reduced burden on taxpayers, as these imports affect the dairy price support program." 
   Craig and Clinton, backed by bipartisan supporters, contend that imports of MPC and casein-based food products have a negative economic effect on dairy farmers, as they displace domestically-produced milk used to make cheese and other dairy foods. 
   Under the legislation, new TRQs imposed on milk protein concentrate and on casein would be consistent with U.S. tariffs on similar dairy products. The legislation contains language directing the U.S. government to ensure that new TRQs are consistent with the terms of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the commitments of the United States under the World Trade Organization. 
   An identical version of the bill, HR. 521, was introduced in the House of Representatives by Representatives Don Sherwood, R-Penn., and David Obey, D-Wis.
