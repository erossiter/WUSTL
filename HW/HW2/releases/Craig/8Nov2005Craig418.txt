INTERNSHIP APPLICATION DEADLINE EXTENDED
  Sen. Larry Craig today announced the application deadline for internships in the spring term has been extended to November 17, 2005.  
 The spring term runs from January to May. Craig offers paid internships within the Washington, D.C., office. Preference is given to Idaho applicants attending Idaho schools who are in their junior or senior years of college (including graduating seniors). 
   Interns are paired with staff members based on experience and interests, in order to best utilize their talents. They are also expected to fulfill some administrative duties such as answering phones, sorting mail and greeting constituents. 
   Applications and more information about the internship program are available on Craig's website at http://craig.senate.gov or at any of Craig's six regional offices in Coeur d'Alene, Lewiston, Boise, Twin Falls, Pocatello and Idaho Falls. A link to the intern application can be found on the left-hand side of the website. It is recommended that applications be delivered personally to the regional offices or sent via fax to (202) 228-1067. Applications can also be mailed, but delays are likely due to heightened security measures for Senate mail. Mailed applications must be received in the office by the deadline and should be directed to:
