SEN. CRAIG ANNOUNCES 2008 SERVICE ACADEMY NOMINEES
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig has nominated 32 of Idaho's best and brightest young people for appointment to our nation's military service academies for the year 2008 - the Class of 2012.  
   "Idaho continues to produce young people who are remarkably qualified for the rigors of our service academies," Craig said. "In their young lives, this year's students have already demonstrated excellent leadership capabilities and strength of character. This nation depends on those who dedicate their lives to defend the values and liberties we hold dear. It is a privilege to nominate them for the four service academies."
