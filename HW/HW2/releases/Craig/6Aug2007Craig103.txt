SENATE APPROVES CASWELL AS DIRECTOR OF BLM
  Idaho Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo supported and praised the approval of James Caswell by the full Senate to serve as the Director of the Bureau of Land Management late Friday evening.  
   Craig, Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, said "I look forward to having someone of Jim's caliber heading up BLM. The fact that he was confirmed so quickly, I think, speaks to his strong qualifications for the job. In the numerous times I've worked with Jim over the years, I've always found him to be reasonable, practical and very fair, and I'm sure he'll continue to demonstrate these qualities in his new role. He'll bring an Idahoan's perspective to land management and related issues at the agency." 
   "Jim is superbly qualified for the position and he is an outstanding combination of experience, education and attitude," Crapo said. "He will do the job with a commitment to collaboration and approach the challenges with fairness." 
   Caswell has served as a Forest Supervisor and most recently headed Idaho's Office of Species Conservation under Governor C.L. "Butch" Otter.
