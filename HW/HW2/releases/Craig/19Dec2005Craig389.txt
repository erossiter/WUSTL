SEN. CRAIG, OTHERS OFFER PATRIOT ACT SOLUTION
  The four Republican Senators who voted against ending debate on the USA PATRIOT Act reauthorization urged Majority Leader Frist and Chairman Specter to work to temporarily extend the expiring provisions of the Patriot Act until early next year.  
 The four Sens. Larry Craig, R-Idaho; Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska; Chuck Hagel, R-Neb.; and John Sununu, R-N.H., sent a letter outlining their request and reasoning. 
   In the letter, the four stated: 
   "We write to express our profound disappointment that many important provisions of the USA PATRIOT Act will expire on December 31. We agree with the President that it is inexcusable for the Senate to not re-authorize this important law. 
   "We believe that if key changes to the conference report were made, the re-authorization would overwhelmingly pass the Senate. As one of many alternatives, the Senate could pass a three-month extension to allow more time for negotiations. Or the Senate could take up and pass a bill similar to the Senate version passed with unanimous support earlier this year. 
   "We note the House of Representatives may return on December 22, making all these options viable."
