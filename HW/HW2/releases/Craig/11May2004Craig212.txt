SEN. CRAIG PUSHES EARLY ACTION TO PREVENT CATASTROPHIC FIRES
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig pressed Administration officials today on wildfire preparedness.  
 The hearing was in front of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, of which Sen. Craig is a member. 
   Mark Rey, Under Secretary for Natural Resources and the Environment, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and Lynn Scarlett, Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management, and Budget, Department of the Interior, testified at today's hearing. 
   "With an accumulation of low water years and a looming drought, fire is a natural topic for all of us to think about. With the combination of drought and increased fuel loads, again our public lands continue to be an easy target for catastrophic fires," said Craig. 
   Craig continued, "We must be ahead of the curve and ensure that we are proactive, not reactive, to fighting fires. I appreciate the Bush Administration's efforts to improve the health of our forests and, therefore, bring back a more natural fire regime. However, we still need to be prepared to tackle the fires that do come along." 
   Senator Craig serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's subcommittee on Public Lands and Forests.
