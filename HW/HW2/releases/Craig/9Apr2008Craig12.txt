SEN. CRAIG SAYS STATES HAVE RIGHT TO MANAGE LOCAL WATER
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig today said States, not the federal government, should decide how to manage local bodies of water. His comments came during a hearing by the Environment and Public Works Committee on the Clean Water Restoration Act of 2007. 
   The 2007 Act proposes to delete the term "navigable" from the Clean Water Act (CWA) and replace it with a new legislative definition of "waters of the United States" that includes all "intrastate waters" and all "activities affecting these waters."
   "No one disputes the value of water quality, but this legislation brings into question any puddle that can float a legal brief," Craig said. "If enacted, it will make judges, not States, water masters, and combine the issues related to water quantity with those associated with water quality.
   "Water is especially vital to the growing population of the West. I would prefer that decisions concerning this precious resource be handled in Laramie, Boise, or Sacramento - not in Washington D.C. These kinds of decisions should be made on the ground by local and State officials, not by the administrator of the EPA."
