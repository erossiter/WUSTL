SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE
  Sen. Larry Craig named Megan Faulkner of Richfield, Idaho, to be Idaho's U.S. Senate page for the Spring 2006 term.  
 She is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Spring Page Program. 
   Megan is currently a junior at Richfield High School in Richfield, where she is the junior class vice-president and a member of Future Farmers of America. She is also a member of the junior varsity basketball team and serves as a volunteer for the Lincoln County Search and Rescue Team. 
   "Megan will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships she will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime." 
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the Senate Chambers for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk. 
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be sixteen years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. In addition, information and an application are available here.
