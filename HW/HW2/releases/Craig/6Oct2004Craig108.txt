REP. CRAIG INTRODUCES SPECIALTY CROP BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow today introduced S.2902, the Specialty Crop Competitiveness Act of 2004.  
 The legislation seeks to promote a comprehensive approach to the challenges faced by specialty crop farmers, and specifically focuses on six areas of federal policy affecting the industry including marketing, international trade, research into crop production and pest and disease problems, and conservation practices.
   "This legislation recognizes that specialty crops are an essential part of our agricultural economy," Craig said. "However, because production of these commodities is so specialized, the industry continues to be largely underserved. I hope to shed some light in Congress on the challenges faced by this industry, and this bill provides the launching point to restore their competitiveness in the marketplace."
   The bill also requires the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation to provide a $470 million block grant to states to support production-related research, commodity promotion, nutrition, food safety and inspection, and other programs to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops.
   Idaho is the fourth largest producer of specialty crops in the nation.
