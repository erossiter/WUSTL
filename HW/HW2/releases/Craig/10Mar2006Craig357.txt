SEN. CRAIG HAILS FEBRUARY JOB GROWTH; FIVE MILLION JOBS CREATED SINCE 2003
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig touted February job figures released today by the Department of Labor. According to the DOL report, the U.S. economy created 243,000 jobs in February alone, pushing the total number of jobs created in the last 12 months to 2.1 million. 
   "This Congress and this President have created an economic environment in which growth is strong, and Idaho's working families are reaping the benefits," Craig said. "There is still work for us to do, which is why I'll keep pushing to eliminate the federal government's tax on death and make the President's tax relief permanent, including the lower capital gains and dividend rates."
   Idaho's unemployment numbers for January were a record low, coming in at 3.3 percent. The unemployment rate of 4.8 percent is well below the average rate for the 1970s, `80s and `90s, and real disposable incomes have risen 2.2 percent in the last 12 months.
