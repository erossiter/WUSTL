GRILES, DEPUTY SECRETARY OF THE INTERIOR, RESIGNS; SEN. CRAIG SAYS GRILES 'WILL LEAVE A BIG VOID'
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig reacted to today's announcement by the U.S. Department of the Interior (DOI) that Deputy Secretary J. Steven Griles has submitted his letter of resignation to President Bush and Secretary Gale Norton.  
 Griles' resignation is effective January 31, 2005, or sooner, if a replacement is confirmed. 
   In a press release, Secretary Norton said she understood Griles' reasons for moving on, but nonetheless expressed regret at his decision. "Yours is a letter I hoped would never come," said Norton. "We have accomplished so much together. We have moved federal relations with the West from antagonism to cooperative conservation...Without your perseverance and focused commitment, we would never have achieved so much progress." 
   Craig praised Griles' work at DOI, saying "I second Interior Secretary Norton's regret in Steve Griles' departure. Steve is the kind of person we need at the Department of the Interior, and his resignation leaves a big void. His knowledge of public lands issues is broad in scope and deep in substance, and he spoke the common sense language of the people I serve. For a State such as Idaho, where we often feel hostage to natural resource policies put forward in Washington, D.C., Steve Griles did much to safeguard our interests, and I thank him for that." 
   Griles served in the public sector for a total of 22 years.
