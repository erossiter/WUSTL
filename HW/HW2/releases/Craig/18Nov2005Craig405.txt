SENATE SENDS SIGNAL ON WTO NEGOTIATIONS
  The United States Senate sent a strong message late last night that the U.S. will not stand for unfair trade practices.  
 The resolution comes on the heels of the next World Trade Organization's Doha Development Agenda Round set to be held in Hong Kong in December. 
   The Craig-Rockefeller Resolution, S. Con. Res. 55, was offered as an amendment to the Tax Reconciliation bill, which cleared the Senate early this morning. The amendment was approved by voice vote. 
   The Resolution, cosponsored by 41 Senators, underscores that any agreement resulting from the Doha Round must not weaken U.S. protections against unfair trade practices. 
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig made the following remarks in support, "Congress has made it clear time and time again that U.S. negotiators cannot bring back a trade agreement from Doha that weakens U.S. antidumping and countervailing duty and safeguard laws that this Congress has put in place. These laws are widely recognized as critical tools to U.S. manufacturers, farmers, ranchers, and workers who sometimes are forced to fight for their rights to compete in fair environments. 
   "As we open up the world's trade, let us make sure that we have in place the tools necessary to keep it fair and balanced and not negotiated away." 
   In Idaho, industries such as semiconductor manufacturing and lumber are in a constant battle against unfair foreign trade practices.
