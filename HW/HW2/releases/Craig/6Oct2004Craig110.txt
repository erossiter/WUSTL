SENS. CRAIG, CRAPO SUPPORT NUCLEAR POWER EXPANSION
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo joined a bipartisan group of Senators today in introducing a Senate Concurrent Resolution supporting the expansion of nuclear power. The Resolution acknowledges that Congress recognizes the essential role of and supports the increased use of nuclear power. 
   The Resolution recognizes the value of nuclear power in generating safe, consistent, affordable, and emission-free electricity. Currently twenty percent of our nation's electricity is generated by nuclear power.
   "Nuclear power is our safest and most environmentally friendly form of energy because it emits no air pollution," said Senator Craig. "France and Japan long ago recognized both its environmental value and its contribution to energy security, and they rely heavily on nuclear power for their energy needs. For our economic security and our environment we need to increase nuclear power to at least thirty percent of our electricity supply in this country."
   "Nuclear power represents a flexible solution to world environmental pollution problems, our national energy security concerns, and economic growth," said Senator Crapo. "Expansion of this resource through education, research, and development will allow the United States to become a leader in pollution reduction and sustainable energy production."
   Senators Craig and Crapo are strong supporters of constructing an advanced Generation IV nuclear reactor in eastern Idaho at the Idaho National Laboratory. Generation IV reactors produce less waste, limit the proliferation of nuclear materials, and utilize passive safety systems.
   The text of the Resolution is below.

   CONCURRENT RESOLUTION
   Recognizing the essential role of nuclear power in the national energy policy of the United States and supporting the increased use of nuclear power and the construction and development of new and improved nuclear power generating plants.
   Whereas the Energy Information Administration in the Department of Energy estimates that by 2025 the United States will need more than 300,000 megawatts of new electricity-generating capacity to maintain its current levels of growth and standards of living;
   Whereas Vision 2020, the nuclear energy industry's plan to increase the use of nuclear energy through the year 2020 to meet the projected growth in the demand for electricity, calls for maintaining the Nation's nonemitting electricity generation at 30 percent, which would require 50,000 megawatts of new nuclear power to be generated;
   Whereas meeting the increasing demand for continuous and reliable, or baseload, electricity is essential for supporting the economic growth which is necessary to maintain the Nation's standard of living;
   Whereas even the aggressive implementation of energy-efficiency initiatives cannot replace the need for new electricity- generating capacity;
   Whereas nuclear power generated by the 103 commercial nuclear power plants operating in the United States provides the electricity for 20 percent of the United States;
   Whereas consumers of nuclear power enjoy a higher level of price stability compared to consumers of other energy sources;
   Whereas nuclear power plants do not produce harmful emissions or greenhouse gases and can provide States, and the Nation as a whole, with flexibility in meeting goals for clean air and economic growth at lower costs than other sources of power;
   Whereas increasing nuclear power generation will require designing and building new plants as well as operating the new facilities, which together will create thousands of new jobs;
   Whereas the nuclear power industry, the Department of Energy, and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission are working together to demonstrate the effectiveness of a new licensing process for nuclear power plants, which allows full public participation in decisions about the designs and sites of new nuclear power plants without causing delays in construction or commercial operation;
   Whereas nuclear energy, science, and technology applications are vital in the diagnosis and treatment of disease, food and mail safety, space exploration, structural inspection,and other important applications;
   Whereas for decades, commercial nuclear power generating facilities have had an unmatched safety record;
   Whereas nuclear power plants in the United States use excess material from Russian weapons programs to generate power, which is a vital component of United States nonproliferation policy;
   Whereas many countries intend to build new nuclear power plants, with 29 new plants currently under construction worldwide and more than twice that many being planned, and the United States must continue to play a leadership role both in domestic nuclear power production and in encouraging the use of nuclear power in other countries;
   and Whereas the United States continues to lead the world in the development, use, and control of nuclear technology:
   Now, therefore, be it Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress -
   (1) recognizes the essential role of nuclear power in the national energy policy of the United States; and
   (2) supports the increased use of nuclear power and the construction and development of new and improved nuclear power generating plants as a means of contributing to national energy independence and maintaining a clean environment.
