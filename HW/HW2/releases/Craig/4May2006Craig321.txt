SEN. CRAIG VOTES 'NO' ON EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, voted "no" today on the $109 billion emergency supplemental appropriations bill. The bill was approved by the full Senate 78-20. 
   "If this bill only contained funding for operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and Katrina recovery, I would have gladly supported it," Craig said. "However, this bill contains billions that have nothing to do with the war on terror, and I will not use it as an excuse to spend like a drunken sailor.
   "My vote is not about supporting our military. My vote is not about supporting recovery efforts in the Gulf Coast. My vote is about frustration with the Senate spending billions upon billions of dollars in such an irresponsible manner. The people of Idaho have charged me with being a good steward of their taxpayer dollars, and they expect me to work hard and make sure those dollars are being spent wisely. This bill does not do that. It's time to say `enough is enough.'"
   President Bush warned that he would veto the supplemental if Congress amended the bill to include more than the $95 billion he requested. Last week, Senator Craig, along with 34 other senators, signed a letter to the President vowing to support his veto if necessary.
