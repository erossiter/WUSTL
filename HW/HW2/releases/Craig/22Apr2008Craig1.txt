SEN. CRAIG CALLS FOR SWIFT RESOLUTION TO OWYHEE INITIATIVE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig today welcomed fellow Idaho Senator Mike Crapo to the Senate Public Lands and Forests Subcommittee to testify concerning S. 2833, the Owyhee Public Land Management Act of 2008, and expressed the need for more clarification and fine-tuning of the language contained in the legislation. 
   "The Owyhee Canyonlands are some of the most marvelous high-desert canyonlands in the Great Basin West," Craig said. "Some of the largest public land ranches in Idaho reside in and around this area, and the air space above it has provided one of the most effective training areas in the world. It is without question a very unique property and something Idahoans and the citizens of our country are excited about."
   Craig went on to express his limited concern over the wording of land exchanges and buyouts included in the bill. "I want to make sure all parties cross the finish line at the same time. Sometimes when we pass redesignation of public lands, those who are for the designation immediately win, while those who are to be compensated in the future unfortunately are not."
   Craig also stressed the importance of maintaining the world class military training grounds which border the proposed wilderness area and secured a commitment from the Wilderness Society to proceed with the original agreement in the event the legislation is passed under a new administration.
   Craig said he is optimistic his concerns will be addressed and praised Senator Crapo for his dedication to the bill. "There have been a lot of compromises in this bill. All parties have given a little and been given back a little, and clearly Senator Crapo deserves an A in this for his effort."
