Secretary Ann Veneman announced today that the USDA will provide surplus stocks of non-fat dry milk to livestock producers in areas hardest hit by the drought.
   "We are pleased that the USDA has recognized the extreme and difficult conditions facing Idaho livestock producers and has responded accordingly. The continuing drought has placed Idaho producers under great hardship, and we feel that this aid is appropriate and necessary."
