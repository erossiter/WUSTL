SEN. CRAIG HAILS MOELLER NOMINATION
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig hailed the nomination of Phil Moeller by President Bush to fill a vacancy on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Current commissioner Pat Wood is retiring, and Moeller would take his place.  
   "I applaud the President's nomination of Phil Moeller to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission," Craig said. "Phil is well qualified, experienced and brings a wealth of knowledge to the table. FERC and the Pacific Northwest would be well served by a commissioner such as Phil and I look forward to supporting his nomination before the Committee." 
   Moeller served as former Washington Senator Slade Gorton's Senior Legislative Assistant for Electricity Policy, a capacity in which he frequently worked very closely with Senator Craig. Moeller hails from Spokane, Washington, and worked for more than 10 years in the Washington State Legislature on energy-related issues.
