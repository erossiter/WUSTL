SEN. CRAIG VOICES CONCERN ON STATUS QUO IN IRAQ TO PRESIDENT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined a bipartisan group of Senators in a meeting with the President today. The subject was the war in Iraq and all of the Senators were there at the President's invitation.  
   Craig stated, "During the meeting I told the President that Idahoans are frustrated with the status quo in Iraq. We support our troops, the goals of the war, and the President. It was our duty to oust a brutal dictator and to make moves to bring democracy and freedom to Iraq and eventually the Middle East. However, we are looking to the commander in chief for a new, clearly defined strategic plan." 
   Craig emphasized that he was pleased with the meeting, "The President was clearly there to listen to our opinions and the garner our input prior to his Iraq policy announcement next week." 
   Senator Craig's weekly editorial, Trial of a Tyrant, was published yesterday and offers additional views on the justice brought to Saddam Hussein.
