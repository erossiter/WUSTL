CITY OF BURLEY WASTEWATER FUNDS APPROVED
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill today.  
 Several projects were included for Idaho, including a $2 million installment for improving the City of Burley's Wastewater Treatment System.
   "Across Idaho we are seeing communities struggling to meet federal requirements for their wastewater systems. These improvements will serve the residents of Burley well by allowing them to comply with regulations with minimal cost to the ratepayers," said Senator Craig.
   The majority of Burley's system was installed in the 1920s. The current treatment plant was constructed in 1962. Further significant modifications were made in 1978 and 1980, including the addition of microscreening facilities to reduce algal discharges and suspended solids to regulated levels that have not been particularly effective. Most residential service connections to the system are at least 30 years old.
   The bill now goes before the full Senate for consideration.
