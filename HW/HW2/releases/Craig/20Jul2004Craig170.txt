SENATE DEMOCRATS BLOCK WILLIAM MYERS FOR POST ON NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS
  Democrats blocked the Senate today from considering William G. Myers III for a post on the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  
 Myers was nominated by President Bush on May 15, 2003, and he was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004. 
   According to Craig, "Once again Senate Democrats are making history by denying the Senate the right to vote on a judicial nominee. 
   "Bill Myers would make a qualified and honorable jurist. Outside of the Senate, he enjoys the support of Republicans and Democrats alike. Unfortunately, Senate Democrats have sacrificed Idaho's representation on the Ninth Circuit and are bypassing the Constitution in the name of racking up favors with their environmental constituencies." 
   Myers received 53 votes, a majority of the Senate. However, Democrats employed a procedural maneuver that requires 60 votes before the Senate could vote on the merits of the Myers nomination. Democrats have employed this same tactic for a number of President Bush's nominees - a first in the history of the Senate. 
   For more information on Bill Myers, please visit the U.S. Department of Justice.
