INL, RESEARCH, WATER INFRASTRUCTURE, AGRICULTURE PROJECTS INCLUDED IN YEAR-END CONGRESSIONAL SPENDING PACKAGE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson today highlighted dozens of important agriculture, research, infrastructure, and economic development projects that will be headed to Idaho as part of a year-end spending package being finalized in Washington, DC. 
   "I'm pleased with the assistance our ag producers will get to mitigate natural disasters and combat pests like the Potato Cyst Nematode," said Craig. "In addition to the help coming to our farmers, our communities and our laboratories benefit from this bill, too. They'll see cleaner drinking water, improved wastewater systems, and cutting edge energy technologies, to name a few. We nearly doubled funding for the Next Generation Nuclear Project (NGNP), and this bill paves the way for Idaho to host yet another first-of-its-kind reactor by 2018."  
   "The funding included in this bill is critical to a number of Idaho schools, institutions, communities, and citizens," said Simpson. "The Potato Cyst Nematode Eradication funding and the agriculture disaster assistance package will assist our state farmers and ranchers through a difficult year of drought, disease, and wildfire. Idaho National Laboratory will see its current research reactor and future demonstration reactor both receive critical infusions of money. And communities across the state, from Marsing to Rexburg, will see their aging water and wastewater infrastructure improved." 
   Among the most prominent projects included in the bill were the following: 
   * $9.6 million for the Idaho State Department of Agriculture's Potato Cyst Nematode Eradication program in Idaho potato fields. This funding is a critical component of State and Federal efforts to assist Idaho farmers in combating Potato Cyst Nematode. 
   * The bill includes the extension of agriculture disaster programs until December 31, 2007. Eligible programs include the Crop Disaster Program, the Livestock Compensation Program, and the Livestock Indemnity Program. Idaho farmers and ranchers impacted by drought and wildfires are encouraged to contact your local Farm Service Agency office to determine if you qualify for these programs. The Idaho Congressional Delegation had requested these extensions early this year. 
   * $116 million for the Next Generation Nuclear Plant (NGNP) at the Idaho National Laboratory. The NGNP program will develop an advanced gas reactor that can be used to produce both electricity and process heat for a variety of applications. 
   * $9.8 million to transition the Idaho National Laboratory's Advanced Test Reactor in a National Scientific User Facility. 
   * $500,000 for the Auger Falls Wastewater Treatment Project in Twin Falls. This is the third year of funding for the project bringing a total federal investment of $1.6 million. Other communities receiving water project funding include Marsing ($432,000), Hazelton ($469,000), St. Anthony ($562,000), Rexburg ($137,000), and Buhl ($300,000). 
   * $4,064,000 through the Army Corps of Engineers Section 595 (Rural Idaho) Program will be used to complete work on a municipal wastewater system in Smelterville and continue work on the Eastern Idaho Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant.
