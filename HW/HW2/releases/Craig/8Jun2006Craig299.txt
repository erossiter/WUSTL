BONNEVILLE POWER ADMINISTRATION RATE HIKE SHORT-CIRCUITED
  The Supplemental Appropriations bill emerged from the House-Senate Conference Committee today with a provision prohibiting the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA)[1] from implementing the Administration's proposal to prepay U.S. Treasury debt. The proposal would have increased power rates in the Northwest in order to fund other government programs. Craig, a member of the Conference Committee, sponsored the provision. 
   Craig said, "The Northwest delegation was united in its opposition to this proposal because we recognize it is a wet blanket on our economy. BPA and our low-cost, clean hydropower played a large part in the development of the Northwest, and we will do whatever it takes to keep power rates low. This is far from the first time this proposal has surfaced, but I hope the message has been delivered that Congress won't stand for it."
   The Conference Committee adjourned early this morning and the report was signed early this afternoon. Craig thanked Northwest House members who lobbied their colleagues late into the night to include this provision.
