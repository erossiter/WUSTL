SENATE HONORS AMERICAN COWBOY
  A bill honoring the American Cowboy and continuing the legislative legacy of the late Wyoming Senator Craig Thomas has passed the U.S. Senate with the sponsorship of Idaho Senators Mike Crapo and Larry Craig. S. Res. 130 declares July 28, 2007 as "National Day of the American Cowboy."  
   The legislation notes that, "Whereas pioneering men and women, recognized as cowboys, helped establish the American West...that cowboy spirit continues to infuse the nation with its solid character, sound family values, and good common sense; Whereas the cowboy embodies honesty, integrity, courage, compassion, respect, a strong work ethic, and patriotism.Now be it resolved that the Senate designates July 28, 2007, as `National Day of the American Cowboy'; and encourages the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities." 
   Idaho's senators noted the date of the bill falls in line with activities at Idaho's Snake River Stampede and honors all of Idaho's rodeo activities. The resolution states approximately 800,000 ranchers in all 50 states are conducting business and contributing to the economic well-being of nearly every county in the nation. 
   The 'National Day of the American Cowboy' legislation was originally drafted by the late Senator Craig Thomas, R-Wyo., a close colleague of both Crapo and Craig. They said it will be especially important this July 28th to keep Senator Thomas in the hearts and minds of Idahoans and Americans for his great Western spirit reflective of the American Cowboy.
