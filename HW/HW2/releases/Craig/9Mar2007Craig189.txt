D.C. CIRCUIT STRIKES DOWN D.C. GUN LAWS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig noted the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision holding unconstitutional D.C.'s gun laws, which prohibit the private ownership of most firearms. The three-judge panel, in a 2-1 decision, noted that the right to keep and bear arms existed before the formation of the United States.  
   Craig, a lifelong supporter of the Second Amendment, said, "It's heartening to see this decision out of the D.C. Circuit Court, supporting the right of individuals to keep and bear arms. Citizens of the District should be encouraged that they are one step closer to being able to protect themselves and their families, and pursue the other legitimate uses of firearms enjoyed by freedom-loving citizens across the nation." 
   Craig supports legislation to repeal the D.C. gun ban.
