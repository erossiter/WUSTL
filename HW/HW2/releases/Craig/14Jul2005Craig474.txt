DELEGATION RESPONDS TO NATIONAL ACADEMIES' STUDY
  Idaho's Congressional Delegation offered the following statement on the National Academies' report entitled, "Superfund and Mining Megasites: Lessons from the Coeur d'Alene River Basin":  
   "From the beginning, our goal in pursuing this NAS assessment was ensuring that the EPA used the best possible science to reach its conclusions. We appreciate it identifying areas of concern, including the need for greater focus on upstream hot spots in the environmental remediation and more consideration of how previous EPA work inside the Box has influenced conditions downstream. The NAS call for a more flexible, efficient and effective problem-solving approach by the EPA is also encouraging. We remain committed to working with the Basin Commission in monitoring this process, and to ensuring that the well-being of the people of the Coeur d'Alene Basin is its highest priority."
