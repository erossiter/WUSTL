SEN. CRAIG JOINS AGRICULTURE SECRETARY VENEMAN TO ANNOUNCE RULE FOR ROADLESS AREAS IN BOISE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman and Under Secretary Mark Rey in Boise today to announce a new rule for roadless areas in our national forests. The proposed rule comes after several lawsuits and years of uncertainty about the management objectives for the 60 million acres of roadless area in the country - nearly 1/3 of our national forests.
   "The Bush Administration is wiping the slate clean and erasing Clinton's legacy of locking-up our land," said Craig.
