GUT-CHECK TIME
 By Sen. Larry Craig
   Throughout our lives, we encounter challenges. Various in nature, some are overcome easily and quickly, while others are more complex, persistent, and sometimes just downright demoralizing.  
 While we toil through what might seem like an endless ordeal, it isn't always easy to see the purpose of our struggles or the goal we are striving to meet.
   Although U.S. history is relatively short when compared with the nations of Europe or the ancient civilizations in India or China, Americans have had no shortage of trials and tribulations. From the first settlers to arrive in Massachusetts and Virginia in the 1600s to the present, we've had our share of obstacles and dark days.
