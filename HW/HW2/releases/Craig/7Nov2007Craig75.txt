SEN. CRAIG, REP. SIMPSON SECURE DEFENSE FUNDS FOR IDAHO
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson have secured funding for a number of Idaho projects in the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations bill. The bill was approved by a conference committee to be approved by both the House and Senate and sent to the President for his signature.  
   "Idaho's growing high-tech industry and universities continue to play an important role in developing new concepts and products that will keep our troops on the cutting edge," Craig said. "The tools being developed will make our Armed Forces more effective and thus better protected. These men and women stand in harm's way to protect our nation and our freedoms, and I'm happy to do my part to help protect them in their missions." 
   "Some of the best and brightest people in the nation are right here in Idaho. Several Idaho-based businesses and universities contribute to the overall security of our nation," said Simpson. "I am pleased to see that Congress provided funding for these critical projects that will benefit our country and improve our national security."
