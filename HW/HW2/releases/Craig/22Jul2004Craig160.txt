SEN. CRAIG, REP. SIMPSON SECURE SENIOR SCOUT FUNDING
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson, members of the Senate and House Appropriations Committees, respectively, hailed passage today of the House-Senate conference report for Department of Defense FY 2005 appropriations legislation.  
 The bill includes $1.4 million to prepare the Idaho Air National Guard for the SENIOR SCOUT intelligence mission.
   "Today's passage draws to a close a year of coordinated effort with members of several congressional committees, including the House and Senate Intelligence Committees. With the help of Congressman Simpson and Governor Kempthorne, we were successful in securing money and support to prepare the Idaho Air National Guard to become the permanent carrier of this high-priority mission," said Craig.
   He continued, "Although a final decision has not been reached on the permanent carrier, indications from Air Force leadership point to Idaho as the permanent carrier for this national security mission and asset."
   "This funding will bring the Idaho Air National Guard one step closer to being the permanent carrier for SENIOR SCOUT intelligence mission," said Congressman Mike Simpson. "I'm very pleased that Senator Craig and I were able to secure $1.4 million in the appropriations conference report."
   SENIOR SCOUT is an airborne electronic signals collection platform that is instrumental in performing intelligence and anti-terror missions worldwide. The encapsulated intelligence package, called a shelter, fits into the back of a standard C-130E or C-130H model that has been modified to accommodate the mission. SENIOR SCOUT relies solely on the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard for mission air support.
   The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature.
