SEN. CRAIG VISITS IDAHO NATIONAL GUARD AT FORT POLK
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig missed a rare Saturday session in the U.S. Senate to visit the men and women of the Idaho National Guard, preparing at Fort Polk, Louisiana, for deployment to Iraq. 
   The sesssion was held as the Senate works to complete legislation before adjourning until after the November election. However, Craig had promised to visit the Idaho troops before they left the United States for Iraq, and he made good on that pledge Saturday.
   "I, along with the majority of Congress, voted to take this country to war," said Craig. "I felt a profound sense of duty and responsibility to go and visit Idaho's young men and women right before they are deployed to Iraq."
   "Their spirits are high and I could feel a great sense of pride among our troops," Craig continued. "The reports and briefings I received from the commanding officers gives me great confidence that Idaho's troops are among the best soldiers in the country. As such, I know they will make Idaho and this nation proud."
   In addition to visiting with the Idaho soldiers, Craig attended a briefing on the Idaho National Guard's mission in Iraq, and encouraged the commanding officers at Fort Polk to ensure that the base's facilities meet the needs of the troops.
