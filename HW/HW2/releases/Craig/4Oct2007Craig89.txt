DOE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAM WILL BRING ALTERNATIVE ENERGY TO IDAHO
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig praised the rollout of a new loan guarantee program at the Department of Energy (DOE), which could make cellulosic ethanol a reality in Idaho. DOE issued the final regulation for its Loan Guarantee Program today, as well as and an invitation to Iogen Biorefinery Partners, LLC to submit a full application for the program.  
   "This announcement represents a significant step in moving the nation, and particularly Idaho, toward greater energy diversity and independence," said Craig. 
   As a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Senator Craig was instrumental in including the loan guarantee policy in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, and has since been working with the DOE to ensure expeditious implementation of the program. 
   In addition, Senator Craig has been and continues to be a strong advocate of Iogen Biorefinery's proposal to locate a cellulosic ethanol biorefinery in Shelley, Idaho. The proposed plant will produce 18 million gallons of ethanol annually, using wheat straw, barley straw, corn stover, switchgrass, and rice straw as feedstocks for the plant. 
   "The Administration's announcement is a major step toward the construction of a large-scale cellulosic ethanol plant that puts Idaho's farmers square in the tractor seat of renewable energy production," said Travis Jones, director of the Idaho Grain Producers Association. "The IGPA applauds the Idaho delegation's work to secure a vital new market for grain producers."
