SEN. CRAIG STRESSES IMPORTANCE OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig, at a hearing by the Senate Environment and Public Works Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee today, addressed the critical need for investment in our nation's infrastructure in order to maintain the health of our major economic sectors and our global competitiveness. 
   Craig discussed U.S. surface transportation challenges in the 21st Century global economy with a panel of experts, including representatives from the US-China Chamber of Commerce, Nike Inc., American Trucking Associations and the AFL-CIO.
   Craig pointed out that in its 2006-2007 Global Competitiveness Report, the World Economic Forum lists infrastructure as one of nine elements crucial to a country's sustained productivity and competitiveness. He also noted that the U.S. has slid from first to sixth in global competitiveness, and the U.S. infrastructure is ranked seventh in the world by the World Bank.
   "The task of reauthorizing our nation's surface transportation policy is certainly daunting considering our fiscal situation and the vast number of needs to maintain and modernize our infrastructure," Craig said. "But the critical nature of this task cannot be ignored.
   "We need national leadership to take charge of this issue and create a vision, similar to the vision created by President Eisenhower in the 1950s to create the Interstate Highway System. President Eisenhower's vision transformed post-World War II America and made the U.S. the world's most mobile society, helping make America the world's preeminent economy in its time."
   Senator Craig, a member of the full Environment and Public Works Committee, served as the Ranking Republican Member for today's hearing in the Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee.
