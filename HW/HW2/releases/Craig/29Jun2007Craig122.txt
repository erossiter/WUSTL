SEN. CRAIG CALLS FREE SPEECH ONLY FAIR DOCTRINE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined colleagues today in supporting legislation to ensure the federal government doesn't start regulating speech on the airwaves.  
   Senator Norm Coleman, R-Minn., is the chief sponsor of the Broadcaster Freedom Act of 2007, which was introduced today. Craig is an original cosponsor. The Act simply states that the Federal Communications Commission cannot reinstate or repromulgate the requirement that -broadcasters present opposing viewpoints on controversial issues of public importance, commonly referred to as the 'Fairness Doctrine.'" 
   Craig said, "Over the past few days, I have been the target of some tongue lashings from talk radio about my stances on solving our immigration woes. While I disagree with them in this case, this is America. This isn't China, Cuba, North Korea, Iran, or Venezuela. We celebrate free speech. We celebrate a diversity of views. We celebrate public debate. In fact, that is one reason people flock to our country - because of those very freedoms. 
   "Unfortunately, every now and then a few thin-skinned politicians get upset about comments on talk radio and they float the reestablishment of the Fairness Doctrine. There are few responses that are more un-American, and Congress needs to set that in stone by passing this bill." 
   The Fairness Doctrine was in place in federal regulation from the 1940s until the mid-1980s.
