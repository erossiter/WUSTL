SEN. CRAIG ANNOUNCES WATER QUALITY GRANT FOR SHOSHONE-BANNOCK TRIBE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced today a $700,000 water quality grant for the Shoshone Bannock Tribe to eliminate an ongoing contaminated water problem on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation.  
   \"These dollars are part of nearly $22 million in water and wastewater grants and loans we\'ve been able to provide to rural communities throughout the state,\" Senator Craig said. \"This grant will provide the necessary improvements to assure safe drinking water for the Shoshone-Bannock Tribe.\" 
   According to the USDA\'s Rural Development Office, current drinking water wells in the area have shown high levels of contaminants including ethylene dibromide and nitrates. The funds will be used to install approximately 25,000 feet of water line along Ballard Road on the Fort Hall Indian Reservation along with the installation of fire hydrants and 83 service connections with water meters.
