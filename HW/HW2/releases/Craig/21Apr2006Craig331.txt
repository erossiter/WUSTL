IDAHO SHINES IN LATEST JOBS REPORT
  Once again, Idaho is a shining star in the monthly jobs report. The March 2006 report was released today by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
   Idaho claims credit for the third-largest over-the-year percentage gains in non-farm employment at 4.9 percent. Reflecting the increase in jobs, Idaho also boasts the second-lowest unemployment rate, at 3.2 percent. That is lower than one year ago, when the rate was 4.0 percent.
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig praised the news, "Idaho has a record to be proud of and excited about. We are creating jobs and wages are rising, demonstrating the market at work and that we are not just creating low-wage jobs. The message to take home is that President Bush's economic policies are expanding our economy.
   "Some in Congress are saying, `Tax cuts worked, so let's change them.' We should be saying, `They worked, let's make them permanent."
   March 2006 marks the 31st consecutive month of job growth in the United States, where 5.2 million jobs have been added since August 2003. In addition, household wealth reached an all-time high of $52.1 trillion.
   Craig added, "Our economy is doing well - let's not threaten our future with unrestrained spending. In addition to making the tax cuts permanent, we need to enact meaningful reductions in government spending rather than suffocate the economy with government."
