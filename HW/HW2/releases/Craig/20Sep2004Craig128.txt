MARTI WISER HONORED AS ANGEL IN ADOPTION
  Marti Wiser, of Boise, Idaho will be honored as a 2004 Angel in Adoption on Thursday, September 23, 2004 at a ceremony in Washington, D.C. The awards are sponsored by the Congressional Coalition on Adoption. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, Co-Chairman of the coalition, will present the award. 
   Receiving national Angels in Adoption awards will be actress Jane Seymour, PGA golfer Kirk Triplett, Grammy Award winner Steven Curtis Chapman, and Vice President of the Orlando Magic, Pat Williams. National Angel Awardees are selected by the four congressional directors of the Congressional Coalition on Adoption Institute (CCAI), which hosts the awards ceremony.
   Marti is being honored for her work with the nonprofit SNAPS, Inc, which handles adoption promotion for the State of Idaho. She is best known for Wednesday's Child, a weekly news program highlighting children in need of adoptive parents. She has also helped guide a collaboration with the State of Oregon and is forging a similar relationship with the State of Washington in order to expand the search for adoptive parents for children in the Pacific Northwest.
   "Marti has advanced adoption and child welfare in Idaho and the Pacific Northwest by leaps and bounds," Craig said. "She has been instrumental in broadening the reach and building the success of adoption programs throughout the region. I know Idaho families consider themselves lucky to have Marti on the job."
   The awards celebration will take place on Thursday, September 23, 2004, 7:00 - 9:30 P.M., at the Ronald Reagan Building and International Trade Center in Washington, D.C.
