SEN. CRAIG DECRIES TAX AND SPEND BUDGET PASSED BY SENATE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig today decried the Senate Democratic Majority's passage of a tax-and-spend budget for 2009 which will allow Congress to raise federal spending by nine percent and pay for it with a mind-boggling $1.2 trillion tax hike on the American people. 
   The Senate passed the budget, which sets the blueprint for federal spending and taxation, on an almost straight party line vote of 51-44.
   "I voted NO on the Democrats' plan to raise taxes on 43 million families with children by $2,300 a year, NO to raising taxes on 18 million older Americans by $2,200 annually and NO to burdening 27 million small businesses with $4,100 more taxes a year, all to fund more wasteful, Washington spending programs," Craig said. "With energy, food and transportation costs soaring because this Congress has not enacted a national energy independence policy, Idahoans and all Americans already have sustained a heavy hit on their finances. The folks I'm hearing from want to keep more, not less, of their hard-earned dollars to spend on the needs of their families and their small businesses, not on Congress' insatiable appetite for new budget-busting programs."
   He said that eight million low income workers, aided by Republican tax cuts enacted since 2001, will be added to federal tax rolls under this budget.
   "Because the Senate Democratic majority refuses to live within its means, like every American family and business must, every American child will owe an additional $27,000 in taxes under this budget as the gross debt climbs by $2 trillion over the next five years," Craig said.
   Craig blamed presidential politics and a Washington-knows-best mentality for the Senate Democrats' misguided budget priorities.
