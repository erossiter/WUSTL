SEN. CRAIG SECURES FISH PASSAGE CENTER LANGUAGE IN ENERGY AND WATER APPROPS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig secured language in the Energy and Water Appropriations conference report which will clarify and streamline fish and wildlife recovery costs for the Bonneville Power Administration (BPA).  
 The language will transfer funding and data analysis responsibilities from the Fish Passage Center (FPC) to other agencies and programs in the Pacific Northwest region. 
   "Idaho's water should not be flushed away on experimental policies based on cloudy, inexact assumptions," said Craig. "I will continue to look for ways to ensure that dams and salmon can coexist and thrive, rather than give in to the myth that the Northwest can only have one or the other. This is the first step in getting the region back on track to salmon recovery. 
   "I have a duty to make sure that the science and data BPA - and consequently, the public - pays for are the very best, free from bias and agendas," Craig continued. "The region's salmon recovery programs will soon be better prepared to make policy decisions based on accurate, reliable data. 
   "Cheap electricity has helped make the Idaho and Northwest economy into what it is today. However, BPA currently spends about $700 million per year on fish and wildlife programs, which translates into approximately 30 cents of every dollar paid for BPA-managed power. Every year, these costs continue to rise, and I'm glad Congress agrees that it's time to make sure these programs are spending ratepayer dollars efficiently and effectively." 
   The House of Representatives approved the Energy and Water conference report Wednesday, and the Senate is expected to vote on it within the next few days and send it to the President for his signature.
