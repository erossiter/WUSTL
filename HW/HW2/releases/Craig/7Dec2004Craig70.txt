SEN. CRAIG SPONSORS BILL TO SUPPORT SCOUTS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig cosponsored legislation today to clarify the federal government's role with the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts organizations.  
 The bill, S. 3026, was introduced by Majority Leader Bill Frist. 
   "For decades the Scouts have partnered with the federal government to develop character and citizenship in America's young people. At a time when families and communities are searching for values-driven youth activities, the tradition of Scouting should be fostered, not squelched," expressed Idaho Senator Larry Craig. 
   The legislation, spurred by pending lawsuits to block federal support of the Scouts, states that no federal law shall limit any federal agency from providing any form of support to the Boy Scouts of America or the Girl Scouts of the United States of America. The full text of the legislation and other information can be found at the Library of Congress. With little time remaining in the current congressional session, this issue is expected to receive consideration in the 109th Congress, which convenes in January.
