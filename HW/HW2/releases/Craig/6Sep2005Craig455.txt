SEN. CRAIG ATTENDS HEARING ON ENERGY PRICES
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig attended a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing to examine gasoline prices and factors contributing to current high prices.  
 Although Hurricane Katrina has contributed to the most recent surge in energy prices, crude oil, refined gasoline and natural gas prices have been at or near record highs for several years. 
   "First, I would like to send my condolences to all those suffering as a result of Katrina," said Craig. "My thoughts and prayers are with you. 
   "Today, we are extremely concerned about the run-up in the cost of energy. Supply shocks like the one we're experiencing now are especially hard on poor citizens and gasoline-dependent businesses. This committee is aware of the tight energy supplies our nation faces, and has been working for quite some time to address the situation. On July 29, 2005, the Senate approved the Energy Bill, which will, in the long run, do a great deal to address the problems we have today. I sincerely regret that we didn't produce the bill on July 29, 2000, instead. 
   "However, the Energy Bill is not a cure-all. Increasing domestic supplies, such as drilling in ANWR, must be a part of the equation. Congress has a responsibility to take a hard look to find what can be done in the long and short term to bring relief to American families who are feeling the pinch. Having said that, government intervention in the marketplace can - and should - only be limited and carefully considered."
