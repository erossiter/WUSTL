SEN. CRAIG ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig had the following statement today on the passing of President Ronald Reagan:  
   I had the honor of being elected to Congress the year Ronald Reagan was elected President of the United States. He embodied the conservative movement and gave the movement credibility. 
   He challenged America, like no other President, to be the best we could be and to have pride in our nation. Reagan recognized we had many great days ahead and challenged the former Soviet Union, ultimately winning the cold war. He won that war by outperforming and outlasting the Soviets, and the victory changed the course of human history. 
   His place in our nation's history and the history of the world is well established. Reagan will long be remembered by all of us in the Republican Party and the conservative movement.
