BUSH EXTENDS TAX RELIEF
  President Bush signed into law legislation to extend many of his key tax relief measures that keep money in the pockets of hard-working low and middle class Americans.  
 Idaho's entire Congressional Delegation voted for the legislation.
   "Congress and President Bush are enabling working Americans to keep more of what they earn. That creates jobs, expands the economy, and allows each family to choose how their money is spent," said Senator Craig. "Besides, keeping money out of the government coffers is a sure-fire way to decrease government and return the power to the people."
   Key provisions included in the bill are:
   * Extension of the $1,000 Refundable Child Tax Credit, the expanded 10-percent tax bracket, and the marriage penalty relief;
   * Assistance to military families in combat zones;
   * Relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax for middle-class taxpayers;
   * Simplification of the tax code through a uniform definition of a child.
   Most of these provisions were included in President Bush's tax cuts previously enacted by Congress, but they required an extension. The legislation also extends various other pro-jobs tax provisions that have expired or will expire soon.
   This tax relief saves American families $109 billion over the next ten years. Military families serving in combat zones will keep an additional $199 million. That money drives innovation, creates jobs, and expands our growing economy.
