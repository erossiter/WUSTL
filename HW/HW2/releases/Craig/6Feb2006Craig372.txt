SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS IDAHO'S NATIONAL GUARD
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig traveled to the Pentagon today to meet with General Richard Cody, Vice Chief of Staff for the U.S. Army.  
 At the top of the agenda were the proposed reductions of the National Guard. 
   Idaho's 116th Cavalry Brigade, which provided tremendous support for Operation Iraqi Freedom, was Craig's main focus in the discussion. 
   Craig said, "Today, I stressed to the General the importance of Idaho's National Guard to our missions at home and abroad. Without question, Idaho's National Guard is an integral part in our overall success in fighting the war on terror, which they admirably demonstrated in their recent engagement in Iraq. 
   "The message to General Cody was clear: it does not make sense to reduce combat capability in the National Guard. Guard units returning from the Gulf need to be quickly re-equipped so they may remain vigilant and relevant in the global war on terrorism." 
   General Cody briefed the Chiefs of Staff for the nation's governors later in the day on this issue.
