SENATE SENDS ENERGY BILL TO PRESIDENT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig offered the following statement on the passage of the Energy Bill: 
   Craig said, "For the past five years we have struggled to enact a comprehensive energy policy for our nation -- a policy to decrease our dependence on foreign energy sources, to build our infrastructure, to build our supply, to encourage conservation, and to develop cleaner technologies for the future. Today's bill is a strong, effective bill that demonstrates leadership on the part of Congress and the President."
