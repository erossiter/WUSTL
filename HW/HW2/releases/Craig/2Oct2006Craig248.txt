FORMER IDAHO DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY DIRECTOR CONFIRMED BY SENATE
  The former director for Idaho's Department of Environmental Quality will now join his former boss at the U.S. Department of the Interior. Allred was confirmed early Saturday morning by unanimous consent in the Senate as Assistant Secretary of Lands and will serve under Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. 
   Craig commented, "I have known Steve for a number of years and look forward to working with him as the Assistant Secretary of Lands and Minerals. I have found Steve to be direct, decisive, and knowledgeable when it comes to energy and natural resource issues. Having an Idaho leader in that position will help reinforce the western heritage of public land use and conservation, and I have no doubt that he will bring new ideas to the Department and will ensure success on every level."
   "Steve brings a distinguished background in public service, environmental protection, and private sector know-how to this post," Crapo said. "His long experience shows a commitment to the principle of collaboration in solving environmental challenges-a skill that is unfortunately all too rare."
