SENS. CRAIG, FEINSTEIN SECURE EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR SECURE RURAL SCHOOLS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced the inclusion of a modified version of S.779, the one-year reauthorization of the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act, in the Senate Supplemental Appropriations Bill.  
   Craig said, "Rural Schools and Counties are one step closer today to receiving emergency funding to continue 'County Payments' for one more year for critical programs. In addition, Resource Advisory Committees (RACs) are proposed for reauthorization. 
   "Senator Feinstein was instrumental in securing funding for County Payments and I appreciate her continued support. 
   "There are two main differences between this and the House language - it provides $425 million in emergency spending for Fiscal Year 2007 and it reauthorizes the RACs, an important and often overlooked benefit of this law. 
   "With a one-year funding band-aid, I am hopeful political differences can be put aside for the good of schools, counties, and communities to develop a multi-year bill so that all of the progress of the last six years will not be lost. 
   "I will work with my colleagues in the Energy and Natural Resource Committee to develop a compromise that addresses the needs of timber-dependent communities and is reflective of our budgetary constraints and political realities." 
   Senator Feinstein, D-Calif., and Craig serve as the Chair and Ranking Member, respectively, of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.
