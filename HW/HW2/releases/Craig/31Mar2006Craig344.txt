SEN. CRAIG INTRODUCES SPECIALTY CROP BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow today introduced the Specialty Crop Competition Act of 2006. The legislation seeks to promote a comprehensive approach to the challenges faced by specialty crop farmers, and specifically focuses on several areas of federal policy affecting the industry including marketing, international trade, research into crop production and pest and disease problems, and conservation practices. 
   "This legislation recognizes that specialty crops are an essential part of our agricultural economy," Craig said. "However, because production of these commodities is so specialized, the industry continues to be largely underserved. With Senator Crapo as an original co-sponsor, we will educate Congress on the challenges faced by this industry in Idaho and the nation. This bill is the launching point for the next Farm Bill to restore their competitiveness in the global marketplace."
   The bill also requires the United States Department of Agriculture's Commodity Credit Corporation to provide a $200 million block grant annually to states to support production-related research, commodity promotion, nutrition, food safety and inspection, and other programs to enhance the competitiveness of specialty crops.
   Idaho is a major producer of specialty crops, including cherries, apples, potatoes, onions, mint, and many others.
