IDAHO JOB GROWTH CONTINUES HOT PACE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig touted outstanding April employment figures today from the Department of Labor, showing Idaho to have one of the best labor markets in the nation for workers. Idaho's unemployment rate, while unchanged at 3.4 percent, remains well below the national average of 4.7 percent. In the last 12 months, Idaho's non-farm payrolls increased by 5.2 percent, tying it for tops in the nation, and the workforce has added 31,600 jobs during that time. 
   "These job numbers are truly remarkable, and I'm pleased that Congress recently extended the tax relief measures that have made this strong economy possible," Craig said. "That being said, I know that there is still room for improvement in some areas. The recent closure of the Kraft plant in Burley and high gas prices illustrate that. I am working in the Senate to boost gas supplies to bring prices down, and my office stands ready to work with the community of Burley to address the challenges ahead. A silver lining for these workers is that the job market is strong at this time. Good quality jobs are being created every day."
   Illustrating that point, the Idaho Department of Commerce and Labor released figures at the end of March showing that "per capita income, the amount of income spread over every man, woman and child in Idaho, rose 4.8 percent during 2005, two-tenths of a percentage point higher than the national increase and twice the rate of Idaho's population growth last year."
