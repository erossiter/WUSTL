IDAHO DELEGATION HOSTS 11TH ANNUAL CONGRESSIONAL AWARD CEREMONY
  Idaho's Congressional Delegation will host the 11th Annual Congressional Award Ceremony, Friday, November 19th, from 5:00-6:30pm at Mountain View High School Auditorium at 2001 South Millenium Way.  
 Idaho's State Constitutional Officers will join the ceremony to distribute the Congressional Medals.
   This year, nearly 130 young Idahoans will be recognized for their achievements in four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and an expedition/exploration activity. Idaho's program leads the nation in the number of medals awarded each year. This year Idaho will have 27 Gold Medalists.
   The Congressional Award Program began as a bipartisan effort in Congress to recognize youth for their accomplishments. President Jimmy Carter signed into law Public Law 96-114 establishing the Congressional Award. Aside from the Congressional Medal of Honor, it is the only award that bears the name of Congress.
   Working with an adult mentor, youths set goals in four program areas: voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and an exploration/expedition activity. Based on the number of hours completed by the participant, they earn the Bronze, Silver, and finally Gold Congressional Award Medal.
   Throughout the past year, the 2004 medalists volunteered in their communities, mentoring children, working with the elderly and Idaho's veterans, and participating in a host of other activities to improve their communities.
