SEN. CRAIG COMMENDS HELEN CHENOWETH-HAGE, HER SERVICE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig offered the following comments on the passing of Helen Chenoweth-Hage: 
   "Helen and I were more than colleagues, we were friends and close political allies. She will be missed for not only her charming personality, but for her dedication to public service and public policy. She was a devoted public servant who was driven by a clearly defined and articulated philosophy. She knew exactly where she stood, and she made sure everyone knew where that was. It is a trait more in Washington should practice, and it was a trait that allowed her to have a profound impact on public policy. "My prayers go out to her family and friends. Please know that she will be dearly missed."
