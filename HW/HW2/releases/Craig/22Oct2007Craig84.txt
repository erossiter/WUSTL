EMERGENCY CONSERVATION RESERVE PROGRAM GRAZING EXTENDED FOR IDAHO COUNTIES
  The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) extended to November 10th the opportunity for ranchers in drought and wildfire impacted Idaho counties to graze livestock on lands enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP). The Idaho Congressional Delegation requested the extension.  
   Counties eligible for the extended emergency grazing are: Adams, Bannock, Bear Lake, Bingham, Bonneville, Camas, Caribou, Cassia, Franklin, Fremont, Oneida, Power, and Washington. Ranchers in these counties still need approval from the local Farm Service Agency. 
   In their October 2nd letter to Acting Secretary of Agriculture Chuck Conner, they said, "Emergency haying and/or grazing. . . allowed many of our ranchers to minimize the inevitable disruption to their operations and cope with the extraordinarily severe conditions." On the news of the extension, the Delegation said, "We are pleased that USDA recognized the emergency created by the drought in parts of Idaho and the value of extending the date. This will provide crucial help to our ranchers while still maintaining the goals of the CRP."
