YELLOWSTONE GRIZZLY BEARS TO BE DELISTED
  Grizzly bears were the topic of discussion today at the Department of the Interior, where it was announced that the Yellowstone population of grizzly bears has recovered to the point where they no longer need special federal protection.  
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Wyoming Sens. Craig Thomas and Mike Enzi in making the announcement today that the bears will be removed from the list of threatened and endangered species. 
   Craig stated, "This is a great day for grizzly bears, those who have worked on their recovery, and the Bush Administration. Progress is being made on recovering species - the goal of the ESA. After all, ideally we wouldn't need an endangered species list because they would all be recovered." 
   Craig took time to emphasize that the Endangered Species Act is in need of reform, "The fact that we are rolling this out with such fanfare underscores what a rarity recovering a species is. It is a testament to the partnerships created in this case, but also a cry for reform of the ESA." 
   The Yellowstone grizzly bears were listed in 1975. Four other populations of grizzly bears in the lower 48, including two in northern Idaho, are not recovered and will remain listed under the ESA. 
   Detailed information on the announcement is available at www.doi.gov. Please contact Senator Craig's office to request pictures from the event.
