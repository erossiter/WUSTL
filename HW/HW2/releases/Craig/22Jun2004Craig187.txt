SEN. CRAIG SECURES MONEY TO PREPARE AIR GUARD FOR NEW MISSION
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig today announced that the Department of Defense (DoD) appropriations bill for FY 2005 includes $2 million for making the Idaho Air National Guard ready to become the permanent carrier for the "SENIOR SCOUT" intelligence mission.  
 Craig is a member of the Appropriations Committee, which wrote the bill. 
   "I'm pleased to announce that a year of diligent work with members of several congressional committees, including the House and Senate Intelligence Committees, resulted in our securing money and support to prepare the Idaho Air National Guard to become the permanent carrier of this high-priority mission," said Craig. 
   "Although no final decision has been made on the permanent carrier, all indications from Air Force leadership point to the fact that Idaho will be the permanent carrier for this national security mission and asset." 
   SENIOR SCOUT is an airborne electronic signals collection platform that is instrumental in performing intelligence and anti-terror missions worldwide. The encapsulated intelligence package, called a shelter, fits into the back of a standard C-130E or C-130H model that has been modified to accommodate the mission. Currently, there are three shelters stationed at the 169th Intelligence Squadron at the Utah Air National Guard in Salt Lake City, Utah. The shelters will remain in Utah, while Idaho's planes and flight crews will likely be the permanent carriers. 
   The SENIOR SCOUT Mission relies solely on the Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard for mission air support. 
   The bill now goes before the full Senate.
