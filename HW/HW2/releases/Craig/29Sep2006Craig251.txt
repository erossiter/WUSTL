SEN. CRAIG VOTES FOR SECURE FENCE BILL, FUNDING
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined 79 of his colleagues this evening to approve the Secure Fence Act.  
   Following the vote, Craig stated, "I have consistently voted for more effective border security, and I continued that tonight. Border security is homeland security. Many of the gains in border security we have seen over the last couple of years are initiatives I spearheaded or supported. 
   "Americans need to realize, though, that true border security will not be in place until we have a workable temporary worker program in place and process the 12 million undocumented workers already in the United States. Creating a process to screen and track those who want to come here legally to work will allow us to steer resources toward catching those who want to do us harm." 
   The Senate also approved the Fiscal Year 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill, which is loaded with border security funding. The bill appropriates $25.58 billion for border and transportation security, including: 
   * 1,500 additional border patrol agents 
  * $1.187 billion for border security fencing, infrastructure, and technology 
  * 2,700 new detention beds 
  * $30 million to enhance worksite enforcement 
  * $183 million for fugitive operations 
  * $137 million for the criminal alien program 
  * $43 million for alternatives to detention 
  * $30 million for infrastructure improvements at detention centers 
   Also included in the Homeland Security bill is language prohibiting the federal government from confiscating or requiring registration of firearms during a natural disaster. Craig cosponsored similar legislation.
