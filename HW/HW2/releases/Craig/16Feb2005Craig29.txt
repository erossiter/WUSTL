SEN. CRAIG PRAISES DEFENSE SECRETARY RUMSFELD AT HEARING
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, addressed Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld in a hearing by the committee today.  
 Rumsfeld appeared before the committee to answer questions regarding President Bush's request for additional funding for the War on Terror. Craig praised Rumsfeld for quickly resolving troop needs in Iraq, such as shortages in vehicle armor. 
   "It is important to pay close attention to budget requests like this, especially when we have Idahoans in harm's way over in Iraq," said Craig. "Congress has a responsibility to make sure our taxpayer dollars are being spent responsibly and effectively, and at the same time, that our men and women in uniform have everything they need to carry out the War on Terror." Craig continued, "There are always unexpected challenges in war time, and Secretary Rumsfeld has shown to be responsive in solving these." 
   President Bush has submitted a supplemental appropriations request of $81.9 billion for FY 2005. A large part of the money will go toward operational costs in Iraq and Afghanistan, such as food, spare parts, and equipment repairs, as well as medical benefits for the troops and an enhanced death benefit for survivors of service members killed while serving our country.
