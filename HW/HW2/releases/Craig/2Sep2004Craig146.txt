SEN. CRAIG COMMENTS ON BUSH'S SPEECH
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, who is attending the Republican National Convention, has the following remarks on President Bush's address this evening: 
   With a very enthusiastic Republican crowd cheering here at our national convention in New York, President George W. Bush outlined his vision for the next four years in both domestic and foreign policy. Truly tonight he met the test, not only of being a visionary president, but one is who strong in his thoughts and his decision making and one who will lead us for the next four years in a way all Americans can respect. Tonight, President George W. Bush became a presidential candidate not just for the Republican Party, but for all America.
