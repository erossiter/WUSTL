APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES PROJECTS FOR NORTH IDAHO
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Interior and Related Agencies and the Agriculture Appropriations bills late yesterday. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Committee, announced that several projects were included for Idaho.  
   Craig said, "Today the Senate takes this year's first step in supporting Idaho's natural resource priorities and their beneficial management - all within a fiscally responsible bill. I'm pleased the Appropriations Committee continues to recognize the importance of our noxious weeds management programs, as well as acknowledging the impact endangered species have on Idaho citizens." 
   Below are projects key to North Idaho in the Interior bill: 
   * Rathdrum Prairie - Spokane Valley Aquifer Study ($500,000): This is the most recent installment in providing for a comprehensive study and model of the Rathdrum Prairie/Spokane Valley Aquifer, which is needed to provide the states of Idaho and Washington with a mutually acceptable understanding of the ground water resource.
   * Burbot Conservation Strategy ($250,000): Since January 2002, the Kootenai Tribe has facilitated a collaborative process to implement this strategy. The draft strategy, crafted by the Tribe with input and advice from the Kootenai Valley Resource Initiative, is in the final stages of development before implementation. The purpose is to establish, implement, and evaluate an innovative recovery strategy for lower Kootenai River burbot, in lieu of formal listing.
   * St. Joe Basin/Mica Creek forest conservation ($4,000,000): This line item maintains an effort in the St. Joe Basin to protect private forest land for future production. This is an ongoing effort with the Potlatch Corporation and the Trust for Public Lands.
   * U of I Mica Creek Collaborative Working Forests Project ($350,000): Progress toward sustainable Western economies and forestlands depends upon a better understanding of forest management effects on species dynamics and the flows of water, sediment, and nutrients within forested watersheds. Previous research on the impacts of timber harvest on forest ecosystems has either focused on isolate components of the natural system or analyzed interactions over small forest parcels. This initiative offers great promise for integrating harvest impacts across a diverse array of forest values - improving our Western economies.
   * Idaho's Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds ($500,000): The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) is in its fifth year of implementing the Idaho Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds. Idaho developed the Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds through a collaborative effort involving private landowners, state and federal land managers, state and local governmental entities, and other interested parties. This project provides incentives for the local groups to build local leadership and an integrated program that will outlive the grant program.
   * Idaho Wolf Recovery ($1,200,000): The State of Idaho has begun building its recovery program in partnership with the Nez Perce Tribe. As the transition in authority progresses, the federal government must share the cost of managing this federally established population. This effort will help ensure an accurate accounting of the wolf population in Idaho.
