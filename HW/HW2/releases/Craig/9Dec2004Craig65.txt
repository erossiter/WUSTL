SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO RESIGNATION OF VA SECRETARY, SELECTION OF HIS SUCCESSOR
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, reacted to the resignation of Secretary of the Veterans Administration (VA) and the selection of his successor, Jim Nicholson. Principi, who visited Idaho twice as Secretary of the VA, was a graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy and a decorated Vietnam veteran. He served in the post throughout President Bush's first term in office.  
   "Anthony Principi has been an outstanding leader and a dedicated problem solver on veterans issues," Craig said. "Not only has he visited Idaho several times in his capacity at the VA, he has taken decisive actions to improve veterans health care in Idaho. Under his tenure, the waiting period for medical care and the backlog of disability claims have both been dramatically reduced, and the quality of care has greatly improved. As a veteran himself, Secretary Principi brought great understanding of veterans' issues and the capability to get things done. He and his talents will be missed." 
   Jim Nicholson currently serves as the U.S. Ambassador to the Vatican. He attended the United States Military Academy at West Point, NY, and served eight years as an Army Ranger and paratrooper and 22 years in the Army Reserve, retiring at the rank of colonel. He is a highly decorated Vietnam veteran. 
   Craig also commented on Nicholson, saying "Much like Secretary Principi, I have a very close personal relationship with Jim Nicholson. Because of that friendship, I know he is very well-qualified and will be very effective in the position. President Bush has again chosen a veteran to serve America's veterans, and I look forward to working closely with him in the coming years to continue tackling the challenges facing the VA and Idaho's veterans."
