DELEGATION APPLAUDS ROADLESS AREA PETITION
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo and Idaho Reps. Mike Simpson and C.L. "Butch" Otter commented today on Idaho's petition to the Secretary of Agriculture to develop a roadless area rule for national forests in Idaho: 
   "The Bush Administration asked governors to recommend plans to manage roadless areas in their states because those closest to the land know it best. A one-size-fits-all policy for 60 million acres is simply not the answer. Governors Kempthorne and Risch reached out to a wide array of groups in Idaho, and we expect their plan to represent a compromise capable of resolving the roadless debate in Idaho, so we can focus on the millions of acres of other public land in our state.
   "Unfortunately, today an ill-informed California judge reinstated the Clinton roadless rule and struck down the state petition rule currently in place. She chose a national edict over local input - a choice that will harm our forests and our communities.
   "She also ignored the fact that the Clinton Roadless Rule was over-turned by District Courts in Alaska, Idaho, and Wyoming. In addition, the Tenth Circuit upheld the Wyoming decision and nine major legal challenges to the Clinton Roadless Rule were withdrawn or settled because of the state petition rule.
   "We are clearly disappointed in her decision and urge the Administration to appeal as soon as possible."
