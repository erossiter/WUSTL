IDAHO FUNDS APPROVED BY APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, announced that the Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development and Related Agencies today approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Agriculture appropriations bill.  
 Funding for a number of Idaho projects is included in the bill.
   "The FY 2005 allocation for Agriculture appropriations is $16.7 billion, which is $67 million less than FY 2004," said Craig. "In a time of budget deficits, I am pleased with the fiscal restraint displayed in this bill. Having said that, in such a competitive environment, I am happy to be able to maintain or increase funding for priority agriculture projects in Idaho."
   One of the rare new projects in the bill is $1 million for planning and design for aquaculture development facilities at Billingsley Creek. Projects receiving increased funding include:
   * Cool season food legume research, up $60,000 
   * Aquaculture research involving the University of Idaho, up $250,000 
   * Sugarbeet research in Kimberly, ID, up $150,000 
   * Solutions to Environmental and Economic Problems (STEEP), up $26,000
   Programs continuing at current funding levels include:
   * High-tech research on improving safety and shelf-life of Idaho commodities 
   * Nez Perce Bio-Control Center for Biological Control of Weeds Implementation, Monitoring and Education 
   * Idaho One-Plan 
   * Greater Yellowstone Interagency Brucellosis Committee for Brucellosis Eradication
