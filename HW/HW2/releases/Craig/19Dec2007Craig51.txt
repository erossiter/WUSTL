PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNS ENERGY BILL
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig praised the enactment today of a streamlined energy bill that encourages renewable fuels and higher automobile efficiency (CAFE) standards. Craig introduced both provisions earlier this year in with Sen. Byron Dorgan, D-S.D., in the bipartisan Security and Fuel Efficiency (SAFE) Energy Act.  
   Craig, who attended the signing ceremony with the President and other members of Congress, said that, "producing biofuels at home and improving the efficiency of our cars and homes not only reduces our dependence on foreign oil, but also dramatically reduces our greenhouse gas emissions. 
   "This bipartisan energy bill takes over where the 2005 Energy Bill left off, and is the most significant energy efficiency and conservation bill in this nation' history. The U.S. leads the world in efficiency and clean energy production, and we continue to see that the rest of the world is eager to follow our lead. In 2005 we put clean nuclear power back in the game, in 2007 we reduced our use while producing more fuels on our farms, and 2008 I believe we can reduce our dependence further by producing more of our hydrocarbons at home as well. Energy independencewhat it takes and what it means to the American public - will be my focus during all of my last year in office." 
   More information on the bill and the SAFE Energy Act, introduced by Craig and Senator Dorgan, is available on his Energy Resources Issue Brief.
