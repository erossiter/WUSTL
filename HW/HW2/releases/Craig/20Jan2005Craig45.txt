SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S INAUGURAL SPEECH
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined his fellow Americans today at the Inauguration of our 43rd President, George W. Bush.  
   After listening to the speech, Craig had the following reaction, "The President outlined his bold vision for America. It is a vision of personal freedom and prosperity - a vision of an America that offers opportunity to all who take the initiative and responsibility. 
   "The President's initiatives, from Social Security to spending reductions to immigration, will be difficult, but he made it clear he has political capital and is prepared to spend it. He is a President who wants to enact, not react, a President who will work across the aisle, but not at the expense of the principles America voted for."
