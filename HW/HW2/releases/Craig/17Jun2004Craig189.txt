SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced unanimous approval by the Senate Appropriations Committee of its first appropriations bill for the upcoming fiscal year - the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "This bill continues and builds upon the commitment of this President and this Congress to safeguard Americans at home, work, and travel; to better secure our borders; and to protect our country from terrorist threats," said Craig. 
   Overall, the bill includes a nearly 10 percent increase from current-year appropriations, almost the only area in addition to national defense that will see actual growth in the federal budget. 
   Some of the major programs included in the $33 billion bill include: 
   * Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for border security and enforcing the laws for legal entry of persons and goods into the United States 
   * Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, charged with enforcement of immigration laws and deportations 
   * Transportation Security Administration 
   * Coast Guard 
   * Disaster relief and emergency preparedness 
   * Information analysis and infrastructure protection 
   * Science and technology development 
   * Continued state and local formula grants, including local law enforcement terrorism prevention 
   Craig is a member of both the full Committee and the Homeland Security Subcommittee that crafted the bill. The bill now goes to the full Senate for its consideration.
