ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT REFORM INTRODUCED
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined Wyoming Senator Craig Thomas today in introducing a comprehensive reform to the Endangered Species Act (ESA). The bill is entitled the Endangered Species Reform Act of 2007.  
   Craig underscored the need for the legislation, "The ESA is plagued with problems ranging from the listing process to the recovery process to the delisting process. It has evolved to have more control over natural resource policy and management than was originally intended. As a result, all activities - from recreation to industry use the States' ability to manage wildlife - are severely hampered by the restrictive nature of the ESA. 
   "We need comprehensive reform to the ESA - it will be better for our environment, our resources, and the people who enjoy them." 
   The Endangered Species Reform Act takes the following steps toward reform: 
   * Improve the listing process by: requiring adequate science that is field tested and peer reviewed; require the Secretary to verify that sufficient biological data exists to support recovery planning; and set minimum requirements for a list petition. 
   * Improve states' involvement in the listing and recovery process. 
   * Improve recovery by mandating that a recovery plan be published at the time a species is listed. 
   * Improve delisting by mandating that a species be delisted when recovery criteria are met. 
   Senators Craig and Thomas both serve on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which has jurisdiction over the Endangered Species Act. Joining the Senators as original cosponsors are Senators Hagel, R-Neb., Enzi, R-Wyo, and Allard, R-Colo.
