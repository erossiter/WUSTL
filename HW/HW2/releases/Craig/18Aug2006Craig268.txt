SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE FROM POCATELLO
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig named Emily Scarborough of Pocatello to be a page in the United States Senate for the Fall 2006 term. She is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Fall Senate Page Program.  
   Emily will be a junior at Highland High School in Pocatello. She maintains excellent academics while serving on the Mayor's Pocatello Youth Forum and as Historian of the National Honors Society at Highland and playing junior-varsity volleyball where she is captain. 
   "Emily will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships she will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime." 
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the Senate Chambers for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk. 
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be sixteen years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. More information and an application are available on Senator Craig's Page Appointments page.
