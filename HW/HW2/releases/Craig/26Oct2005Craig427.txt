PRESIDENT SIGNS CRAIG BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig attended the signing ceremony at the White House today for S.397, the Protection of the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, which he authored. S.397 protects law-abiding firearms manufacturers and dealers from being sued for the criminal actions of a third party.  
 The House of Representatives approved the bill last week. 
   "It was very rewarding to be at the White House and see the President sign legislation that will protect our Second Amendment rights," Craig said. "Firearms dealers and manufacturers who follow the law will no longer be threatened by activist lawyers who seek to advance their radical, anti-Second Amendment agenda through the courts, rather than the democratic legislative process."
