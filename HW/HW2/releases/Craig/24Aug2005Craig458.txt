SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO PRESIDENT'S SPEECH
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig had the following reaction following President Bush's speech in Nampa, Idaho:  
   "First of all, I am so pleased that President Bush was able to spend some quality time in Idaho. I know the folks at Tamarack and the residents of Valley County treated the President and First Lady like family. They left knowing why we all love Idaho so much and the importance of managing public lands for multiple uses. 
   "At the Idaho Center, the President delivered one of his most powerful speeches. Idahoans captured first-hand his passion for conquering terrorism and establishing democracy and freedom around the world. 
   "I appreciate him spending some of his vacation in Idaho and speaking to Idaho families who are making sacrifices to expand democracy and fight terrorism. It is a mission worth tackling."
