SENATE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS BODMAN
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing today on the confirmation of Samuel Bodman to be the Secretary of Energy.  
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Committee, participated in the hearing. 
   During the hearing, Senator Craig explored the nominee's views on a number of DOE-related issues, including nuclear research, climate change, energy, and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL). Asked about the need for a full scale demonstration of an advanced nuclear reactor at the INL, Bodman stated that the project "makes sense" and would have his support. Further, Bodman expressed his commitment to acquaint himself more directly with Idaho's settlement agreement and to honor this agreement, which lays out DOE's obligations to the people of Idaho for the cleanup of nuclear waste in the state. 
   "I was first impressed with Dr. Bodman's work as Deputy Secretary at the Commerce Department, where he brought organization to the federal government's climate science programs. His efforts in that regard have placed the United States in a much stronger position on the issue. Similarly, Sam strikes me as the kind of Secretary of Energy who will aim to leave DOE even stronger than he found it. By his own admission, he is detail and action oriented. DOE and its national labs are going to be well served by Dr. Bodman, and I look forward to his rapid confirmation." 
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee has scheduled a vote on the nomination of Dr. Bodman for Wednesday, January 26th. He is expected to be voted out of the committee with strong bipartisan support.
