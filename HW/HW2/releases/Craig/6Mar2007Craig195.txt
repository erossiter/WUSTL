SEN. CRAIG INTRODUCES ONE-YEAR EXTENSION OF COUNTY PAYMENTS LAW
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig introduced legislation today to extend the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act by one year. Commonly known as the Craig-Wyden bill, the Act provides a safety net for payments to timber dependent counties and schools and a collaborative process for resource advisory committees to direct some of that safety net payment to local projects on the forests.  
   Craig lauded the accomplishments of the Act over the past six years as "positive and substantial." He continued, "This law should be extended so it can continue to benefit the forest counties and their schools, and contribute to improving the health of our public lands." 
   Craig emphasized that he continues to work with other Senators on a comprehensive reauthorization, but that this one-year extension may be needed in the meantime, "I do not feel the schools and counties should become victims while we in Congress negotiate a path forward." 
   Recognizing that it will be difficult to get the Senate to consider this on its own, he is working to, "include it in any legislation that is being considered by the Senate." 
   Craig serves as the Ranking Member of the Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee.
