SENS. CRAIG, DORGAN AMENDMENT HELPS IDAHO AGGRICULTURE PRODUCERS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised the approval of the Craig-Dorgan amendment as part of the Agriculture Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2005, which was approved by the full Appropriations Committee late last night.  
 The amendment would create a general license for agriculture producers to travel to Cuba. Sen. Craig is a member of the Appropriations Commitee. 
   Currently, agriculture producers must wait for the Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) to approve thousands of travel requests before they may return to Cuba to finalize trade agreements that were negotiated on previous trips to the island. In the past four years, Cuba has purchased over $500 million in U.S. agriculture goods. 
   "Because of the recent tightening of restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba, our agriculture producers have been shoved to the bottom of the list at OFAC while trying to acquire licenses to legally travel, sell their goods, and finalize their ongoing contracts with Cuban entities," Craig said. 
   He continued, "Idaho agriculture producers have a contract with Cuba to sell $10-12 million in Idaho goods, and this general license will ease the burden as they continue to sell their goods in this growing market. Anything less will not be in the spirit of the law that the Senate and Congress passed in 2000 which authorized the legal sales of agriculture goods to Cuba." 
   The bill now goes before the full Senate.
