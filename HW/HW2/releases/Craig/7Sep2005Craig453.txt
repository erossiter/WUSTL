SEN. CRAIG: INCLUDE COMBAT PAY IN IRAS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig agreed today to cosponsor legislation to include combat pay when determining an allowable contribution to an individual retirement plan, such as Roth IRAs.  
 The bill, S.601, would directly benefit soldiers serving in combat zones and their families. 
   While serving in combat zones, soldiers receive extra combat pay, which is tax-free. However, under current law, tax-free income cannot be included in the formula that determines how much workers may contribute to their individual retirement plans. 
   "Soldiers serving in combat zones, like the men and women of Idaho's 116th Cavalry Brigade in Iraq, ought to be able to put away a little of their combat pay for retirement. It's only fair," Craig said. "Congress should always look for ways to encourage Americans to save and prepare for the future. This is just one, small way we can express our gratitude and make sure our soldiers are well-cared for when the day comes to retire."
