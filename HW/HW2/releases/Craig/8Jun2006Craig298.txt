SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS DEATH TAX REPEAL
  While the Senate failed to stop a filibuster of the repeal of the death tax today, Idaho Senator Larry Craig supported the measure along with his colleague, Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo. The Senate fell 3 votes short of the 60 required to end the Democrat-led filibuster. 
   "There is no reasonable basis in philosophy, economics, or simple fairness for imposing a tax for no other reason than a person's death, regardless of how much that person owned. With such a burden, what incentive is there for people to work hard, create jobs, implement new ideas, save, and invest, if they know the government - not their family or other designated heirs, such as a church or favorite charity - will benefit from what they have accomplished?
   "The repeal of this double-tax in 2001 has helped our economy. However, its full effects won't be noticed until we make it permanent. I am disappointed in today's vote. Fortunately, Republicans will continue to push this until we win."
   The bill the Senate voted on, H.R. 8, makes permanent the repeal of the death tax that is part of the tax cuts enacted in 2001. The House passed the bill in April 2005.
