CONGRESS POISED TO APPROVE DEFENSE PROJECTS, CUT SPENDING
  Earlier today the House approved the Fiscal Year 2006 Defense Appropriations bill. The Senate is poised to take up the measure this week. The bill also includes a government-wide (excluding veterans) 1% reduction in discretionary spending and a provision authorizing oil drilling in the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge. 
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Representative Mike Simpson, both members of their respective Appropriations Committees, support the bill.  
   "The projects included in this bill are a testament to the vital contribution Idahoans make to the security of our nation," said Congressman Simpson. "We can all be proud of the work that's being conducted across our state to better equip our troops, bring innovative new technologies to the battlefield, and expand Idaho's high-tech industry." 
   Craig echoed Simpson's sentiments, "The research, development and training in these projects will help keep our men and women in uniform on the cutting edge of technology and safety. With Idaho's help, they will remain the best-equipped, best-trained forces in the world." 
   In addition to the spending cut and ANWR provisions, Craig and Simpson highlighted the following projects in Idaho: 
   * Read Out Integrated Circuits ($2.4 million) - This initiative seeks to improve the manufacture of read out integrated circuit (ROIC) semiconductors, which is vital to the development of the new Joint Strike Fighter. AMI Semiconductor of Idaho is nationally preeminent in this technology. The Air Force is expected to continue working with AMI on this project. 
   * Medical Modeling and Simulation Through Synthetic Genes ($1 million) - This initiative continues research and development on ways to provide a risk-free, realistic learning environment for medical skills training, from buddy aid to trauma surgery procedures, using high fidelity modeling. The Army is expected to continue working with Crowley-Davis Research on this project. 
   * Rural Electronic Medical Record (EMR)/Teleradiology System ($1.2 million) - This project would upgrade the current teleradiology and EMR technologies at St. Alphonsus to allow the continuation of these services to rural areas. 
   * Smart Prosthetic Device Technology at ISU ($1 million) - The goal of this project is to research, develop, and demonstrate a "smart" prosthetic device that provides people who are missing limbs - whether they are veterans with combat injuries or non-veterans with other injuries - the ability to have natural/human-like motions using synergy of myology, signal processing, robotics, control, and micro-technology. 
   * Advanced Lead Acid Battery Development for Military Vehicles at UI ($1 million) - The University of Idaho has a renowned history in battery development, and is a logical partner in the research and design of increasingly superior batteries for our military. 
   * Advanced Microwave Ferrite Research at UI ($1.5 million) - Critical to point-to-point communication and RADAR systems are the class of microwave devices that employ ferrite materials. Incorporating these into smaller and more portable microwave communication devices is an important research thrust of the military. 
   * Quiet High Speed Propulsion ($4.8 million) - This will fund ongoing research and development at Bayview of quiet hull and propulsion designs for the next generation of naval vessels, including the SeaJet model of the DDX destroyer. 
   * Research of frequency selective surfaces and thermal signatures at INL ($2.4 million) - There is a constantly growing demand to provide technologies for signature reduction to mask military assets from adversarial surveillance and monitoring. The INL is demonstrating the use of frequency selective surface (FSS) treatments to reduce or alter the infrared (IR) thermal signatures of critical "assets." This request provides funding to continue the research and engineering necessary to develop, manufacture, test, and demonstrate full-scale FSS prototypes. 
   * Advanced Materials Disposition for Semiconductor Nanostructures at UI ($1 million) - Supports critical research and testing to incorporate these technologies into the manufacturing process for semiconductor products like computer chips and sensors. 
   * Magnetic Random Access Memory (MRAM) Communication Materials at UI ($1 million) -This ongoing research will combine MRAM cells, which are intrinsically radiation-hard, with radiation-tolerant microelectronics, leading to low-power, nonvolatile memories that function in space. 
   * System Approach to Radiation Hardened Electronics ($2.4 million) - Consistent, reliable performance of integrated circuitry used in space-deployed communication, surveillance, and guidance systems is a persistent problem for the military services. The Air Force is pursuing technologies and techniques that will ensure a ready, economical, domestic capability for producing radiation hardened circuitry using the most advanced commercial processes. SHARE has been identified by the Air Force as a critical capability that will facilitate collaboration among commercial circuit designers, simulation software vendors, and fabrication facilities. The Air Force is expected to continue working with American Semiconductor, Inc. on this project. 
   * DNA Safeguard Project at BSU ($1 million) - Funds will be used to conduct research and development on the DNA safeguard marker. This marker is a DNA-based label that will be included in sample collection vessels used in DNA collection. The marker will assure the public that the blood or cheek samples they provide cannot be planted or accidentally contaminate evidence. 
   * Research on a Molecular Approach to Hazardous Materials Decontamination ($1 million) - This fundamental research is needed to formulate a new generation of decontamination solutions that will be faster, more efficient, versatile, stable, environmentally friendly, and easy to use, as well as effective against the threats of today and unknown, future threats. The Department of Defense is expected to continue working with Boise Technology, Inc. on this project. 
   * Characterization, Reliability and Applications of 3-D Microstructures at BSU ($1.8 million) - This is part of a multi-year funding effort. BSU is developing layered microchips, which will allow chip designers and manufacturers to pack increasingly more electronics into the same footprint. Much like a city will build taller buildings to put more in less space, this approach seeks to layer chips - a technology still very much under development. 
   * Small Accelerators and Detection Systems at ISU ($1.5 million) - The Idaho Accelerator Center at Idaho State University will continue to develop portable, high-intensity, radiation producing accelerators that can be used to destroy a wide variety of chemical and biological agents. Idaho State University would use its state-of-the-art pulsed electron accelerator to research and develop radiation-producing, high-dose rate accelerators capable of destroying chemical and biological agents without harming nearby materials, people, or facilities. 
   * Remediation of Environments Contaminated by Ammonium Perchlorate at UI ($1 million) - This project will characterize at the molecular level the microbial populations most successful and efficient at promoting the degradation of perchlorate to innocuous products. 
   * Advanced Unmanned Vehicle System Development at INL ($4.2 million) - Utilizing the assets of INL, this proposal would develop, test, and evaluate an integrated unmanned protection system in support of transport security missions. 
   * Vacuum Sampling Pathogen Collection and Concentration ($1.5 million) - Microbial-Vac Systems, Inc. (MSI), is working with the Department of Defense to develop the Microbial-Vac (M-Vac), a new safer wet or dry vacuum pathogen location tool designed for first responder, environmental safety, and food safety personnel to confidently collect food (E.coli), environmental (Anthrax) bio-threat, and other surface pathogens for more accurate and timely lab analysis and counter-response decisions. 
   * Critical Infrastructure Test Range at INL ($6 million) - Funds will be used to upgrade and apply capabilities at the INL Critical Infrastructure Test Range to support Department of Defense critical infrastructure requirements. 
   * Explosive Detection and Mitigation at INL ($2.8 million) - Funds will be used to conduct research, development, prototyping, testing, demonstration, and evaluation of advanced technologies to detect and mitigate hidden explosives associated with suicide bombers, cargo containers, vehicles, and improvised explosive devices (IEDs). 
   * Information Therapy Program ($1.5 million) - The Department of Defense has a history of transforming health care delivery by using eHealth technologies, recognizing the value of on-demand computerized patient information to enhance patient safety and deliver quality health care. The Information Therapy Program will develop patient "information prescriptions" so patients are able to answer key questions that support decisions in their health care process. The Department of Defense is expected to work with Healthwise, Inc. on this project. 
   * Credibility Assessment Research Initiative at BSU ($1.05 million) - BSU will work with community and organizational psychologists to develop methods for education and integration of new automated credibility assessment into the workplace that would improve attitudes toward periodic testing of federal employees with access to our nation's secrets. 
   As members of their respective Appropriations Committees, Senator Craig and Idaho Representative Mike Simpson cooperate to ensure federal spending is restrained, tax dollars are appropriately spent, and that high-priority Idaho projects are included.
