SEN. CRAIG ACCEPTING PAGE APPLICATIONS FROM IDAHO STUDENTS FOR SPRING 2006 TERM
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig is currently seeking page applications from Idaho students for the Spring 2006 term. The deadline for applications is November 1, 2005. Because of his seniority, Craig is allowed to appoint one high school student from the State of Idaho each term to serve as a page on the U.S. Senate floor.  
   "The Senate Page program offers high school students the opportunity to work side by side with U.S. Senators. Pages also live, study and work with fellow students from all across the country. They gain valuable experience and have a chance to be directly involved in the government," said Craig. 
   Page eligibility is limited to those who are currently juniors in high school or will be juniors next school year, and who will be 16 or 17 years old on or before the date of appointment. Pages are an important element in the daily proceedings of the United States Senate. Their duties consist primarily of delivering correspondence and legislative material to congressional offices, taking messages, preparing the Chambers for sessions, and carrying bills and amendments to the Senators' desks. 
   Applications and more information about the page program are available at any of Craig's six regional offices in Coeur d'Alene, Lewiston, Boise, Twin Falls, Pocatello, and Idaho Falls, or on his website's Page Program section. A link to the page application can be found on the left-hand side of his homepage. Completed applications should be sent via mail or fax to Craig's office in Pocatello. Applications should be directed to:
