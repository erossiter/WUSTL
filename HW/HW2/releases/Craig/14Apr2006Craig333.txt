MIKE TRACY TO LEAVE SEN. CRAIG'S OFFICE
  After serving as Idaho Sen. Larry Craig's Communications Director for nearly ten years, Mike Tracy announced that he will be leaving to join an advertising/public relations firm in Boise. 
   Tracy reflected on his time working for Craig, "It has been an honor to work with Senator Craig over the last decade. Idaho is fortunate to have such an honest, hardworking public servant watching out for the best interests of Idahoans. As he has been for many years, I know he will continue to be a great leader for the Gem State. I am truly grateful that he allowed me the opportunity to be a part of such a great team."
   Craig thanked Tracy for his service, "Mike has been an invaluable asset to me and the people of Idaho. He provided tremendous experience, enthusiasm, and good humor, and we will miss having him around every day."
   On April 7, 2006, Craig publicly thanked Tracy on the floor of the United States Senate. During the speech, he said, "His tenacity is legendary. When he heads into a battle with me, Mike is always out on the front line with the flag flying high. He is a man who loves America and is not afraid to let people know it. When you are around Mike, you cannot help but be boosted by this man's passion."
   Mike's last day of work in the Craig office is today, April 14, 2006.
   Replacing Mike Tracy as Communications Director is Dan Whiting. Whiting has worked for Craig for just-shy of nine years in a variety of functions. He will be based in D.C., where he currently lives and works. He received a B.S. in Human Resource Management from the University of Idaho and an M.A. in Entrepreneurship from Regent University. While he grew up primarily in Idaho Falls, he considers Coeur d'Alene home now.
