SEN. CRAIG COMMENDS EARLY TRANSFER OF POWER IN IRAQ
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig commented on the transfer of power from the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) to the Iraqi Transitional Government, two days ahead of schedule.  
 Craig said the early transition of power will strengthen the hand of the United States as President Bush seeks to broaden NATO involvement in Iraq.
   "This historic event marks the rebirth of Iraq as a sovereign nation," said Craig. "Once again the action taken by the Bush Administration shows the nimbleness and ability to adjust to the challenges presented during a difficult time. The new Iraqi leader, Iyad Allawi, made a strong statement against terrorism and thanked America for the freedom his countrymen now enjoy. The timing was excellent as President Bush was in Turkey gaining support from NATO to take a more formal role in working to bring stability to Iraq."
   U.S. forces will continue to provide security in Iraq until the new Iraqi army and police forces are capable of taking on that responsibility. In a statement earlier today, NATO leaders expressed support of the transfer.
   Craig praised President Bush's efforts, noting that in the three years since terrorists attacked the United States, President Bush has liberated two countries, crushed the Taliban, crippled al-Qaida, put nuclear inspectors in Libya, Iran and North Korea without firing a shot, and captured a dictator who slaughtered more than 500,000 of his own people. Bush did all this abroad while not allowing another terrorist attack at home.
