IDAHO DELEGATION REACTS TO RUPERT KRAFT FACILITY CLOSING
  The Idaho Congressional Delegation issued the following reaction to the announcement by Kraft Foods Inc. to close its Rupert manufacturing facility in January 2007: 
   "We were shocked and disappointed to learn today of the Kraft plant closing in Rupert. Our initial thoughts and concerns are with the community of Rupert and the men, women, and families who will be affected by this decision. While we cannot fully appreciate the impact this decision is having on the people of Rupert, we are committed to working with Kraft employees and community leaders to identify ways in which the federal government, and our offices, might be of assistance over the coming weeks and months. We are intent on helping Rupert and its citizens through this transition and bringing new economic opportunities to the area."
