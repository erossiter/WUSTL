IDAHO LAND EXCHANGE APPROVED BY SENATE COMMITTEE
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today praised the Committee's approval of S. 1802, the Idaho Wilderness Boundary Modification Act of 2007, by unanimous consent. 
   S. 1802 would exchange land between the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness and the Diamond D Ranch north of Stanley, Idaho. Approximately ten acres would be retracted from the wilderness boundary and ten acres added to it from a nearby location. Senator Craig introduced the bill in July.
   "Everybody wins in this situation," Craig said. "The Diamond D Ranch would stop paying fees to use land it has been working since before wilderness was designated, and the U.S. Forest Service would save taxpayer money and valuable time completing paperwork. We have several similar cases going on across our state that ought to be cleaned up to help the efficiency of the Forest Service, protect the land rights of Idahoans and retain wilderness integrity."
   The Diamond D Ranch is a hunting and fishing guest ranch nestled next to the Frank Church River of No Return Wilderness. This land exchange results in no-net-loss of designated wilderness land.
