BSU CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT APPROVED BY SENATE
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill today.  
 Several projects were included for Idaho, including $900,000 for the Center for Environmental Science and Economic Development at Boise State University (BSU).
   The Center is designed to mitigate the impact of oppressive federal land policies on Idahoans. It will focus on constructing economic development strategies to diversify Idaho's economy and workforce. The Center will focus its efforts on opportunities in information technology, environmental finance, and physical sciences, among other areas.
   "Idaho needs to continue its drive toward a diverse economic base that can withstand economic fluctuations. This Center is an important component of that diversification," said Senator Craig.
   This is the third year of funding for this project. Private matching funds are also being raised by BSU. This bill now goes before the full Senate for consideration.
