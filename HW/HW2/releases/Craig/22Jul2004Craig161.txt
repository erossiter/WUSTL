BUSH SIGNS CONCEALED-CARRY LEGISLATION ALLOWING OFF-DUTY, RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO CARRY CONCEALED FIREARMS
  President Bush signed the Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act today.  
 Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, an original cosponsor of the bill, joined the President at the bill signing.
   "The President's actions today will save lives," said Craig. "Law enforcement officers, including retirees, need to protect themselves and their families. They have spent a career putting their lives on the line to protect us, and, because of the nature of their work, many need protection - including when they travel outside their home cities or states.
   "In addition, allowing off-duty law enforcement officers to carry firearms effectively increases the number of trained citizens protecting us, at no cost to the taxpayer.
   "Overall, this legislation underscores an important fact - allowing law-abiding citizens to carry concealed weapons reduces crime."
   Now that this bill is law, members of law enforcement, including qualified retirees, will be able to carry concealed weapons in any state. The legislation passed the Senate unanimously on July 7, 2004 and the Senate version was cosponsored by 71 Senators.
