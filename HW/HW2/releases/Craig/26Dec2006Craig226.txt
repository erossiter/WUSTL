SEN. CRAIG COMMENDS FORD'S SERVICE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig offered the following comments on the passing of former President Gerald Ford: 
   "Gerald Ford helped guide our country through a difficult time by taking hold of the reins of a presidency in shambles. His new direction brought honesty and integrity back to the White House.
   "I hope as we take this opportunity to reflect on his life and his service to the United States, we realize the sacrifices he made as a public servant - sacrifices that enabled him to help make our country a better place to live."
