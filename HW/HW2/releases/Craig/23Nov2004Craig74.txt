CONGRESS APPROVES PROJECTS FOR NORTH IDAHO
  The Conference Report for the Omnibus Appropriations bill which passed both houses of Congress Saturday included dozens of important Idaho projects. The state is represented by two members on the Congressional Appropriations Committees that wrote the bill - Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson. They, along with Sen. Mike Crapo and Rep. C.L. "Butch" Otter, all worked on the projects as a united Idaho Delegation, and praised the bill's support for the projects. 
   The Omnibus legislation includes virtually all discretionary federal spending for Fiscal Year 2005, except for defense and homeland security spending. To keep the bill fiscally responsible, Congressional leaders and the President agreed to essentially freeze spending, overall, at the same level as that for 2004. Included in the Omnibus were several projects important to North Idaho, including, but not limited to:
   * Technology to Improve Safety and Shelf-Life of Idaho Agricultural Commodities - $829,000 
  * Idaho One-Plan - A unique collaboration to assist Idaho farmers and ranchers in their natural resource stewardship responsibilities - $200,000 
  * Grass Seed Cropping for Sustainable Agriculture Research, University of Idaho - $407,000 
  * Idaho's Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds - $1,000,000 
  * Burbot Conservation Strategy - $150,000 
  * St. Joe Basin/Mica Creek forest conservation easements - $3,000,000 
  * University of Idaho Mica Creek Collaborative Working Forests Project - $250,000 
  *Spokane Valley - Rathdrum Prairie Aquifer - $2,150,000 ($500,000 from Interior appropriations, $1,650,000 from VA-HUD and Independent Agencies appropriations) 
  * Legislative authority for the Forest Service to purchase the General Services Administration building in Sandpoint 
  * Continue Idaho participation in the Criminal Information Sharing Alliance Network - $750,000 
  * Rural Idaho Water Projects (Including Bonner's Ferry, Spirit Lake, and Coolin) - $3,750,000 
  * Upgrade US-95 from Worley to Mica - $3,000,000 
  * Upgrade US-95, Mile Post 536 to the Canadian Border - $1,500,000 
  * Dover Bridge in Bonner County - $1,500,000 
  * Transportation technology for Variable Dynamic Message Signs and real-time incident reporting - $2,250,000 
  * North Idaho Rural Health Consortium - Telemedicine - $500,000 
  * Caring Foundation for Children, to implement a program of enrolling low-income children in underserved, rural areas, in dental care (Idaho and Utah) - $300,000 
  * Development of radiation-tolerant ultra-low-power electronics (University of Idaho) - $1,000,000
   This Wednesday, the House of Representatives is expected to clear the final version of the bill, which differs slightly from the version approved on Saturday. The President is expected to sign the legislation into law after Congress worked to meet his demands for fiscal responsibility.
