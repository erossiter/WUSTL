SENS. CRAIG, CRAPO APPLAUD JUDGE SMITH NOMINATION
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo reacted positively to today's announcement by the President that he nominated Randy Smith, an Idaho State District Judge, to serve on the Ninth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals.  
   Craig and Crapo made the following statement, "Randy is an accomplished lawyer and judge. His service on the bench in Idaho has earned him a reputation of being fair, honest, and one who seeks resolution. He also understands that judges interpret law, they don't create it. He will serve the country well. In addition, we are pleased that the President recognized this seat should be filled by an Idahoan and will work with the President and Randy to ensure he receives full, fair, and timely consideration by the Senate." 
   Craig and Crapo also emphasized they will continue to work to ensure William G. Myers III, another Idahoan awaiting confirmation to the Ninth Circuit, receives a fair up-or-down vote from the Senate. He is currently the target of a filibuster but has received a majority vote in the Senate and has twice been approved by the Judiciary Committee.
