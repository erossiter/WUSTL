NAS SCHEDULES IDAHO MEETING ON DOWNWINDERS
  Idaho's Congressional Delegation announced today that the National Academy of Sciences Board on Radiation Effects Research will hold a meeting in Idaho to accept oral testimony from Idahoans.  
 The Board is examining the Radiation Exposure Compensation Program.
   On September 9, 2004, Senators Craig and Crapo and Congressmen Simpson and Otter wrote Isaf Al-Nabulsi, Ph. D., requesting a meeting in Idaho. In the letter, the Delegation stated:
   While the number of written responses is encouraging, in talking with our constituents, we are convinced that an opportunity for the public to give oral testimony, at a location in Idaho, will increase the likelihood that those Idahoans who wish to have their information incorporated in the study will have another format in which to do so. . . This approach both preserves the Board's ongoing efforts and schedule while increasing the official record of Idaho cases. Such a public meeting also would allow the Board to present to Idaho citizens a detailed explanation of the study and its objectives.
   The Board has already received approximately 450 inputs from Idahoans in addition to letters, faxes, and e-mails that have been forwarded by the Delegation from Idahoans.
   The meeting will be held in Boise on November 6th. Boise will accommodate both the large number of anticipated participants coming from around the state as well as the necessary infrastructure for the Board to digitally record the meeting.
