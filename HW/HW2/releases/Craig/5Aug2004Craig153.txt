SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE FOR FALL 2004 TERM
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig named Lindsey Wright of Shelley, Idaho, to be Idaho's U.S. Senate page for the Fall 2004 term.  
 She is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Fall Page Program. 
   Lindsey will be a junior at Shelley High School this coming school year where she is a writer for the school newspaper, a member of the National Honor Society, and maintains a 4.0 GPA. During her "free" time, she is involved with 4-H, Girl Scouts, jazz dancing, drama, and plays the occasional guitar. And, in the event you are a regular at Mick's Home Cooking in Shelley, don't expect Lindsey to wait on you for the next few months.
   "Lindsey will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships she will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime." 
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the House and Senate Chambers for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk. 
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be sixteen years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. In addition, information and an application are available here.
