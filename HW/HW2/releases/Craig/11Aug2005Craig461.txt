DELEGATION APPLAUDS BOGERT AS PICK FOR EPA REGIONAL ADMINISTRATOR
  Idaho's Congressional Delegation applauded the choice of Michael D. Bogert as the Region 10 Administrator for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  
 Region 10 is based in Seattle and covers Idaho, Alaska, Oregon, and Washington. 
   In a December 17, 2004 letter to Dina Powell, Director of the Office of Presidential Personnel, the Delegation said, "Laurence Michael Bogert is wholly qualified by virtue of his education and experience to take on the many challenges of serving as EPA Region 10 Administrator. Further, as a native Idahoan and former counsel to Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne, Michael Bogert is intimately familiar with the natural resource opportunities and challenges of the western states which constitute Region 10. He is sensitive to the need to protect the environmental treasures of the west, while balancing the real life considerations of the citizens of this region and their livelihoods. 
   "In our view, the President could not make a stronger selection for this post than Michael Bogert."
