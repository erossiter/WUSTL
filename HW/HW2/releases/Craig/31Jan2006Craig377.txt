SEN. CRAIG HAILS JUDGE ALITO CONFIRMATION
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised the approval of Judge Samuel Alito today to serve as an associate justice on the United States Supreme Court.  
 Alito was approved by a bipartisan majority of Senators, 58 to 42. 
   "Today we have sent a man to the Supreme Court who is not only an experienced, hardworking and thoughtful judge, but also an outstanding human being," Craig said. "I believe he is exactly the sort of man the Founding Fathers had in mind as they framed the Constitution. Judge Alito's colleagues, from across the political spectrum, have praised him for his honesty, integrity and adherence to the law. 
   "When I met with him, I was impressed by his temperament and character, and his performance before the Judiciary Committee confirmed my assessment. Judge Alito will be a phenomenal Supreme Court justice, and I commend President Bush for nominating him." 
   Yesterday, efforts to filibuster Alito's nomination came up well short, as debate was ended by a strongly bipartisan 72-25 margin.
