SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO SUPREME COURT NOMINEE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig issued the following statement on the nomination of Judge Samuel A. Alito, Jr., to replace the retiring Justice Sandra Day O'Connor on the Supreme Court:  
   "As he has done before, President Bush has made another strong selection in nominating Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. Alito has already been confirmed by the Senate twice, and he has had a very distinguished career in his 15 years on the Third U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. I look forward to meeting with him and learning more about him and his judicial philosophy. 
   "I am very disappointed that some Senators have already announced their opposition to Alito, even though his nomination was announced just hours ago. I hope the rest will give him full and fair consideration, and the up-or-down vote that he deserves."
