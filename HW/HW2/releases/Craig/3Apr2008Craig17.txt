SEN. CRAIG ADVOCATES CLEAN ENERGY TAX CREDIT EXTENSION
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, today joined a bipartisan group of senators in supporting the Clean Energy Tax Stimulus Act of 2008, a bill to extend clean energy tax credits set to expire at year's end. 
   The bipartisan legislation, which was introduced by Senators Maria Cantwell and John Ensign, calls for a one-year extension of the renewable energy production tax credit as well as an additional eight years for the solar energy and fuel cell investment tax credit.
   "Idaho benefits from nearly every provision in this tax cut," Craig said. "From the wind turbines that are popping up throughout the state, to our new geothermal power plant near Raft River, to our solar manufacturing plant in Pocatello, all of Idaho's clean energy projects will benefit."
   "The energy sources promoted in this bill, when coupled with our existing hydroelectric and nuclear facilities, are an essential part of keeping our economy vibrant and competitive," Craig continued. "This bill must be passed by both chambers and signed by the President in the timeliest fashion possible."
   In addition to extending production and solar tax credits, the legislation introduced today authorizes $400 million for Clean Renewable Energy Bonds, and extends tax credits for those who modify or build energy-efficient homes and commercial buildings. The bill also extends credits for energy efficient appliances such as dishwashers and refrigerators.
   As a member Board of the Alliance to Save Energy, Craig has been a strong supporter for the extension of clean energy tax credits to achieve a healthier economy, cleaner environment and greater energy security.
