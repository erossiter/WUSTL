SENS. CRAIG, CRAPO, REP. OTTER COMMENT ON SOFTWOOD LUMBER AGREEMENT
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo and Rep. C.L. "Butch" Otter had the following reaction to the United States and Canada reaching an agreement on softwood lumber trade: 
   "This agreement confirms the decision by U.S. officials and the coalition of timber businesses to stand tall in the face of unfair trade practices. This agreement sends the message that we must stay at the bargaining table to negotiate reasonable and fair trade deals.
   "We are hopeful this agreement will stand, and that both the governments and the industries of Canada and the United States will uphold and abide by this settled-upon agreement. We are excited that we can now move forward and work on other challenging issues facing many U.S. industries.
   "We applaud the leadership of the Bush Administration and Prime Minister Harper in coming to terms on a negotiated settlement. Further, the tenacity and skill Ambassador Schwab has demonstrated in recent days is a prelude of great things to come for USTR, the United States, and our domestic industries."
