SENATE COMMITTEE SAYS 'GO' TO IDAHO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  A number of transportation projects critical to Idaho received approval from the full Senate Appropriations Committee today. Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the committee, expressed concern about the overall funding level reflected in the Democrats' budget this year.  
   "In my years on the committee, I've adopted a rigorous screening process for requests to make sure that taxpayer dollars are spent responsibly, and I think it has worked well," Craig said. "All of the Idaho projects included here aim to accommodate the rapid growth and other community needs across Idaho. These communities have worked to secure significant matching funds from private or state sources. 
   "I continue to be concerned about the overall level of spending we are dealing with this year," Craig continued. "Congress has the constitutional responsibility to determine funding priorities, and I believe we should exercise that right. I will vouch for every Idaho project I included in the bill, and I will continue to work with my Republican and Democrat colleagues on the committee and President Bush to bring more balance to the process. We need to manage federal spending responsibly as we work to eliminate budget deficits." 
   The Idaho projects included in the bill are: 
   * CSI Student Safety Initiative - $800,000 
   * Mountain Home Community Center Complex - $500,000 
   * City of Rocks Back Country Byway - $5,000,000 
   * Idaho Transit Coalition Capital Improvement Project - $4,520,000 
   * Lewiston Partnership Project - $400,000 
   * I-84 Exit 29 (Franklin Road) - $800,000 
   * Boise Airport Phase I Runway Improvements - $1,250,000 
   * Treasure Valley Transit Facilities - $480,000 
   * Development Workshop/Upper Valley Industries - $500,000 
   * I-84, Curtis Road to Broadway Interchange Widening - $1,500,000 
   * The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
