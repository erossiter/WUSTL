SEN. CRAIG PUSHES LEGACY WASTE REMOVAL OUT OF IDAHO
  Today, Idaho Senator Larry Craig pushed the removal of legacy defense nuclear waste from the State of Idaho, during a hearing by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. Edward Sproat, Director of DOE's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, testified at the oversight hearing on the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository, agreeing with the approach outlined in the Domenici-Craig NU-WAY Bill that would treat legacy defense waste differently from commercial spent nuclear fuel.  
   Craig stated, "Idaho is currently home to over 300 metric tons of defense-related spent nuclear material, and we have over 4000 metric tons of high level waste. Earlier this year Senator Domenici and I introduced the NU-WAY Bill allowing for the safe interim storage of this non-recyclable waste at the Yucca Mountain site. Now it's time to move this mission to its rightful burial place." 
   Senator Craig went on to push the environmental benefits of nuclear power generation. The Senator highlighted the ability of nuclear power to avoid significant carbon dioxide emissions when generating electricity, as compared to emissions generated by coal fired plants. The Senator made it clear that Idahoans have rallied against coal and would favor new nuclear power generation. 
   Craig emphasized, "A vote against Yucca Mountain is a vote against nuclear power and a vote against the environment. People need to decide if they are either anti-nuclear or pro-environment; it's now clear you cannot be both."
