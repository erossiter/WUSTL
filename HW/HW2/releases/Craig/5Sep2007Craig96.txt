SEN. CRAIG'S COUNSEL URGES ETHICS TO CLOSE INVESTIGATION
  Stanley Brand, legal counsel for Idaho Senator Larry Craig, delivered a letter on Craig's behalf to the Senate Ethics Committee today.  
   "The letter points out that there is no precedent - in more than 220 years - for the Ethics Committee to assert jurisdiction over my case in Minneapolis," Craig said. "It is my hope that the committee will agree, and we have strong reason to believe they will. To continue this investigation would open a whole can of worms for the entire Senate, for years to come."
