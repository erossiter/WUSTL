BUSH RENOMINATES BOISE RESIDENT MYERS FOR NINTH CIRCUIT
  Boise resident William G. Myers received a Valentine's Day present from President Bush.  
 Myers was nominated today to serve on the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. 
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a supporter of Myers', praised President Bush's nomination, "Nearly two years ago, President Bush made a sound decision in nominating Bill Myers to the Ninth Circuit. Over the years, Bill Myers has impressed me with his professionalism, integrity, and ability. Most important, he knows and respects the law and will not legislate from the bench - a lesson many sitting judges should heed." 
   Myers was first nominated by President Bush on May 15, 2003 and was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on April 1, 2004. His nomination was filibustered by Senate Democrats. While he received a majority vote for confirmation, 53, he failed to garner the 60 votes necessary to overcome the filibuster. 
   Once the 108th Congress adjourned sine die last winter, all nominees not confirmed have to be renominated if the President wants them to be considered again.
