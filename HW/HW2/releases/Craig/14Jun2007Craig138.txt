SEN. CRAIG CELEBRATES FLAG DAY WITH IDAHO STUDENTS, COUNTRY STARS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig celebrated Flag Day today by introducing a resolution in the Senate and attending a performance to honor the National Anthem Project. The project, which is sponsored by the National Association for Music Education, seeks to educate Americans about the national anthem and support school music programs. Craig also attended the National Anthem Project's final tour event at the Washington Monument, where the country music group, The Oak Ridge Boys, performed the anthem.  
   A 2005 Harris Poll indicated that about two-thirds of Americans do not know all the words of the first stanza of our national anthem, "The Star-Spangled Banner." Other polls have indicated that many Americans do not know the name of the national anthem, why it was written, or the author - Francis Scott Key. The Harris Poll found that a majority of those who do know these facts received five years or more of music education. 
   "Aside from being a beautiful song, the Star-Spangled Banner is such an important part of our history and culture as a nation," Craig said. "At the same time, many have never been taught the significance of the song, or even the words. So I'm happy to draw attention today to our school music programs and the efforts of those who have dedicated themselves to this great cause. A greater understanding of The Star-Spangled Banner only strengthens a common bond that brings all Americans closer together." 
   Also taking part in the ceremony at the Washington Monument were The President's Own United States Marine Corps Marching Band, and 5,000 participants from 42 states. Representing Idaho were Hidden Springs Charter School and Snake River High School. 
   Idaho Senator Mike Crapo, Senator Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), and others joined Craig as original cosponsors of the resolution.
