IDAHO NOMINEE SCREENED BY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE
  Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo testified on behalf of Idaho judge Randy Smith as he appeared today before the Senate Judiciary Committee. President Bush nominated Smith to fill a vacancy on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, of which Idaho is a member.  
   "Randy Smith has been a model judge in his time on the bench, and he deserves a promotion," Craig said. "Smith has won praise across the board for his professionalism, courtesy, and judicial demeanor. He is a judge who lets the law, not his politics or his personal beliefs, dictate his actions, and we need more judges like him on the 9th Circuit. I'm very pleased President Bush nominated him." 
   "Judge Smith received a unanimous well-qualified rating from the American Bar Association," Crapo said. "With eight years of teaching business and tax law courses, he has continued to be a teacher and student of the law. There is no question that his background, public service, and stellar reputation make him an excellent choice for the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. I am pleased to support his nomination." 
   Smith currently serves as a state judge in Idaho's Sixth District Court in Pocatello. He previously served as pro tem justice on the Idaho Supreme Court and the Idaho Court of Appeals. He is highly respected across the state as an attorney, jurist, mediator and community member.
