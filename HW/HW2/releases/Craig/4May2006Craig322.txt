GOV. KEMPTHORNE SEES OTHER SIDE OF DAIS
  Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne testified before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee regarding his nomination to serve as Secretary of the Interior. Members of the Committee quizzed him on a variety of issues before the Department, from public land management to Indian trusts to oil and gas development. 
   Idaho Senators Larry Craig and Mike Crapo introduced Kempthorne at the hearing.
   Craig, who serves on the Committee, said, "During today's hearing, Dirk provided an opportunity for the Committee and the public to see what he will bring to the Department. We saw Idaho values, such as appreciation of public land, conservation, and collaboration. Those of us from Idaho have seen Dirk's leadership abilities since he first served as Student Body President at the University of Idaho. His leadership and his values will serve the Department, the President, and all of us well."
   "From his time in the Idaho Department of Lands, as mayor, as senator, and as governor, Dirk has always been recognized from both sides of the aisle for his unique abilities as a leader," Crapo said. "He is a man of many accomplishments and integrity and combines a thorough understanding of policy with the consensus-building abilities required to see the right policies carried out through legislation. These qualities will serve the nation well as he takes on the many challenges facing the Department of the Interior in the 21st Century."
