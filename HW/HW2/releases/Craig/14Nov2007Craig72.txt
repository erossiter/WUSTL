SEN. CRAIG, REP. SIMPSON SECURE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT/TRANSPORTATION FUNDS FOR IDAHO
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson have secured funding for a number of Idaho projects in the Fiscal Year 2008 Transportation-HUD Appropriations bill. The bill was approved by a conference committee to be approved by both the House and Senate and sent to the President for his signature.  
   "Transportation and economic development go hand-in-hand. You can't have one without the other, and these projects represent some of the best efforts in Idaho to give our local communities a boost. I am proud to work on their behalf in the Senate," said Craig. 
   "While I have some concerns with the overall bill, the Idaho projects included in it will help bring economic opportunity and improved roads, bridges and transit to Idaho communities," said Simpson. "These modest investments in Idaho's communities and infrastructure will help assist ongoing state and local efforts to bring new opportunities to our state."
