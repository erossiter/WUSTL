SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES FOUR OF TWELVE ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved four of the twelve annual appropriations bill earlier today. Included in the bills are a number of projects important to Idaho.
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Committee, stressed the importance of the projects within a balanced budget, "As Congress struggles rein in federal spending, we must be vigilant in ensuring Congress approves projects appropriate for federal taxpayer support. Each of these projects meets that test and adds value for taxpayers." 
   Clearing the Committee today were the Fiscal Year 2007 Labor-HHS-Education, Military Construction-Veterans Affairs, Transportation-Treasury-HUD-Judiciary, and Defense Appropriations bills. Below are projects important to Idaho, included by Craig. For more information on any project please contact Craig's office.
