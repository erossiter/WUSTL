SENATE APPROVES EARMARK REFORM
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised today's passage of earmark reform that will make the budget process more open and transparent. The so-called DeMint amendment, named after its primary sponsor, Sen. Jim DeMint (R-SC), was approved 98-0. The amendment requires full disclosure of earmarked spending, allowing taxpayers to see how their tax dollars are being spent. It also requires a list of "critical needs" requests and their sponsors to be published on the Internet.  
   "I was really pleased to support this important change that will bring more sunshine to the budget and appropriations process," Craig said. "In fact, last year, on a voluntary basis, I started posting on my website every critical need I have requested for Idaho and Idaho communities since 1997. I've urged people to go there [http://craig.senate.gov/idinit.cfm] and see for themselves how federal tax dollars are being spent in Idaho. The amendment we approved today will require that kind of openness from all members of Congress, and that's a good thing." 
   The original lobby reform bill only required disclosure of a small fraction of directed spending requests, but the DeMint amendment required disclosure of all directed spending for both federal and non-federal entities. 
   "In November, the voters sent a strong message to Congress that they wanted change," Craig continued. "This measure is an important step to help rebuild the public trust."
