SEN. CRAIG ACCEPTING APPLICATIONS FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig is currently seeking intern applications for the summer term, which runs from May to August. The application deadline is March 15. Sen. Craig offers paid internships within the Washington, D.C., office. Preference is given to Idaho applicants attending Idaho schools who are in their junior or senior years of college (including graduating seniors).  
   "Interns have the chance to be an essential part of a working congressional office," said Craig. "They participate in the legislative process as well as ensure that constituent services run smoothly. For those interested in politics, it is an incredible opportunity to get a behind-the-scenes look at how our government functions while serving the people of Idaho." 
   Interns are paired with staff members based on experience and interests, in order to best utilize their talents. They are also expected to fulfill some administrative duties such as answering phones, sorting mail and greeting constituents. 
   Applications and more information about the internship program are available on Craig's website at http://craig.senate.gov/intern.htm or at any of Craig's six regional offices in Coeur d'Alene, Lewiston, Boise, Twin Falls, Pocatello and Idaho Falls. It is recommended that applications be delivered personally to the regional offices or sent via fax to (202) 228-1067. Applications can also be mailed, but delays are likely due to heightened security measures for Senate mail. Mailed applications should be directed to: Office of Senator Larry Craig
