SENATE APPROVES PROJECTS FOR NORTH IDAHO
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 VA-HUD-Independent Agencies Appropriations bill today. Several projects were included for Idaho, including four north of the Salmon River. 
   "From explorers two hundred years ago to the new frontier of space, these projects represent opportunities for Idaho to continue to grow and expand its economy and our quality of life," said Senator Craig.
   The following projects were included for North Idaho:
   * Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Plan ($1,000,000): This will assist communities and non-profit organizations to prepare for the Bicentennial in a wide diversity of ways including construction or development of informational kiosks, community trails, interpretive signs, improved parking, and other infrastructure improvements related to the Bicentennial. It will also assist existing museums along and adjacent to the Trail.
   * Science and New Technologies Lab, University of Idaho ($900,000): The goal of the Laboratory, to be located in Moscow, is to create new technologies that result in the development of hi-tech businesses which directly contribute to the economies of Latah County and surrounding North Idaho and facilitate the growth of Idaho's science and technology industries.
   * Development of Radiation-Tolerant-Ultra-Low-Power Electronics ($1 million): The Center for Advanced Microelectronics Biomolecular Research (CAMBR) in Post Falls is working with NASA to develop electronics that consume substantially less power while surviving the high cosmic radiation of space environments, which is very damaging to traditional electronics. This will continue the research and development, as well as provide potential opportunities to partner with other Idaho technology companies.
   * Rathdrum Prairie/Spokane Valley Aquifer ($1.5 million): This item teams with $500,000 included in the FY2005 Interior Appropriations bill to continue the study of the Aquifer to provide the data needed to manage this unique and valuable resource.
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
