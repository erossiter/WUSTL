SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS CLOSING IMPORT LOOPHOLE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced today that he is co-sponsoring S.695, the "New Shipper Review Amendment Act of 2005," to prevent foreign shippers from exploiting loopholes in U.S. trade laws which allow them to avoid paying anti-dumping duties.  
   "This legislation is a simple, yet effective method to stop attempts to undermine and disrupt the U.S. marketplace, particularly the U.S. honey industry," Craig said. "The bill will help stabilize the honey market and several others, will exclude those who are bad actors from taking advantage of this loophole, and will allow the U.S. government to do its job legally and effectively, to the benefit of U.S. producers and businesses." 
   Some new foreign shippers establish U.S. affiliates and use bonds as deposits to pay U.S. anti-dumping duty rates on imports of goods. However, the use of bonds has led to abuse of U.S. trade law. The U.S. Customs Service cannot collect on increasing amounts of U.S. anti-dumping duties from U.S. affiliates who receive the goods, then dissolve. This abuse has led to hundreds of millions of dollars of duties that the U.S. Customs Service cannot collect. 
   Chinese bulk imports of honey and other agricultural commodities using the bonding privilege have flooded U.S. markets with massive volumes of commodities at very low prices, damaging U.S. producers. 
   The legislation would suspend "new shipper" bonding authority for three years, while the Customs Service studies the best way to close the loophole.
