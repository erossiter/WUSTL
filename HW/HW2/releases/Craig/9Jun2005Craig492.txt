HART REJOINS SEN. CRAIG'S STAFF
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced that Will Hart has rejoined his staff to serve as his Regional Director for southwest Idaho.  
 Hart started in the position on May 31, 2005. 
   Hart most recently served as the Communications Director for the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. However, his history with Senator Craig stems back to the summer of 1993, when he was an intern in Craig's D.C. office. Later he served as a Field Representative for Craig for Senate in 1996, as his Press Secretary from 1998-2000, and as his Senior Communications Manager from 2002-2004. Hart also served as Communications Director for Congressman C.L. "Butch" Otter during Otter's first term. 
   While he was raised in Alaska and Bellevue, Washington, Hart returned to his Idaho roots to attend the University of Idaho, where he earned a B.A. in History. He then worked as a Sales Representative in Idaho for Walls Clothing and as the Campaign Manager for Ron Crane for State Treasurer. 
   "It is great to be back home in Boise working for my political mentor Senator Larry Craig," Hart said. "I am very excited to get out on the ground in southwest Idaho representing Senator Craig and begin tackling the many challenges facing our growing region." 
   Craig's Boise office serves Idahoans in Adams, Valley, Payette, Canyon, Ada, Boise, Owyhee, Washington, Gem, and Elmore counties.
