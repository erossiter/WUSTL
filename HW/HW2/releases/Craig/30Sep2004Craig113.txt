SEN. CRAIG IMPROVING COMMODITY MARKETING, RESEARCH PROGRAMS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined colleagues in introducing legislation to strengthen the commodity research and marketing programs. S. 2866, the Commodity Assessment Protection and Reform Act, is sponsored by Sen.  
 Inhofe, R-OK, and eight other Senators, including Craig.
   The legislation clarifies the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002, which authorizes the collection of assessments on commodities through voluntary participation from state commissions. The assessments support research and marketing that benefits all producers. These projects fund extensive research that boosts productivity, disease resistance, and quality of crops.
   "This bill is essential to maintain the integrity of this program for Idaho producers," said Senator Craig.
   To ensure its continued use and effectiveness, legislation is needed to clarify the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) authority if a state wishes to modify the assessment rate originally agreed to between the State and the USDA. This legislation allows the States the ability to modify the rates. It also enables USDA to collect the assessment should the producer default on a marketing loan which uses the crop as collateral.
   Craig emphasized, "As our government encourages farmers to become more responsible for their own marketing and research programs, Congress needs to maintain the programs that help them achieve that goal."
   S. 2866 was placed directly on the Senate calendar in order to facilitate passage before the end of the 108th Congress later this year.
