SEN. CRAIG INTRODUCES FLU PROTECTION ACT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined Indiana Sen. Evan Bayh today in introducing the Flu Protection Act of 2005.  
 Craig and Bayh authored the legislation, which seeks to encourage increased production of influenza vaccines in the United States. 
   "We dodged a bullet this year because we had a mild flu season," said Craig. "We won't always be so fortunate, and that's what this legislation is about. The United States is disturbingly underprepared to deal with either a massive outbreak of the flu or a sudden shortage of vaccine, and we cannot hope to skate by any longer." 
   The Flu Protection Act offers a tax credit to vaccine manufacturers who build new facilities or expand their current production capabilities in the United States. It would also allow the federal government to purchase an amount of unused doses at the end of the flu season to lessen the current economic disincentives to vaccine manufacturers. 
   The bill will also seek to improve outreach and education about the importance of flu vaccination.
