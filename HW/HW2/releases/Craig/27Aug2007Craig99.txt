SEN. CRAIG ISSUES STATEMENT ON ROLL CALL STORY
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig made the following statement in response to the Roll Call story this afternoon: 
   "At the time of this incident, I complained to the police that they were misconstruing my actions. I was not involved in any inappropriate conduct. 
   "I should have had the advice of counsel in resolving this matter. In hindsight, I should not have pled guilty. I was trying to handle this matter myself quickly and expeditiously."
