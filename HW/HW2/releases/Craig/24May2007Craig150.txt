SEN. CRAIG, AIDE HONORED BY WAR WIDOWS
  Sen. Larry Craig was honored today with an award by the Gold Star Wives Of America, an organization of military widows and widowers. The group also presented a similar award to Jon Towers, a senior policy advisor who works for the senator. 
   "While Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, Senator Craig held the first hearing to examine the benefits and quality of service provided to the surviving spouses and children of those who died in the line of duty. We are grateful for his recognition of our population and our needs," said Rose Lee, who chairs the Gold Star Wives Committee on Government Relations.
   Lee also praised Jon Towers, who has worked on the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs since 1997.
   "Jonathan is on Senator Craig's Veterans' Affairs Committee staff and has done superior staff work in his research and attentiveness to what is right for widows and their children. We are pleased to honor Jonathan today," Lee said.
   Sen. Craig thanked the organization and praised their efforts to help those who provide service to others.
   "Gold Star Wives is the premier organization for America's military widows and widowers, and reminds those of us in Congress about the unique needs of those whose loved ones have paid the ultimate price," Craig said.
   In 2005, the first veterans benefits hearing Craig conducted as Chairman of the Committee examined the needs of those who had lost husbands and wives in combat. At the hearing the Idaho Republican called for a "one-stop" shop which widows and widowers could turn to learn of the benefits available to them.
   As a direct result of that hearing, the Department of Veterans Affairs established a website which provides quick links to information to those who spouses either died in combat or after service in the military. That website is located at: http://www.vba.va.gov/Survivors/
