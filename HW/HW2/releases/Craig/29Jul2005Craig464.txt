GUN LAWSUIT BILL CLEARS SENATE
 S. 397, the Protection of the Lawful Commerce in Arms Act, cleared the U.S. Senate today with strong bipartisan support, 65 to 31.  
 The legislation aims to prevent law-abiding firearms dealers and manufacturers from being held responsible for the criminal acts of third parties. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, the bill's original sponsor, praised the Senate's approval. 
   "I've asked the question before, and I'll ask it again: Should Ford or Chrysler be held responsible if a drunk or negligent driver injures someone? Sensible Americans say `no', and that's what this bill reflects." Craig continued, "Today, the Senate made a strong stand against predatory lawsuits and the practice of achieving a social agenda through the courts, rather than the legislative process. Private citizens seeking self-defense, law enforcement officers, the armed services and our national security all won today." 
   S.397, which garnered 61 cosponsors, does not shield dealers or manufacturers who violate existing law or act negligently, nor does it protect the makers of a faulty product. 
   H.R.800 is the House version of the bill under consideration.
