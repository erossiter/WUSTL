IDEA REAUTHORIZATION PASSES SENATE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig joined 95 of his colleagues today in approving reauthorization of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA), S. 1248/H.R.1350.  
 The reauthorization will improve the workability of IDEA and fulfill the funding commitments of the federal government. 
   Senator Craig said, "The IDEA requirements are a massive unfunded mandate to our local school districts, and it is shameful that the federal government has not honored its commitments to fund forty percent of the costs the requirements. This bill will put us on track to fully fund IDEA within the next seven years - a move that will improve education for all students." 
   He continued, "Furthermore, the legislation will ensure those targeted for individualized attention receive it in a timely and efficient manner." 
   S. 1248/H.R.1350 helps students by providing early access to services and support while working to reduce the misidentification of nondisabled children. This bill aims to make things easier for parents by allowing parents and schools to make changes to a student's individualized education plan (IEP) without calling an entire IEP meeting. S. 1248/H.R.1350 should also help to relieve the burden on schools that are often associated with special education regulations. It includes provisions to improve discipline and school safety, reduce paperwork, and simplify funding for grants to State agencies. In addition, it establishes a framework to fully fund the federal portion of IDEA costs by 2011.
