SEN. CRAIG PRAISES DOL'S APRIL JOB NUMBERS FOR IDAHO
  According to U.S. Department of Labor statistics released today for the month of April, more than 1,000 nonfarm jobs were created in Idaho in April alone.  
 Since April 2003, the number of Idaho employees on nonfarm payrolls has increased by more than 10,000. 
   "I am very pleased to see the strong signals that our nation is on the road to economic recovery," said Craig. "Clearly, those who criticized President Bush for a 'jobless recovery' got a little ahead of themselves in their eagerness to discredit the tax relief and economic policies that he championed. 
   "I'm also very pleased to see that Idaho is included in this positive growth." 
   Idaho's statewide unemployment rate now stands at 4.4 percent, down from 4.6 percent the previous month.
