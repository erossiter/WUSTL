SEN. CRAIG LANGUAGE ON RECA TO BECOME LAW
  Congress took an important step today toward the reform of the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA).  
 The House overwhelmingly approved the Department of Justice's Fiscal Year 2006 appropriations bill. Included in the bill is Senate-approved language written by Craig. 
   Craig's language directs the Department of Justice to submit a report to Congress detailing the actions that need to be taken to implement the recommendation of the National Academies of Science (NAS) report on RECA. The language reads: 
   "Radiation Exposure Compensation. - The conferees direct the Department to submit a report, within 90 days of enactment, to the Committees on Appropriations detailing those actions that the Department and the Congress can take to implement the recommendations of the National Academy of Sciences' report on the coverage of affected populations by the Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (Public Law 108-375)."
   In anticipation of the bill being enacted, Craig has been working with officials at Justice to ensure timely delivery of their recommendations. Craig emphasized that this language is a necessary step toward reform, but cautioned people from putting too much hope in it, "Reform is still a long, uphill battle - people need to realize that and not place hope that next week all Idahoans will be eligible for consideration for compensation under RECA. That being said, this language ensures that the Administration is engaged on this issue. Without their assistance, it is a non-starter in Congress." 
   For more information on the general issue of RECA, please read the Idaho Delegation's statement on the NAS report.
