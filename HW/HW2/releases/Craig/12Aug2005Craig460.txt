SEN. CRAIG FIRST SENATOR TO PODCAST
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig is the first U.S. Senator to offer his own podcast through iTunes. For starters, he is distributing his Washington Report[1], a 3-5 minute, bi-weekly audio program featuring news from Washington.  
   Craig, who just turned 60, emphasized this is a medium for everyone, "While the term podcast probably generates an image of a 19-year old with white earphones, the technology is applicable to all ages. I predict a rapid increase in the use of this technology as consumers realize it gives them more control over when and what they hear." 
   A "podcast," coined from iPod (the name of Apple's portable audio player) and broadcast, is another method to distribute audio over the Internet. While traditional audio files are steamed over the Internet in real time, podcasts allow users to automatically download new files to their computers or portable audio players to be listened to at their leisure. It shifts control of timing and content to consumers and allows them to listen to programming when they are not connected to the Internet, such as during a walk, at the gym, or while driving. 
   Craig continued, "It is my goal to ensure Idahoans have as much information as possible about the happenings in Congress. This is just one more tool for distributing news and information about what Congress is doing. Other tools include my website, an RSS NEWS FEED[2], and my bi-weekly ENEWS[3]."
