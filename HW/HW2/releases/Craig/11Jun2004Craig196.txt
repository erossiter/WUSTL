SEN. CRAIG ATTENDS PRESIDENT REAGAN'S FUNERAL SERVICE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig attended the funeral service of President Ronald Reagan today at the National Cathedral.  
 Speakers included President George W. Bush, former President George H.W. Bush, and video remarks were included from former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of the United Kingdom, who was able to attend.
   "Much has been said in honor of Ronald Reagan in recent days," said Craig. "While President Reagan would claim otherwise, all of it is well-deserved. There is no question the world is a better place because of him, and that he truly was the right man for the times.
   "Today, I was honored to pay my final respects to this truly dynamic human being. He changed a party, a nation, and the world. The lives of billions were impacted for the better by Ronald Reagan. Our prayers go with him, but he will remain in our hearts. God bless Ronald Reagan."
   Also in attendance were all four living former Presidents, Secretary-General of the former Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev, and several other heads of state. The State Funeral concluded memorial events in Washington, D.C. Reagan's body will now be returned to California for burial at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley.
   After 4:30 pm (ET) audio comments from Senator Craig will be available for download at http://src.senate.gov/radio.
