SEN. CRAIG SELECTED TO OVERSEE INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee Republicans selected subcommittee memberships today, and Idaho Sen. Larry Craig was selected as the Ranking Republican for the Interior and Related Agencies Subcommittee.  
   The Subcommittee oversees funding of the Department of the Interior and related agencies, such as the Forest Service, Environmental Protection Agency, and Bureau of Land Management. 
   Craig said, "It is no secret that I have spent my time representing Idaho in Congress with a focus on natural resource and energy issues, among other issues, so I am excited for the opportunity to help oversee the use of taxpayers' dollars in our natural resource agencies. 
   "I have more initiatives planned than I can touch on now, but highlights will include fiscal responsibility, effective active resource management, wildfire prevention and suppression, drinking and wastewater, and endangered species recovery. 
   "Senator Feinstein will be serving as the Chair, and I have an effective working relationship with her on these issues. We tackled a number of forest management issues in the past, such as Healthy Forests and the Quincy Library Group. I have found her to be thoughtful, tenacious, and dedicated to improving forest health." 
   Former Senate colleague and fellow Idahoan, Secretary of the Interior Dirk Kempthorne said, "This is a great testament to Senator Craig's leadership in the Senate on these and other important issues to the Department of Interior and the West. I appreciate his friendship and I look forward to working with him in his new role on this important Subcommittee." 
   Craig will also serve on the Homeland Security, Agriculture, Energy and Water Development, Labor-Health and Human Services, and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs subcommittees.
