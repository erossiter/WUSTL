SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES AGRICULTURE RESEARCH PROJECTS
  Today the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies approved its fiscal year 2008 Appropriations bill. Included in the bill is support for a number of projects important to Idaho, including agriculture research and rural infrastructure.  
   Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Subcommittee, said, "The United States and Idaho have a long history of innovation in agriculture. Because of this, we now lead the world in agriculture, and it must continue to ensure the U.S. leads in feeding the world. 
   "I continue to be concerned about the overall level of spending we are dealing with this year. Congress has the constitutional responsibility to determine funding priorities, and I believe we should exercise that right. I will vouch for every Idaho project I supported in this bill, and I will continue to work with my Republican and Democrat colleagues on the committee and President Bush to bring more balance to the process. We need to manage federal spending responsibly as we work to eliminate budget deficits."
