DELEGATION PROMISES SUPPORT TO ATLAS EMPLOYEES
  In reaction to Stimson Lumber Company's announcement that they will be closing the Atlas mill in Coeur d'Alene at the end of the year, Idaho Sens.  
 Larry Craig and Mike Crapo and Rep. C.L. "Butch" Otter offered the following statement: 
   "First and foremost, to the employees of the Atlas mill, `We will do all we can to help reduce the impact of this closure. We will support your petition for Trade Adjustment Assistance to help with this transition and will also work to help outside workers, such as loggers, who are not directly employed by Stimson but will be impacted.' 
   "In addition, we are saddened to see yet another mill close due to the increase in softwood lumber imports from Canada and other countries. This latest closure in Idaho only reinforces how important it is that we find a way to resolve the Canadian lumber dispute quickly. We remain committed to solving this tough problem because the timber industry is a vital part of our economy - one we are determined to see flourish in Idaho. 
   "We appreciate the contributions Stimson and its employees have made to the Coeur d'Alene community, and we applaud Stimson Lumber Company's efforts to make this very difficult transition as easy as possible for everyone involved."
