SEN. CRAIG LAUDS JIM CASWELL'S SELECTION
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior and Related Agencies, lauded the selection of Jim Caswell to head the Bureau of Land Management.  
   Craig stated, "I could not be more pleased with the President's selection of Jim Caswell to head the Bureau of Land Management. I have worked with Jim both as a Forest Supervisor and as head of Idaho's Office of Species Conservation. He has consistently shown himself to be practical, fair, efficient, and pragmatic. He listens to both sides and makes sound decisions. These qualities will serve BLM and the public well. 
   "I will work with the Administration to ensure that Jim receives fair, open, and timely consideration before the Senate."
