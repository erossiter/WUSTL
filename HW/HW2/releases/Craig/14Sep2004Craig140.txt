SEN. CRAIG, REP. OTTER, GOV. KEMPTHORNE TO ANNOUNCE PUBLIC LAND EXCHANGE PROPOSAL
  Sen. Larry Craig, Gov. Dirk Kempthorne, and Rep. Butch Otter will announce a proposal for a land exchange involving key parcels of land from the Boise Foothills to North Idaho at a press conference at 3:30 p.m. Friday, September 17, on Bogus Basin Road (3.1 miles north of the intersection of Bogus Basin and Hill road). The proposed exchange is a unique concept developed between the Idaho Department of Lands (IDL), the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) and the U.S. Forest Service (FS) with the assistance of the City of Boise. 
   The proposed exchange is unique in that it contemplates using both BLM and FS land to balance an exchange with Idaho State Endowment lands on an equal value basis. BLM, FS and IDL staff have identified parcels that help reduce the four threats to federal forests and grasslands as identified by the Chief of the Forest Service as well as convey to the State of Idaho lands that help benefit the State's endowment beneficiaries.
   The City of Boise has assisted the effort by using funds from its 2001 Foothills Levy to pay for professional services such as environmental conditions, wildlife habitat, cultural resources, timber species and volume, mineral resources and appraisal services that help evaluate the feasibility of the proposed exchange. Governor Kempthorne, Senator Craig and Congressman Otter invite the public to learn more about this proposal and provide comments to the partnering agencies on the proposed exchange concept from September 20 to October 20, 2004. Next week, Open House meetings in which the partnering agencies will provide information and answer questions will be held in Kellogg, St. Maries, Moscow and Boise to provide additional information on the exchange.
