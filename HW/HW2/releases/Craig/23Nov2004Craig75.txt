CONGRESS APPROVES PROJECTS FOR NORTH CENTRAL IDAHO
  The Conference Report for the Omnibus Appropriations bill which passed both houses of Congress Saturday included dozens of important Idaho projects. The state is represented by two members on the Congressional Appropriations Committees that wrote the bill - Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson. They, along with Sen. Mike Crapo and Rep. C.L. "Butch" Otter, all worked on the projects as a united Idaho Delegation, and praised the bill's support for the projects. 
   The Omnibus legislation includes virtually all discretionary federal spending for Fiscal Year 2005, except for defense and homeland security spending. To keep the bill fiscally responsible, Congressional leaders and the President agreed to essentially freeze spending, overall, at the same level as that for 2004. Included in the Omnibus were several projects important to North Central Idaho, including, but not limited to:
