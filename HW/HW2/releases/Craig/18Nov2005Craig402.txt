HOUSE APPROVES TRANSPORTATION, TREASURY, HUD APPROPRIATIONS CONFERENCE REPORT
  The House of Representatives approved the conference report today for the Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development (HUD) appropriations bill. The Senate is expected to approve the measure in the next few days and send it to the President for his signature. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Idaho Rep. Mike Simpson serve as members of the respective Senate and House Appropriations Committees, which crafted the bill.  
   "Idaho has very real transportation needs," Craig said. "As our population continues to grow, our infrastructure must improve to keep up with the increased demands. These projects will improve the safety and efficiency of Idahoans as they travel and bring goods and services to market." 
   "These critical projects will help modernize Idaho's transportation infrastructure and improve safety on our state's roads," said Simpson. "I'm particularly thrilled with the funding for Boise's new airport tower because it's critical to the future growth of both the airport and our state's economy."
