SEN. CRAIG PRAISES PLAN TO SECURE BORDER
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig praised President Bush's announcement tonight that several thousand National Guard troops will be deployed along the United States' southern border to assist the Border Patrol. 
   "For any immigration reform to work, our borders must first be secured," Craig said. "For years, I have worked to beef up the resources at the border, and over the last decade, Congress has tripled the number of agents enforcing border and immigration laws. This has helped, but illegal immigration persists. Bringing the resources of the National Guard to bear will free up the Border Patrol and help them be more effective.
   "While Congress works on more permanent solutions, including comprehensive immigration reform, I am pleased that the President is taking this bold step, which many of us have been urging, and I will be working with other senators to provide the support this initiative requires."
