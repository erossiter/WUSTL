SEN. CRAIG RESPONDS TO TREATMENT OF ABU GHRAIB PRISONERS
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig attended a classified briefing today by the Department of Defense for all Senators regarding the ongoing investigation into the alleged abuse of prisoners at the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq.  
 He has the following statement: 
   "The additional photos I saw today were disturbing.
   "Our military is acting swiftly and appropriately to punish those who acted in a way unbecoming an American soldier. The message needs to be sent that the United States of America will not tolerate our soldiers violating the rights of anyone, even our prisoners. 
   "While Congress has a role in oversight, we are not the judge and jury. We need to let the court martial process move forward without obstruction. 
   "This must not be allowed to derail our mission to bring freedom and prosperity to the people of Iraq or to stop the global scourge of terrorism. In addition, the actions of a few should not tarnish the reputation of our military or cloud the message that what they are doing is just and right."
