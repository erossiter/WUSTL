SEN. CRAIG CALLS ON SENATE TO PASS NATIONAL ENERGY POLICY
  In the wake of the highest gasoline prices in history, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig called on Congress to enact a comprehensive national energy policy. Below are excerpts from his speech:  
   "At the close of business on Friday of this past week, the futures for crude oil in some categories went to over $38 a barrel. Now that will translate down the road to nearly $3 a gallon of gasoline at the pump in the United States. I'll bet you that I'm one of the few that will come to the floor today and speak about the crisis in energy that is draining this economy while all of that money flows to the Middle East because we're so focused on the presidential finger pointing that's going on at this very moment. Why don't we finger point at ourselves for just a little bit? 
   "When we talk about growth and we talk about the average American family's needs, have we told the American family this year they're going to spend between $400 and $500 more for gasoline than they did a year ago? 
   "This country has had a no-development policy for well over two decades. We've run around and stuck our heads in the sand, hoping that somehow we could just get through this while the world has become an ever larger consumer of hydrocarbons. We have good conservation policies in place, and we'd have better conservation policies in place had we passed a national energy policy. We'd have pro-production policies in place, and we would be sending the economy toward producing once again had we passed a national energy policy. 
   "As the summer goes on, all of our refineries are operating at peak capacity at this moment. But nearly 60% of the oil they're refining is produced by a foreign country. Those foreign countries are raking in U.S. gold in the form of U.S. dollars like they never have before."
