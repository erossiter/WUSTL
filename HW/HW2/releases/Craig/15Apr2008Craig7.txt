SEN. CRAIG URGES COOPERATION WITH LOCALS AS FIRE SEASON APPROACHES
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Interior Appropriations Subcommittee, today urged Interior Secretary and former Idaho Governor Dirk Kempthorne to work more closely with the U.S. Forest Service and local Idaho communities during the upcoming fire season. 
   "We had an extreme fire year in 2007 when Idaho was unfortunately home to the largest wildfire in the nation," Craig said. "I've spent a good deal of time with all parties involved in the suppression of that fire, even holding a conference in Boise earlier this year, and I'm convinced that if we had been better prepared, kept locals involved and had teams in place, the results would not have been as severe."
   Craig went on to urge Kempthorne to work with the U.S. Forest Service to ensure there are no gaps in the two departments' upcoming fire season budgets and to utilize the resources provided by the National Interagency Fire Center.
   Craig's comments came during a hearing on the Interior Department's proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2009.
   Senator Craig also questioned Kempthorne about the Interior Department's responsibility to secure 793 miles of the nation's southern border, and expressed concern about reports of drugs from China being smuggled into California and across the border to Mexico for processing and back into the U.S.
