'ASSAULT WEAPONS' BAN EXPIRES; SEN. CRAIG SLAMS LAW AS INEFFECTIVE, PRAISES EXPIRATION
  Today marks the expiration of the Clinton-era "assault weapons" ban, and Idaho Sen.  
 Larry Craig, an opponent of the ban and other erosions of the rights protected by the Second Amendment, praised its demise. 
   "Today marks the death of an ineffective law - a law whose very foundation is based on emotion and cosmetics, not facts," said Craig. 
   Craig continued, "The only effect this ban had was to deny law-abiding citizens the right to own certain firearms that look more dangerous than others. It did nothing to reduce crime, save lives, or keep guns out of the hands of criminals. 
   "We should let sleeping laws die. Congress should continue to focus on reducing crimes by prosecuting gun-wielding criminals to the full extent of the law. It is the only method that works."
