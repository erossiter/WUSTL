SEN. CRAIG COMMENTS ON MIERS NOMINATION
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig commented today on the nomination of Harriet Miers to replace the outgoing Sandra Day O'Connor as a Supreme Court justice.  
 Miers currently serves as Counsel to the President, a post she has held since February, 2005. 
   "Harriet Miers is an impressive legal talent with a reputation for hard work," Craig said. "I look forward to learning more about her and her judicial philosophy, and I commend the President for bringing this nomination forward quickly." 
   Craig continued, "While rumors of a Democrat filibuster began before Ms. Miers was even nominated, I'm hopeful that all Senators will give her full and fair consideration before deciding whether or not to confirm her." 
   While her nomination moves through the process, Justice O'Connor will continue to serve on the court. 
   More information on the judicial nominations process is available in the Judicial Nominations Special Report.
