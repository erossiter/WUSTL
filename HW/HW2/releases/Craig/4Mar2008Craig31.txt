SEN. CRAIG PUSHES NORTHERN BORDER ISSUES
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig, a member of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today questioned Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff about the President's Fiscal Year 2009 budget request. Among the topics Craig raised with the Secretary was security along the northern border Idaho shares with other northern States. 
   Craig said, "I am pleased that the Secretary understands the importance of securing both of our nation's land borders. I applaud the Department's use of new technologies, including infrared and seismic sensors and unmanned aerial vehicles, to fill gaps where human border patrol agents cannot get to or do not regularly patrol. However, it is important to shore up our northern border to ensure that we are able to track anyone who attempts to cross the border outside of the checkpoints.
   "I share the Secretary's commitment to deploying new technologies to our northern border and working to secure our nation's largest border, recognizing the different types of threats that are coming through our northern border."
