SEN. CRAIG REJECTS SURRENDER DATE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig voted against final passage of the FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations bill today. The Senate approved the bill on a vote of 51-47.  
   Craig explained his vote, "While this bill contains important provisions, including a reauthorization of the Craig-Wyden bill, it also contains a firm withdrawal date from Iraq. We might as well just throw up the white flag because we are announcing the day we will surrender. 
   "We are on a mission to fight terrorists where the terrorists are and establish a working democracy in the Middle East. This debate is about more than Iraq - it is about a stable Middle East. Policies of the past considered the Middle East 'stable' as long as there wasn't too much going on. Well, our President's message to the citizens of the Middle East is that we want you to enjoy freedom and democracy and only then will the region be stable."
