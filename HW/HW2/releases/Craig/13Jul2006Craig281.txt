SEN. CRAIG RED CARDS EUROPEAN UNION'S ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig blasted the European Union's premature imposition of unprecedented fines against Microsoft Corporation: 
   "The European Union continues to march down the path of least resistance in software development - choosing expropriation over innovation. Yesterday they chose to head butt Microsoft with fines before its own compliance deadline passes.
   "At a time when we are trying to break down trade barriers on everything from microchips to beef, the EU actions reek of protectionism. Americans need to understand that every dollar that goes across the pond is one less dollar spent in America on new jobs and future product development."
