SEN. CRAIG HONORED FOR WORK ON MINIDOKA INTERNMENT CAMP
  The Japanese American Citizens League recognized Idaho Senator Larry Craig's work to conserve the Minidoka National Historic Site.  
   Craig stated, "During times of war, countries often make mistakes with the best of intentions. The treatment of Japanese Americans during World War II was a dark period in our history, and one we could repeat if future generations forget. Conserving the sites of the camps and establishing educational opportunities will help ensure we don't repeat our past mistakes." 
   Craig and the rest of the Idaho Congressional Delegation are currently sponsoring legislation to expand the Minidoka National Historic Site to include Hermann Farm. The Farm is significant because it was originally part of the Camp and was part of a program to give land to veterans of World War II upon their return. As one of the few "Farm-In-A-Day" promotions, local community members turned the land from desert to a farm in one day by joining together and demonstrating the same American tenacity and ingenuity that won the War. 
   The bill also authorizes an eight acre site in Bainbridge Island, Washington, as part of the Site. It is the site of the first internment camp and will house the Nidoto Nai Yoni ("Let it not happen again") memorial that commemorates this tragedy. 
   Representatives from the Japanese American Citizens League, including National Director Floyd Mori, met with Craig today to present the award and thank him personally.
