SEN. CRAIG RESPONDS TO 9-11 COMMISSION REPORT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee's Subcommittee on Homeland Security, today reacted to the public release of the 9/11 Commission's final report on the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. 
   "I welcome the findings of the 9/11 Commission report," said Craig. "Without question, it provides great insights into the obstacles that remained in place after the Cold War and our bureaucratic failures leading up to the attacks.
   "Unfortunately, the report does not take into consideration some of the steps already taken by the Bush Administration and Congress to improve intelligence-sharing and prevent further attacks, including the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Proliferation Security Initiative and the USA PATRIOT Act.
   "However, the report serves as a great reference for Congress, the Bush Administration, and our intelligence agencies as we move to improve our defenses at home and abroad in the war on terror. America is not immune to future acts of terrorism, but we are much safer than the day the attacks occurred. I congratulate the committee and thank them for their important work."
   The 567-page report contains the findings of the two-year investigation into the September 11 attacks by the bipartisan 9/11 Commission, and includes suggestions to avoid future attacks.
