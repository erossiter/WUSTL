SEN. CRAIG SUPPORTS BEEFING-UP BORDER
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig cosponsored an amendment to expand the number of border patrol agents. Sens.  
 Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, and John Ensign, R-Nev., offered the amendment during Senate consideration of the Budget Resolution. 
   The amendment provides for an additional 2,000 border patrol agents in Fiscal Year 2006, with at least ten percent being allocated to the northern border. This number coincides with the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission and the Intelligence Reform Bill of 2005, which was enacted earlier this year. 
   Speaking on the amendment, Craig stated, "Bringing our immigration problem under control requires both increased enforcement and reform of our guest worker programs. The bottom line is that we need more agents on our nearly 7,000 miles of land borders." 
   In order to keep the budget balanced, amendments are required to offset their cost by reducing spending in other programs. The $352 million required for this program was extracted from the International Affairs budget. 
   Craig continued, "We have a problem that needs to be addressed here at home - we should focus our resources on that before the needs of other countries." 
   The amendment is now part of the Senate's Budget Resolution, which will need to be reconciled with the House version by a conference committee.
