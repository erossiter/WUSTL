KRISTINE SVINICKI HEADED TO NUCLEAR REGULATORY COMMISSION
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig congratulated former employee, Kristine Svinicki, today on her confirmation to the federal U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. Svinicki was approved in December by the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee (EPW) and was approved unanimously by the full Senate early this morning. She was nominated by President George W. Bush to serve on the commission, on Craig's recommendation. The commission oversees operation of the nation's nuclear power plants, and reviews applications for new plants. 
   Svinicki served from 1997 to 2005 as a senior policy advisor to Senator Craig for nuclear energy and technology, as well as Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site cleanup and a host of other issues. Before that, she worked at the U.S. Department of Energy Idaho Operations Office in Idaho Falls. Since 2005, she has served as a professional staff member of the Senate Armed Services Committee.
   "It truly has been an honor to work with Kristine over the years, but I knew from the day we hired her that we wouldn't be able to keep her for long," said Craig. "It was easy to see she was destined for bigger and better things, and I'm glad that President Bush and the Senate agree. I wish her well in her new capacity at NRC, and I know she'll do a phenomenal job."
   "I am deeply grateful to Senator Craig for his steadfast support and for the professional opportunities and mentoring he has provided during my service as staff in the United States Senate," said Svinicki. "Working in the Senate has been a privilege, and I will miss my 'Senate family,' but I look forward to taking on the new opportunities before me."
