SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO ETHICS COMMITTEE LETTER
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig had the following reaction today to a letter sent from the Senate Ethics Committee to Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:  
   "It is my intent to fight the case before the Ethics Committee while I am a sitting Senator. I would prefer to have that case resolved on its merits. 
   "The letter sent today from the Committee to Senator McConnell does not address the arguments laid out by my attorney earlier today. I hope that Committee addresses those arguments sooner, rather than later, so that I can have my name cleared." 
   The letter from the Committee is available at: http://craig.senate.gov/releases/pr090507b-letter.pdf.
