SEN. CRAIG TO LEAD SENATORS TO NORMANDY FOR MEMORIAL DAY, JOINED BY VETERANS AFFAIRS SECRETARY NICHOLSON
  Sen. Larry Craig, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, will lead a delegation of Senators on a tour of military cemeteries in Europe and North Africa starting Saturday, May 27. Joining them will be VA Secretary Jim Nicholson.
   On Memorial Day, Monday, May 29, the group will visit Omaha Beach in France and lay a wreath in honor of the over 10,000 American servicemen who gave their lives at Normandy. The delegation will also examine the Pointe du Hoc monument that was erected by the French to honor the American 2nd Ranger Battalion which, in 1944, scaled a 100 foot cliff to take out German gun emplacements. 
   "My committee has jurisdiction over the cemeteries which serve as the final resting places of many of our nation's heroes. I feel it is important that we see first hand the condition of those facilities and pay our respects to those who gave all," Sen. Craig said.
   Those traveling in the delegation include U.S. Senators Larry Craig (R-Idaho), Arlen Specter (R-Pennsylvania), Richard Burr (R-North Carolina), Johnny Isakson (R-Georgia) - all members of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. They will be joined by Secretary of Veterans Affairs Jim Nicholson, and Brigadier General John W. Nicholson, Ret., Secretary of the American Battle Monuments Commission.
