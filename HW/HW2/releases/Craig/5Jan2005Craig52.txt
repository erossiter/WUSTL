SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig named Olga "Mimi" Faller of Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, to be Idaho's U.S. Senate page for the Spring 2005 term.  
 She is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Spring Page Program. 
   Mimi is currently a junior at Gonzaga Preparatory School in Spokane, where she is a member of the National Honor Society and President of the French Club. In addition, she is a member and officer of the Varsity debate team and served as the captain of the Junior Varsity soccer team this fall. Mimi also assists her fellow students as a volunteer tutor and is a self-described "avid skier." 
   "Mimi will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships she will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime." 
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the House and Senate Chambers for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk. 
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be sixteen years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. In addition, information and an application are available on Senator Craig's website at http://craig.senate.gov.
