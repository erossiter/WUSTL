SEN. CRAIG REACTS TO SUPREME COURT RULING
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig reacted today to the Supreme Court's ruling on a case contesting the Constitutionality of the phrase "under God" in our Pledge of Allegiance. 
   "Once again the Supreme Court rescued us from a Ninth Circuit ruling," said Craig. "Fifty years ago today Congress added 'under God' to our Pledge, and it is important we maintain that heritage." 
   A copy of the ruling is available at www.supremecourtus.gov.
