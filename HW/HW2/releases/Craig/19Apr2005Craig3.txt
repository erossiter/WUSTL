AGJOBS RECEIVES MAJORITY VOTE
  The United States Senate considered S. 359, AgJOBS, today as an amendment to the Fiscal Year 2005 Supplemental Appropriation bill. 53 Senators voted in favor of the legislation, which fell short of the 60 needed to stop the filibuster.  
   Following the vote, Idaho Sen. Larry Craig offered the following observation, "A majority of my colleagues sent a strong message today that they support AgJOBS and are ready to address immigration reform. President Bush and Majority Leader Frist continue to stress the importance of addressing comprehensive immigration reform this year. I will continue to work with Senator Kennedy and our other supporters to bring this before the Senate sooner rather than later." 
   AgJOBS seeks to stabilize our agricultural workforce by reforming the H2A guest worker program and providing a path to legal status for an estimated 500,000 workers already in the country. The competing measure, offered by Senators Chambliss and Kyl, garnered 21 votes.
