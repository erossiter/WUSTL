IDAHO DELEGATION RECOGNIZED FOR PROMOTING AFFORDABLE INSURANCE
  The National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies (NAMIC) honored the Idaho Congressional Delegation with the Benjamin Franklin Public Policy Award.  
 Idaho is the only state where all members of Congress received the award.
   The award honors members of Congress who consistently support a stable, affordable insurance industry. Public policy issues that were considered include ergonomics regulations, Patient's Bill of Rights, insurer access to criminal records, class action reform, and terrorism risk insurance.
   The award is named after Benjamin Franklin in celebration of the 250th anniversary of the American mutual insurance industry and pays tribute to the first successful mutual insurance company, The Philadelphia Contributionship for Insurance of House from Loss by Fire, in 1752. Benjamin Franklin was a founding director.
   "NAMIC is honored to present this award to these members of Congress who have demonstrated their unwavering support and leadership on behalf of our members, insurance customers, and the property/casualty insurance industry," said Monte Ward, NAMIC's federal affairs vice president.
   "The awardees' understanding and support of the insurance industry have helped to successfully protect the free and open market environment that has existed since Mr. Franklin started that first successful mutual insurance company," said Ward.
