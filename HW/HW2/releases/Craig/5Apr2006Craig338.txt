SEN. CRAIG COSPONSORS SMALL BUSINESS HEALTH PLAN BILL
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig announced today that he is cosponsoring S.1955, the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act of 2005. Also known as the Small Business Health Plan bill, the legislation would allow small businesses to band together through associations and purchase group health insurance plans for their employees. 
   Proponents of the bill argue it will make health insurance available to more uninsured workers, by making health benefits more affordable for businesses to offer employees. The bill was recently approved 11-9 by the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
   "Senator Enzi and Senator Nelson [D-Neb.] deserve the credit for threading this very complicated needle," Craig said. "They and the other members of the HELP Committee worked diligently over the past six months to hear the concerns of all parties, work out acceptable compromises, and bring a bill before the Senate that I think we can all support.
   "Congress has been working for many years to craft a bill that will provide much needed assistance to our small businesses to help them obtain affordable health insurance for their dedicated employees and their families, many of whom are currently uninsured. This bill does just that."
   The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration.
