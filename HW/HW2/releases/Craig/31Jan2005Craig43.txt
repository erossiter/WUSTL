SENATE CONFIRMS NEW ENERGY SECRETARY
  The United States Senate confirmed Dr. Samuel Bodman to be the next Secretary of Energy.  
 Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo supported Dr. Bodman. 
   "During his confirmation hearing, Dr. Bodman addressed a number of issues important to Idaho, especially the Idaho National Laboratory. He demonstrated a deep conviction to the promotion of nuclear energy and to strengthening the Lab. In addition, he understands the need for an energy policy and will work with Congress to enact and implement an energy bill," said Craig. "I am proud to support his confirmation and look forward to working with him." 
   "I am confident in Secretary Bodman's ability to lead the Department of Energy. National energy policy must be a top priority for our country, and Secretary Bodman will be a strong advocate for the many facets of energy including energy research such as the nuclear research planned at the Idaho National Laboratory," Crapo said.
