IDAHO CONSERVATION, WATER PROJECTS RECEIVE SUPPORT
  The Senate Interior and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee approved its fiscal year 2008 funding bill today. 
   During his opening remarks, Idaho Senator Larry Craig, the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, expressed his concern over the path of the appropriations process this year, citing substantial and unsustainable spending increases in many of the bills. Craig pointed out that the Interior bill has the smallest percentage increase, 2.8 percent, of any of the bills and said, "I am worried that this kind of money cannot be managed and spent responsibly. In some areas, in the Interior bill and elsewhere, modest and incremental increases are justified, and I will support such increases."
   DURING HIS OPENING REMARKS, CRAIG HIGHLIGHTED SEVERAL IMPORTANT PROGRAMS FUNDED IN THE BILL: 
   * Wildland firefighting accounts are beefed up, including restoring major cuts to the State Fire Assistance Program 
   * National Parks Centennial Initiative is fully funded at the President's request 
   * Clean Water State Revolving Fund provides $200 million over the President's request
