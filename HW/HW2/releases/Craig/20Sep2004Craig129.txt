GOWEN FIELD, MOUNTAIN HOME AIR FORCE BASE PROJECTS APPROVED
  The Senate approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction Appropriations bill today. The bill includes four significant projects for Idaho. 
   "Gowen Field and Mountain Home are strategic national assets. These projects strengthen Idaho's military facilities to ensure Idaho has the tools to continue to provide for our national defense," said Senator Craig.
   Senator Crapo said, "With the Senate's passage of the legislation, we take a step toward helping our fighting men and women by providing the tools and resources they need to protect our national security and take on terrorist threats around the world. Idaho's service members, guardsmen, and reservists - and their families - have placed their lives on the line to protect us; I'm pleased that we can help recognize that commitment with these important Idaho projects."
   Included in the bill, which is on its way to a Conference Committee to reconcile differences with the House version, are construction projects for the Idaho National Guard's Gowen Field and Mountain Home Air Force Base. Details of the projects are included below:
   * Mountain Home AFB Family Housing Replacement Phase 6 ($39.333 million): Over the last several years, Mountain Home AFB and Congress have worked to replace the on-base housing. This phase will construct 147 units.
   * Gowen Field Base Supply Complex Addition/Alteration ($3.5 million): This project provides the additional supply, storage, and training needs since the 124th Wing switched its mission in 1996 to flying A-10s and C-130s.
   * Gowen Field Munitions Maintenance and Storage Facility ($900,000): The current Munitions Maintenance and Storage Facility needs to be moved to accommodate growth at the Boise Airport. Relocating the Facility will allow the Airport to accommodate more civilian aircraft.
   * Gowen Field Training Area Railhead ($1.349 million): Gowen Field houses a premier training facility for Guard members. Presently, temporary rail facilities are built each year to unload equipment. This will provide for the construction of permanent facilities, increasing safety, and saving tax dollars.
   Funding for both the Railhead and Storage Facility represent the planning and design phase for these multi-year projects.
