SEN. CRAIG COMMENTS ON PASSING OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig made the following statement on the passing of Pope John Paul II:  
   "Although the Pope's health had been declining for some time, I was still very saddened to hear the news of his passing. He was a thoughtful, yet forceful defender of Christianity, and nearly all respected him because he never conducted a poll before speaking his conscience. He always spoke and acted out of deep conviction.
   "At the same time, one doesn't have to be a Catholic to see the massive impact this man had on history and human events. Pope John Paul II saw firsthand the Iron Curtain descend upon Europe. Much like Ronald Reagan, he understood communism at its core, and saw it for what it really was - an evil ideology that suffocates the spirit and crushes freedom. His trip to Poland in 1981 gave hope and inspiration to hundreds of millions, and marked the beginning of the end of communist rule in Europe. 
   "Pope John Paul II was a visionary who appealed to the young, and spoke out on behalf of the poor and the weak. He was courageous and bold, and yet, gentle and understanding. He was an example for us all. He will be missed, but never forgotten."
