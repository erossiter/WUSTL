HOUSE APPROVES COMMERCE, JUSTICE AND SCIENCE CONFERENCE REPORT
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig and Rep. Mike Simpson today announced that the House of Representatives has approved the conference report for the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations bill for FY2006. The Senate will likely approve the legislation in the next few days and send it to the President for his signature.  
   The following Idaho projects were included in the bill: 
   * Criminal Information Sharing Alliance Network (CISA) - Idaho State Police ($750,000) - CISAnet is considered a model for collection and secure sharing of law enforcement information, and an excellent example of cooperation among federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies. Participating states have made it the central intelligence-gathering system for their homeland defense efforts. Funding will allow the Idaho State Police to participate in the enhancement and maintenance of the system, including expansion of connectivity among law enforcement agencies, replacement and upgrading of workstations, development of CISAnet applications, and integration of hardware and software components. 
   * Idaho-Montana Lewis and Clark Bicentennial Bi-State Safety Project ($300,000) - The rural counties in Idaho and Montana that lie on the Lewis and Clark Trail are unique to other Trail counties in other states in that they are very large, with small populations concentrated in communities that are surrounded by public land. Increased personnel and training needs will be ongoing through the bicentennial years. In order to ensure public safety for Lewis and Clark Bicentennial events, there are serious needs in these counties for increased staffing. This project will provide for continuing staffing needs in the eight counties in Idaho and Montana, training, and for equipment and supplies. 
   * Child Protection Program - Nez Perce Tribe ($150,000) - This will provide the Nez Perce Tribe the tools to establish an effective Child Protection Program on the reservation. The increased accuracy of reporting child abuse and neglect has established a need for children's services on the reservation. 
   * Idaho Virtual Incubator - Lewis-Clark State College ($75,000) - The Idaho Virtual Incubator (IVI) provides e-commerce applications to Idaho rural small businesses by using university students to help provide business assistance. The cornerstone services for the IVI include Website development, e-marketing assistance, and database development. 
   * Radiation-Tolerant Ultra-Low-Power (RTULP) Electronics for Space Applications - University of Idaho ($1 million) - The Human and Robotic Technology (H&RT) program requires a level of radiation-hard electronics capability much beyond what is available today. In addition to providing deep submicron electronics for science applications, the same technology will be utilized for electronic pathogen detection for manned space probes in the H&RT program. 
   * Temporal Land Cover Change Research Program - Idaho State University ($500,000) - The changes that are altering and degrading many of our rangelands include wildfire, invasive plants, drought, and uncontrolled development. ISU proposes to continue on going research and utilize the results and models already developed to produce a new model of rangeland health. The continuation of this successful work will create a rangelands remote sensing core to service at Idaho State University that would service the entire Intermountain West as a clearing house for data, research results and information. 
   * Performance, Safety, and Mission Success Tools for NASA Programs - INL ($2 million) - This project will enable the application of INL capabilities to develop and apply tools to support multiple NASA missions and programs. 
   * ISU Boise Center Aerospace Laboratory ($500,000) - Geospatial research for water resource organizations in Idaho to utilize remote sensing and geospatial technologies for more efficient use of water. 
   * National Consortium of Offender Management Systems (NCOMS) Software Development Project - Idaho Department of Corrections ($25,000) - This system gives the Idaho Department of Corrections (IDOC) access to the most comprehensive information on offenders available in the country. Further, the system provides a forum for member states to collaborate on improvements, recommendations, and ideas. IDOC will be able to make needed upgrades so the system is more flexible and compatible with all types of databases, eliminating most interface barriers. The system has the potential to affect everyone in the department, connecting IDOC and all of the facilities in the consortium, as well as the Parole Commission. 
   * Pro-Tech Program - College of Southern Idaho ($75,000) - Through this program, the College of Southern Idaho takes an active role in Economic Development in Idaho's Magic Valley by providing training to companies that are new to the area. CSI partners with other agencies to identify training needs and to identify potential candidates for employment. The most recent of these ventures are the training programs that were established for Dell Computers. 
   * Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund ($2,250,000) - Salmon recovery projects in Alaska, Washington, Oregon, California, and Idaho. This is the third year that Idaho has been included in the program. The Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund (PCSRF) was created in 1999 to meet obligations of the Pacific Salmon Treaty and recovering threatened and endangered salmon stocks in the Pacific Northwest. In fiscal year 2004, Idaho was finally included in the fund through the appropriations process. Authorization for the program has expired and a reauthorizing bill has been introduced and is awaiting Senate consideration. A similar bill has already passed the House several times in recent years. 
   "Idaho will be a safer, more economically vibrant place as a result of these projects," Craig said. "The INL and our colleges and universities will be able to stay on the cutting edge of research and development. I'm also very pleased that Mike and I were able to secure for Idaho a share of the Pacific Coastal Salmon Recovery Fund to improve salmon habitat and recovery efforts." 
   "These projects will help improve our state's economic base, expand programs at Idaho's colleges and universities, and boost the INL's contributions to space exploration," said Simpson. "Higher education and the students of Idaho are big winners in this bill." 
   The conference report preserves an amendment added by the Senate, requiring the Federal Trade Commission to immediately launch an investigation into whether gasoline companies have engaged in price gouging in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. 
   As members of their respective Appropriations Committees, Senator Craig and Idaho Representative Mike Simpson cooperate to ensure federal spending is restrained, tax dollars are appropriately spent, and that high-priority Idaho projects are included.
