SEN. CRAIG APPOINTS SENATE PAGE
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig named Nathan J. McGregor of Filer, Idaho, to be Idaho's U.S. Senate page for the Summer 2006 term. He is one of thirty students nationally who have been chosen by their respective Senators for the Summer Page Program. 
   Nathan is currently a junior at Filer High School in Filer, where he is the junior class president and is a member of the National Honor Society and Business Professionals of America. He is also a member of the varsity soccer and junior varsity golf and bowling teams, and currently takes courses at the College of Southern Idaho. He is majoring in political science.
   "Nathan will represent Idaho well as a Senate page," said Senator Craig. "In addition, the knowledge, experience, and friendships he will gain will reap rewards for a lifetime."
   The primary duty of a Page is to deliver correspondence and legislative material to Congressional offices. Pages also take phone messages, call members to the phone, prepare the Senate chamber for sessions, and carry bills and amendments to the desk.
   The United States Senate Page Program is open to juniors in high school who will be 16 or 17 years old on or before the date of the appointment. All Idaho high schools are provided with applications and details about the Page Program. In addition, information and an application are available in the Page Program [1] section of Senator Craig's website.
