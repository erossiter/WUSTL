APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN IDAHO
  The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the Fiscal Year 2005 Interior and Related Agencies and the Agriculture Appropriations bills late yesterday. Idaho Sen. Larry Craig, a member of the Committee, announced that several projects were included for Idaho.  
   Craig said, "Today the Senate takes this year's first step in supporting Idaho's natural resource priorities and their beneficial management - all within a fiscally responsible bill. I'm pleased the Appropriations Committee continues to recognize the importance of our noxious weeds management programs, as well as acknowledging the impact endangered species such as wolves, sage grouse, and slickspot peppergrass have on Idaho citizens." 
   Below are projects key to southern Idaho in the Interior bill:
   * Idaho's Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds ($500,000): The Idaho State Department of Agriculture (ISDA) is in its fifth year of implementing the Idaho Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds. Idaho developed the Strategic Plan for Managing Noxious Weeds through a collaborative effort involving private landowners, state and federal land managers, state and local governmental entities, and other interested parties. This project provides incentives for the local groups to build local leadership and an integrated program that will outlive the grant program. 
   * Idaho Wolf Recovery ($1,200,000): The State of Idaho has begun building its recovery program in partnership with the Nez Perce Tribe. As the transition in authority progresses, the federal government must share the cost of managing this federally established population. This effort will help ensure an accurate accounting of the wolf population in Idaho. 
   * Idaho Sage Grouse Management Plan ($500,000): In 1997, the State of Idaho Department of Fish and Game put together a State Sage Grouse Management Plan that sought to prevent the listing of the sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act. The Plan will prioritize, develop, and expedite to the extent practicable all management actions including juniper expansion control, fire rehabilitation, and sagebrush restoration and all other items related to the prevention of sage grouse listing under the Endangered Species Act. 
   * Boise Foothills land conservation ($1,000,000): In May 2001, the citizens of Boise, in one of the highest voter turnouts in City history, elected to tax themselves in order to secure permanent public open space in the Boise Foothills. This provision ensures the participation of the federal Land and Water Conservation Fund, which is also needed as a partner. 
   * Slickspot Peppergrass ($110,000): This line item supports the conservation measures of the candidate conservation agreement between the State of Idaho, through the Office of Species Conservation, in conjunction with its partners: the Idaho National Guard, Bureau of Land Management (BLM), and numerous non-governmental cooperators. This agreement led to the withdrawal of the proposed rule to list the plant as endangered. Continued implementation is necessary under the terms of the agreement and it is important to monitor the results of the measures to ensure that they are effective for the plant. 
   * Henry's Lake land conservation ($750,000): A rapidly changing economy has put stress on traditional agricultural uses of the Henry's Lake Region and is fueling a shift of land use from ranching to second home and resort development. As a result, important ranch lands are being sold off in piecemeal fashion to offset agricultural revenue shortfalls and to meet estate tax commitments. This project would provide for the purchase of ranch land conservation easements, both protecting family lands and assisting county governments by keeping these lands on the county tax rolls.
