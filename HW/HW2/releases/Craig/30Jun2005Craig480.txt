SEN. CRAIG PRAISES NEW FERC CHAIRMAN
  Idaho Sen. Larry Craig issued the following reaction today to President Bush's choice for Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission:  
   "The energy industry has endured much turbulence during the past four years and needs stable regulatory leadership. The President has selected the right man for the job. Joe Kelliher, as Chairman of the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission, will provide knowledgeable, judicious, and mature political leadership at that agency. Joe is one of the most respected experts of utility law in the country and I look forward to working with him on the many challenging issues that the Commission will face in the months and years ahead."
