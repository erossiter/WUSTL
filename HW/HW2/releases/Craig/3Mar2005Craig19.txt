SEN. CRAIG TO SERVE ON INTERIOR APPROPRIATIONS SUBCOMMITTEE
  The Senate Appropriations Committee completed its reorganization last night, and Idaho Sen.  
 Larry Craig picked up a new assignment. He will now serve on the Interior and Related Agencies Subcommittee, along with five other subcommittees. 
   As the chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee's Subcommittee on Forests and Public Lands, he plays a key role in public land policy and has worked closely with Senator Conrad Burns in funding the Department of the Interior and related agencies, such as the USDA Forest Service and the Environmental Protection Agency. As a member of the Subcommittee, he will play a more direct role in crafting the annual funding bill. 
   Over the past couple of months, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees have toiled through a reorganization plan. The Senate finalized their plan late yesterday. After the dust settled, Craig now serves on the following Appropriations Subcommittees: Agriculture, Rural Development, and Related Agencies; Energy and Water Development; Homeland Security; Labor, HHS, and Education; Military Construction and Veterans Affairs; and Interior and Related Agencies. 
   Following the announcement, Craig stated, "These subcommittee assignments will allow me to have more impact over the budgets of agencies important to Idaho. Idahoans pay a tremendous portion of their income to the federal government, so I will continue to work to ensure their federal tax dollars are spent effectively and responsibly." 
   Rep. Mike Simpson, R-Idaho, serves on the Appropriations Committee in the U.S. House of Representatives.
