SENS. DOMENICI, CRAIG APPLAUD HOUSE ACTION TO ADD $500 MILLION FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION EFFORTS
  Senate Energy & Natural Resources Chairman Pete V. Domenici and Forest Subcommittee Chairman Larry Craig applauded action by the House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee today to add an additional $500 million for fire suppression in FY04 and $500 million for the same purpose in FY05.  
   The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee added the funds to the FY2005 Interior Appropriations Bill. Last month, the House passed an FY2005 Budget Resolution to begin the budget process. Senate action on the FY2005 Budget Resolution has been stymied by partisan disputes. 
   Chairman Domenici's statement: 
   "The House Interior Appropriations Subcommittee showed real leadership by recognizing that the responsible way to deal with forest fires is to budget for prevention and suppression efforts. I've tried to accomplish the same result in the Senate. Earlier this year, Senator Burns and I persuaded the Senate Budget Committee to include an additional $500 million for fire suppression in the Senate budget proposal. 
   "Unfortunately, some senators continue to obstruct passage of the resolution. I urge western senators concerned about the high risk of wildfire in their states to stop playing politics with our natural resources and their constituents' safety. Let's pass the FY05 Budget Resolution and let's get down to the business of appropriating the extra fire fighting funds we all agree are needed." 
   Senator Craig's statement: 
   "It is time to stop pointing fingers and start finding solutions. The first step is the passage of the Budget Resolution. Robbing Peter to pay Paul only exaggerates the problem. In the end, we must enact a funding mechanism that allows the agencies to manage our lands, including proactive measures such as the Healthy Forest Restoration Act."
