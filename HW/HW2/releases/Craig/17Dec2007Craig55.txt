SEN. CRAIG, REP. SIMPSON SECURE TRANSPORTATION, ENVIRONMENT, AND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS FOR IDAHO
  Idaho Senator Larry Craig and Congressman Mike Simpson, both members of their respective Appropriations Committees, announced the inclusion of several Idaho-specific projects in the Fiscal Year 2008 year-end spending package.  
   Craig commented approvingly, "Idaho will be a better place because of these projects. Strong transportation infrastructure and a clean, livable environment are catalysts for a strong economy. The upgrades at the Boise Airport will help attract business to Idaho, never mind the godsend to anyone who flies in and out of Boise, and the improvements at Gowen will improve our military's readiness and help ensure Idaho's facilities survive long into the future. " 
   "Economic opportunity largely rests on our ability to transport goods and people in a safe and efficient manner. The new traffic control tower coming to the Boise Airport is desperately needed for safety and to keep up with the growth of the Treasure Valley," said Simpson. "These modest investments in Idaho's communities and infrastructure will help assist ongoing state and local efforts to bring new opportunities to our state."
