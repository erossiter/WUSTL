IDAHO DELEGATION LAUDS PASSAGE OF HOMELAND SECURITY APPROPRIATIONS
  The Idaho Congressional Delegation welcomed final passage of the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations bill Monday. The $33.1 billion bill reflects an increase of nearly 10 percent over FY 2004 funding levels. 
   "This bill demonstrates the commitment of this President and this Congress to safeguard our homeland by improving border security, protecting our country from terrorist threats, and providing the resources to first responders to carry out these missions," said Senator Craig. "The high priority we are placing on protecting Americans at home and successfully fighting terrorism abroad is demonstrated by the fact that we expect a freeze, overall, on appropriations outside Defense and Homeland Security. This also shows our commitment to restore fiscal responsibility."
   Senator Crapo said, "We must be ready to respond to threats against our country's security and safety wherever they may be. This bill moves us further in that direction and it provides Idaho with needed resources in disaster relief, border security, and information and infrastructure support."
   "The passage of this bill is an extremely vital component of our efforts to improve the security of our nation," said Congressman Simpson. "The bill will help protect Americans at home, secure our nation's borders, and ensure our nation's first responders have the resources they need."
   "It doesn't get the headlines of military operations, but improving border security and providing local and state authorities with the tools they need to protect their citizens is just as critical in winning the war on terror," Congressman Otter said. "Helping Americans feel safe and secure in their own homes and communities is the primary role of government. This bill shows we take that responsibility seriously."
   Some of the major programs included in the $33 billion bill include:
   * Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, which is responsible for border security and enforcing the laws for legal entry of persons and goods into the United States
   * Bureau of Immigration and Customs Enforcement, charged with enforcement of immigration laws and deportations
   * Transportation Security Administration
   * Coast Guard
   * Disaster relief and emergency preparedness
   * Information analysis and infrastructure protection
   * Science and technology development
   * Continued state and local formula grants, including local law enforcement terrorism prevention.
