SEN. CRAPO PRAISES GOV. KEMPTHORNE APPOINTMENT
  Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne will make a superior Interior Secretary, Idaho Sen. Mike Crapo said today in response to the announcement that Kempthorne has been chosen to fill the post recently vacated by current Secretary Gale Norton. 
   "Dirk is a westerner, a colleague and a friend who sincerely understands western issues," Crapo said. "We are currently addressing so many important and difficult issues that impact Idaho, and the prospect of working so closely with him in this role is very exciting. Dirk has been an advocate for improving the Endangered Species Act, public lands management, fish recovery and I look forward to him working collaboratively with Congress to address these and many issues."
   Crapo continued, "Dirk served well as a U.S. Senator and has worked to improve Idaho's natural resources and land as our Governor. I have confidence he will serve the nation as well as he served Idaho in this capacity as Secretary of the Interior."
   Kempthorne and Crapo were elected to the U.S. Senate and House respectively in 1992 and Crapo filled Kempthorne's Senate seat when Kempthorne was elected to be the governor of Idaho.
