INTELLIGENCE REFORM CLEARS SENATE
  S.2845, the Intelligence Reform bill, was approved by the U.S. Senate today with strong bipartisan support. Idaho Sens. Larry Craig and Mike Crapo both voted in support of the measure, which passed 89-2.  
   S.2845 overhauls the intelligence gathering and analysis capabilities of the United States to deal more effectively with the threats of the 21st Century. 
   "I applaud the passage of this much needed Intelligence Reform bill," said Craig. "At last, we will have a central entity that is charged with sharing intelligence within and between our intelligence services. Without question, this reform will go a long way toward coordinating and fighting terrorism at home and abroad. However, even with passage of this bill, there is still much work to be done within our intelligence agencies and how they are conducting human intelligence in the field. With that, I look forward to building on the success of this bill and continuing to improve our agencies to help safeguard our national interests and personal security." 
   Senator Crapo said, "Congress took an important step today to better coordinate and analyze the intelligence collection of and dissemination from our intelligence community. The long road that began with the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, culminates in the dramatic changes in this bill that will help the way men and women in our intelligence agencies support the nation's decision makers. I also want to applaud the President for the many administrative changes he has initiated to facilitate the changes Congress is making with this legislation. With threats to our national security and the American people such a real and demonstrated issue, it is critical that all levels of government act decisively and effectively to improve the combined efforts of our intelligence community." 
   The bill now goes to President Bush for his signature.
