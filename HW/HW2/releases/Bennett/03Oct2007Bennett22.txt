  Bennett and Senate Colleagues Call for $3 Billion to Secure U.S. Border   WASHINGTON, D.C.  As the Senate prepares to wrap up the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill, the chamber overwhelmingly agreed to a provision, supported by Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah), that will give a $3 billion boost in security along the U.S. border.  The American people have asked Congress to make border security a priority, and today the Senate responded with $3 billion to put toward that effort, said Bennett. The Senate overwhelmingly agreed to the amendment sponsored by Senator Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) by a vote of 95-1.  The amendment will accomplish the following:A similar Graham provision was included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill passed by the Senate in July. The Senate agreed to add the language to the Defense Appropriations Bill, as it will likely move more quickly through conference than the homeland security spending bill. Final passage of the defense spending bill is expected tonight.# # #
