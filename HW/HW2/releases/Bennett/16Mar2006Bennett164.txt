  	âDirk and I were elected to the Senate in the same cycle and served together for one term.  Heâs a great friend and a fellow westerner.  Dirkâs a man of great capacity who understands the issues extremely well.  Also, and of great importance, heâs a man of good temperament who doesnât bring a divisive tone to public service.    
  	âDirk Kempthorne is as good a choice as the president could have made. Iâm delighted with this announcement.â?
