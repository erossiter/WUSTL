UVSC Gets Federal Boost for Forensics Program                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
  	âThe forensic science program will be a tremendous addition to the school,â? Bennett said. âIts contributions will be important to law enforcement and homeland security across Utah and the nation.â?    
  	The U.S. Bureau of Justice Assistance awarded nearly $400,000 to the Orem-based campus this week. These funds, secured by Bennett in the Fiscal Year 2005 Commerce, State, and Justice Appropriations Bill, will go toward equipment, supplies, and minor renovations to support the academic study of forensics.	    
  The new program will benefit students as well as law enforcement officers working in the field and crime labs. Students specializing in forensic science will have a unique hands-on experience, while local and state law enforcement agencies will have access to a new pool of highly-specialized college graduates. The grant will complement the schoolâs existing courses in criminal justice, fire science, technology, and core scientific disciplines.
