  Bennett Votes to Protect the Jobs of Millions of Americans     Minimum Wage Bill Passes Senate, Includes Provisions to Minimize Burden on Small Businesses   

	âI agree with economic studies that show an increase in minimum wage would actually decrease job opportunities for those with minimal skills. However, I voted for the bipartisan compromise because it includes provisions that will minimize the burden on small businesses that employ millions of Americans, and will allow them to continue to grow and create jobs,â? said Bennett.    

	The House of Representatives passed a similar bill two weeks ago that also increased the minimum wage by $2.10 over 26 months, but did not provide tax relief for small businesses. Because the House and Senate bills are not identical, a conference will now occur to reconcile the differences. Following the conclusion of the conference, the House and Senate will vote on final passage and send the bill to the president for his signature.
