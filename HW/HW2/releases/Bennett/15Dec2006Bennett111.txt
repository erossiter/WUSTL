  Mantua Fire Department Receives Funding to Replace 1969 Fire Engine   

âOur local firefighters depend on safe and reliable equipment to protect themselves from harm, and this funding will go a long way to help the Mantua Fire Department modernize some of its equipment,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that approves the USFA budget. âThe volunteer firefighters deserve our thanks for their commitment and honorable service to the community.â?    

The Mantua Fire Department is staffed by 25 volunteers. The grant will be used to replace the outdated 1969 fire engine, which would have been difficult to purchase on the departmentâs $6,000 annual budget. The grant comes at a critical time as Mantua experiences tremendous growth, brought on by new subdivisions and population influx.      

Mantua Fire Chief Dave Derricott said, âThis is a big shot in the arm for our station. We heavily rely on hand-me-down equipment from other stations, and now we donât have to worry about the safety of our equipment in responding to emergencies. What a great Christmas gift.â?     

The Mantua Volunteer Fire Department is the eighth Utah department this year to receive a grant. The Ivins Fire Department in Washington County also received a $68,134 federal grant this week to improve fire operations and firefighter safety. Last year, 33 Utah departments received over $2.1 million from USFA.    

The USFA, an agency within the Department of Homeland Security, provides funding to fire departments across the nation through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. For more information on the program, please visit USFAâs website at www.firegrantsupport.com.
