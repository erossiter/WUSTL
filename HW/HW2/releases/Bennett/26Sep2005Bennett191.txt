Federal Government Cuts UTA Check for $6 Million                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  	âGrowth in Utah and its effect on transportation infrastructure continue to challenge state officials, and any relief the federal government can provide is welcome,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. âThe money is particularly important to commuter rail and intermodal terminals, which will serve as convenient locations bringing mass transit together.â?    
  	The $6 million federal assistance is broken into three parts:    
  â¢	$2.7 million â UTA reimbursement for the preliminary engineering phase of the Weber County to Salt Lake Commuter Rail Project. The project is approximately 40 miles in length, with seven stations from the City of Pleasant View, north of Ogden, to Salt Lake City.     
  â¢	$2.3 million â Purchase land that will be used for a future intermodal terminal in West Valley City. Funds  also help continued engineering and construction of the Gateway Intermodal Terminal, located at 200 South and 600 West.    
  â¢	$2 million â Replacement for five commuter buses, which service high-demand commuter routes along the Wasatch Front.
