  Bennett Calls President's Decision to Nominate Hill Commander for Pentagon Air Force Post a Good Move   

            "I would like to congratulate General Sullivan on his pending promotion to lieutenant general and new assignment as deputy chief of staff at Air Force Installations, Logistics, and Mission Support Headquarters," said Bennett. "Hill will lose a powerful leader, but the United States Air Force will continue to benefit from his capable service. I look forward to working with him in his new capacity."    
              No announcement has been made yet on who will replace Sullivan at HAFB.
