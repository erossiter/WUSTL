Bennett Announces More Flood Assistance Funds for Southern Utah                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  	창The flooding that occurred in southern Utah last year was devastating to the residents and communities. I창ve worked hard to help my colleagues and the administration understand the scope of this disaster and I창m pleased that assistance continues to come to the area,창? said Bennett, who serves as subcommittee chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture.     
  	The Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) at USDA will distribute the $1.2 million to Kane County from unused funds returned to the department. The proposed work will protect approximately six miles of a county road that is one of the main access arteries leading into the Grand Staircase Escalante National Monument and also connects western Garfield and Kane Counties. EWP funds will also be used to provide protection of electricity utilities from Glen Canyon Dam to southern California. Bennett communicated the needs of Kane County to USDA, and encouraged them to use any available funds for the clean-up efforts in the county.    
  	Bennett was one of the first public officials to tour the flood damage in January 2005. From his position on the Senate Appropriations Committee he actively sought the support of his colleagues to secure emergency assistance for the region.    
  	The EWP program uses emergency measures to safeguard lives and property from floods, drought, and erosion on any watershed whenever fire, flood or any other natural occurrence is causing or has caused a sudden impairment of the watershed.
