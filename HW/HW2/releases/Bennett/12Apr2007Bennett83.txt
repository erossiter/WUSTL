  Senator Bennett Votes To Support Stem Cell Research Bills     President vows to veto one bill, future of the other is uncertain   

  "I supported efforts to increase the government's commitment to stem cell research because I believe it provides great hope for the many Americans affected by debilitating diseases today. Federal involvement will not only help move this promising science forward, but it will ensure that it occurs under strict ethical and procedural guidelines.     

  "Because the first bill passed today faces a presidential veto, I believe the Coleman-Isakson compromise makes a lot of sense. Republicans and Democrats alike voted for this bill, and the president has indicated he will support it. Now it is up to the House. If they refuse to take it up, it will be clear that they are playing politics with this very important issue."
