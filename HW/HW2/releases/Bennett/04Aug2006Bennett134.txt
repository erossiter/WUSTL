$3.1 Million Coming to St. George for I-15 Improvements                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          
  	âAs St. George continues to address the dramatic growth challenges in the region, meeting transportation needs will remain a top priority,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation. âIâm pleased to help bring federal dollars back to the local level, and will continue efforts to fund this critical project.â?    
  	The current Bluff Street and I-15 interchange is causing serious traffic delays with back-up along Bluff Street and an I-15 off-ramp. These funds, secured by Bennett in last yearâs transportation spending bill, will be used to increase the distance between the southbound I-15 interchange and the intersection of Bluff Street and Main Street. Bluff Street will also be widened as part of the project.     
  	The Senate Appropriations Committee this year also approved Bennettâs request for an additional $750,000 for the project.
