  Statement of Senator Bob Bennett on the Death of President Gerald Ford   

"I am saddened by the passing of President Ford, whom I knew best in his position as Republican Leader in the House of Representatives. He was thoroughly decent, dedicated to doing whatever was the right thing regardless of Party, and always approachable. He represented what is best in a public servant.     

"Joyce and I extend our condolences to the Ford family at this time," said Senator Bob Bennett.
