  Senate Passes Bennett Amendment Requiring Expedited Plan to Move Moab Tailings Site   WASHINGTON, DC  Last night the United States Senate voted to support an amendment by Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) that would expedite a plan by the U.S. Department of Energy to move the uranium tailings in Grand County, Utah, away from the banks of the Colorado River, a vital natural resource in the region. I have said all along it is entirely unacceptable for the clean-up of these tailings to take over 20 years. I believe it is completely doable and logical to have it completed by 2019, and my amendment requires the secretary of energy to put forward a plan to do just that, said Bennett, who is a member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations subcommittee and has secured nearly $70 million in federal dollars since 2000 for the remediation of the site.The Bennett amendment (S.Amdt 3102 to S. Amdt 2011) was included in the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008, which passed the Senate Monday night. Earlier this year, Bennett questioned Department of Energy officials during a Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee hearing over their proposed 21 year timetable to clean up the tailings site. Bennett made clear that the timeline was unacceptable, and subsequently wrote a letter to the energy secretary expressing his concerns.The Moab site is of particular public interest due to its close proximity to the banks of the Colorado River. As the pile continues to leak contaminants to the river through the groundwater, concerns rise over the potential impact on endangered native fish species habitat, the environment, and downstream water users. Public interest is also heightened by how close the site is to a Nature Conservancy wetlands preserve and its shared boundary with Arches Park.# # #
