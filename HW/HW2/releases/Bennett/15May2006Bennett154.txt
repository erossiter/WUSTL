 	âIâve always said that as the former governor of a border state, President Bush understands this issue better than anyone else in Washington. He showed that tonight.  
 	âAs we address this in the Senate, Iâm hoping the Senate bill will incorporate all the elements the president laid out and fill in the gaps of the House bill,â? said Sen. Bennett.
