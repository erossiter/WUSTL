  Bennett Says Lobbying Bill is False Advertisement - Produces No Serious Reform  
 WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) voted against S. 1  Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act of 2007  on the grounds that the legislation will not produce any real reform and will complicate the constitutional right to petition the government. He offered the following statement immediately following the vote on final passage. I am grateful that my amendment with respect to grassroots lobbying was included in this bill, however the measure moves awfully close to restricting a persons First Amendment rights. The constitutional right to petition the government for redress of our grievances is as sacred as our freedom of speech and freedom of religion. This bill just goes too far in complicating the process of petitioning without producing any real meaningful reform or constraints on spending. I voted against it in protest that it is a false advertisement under the label of reform, said Bennett.# # #
