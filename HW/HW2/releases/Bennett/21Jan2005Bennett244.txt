Bennett Praises Bushâs Second Inaugural Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
 	âIn President Bushâs second inaugural, he rose above the details that he covered in his first, and gave the country, and indeed the world, a view of the vision he has for the eventual world peace.  
 	âHe is absolutely convinced that the spread of liberty and the establishment of freedom in other countries will indeed give us lasting peace. He made that case very eloquently, very directly, and I think quite movingly in his inaugural address here today. It was a great moment in American history.â?
