Bennett Responds to Pres. Bush's Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           
  	âI commend the president for his timely nomination of Judge Samuel Alito to serve on the Supreme Court. Judge Alitoâs impressive credentials and extensive legal experience position him well for this post. Fifteen years ago, the Senate unanimously confirmed Judge Alito as a circuit court judge, and I encourage my colleagues to, once again, move this nomination forward in an expeditious manner.â?
