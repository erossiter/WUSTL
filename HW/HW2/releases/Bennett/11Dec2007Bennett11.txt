  Bennett Encourages Utahns to Nominate America's Best for Above & Beyond Honors   Washington, D.C.Utah Senator Bob Bennett today encouraged Utahns to nominate deserving citizens, colleagues, co-workers, family, and friends for the Above  Beyond Citizen Honors, which recognizes Americans who go out of their way to make a difference in the lives of others. I encourage every Utahn to look around their communities at the individuals who really make a difference and nominate them for this honor. Even though they do not seek recognition for their acts of kindness we can all learn from their examples, said Bennett. Above  Beyond is a nonpartisan initiative directed by The Congressional Medal of Honor Society. The organization will recognize and honor Americans who have made a difference in the lives of others through an act of heroism, or through their continued commitment of putting others before themselves. After nominations have been received, one finalist will be selected from every state. From these nominees, three will be chosen to receive the Above  Beyond Citizen Honors, one of the nations highest civilian honors. On March 25, 2008, National Medal of Honor Day, The Congressional Medal of Honor Society will present the awards during a live event hosted by Brian Williams at Constitution Hall in Washington, D.C., and broadcast to the nation on March 30. Former U.S. Secretary of State and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell, and Presidents William Jefferson Clinton and George H.W. Bush are co-chairs of the event. Nominations for the Above  Beyond Citizen Honors can be submitted by filling out an online form at www.aboveandbeyond365.com. Forms must be received by December 16, 2007, in order to be considered. # # #
