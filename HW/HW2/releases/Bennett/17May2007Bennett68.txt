  Bennett Commends House for Upholding First Amendment Rights   

  "I am pleased to see the House Judiciary Committee join me in defeating efforts that would clearly infringe upon the rights of Americans to petition their government," said Bennett. "The Supreme Court has ruled that grassroots advocacy is at the zenith of protected political speech under the First Amendment. I fought hard in the Senate to protect this core freedom, and I commend the committee for doing the same."     

  In January when the Senate took up its version of the lobbying reform bill, S.1, Bennett championed an amendment that removed section 220 - The Disclosure of Paid Efforts to Stimulate Grassroots Lobbying. Today, the House Judiciary Committee rejected Representative Martin Meehan's (D-Mass.) attempt to include language in the House bill similar to the provision Bennett successfully opposed in the Senate.
