Bennett Says GDP Growth is Proof the Economy Remains on Solid Footing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
  	âTodayâs announcement that the GDP grew an impressive 4.8 percent is proof that the economy remains on solid footing,â? said Bennett, vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. âThis is the highest growth since the third quarter of 2003, confirming once again that economic expansion remains strong.â?    
  	Below are additional highlights of the BEA report:    
		  â¢	The major contributors to GDP growth in the first quarter were personal consumption expenditures (grew 5.5 percent), business equipment and software spending (grew 16.4 percent), exports (grew 12.1 percent), and federal government spending (grew 10.8 percent). Imports, which are a subtraction from GDP, grew 13.0 percent.     
  â¢	The acceleration in growth (from 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter to 4.8 percent in the first) reflected faster growth in personal consumption expenditures for durable goods, an upturn in federal government spending, and faster growth in equipment and software and in exports.      
  â¢	Growth in the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index excluding food and energy prices, the Federal Reserveâs preferred measure of consumer price inflation, declined to an annualized 2 percent in the first quarter from 2.4 percent in the fourth quarter.
