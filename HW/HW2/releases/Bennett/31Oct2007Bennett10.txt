  Bennett Applauds Bush Nominee for Next U.S. Agriculture Secretray    WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) issued the following statement after President Bush today announced the nomination of former North Dakota Governor Edward Schafer as the next secretary of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).I commend President Bush on this nomination, said Bennett, ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration, and Related Agencies. Governor Schafer has been a strong advocate for agriculture in his years of service in North Dakota, and I look forward to working with him on the many issues facing the agricultural community.Schafer served as governor of North Dakota from 1992 to 2000 where he gained extensive experience with the agriculture industry. While governor, he directed responses to eight statewide disasters, including drought, flood, and fire. He also oversaw initial development of North Dakotas biofuel industries and led an agricultural trade mission to China to help open new markets for North Dakota farms.  If confirmed, Schafer will head the USDA in its mission to provide leadership on food, agriculture, and natural resources. The department is charged with providing financing to help expand job opportunities and improve housing, utilities, and infrastructure in rural America; enhancing food safety; improving nutrition and health; and managing and protecting America's public and private lands. USDA also works with other agencies to expand markets for agricultural products, and further develop alternative markets for agricultural products and activities.# # #
