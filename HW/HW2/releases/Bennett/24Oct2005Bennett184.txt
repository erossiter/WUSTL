Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah), a senior member of the Senate Banking Committee and vice-chairman of the Joint Economic Committee, today praised President Bushs nomination of Ben Bernanke to serve as chairman of the Federal Reserve and issued the following statement:The president has made an excellent choice in Ben Bernanke to serve as chairman of the Fed. Succeeding Alan Greenspan will be very difficult; but Dr. Bernanke has the credentials that make him an exceptional candidate. He has served on the Federal Reserve Board under Chairman Greenspans leadership. He understands its operations and brings a background of practical experience as well as academic excellence to this assignment. Ive been impressed in his appearances before the Joint Economic Committee and I look forward to working with him after hes confirmed.
