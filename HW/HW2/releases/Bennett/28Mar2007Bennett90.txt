  Bennett Pushes For Funding That Will Increase Payments To Utah Counties By Millions     Senator Says Full Funding for PILT and Secure Rural Schools is Long Overdue   

	"For decades, Utah counties have faced woefully inadequate compensation for public lands within their borders. We changed that today with passage of this amendment," said Bennett. "Finally, we can correct the imbalance we've faced for so many years and forge a way to send more funding to counties that need and deserve it most."    

  Bennett is an original cosponsor of the Wyden- Reid amendment that will fully fund the PILT program for the first time since 1994. Administered by the Department of the Interior, PILT payments are intended to off-set the loss of tax revenues due to the tax-exempt status of public lands. The payments also help counties provide services required under the myriad of unfunded federal mandates. Last year all 29 Utah counties received PILT payments, totaling more than $20 million. If this becomes law, payments nationwide would increase by more than $100 million over the fiscal year 2006 level ($232.1 million).     

  	The amendment will also reauthorize the SRS Program, which expired on September 30, 2006, and the last payment was made in December 2006. President Bush has proposed a five-year extension, but it is uncertain when Congress would act on that extension. This amendment will restore funding for SRS and give much needed assistance for rural counties affected by the decline in revenue from timber harvests in federal lands. Traditionally, these counties relied on a share of receipts from timber harvests to supplement local funding for school systems and roads. Funding from SRS has been used to support more than 4,400 rural schools and to help maintain county road systems.     

	The amendment passed the Senate by a vote of 75-22.
