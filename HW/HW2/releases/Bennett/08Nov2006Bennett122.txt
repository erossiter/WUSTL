Bennett Thanks Rumsfeld For Service, Says Gates Excellent Choice For Top Pentagon Post                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          

	âIt is not a surprise that Secretary Rumsfeld has decided to step down at this time. He has served for six years in a very demanding and tough position, and his sacrifice and service to our country, particularly as a key leader in the War on Terror, should be noted.     

	âThe president has made an excellent choice by nominating Robert Gates as the next defense secretary. I have met him and he certainly has the right background to succeed in this post. As a member of the Baker-Hamilton commission, he will bring a fresh perspective on how we move forward in Iraq, and I look forward to working with him on this and other important foreign policy issues,â? said Bennett.
