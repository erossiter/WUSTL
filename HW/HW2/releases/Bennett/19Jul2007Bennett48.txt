  Utah Agriculture Projects Get Over $24 Million     Bennett includes over $17 million for renowned USU ag program  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved a bill that will provide over $24 million for Utah projects requested by Senator Bob Bennett, as a part of the fiscal year 2008 spending bill for the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA).   Every Utahn, from the farmers and ranchers who depend on the land for their livelihood, to families who trust that the food they buy at local markets is safe, relies on the agriculture programs funded in this bill, said Bennett, ranking Republican on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture. I am pleased we were able to set aside a large portion of this funding to enhance learning opportunities for USU students, who continue to pioneer ground breaking research.    Of the $24.76 million Bennett secured for Utah, $17.77 million is designated for agriculture research and a new high-tech facility at Utah State University (USU).    Below are USU projects included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill. Additional Utah projects are listed after the USU projects. Agriculture Research Center $8 million Funding will support the planning, design, and preliminary stages of construction for a new USU facility that will bolster 21st Century research, teaching, and services, and make USU the focus of agriculture research in the West. The building will provide space to enhance collaborative opportunities between USU faculty, USDA and Agriculture Research Service (ARS) researchers. The planned building will replace the aging agricultural science facilities and will provide USU with a state-of-the-art, high-tech facility connected to three different labs on campus. Jack H. Berryman Institute for Wildlife Damage Management    $1.5 millionThe Jack H. Berryman Institute is a collaborative program with Mississippi State University that researches scientifically based solutions for wildlife disease threats and wildlife economics in the western U.S. Since its creation in 1993, the purpose of the Institute is to give students opportunities for inter-institutional, multi-disciplinary research and outreach programs and create a better educated workforce to resolve human-wildlife problems in the U.S. This funding will expand the institute to start addressing relevant eastern issues. In the last four years, Bennett has obtained nearly $5.5 million for the Institute.Advanced Computation Research and Education System (ACRES)   $750,000The $750,000 will be used for computing equipment and grants for faculty and students. The ACRES system will help integrate high performance computing technologies into agricultural and natural resource programs at USDA. Bennett has secured over $1 million for this project over the last two years.Research and Education Outreach at the Utah Botanical Center   $900,000The Utah Botanical Center serves as a regional learning and research center to promote natural resource conservation. Research will support production of low water-use plants in sustainable home landscapes for high-desert environments. Over the last four years, Bennett has garnered over $3.2 million to continue this important research.Drought Management Initiative   $900,000 Utah and the Intermountain West experience periodic droughts that severely limit water supplies, damage agriculture products, and threaten economic growth.This initiative seeks to develop accurate prediction of water yield, improved agricultural irrigation, and better management of urban water demand. Bee Biology and Systematics Laboratory  $302,000This lab conducts pollen research that helps farmers increase their crop yields. The honeybee colony population in the U.S. is currently experiencing a significant collapse and beekeepers throughout the country are reporting losses. It is estimated that bee pollination, which farmers rely on for crop production, is responsible for 30 percent of the U.S. food supply. The sudden loss of colonies could lead to food supply shortages. This funding and research at USU are critical to further explore the current bee shortage and the effects of pollen on crop production. Predator Ecology Research Station at the Wildlife Research Center   $1.38 million This project continues research on large predators of Utah and the Intermountain West, and particularly how they affect the livestock industry. The center is located in Millville, Utah. Bennett secured $1.38 million in fiscal year 2006 for the center. U.S./China Joint Biotechnology Research Programs    $600,000In collaboration with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology, Xiamen University and the Northwest Sci-Tech University of Agricultural and Forestry of the People's Republic of China, USU will develop joint research programs in agricultural biotechnology including infectious diseases, livestock cloning and genetics, crop production, and irrigation. The funding will be used for professional exchange, intensive short courses, training, and internships in an effort to promote greater economic and agricultural development in the U.S. and China. Air Quality Center Research Program  $417,000 High production in agricultural regions requires producers to modify their existing practices to reduce harmful emissions like diesel powered machinery, harvest operations and burning. Emissions can impact human health, property values and the environment. These funds will support the continuation of a program that develops and evaluates agricultural emissions measurement procedures and determines the environmental benefits of reduced emissions to meet Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) standards and improve air quality for Utahns.Center for Public Lands and Rural Economies  $300,000The center conducts research on the impact public land ownership has on rural communities, and particularly their ability to meet other budgetary demands like health care and education. Funding will be used for research materials, publication costs, and travel to 19 Utah counties. Bennett has secured nearly $700,000 in the past four years for the project. Biotechnology and Genomics Research Program  $1.6 million Research studies through the program will examine how organisms interact with their environment by extracting information from existing plants, animals, and microbes genome sequences. Bennett has secured over $4 million for the project since fiscal year 2004. Pasture and Forage Research   $250,000 This will complete a USU research project, affiliated with the Utah Agricultural Experiment Station, that focuses on the integration of improved forage species and pastures, resulting in a system that can better meet the needs of the livestock industry. Funding will primarily be used to fund graduate and undergraduate student research. Over the last four years, Bennett has secured nearly $900,000 for the research. Forage and Range Research    $876,000 Funds will continue research on grasses that use less water, use it more efficiently and perform well with poor quality irrigation water.  Below are additional Utah projects requested by Bennett and approved by the committee in this year's bill:Collaborative Drug Safety Research - University of Utah (U of U) and Critical Path Institute (CPI)  $750,000 This funding will continue to enable scientists from the U of U, the Critical Path Institute in Arizona and the FDA to identify genetic tests that predict how patients will respond to drugs used to treat heart failure, including the blood thinner Warfarin. This collaborative effort has been extremely successful in developing tests for Warfarin. It is estimated that integrating genetic testing into Warfarin therapy could allow Americans to avoid 85,000 serious bleeding events and 17,000 strokes annually, reducing health care spending by approximately $1.1 billion annually.This research will enhance patient safety, reduce the number of patients necessary for clinical testing, and enable manufacturers to accelerate drug development and bring safer, innovative life-saving drugs to market more quickly. In May, Bennett held a field hearing at the U of U to discuss the success and future of FDAs Critical Path program. Mormon Crickets  $1.5 millionThis funding allows Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to continue eradication and control of Mormon crickets in Utah. Mormon cricket infestation has damaged critical habitats, grazing lands, and crop lands throughout several western states. Eradication of these insects will benefit farmers, ranchers, wildlife and public and private land in Utah to ensure crops reach their harvest. Since fiscal year 2004, Bennett has secured over $3 million for cricket infestation. Utah Conservation Initiative  $3.65 million Funding for this initiative, administered by the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), will help meet conservation and natural resources needs statewide.Fresh Fruit and Veggie Program  $500,000 This program, reauthorized by the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004, allows 25 schools throughout Utah to serve fresh and dried fruits and fresh vegetables free to school children. In fiscal year 2006, Bennett helped appropriate $1 million for the program in Utah.Water Quality Pilot Project   $350,000  This bill will continue funding for a non-regulatory program that protects surface and ground water from concentrated animal feeding operation (CAFO) and animal feeding operation (AFO) waste. Chronic Wasting Disease   $244,000This project allows USDA's APHIS program to continue research that addresses problems associated with deer and elk in different regions of the U.S., including Utah, testing positive for Chronic Wasting Disease (CDW). Additional programs of interest to the state are highlighted below:USDA Mutual Self-Help Housing Program  $38 million   The bill includes a nearly $5 million increase over last years level for the USDA Mutual Self-Help Housing Loan program, which has been very successful in Utah.The program enables low-income families to buy a new home at an affordable rate by participating in the construction process. Six to 10 participants work together as a group with a construction supervisor to build approximately 65 percent of their homes. The program takes about 10 to 11 months and the participants complete their homes simultaneously  no one moves in until all the homes in the group are completed. The labor acts as the down payment and reduces the price of the home by approximately 20 percent.        The USDA program has been in existence for 40 years and has helped over 15,000 families across the U.S. Since the program started in Utah in 1972, 628 homes have been built throughout the state including developments in Kamas, Oakley, Moab, and Brigham City. Western States Wildlife Services Operations   $10.7 millionWith well over 250,000 sheep and nearly 150,000 cattle lost each year to predators, the livestock industry faces major expenses associated with livestock losses and predator control costs. This funding will assist in predator control, while helping to protect this industrys economic survival.Scrapie Eradication   $18.6 millionIt is estimated that scrapie, a fatal brain disease affecting the nation's sheep flocks and goat herds, costs the sheep and goat industry over $20 million annually in lost export sales, lost productivity, and other costs. These funds will help accelerate the secretary's program for scrapie eradication.Grazing Lands Conservation Initiative $27.7 millionThe Initiative is a nationwide collaborative process of individuals and organizations working to maintain and improve the management, productivity, and health of grazing land. Concerns about invasive species and western grazing lands will also be addressed.The spending measure will now be placed on the Senate calendar and be considered at a later date.# # #
