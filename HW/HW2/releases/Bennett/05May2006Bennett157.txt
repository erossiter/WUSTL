10 Rural Utah Communities Get Over $10 million for Water System Upgrades                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 	âWater storage in our rural communities remains a difficult and expensive challenge,â? said Sen. Bennett.  âWe canât run the risk of water treatment systems that arenât properly maintained, or water storage facilities that canât adequately store precious drinking water. These funds can help prevent these potential problems and make necessary projects affordable. Iâm delighted this program is underway and bringing relief to rural Utah.â?  
 	The 2003 legislation authored by Bennett formed the Utah Environmental Infrastructure and Resource Protection and Development Program and authorized the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) to use up to $25 million to help develop local water systems in small communities.  The new program was established as an amendment to Section 595 of the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) and applies to all counties outside the Wasatch Front and St. George. Though authorized for $25 million, Congress must approve annual appropriations for the program.  The federal share of 75 percent is matched by a local share of 25 percent.  
 	One million dollars in grants were issued to Utah communities in the programâs first year, but due to increased interest, Bennett secured an additional $10 million last year.  The grants will be used for design and construction of Section 595 projects including renovation or construction of wastewater treatment facilities, drinking water supply, environmental restoration and surface water resource protection and development.  
 	Todayâs announcement from the Army Corps identifies the following municipalities selected to receive funds in this yearâs allocation:  
Kane County $550,000; Moroni $352,000; Richmond $27,000; Uintah County $307,000; Blanding $1,320,000; Cedar City $1,710,000; Logan $4,260,000; Mantua $465,000; Park City $600,000; Snyderville $222,000.  
 	Communities interested in being considered for future federal assistance should contact Scott Stoddard at the USACE, scott.stoddard@usace.army.mil .
