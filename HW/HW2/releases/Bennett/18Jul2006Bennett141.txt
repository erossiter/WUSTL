Bennett Supports Stem Cell Research, Votes for Continued Funding in Regulated Environment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
  	창I supported the president in his effort to initiate federal funding for stem cell research and, as a result, we have learned a lot. Unfortunately, however, the stem cell lines approved for research are deteriorating. Therefore, the question is whether we refresh the number of embryos already marked for this research. After studying the issue and hearing the recommendation of Senator Bill Frist, a physician himself, I am supportive of refreshing the number of stem cell lines and keeping the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the   research mix.    
  창The issue is not a question of whether stem cell research will go forward. That issue has already been determined as states, such as California and New Jersey have  made the commitment to fund research on stem cell lines. The question now is whether the federal government will be involved. I believe that it is essential for both scientific and ethical reasons that the federal government, through the NIH, maintains an investment in this research. If the NIH were cut out all together, as it would be without this bill, the federal government would be left without any say in the ethical guidelines framing this promising   science.창?    
				  Senator Bennett also voted in favor or two other measures relating to stem cell research 창 the first would outlaw creating embryos solely for research purposes and the second authorizes funding for additional types of stem cell research.  All three bills passed the Senate.
