Bennett, FAA Administrator Discuss Decision to Move Forward with St. George Replacement Airport                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  	âThis announcement is a long-time in coming and is obviously great news for St. George, the surrounding areas, and the state,â? said Bennett. âThe current airport does not meet the requirements of modern aircraft and cannot be modified to conform to the FAA standards. Iâm pleased that the FAA recognizes this and will take the necessary steps to ensure that a new replacement airport is built to accommodate the future demands of one of the stateâs fastest growing areas.â?    
  	Bennett and other members of the delegation have worked with the FAA over the years to respond to concerns and questions about the replacement airport proposal. Because of the interest and support of the congressional delegation, former Transportation Secretary Norm Mineta selected the St. George Replacement Airport Project as one of the nationâs critical transportation projects to receive expedited environmental reviews under Executive Order 13274.    
  	Now that the ROD is signed, FAA will place in the Federal Register a notice of its availability for public review. The Office of the Associate Administrator for Airports will now work with St. George on an Airport Improvement Program grant for land acquisition before the end of this fiscal year.
