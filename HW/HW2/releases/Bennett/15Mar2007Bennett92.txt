  Bennett's 10-Year Effort For New Salt Lake Courthouse Gets $16 Million Boost    

	"Today we cleared a major hurdle in moving this project forward, and I am happy to announce that the final $16.4 million needed for site and design work is on its way to Salt Lake," Bennett said, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and strong proponent of this project. "The current building is showing its age and the court system is feeling the pressures of growth, making expansion necessary. This funding shows a strong commitment from the government that this courthouse is a priority."    

  	The existing courthouse is inadequate to meet the growing needs of the court and the old courtroom design falls below current standards.  Additionally, as the current courthouse fails to provide for secure prisoner circulation, security at the facility is threatened.  The new courthouse will meet the 10-year space needs of the court as well as the 30-year expansion requirements. Currently, the U.S. District Court, U.S. Marshals Service and related support staff are housed in the building.    

  	In 2002, Bennett secured over $11 million for design and land acquisition for the proposed new 330,000 square foot courthouse in downtown Salt Lake City, which will be managed by the General Services Administration (GSA). The project has been stalled in the site and design stage for more than ten years due to various concerns, namely how to minimize the impact on neighboring historic buildings. Those concerns have been resolved, allowing the project to move forward.
