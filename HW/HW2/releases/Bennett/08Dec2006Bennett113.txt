  Senate Confirms Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach as the Next FDA Commissioner     Senator Bennett says new commissioner is an outstanding choice  

창I am convinced that Dr. von Eschenbach is a man with a vision, someone who looks to the horizon and then beyond to see where the FDA ought to be,창? said Bennett, who is the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture, which has jurisdiction over the allocation of federal funds for the agency. 창The president has made an outstanding choice in Dr. von Eschenbach, and the country will be well served to have him in this place.창?      

The nomination, which passed the Senate by a vote of 80-11, will now be sent to the president.
