Bennett Applauds DOE News: Moab Tailings Should Be Moved                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 	âI have always believed that the best action, given the science, was to move the Atlas tailings pile,â? said Bennett. âI am pleased with the Department of Energyâs announcement today and remain committed to securing federal funds to expedite the process.â?  
 	In February Bennett, along with the other members of the Utah congressional delegation, sent a letter to Secretary of Energy Sam Bodman urging him to select an alternative that would move the tailings from the banks of the Colorado River. Bennett also addressed these issues with Bodman in several meetings over the past few months. Bennett, as a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water, has also ensured that federal funding was available to continue work on the remediation of the Atlas uranium tailings site while DOE made decisions about final disposition of the pile.  
 	The preferred alternatives will be included in DOEâs final Environmental Impact Statement, but they do not indicate that the department has reached a final decision on the remediation of the Moab site.
