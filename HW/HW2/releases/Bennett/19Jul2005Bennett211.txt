     "Judge John Roberts is a superb choice to serve on the Supreme Court. I happened to be  one of the 70 senators the president mentioned who were consulted in the process of this choice.  When the White House called me to get my input, I said I hoped the president would not feel compelled to fill a quota with this nominee 창 whether a gender quota, an ethnic quota, or an ideological quota 창 rather, get the very best person you can find and let the ideology and diversity chips fall where they may. I think they창ve done that. Judge Roberts창 credentials are outstanding and I look forward to an orderly and appropriately solemn confirmation process," said Bennett.
