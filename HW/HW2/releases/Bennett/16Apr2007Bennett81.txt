  Senator Bennett Expresses Great Sympathy Over The Virginia Tech Tragedy    
 
"Today I wish to pause and express on behalf of the people of Utah our great sympathy for and anguish over the great tragedy that occurred in the state of Virginia. I was once a resident of the state of Virginia and am now a physical resident of the state of Virginia, remaining a legal resident of Utah, and I feel close to the people of Virginia.     

"Virginia is known for its system of colleges spread throughout the state in magnificent rural settings - and Blacksburg, Virginia, is one of those settings, and Virginia Tech is one of those colleges. It comes as an enormous shock, and a sense of horror, to discover that a single student can be sufficiently disturbed in this quiet kind of setting to vent all of his demons in such a manner. I want the people of Virginia, and the students and parents of Virginia Tech, to know that they are not alone in their horror and their grief, and to share that on behalf of the people of Utah whom I represent."
