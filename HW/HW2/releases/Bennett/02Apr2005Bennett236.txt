Bennett Comments on Passing of Pope John Paul II                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
 âPope John Paul II was a pivotal figure in our history.  He played a major role in the demise of the Soviet Union and the fall of the Iron Curtain, and as the first non-Italian pope in centuries, dramatically changed the culture of the Roman Catholic Church on a global scale.    
 âI extend my condolences to all members of the Catholic Church and join them as they mourn the passing and celebrate the life of this outstanding religious leader.â?
