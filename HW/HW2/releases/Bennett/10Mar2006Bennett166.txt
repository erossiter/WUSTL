The U.S. has experienced 30 consecutive months of job growth, resulting in more Americans working today than any other time in our nations history. This is certainly more good news for the economy, and further evidence the Bush tax cuts are working said Bennett.Highlights in the report include: The U.S. economy added 243,000 new jobs in February. Over the past 12 months, 2.1 million new jobs have been added, and nearly 5 million since August 2003.
