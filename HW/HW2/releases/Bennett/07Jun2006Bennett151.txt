Bennett Votes to Support Debate on the Marriage Protection Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
	  	창In recent years, we have witnessed the efforts of activist judges to strike down state laws aimed at protecting traditional marriage, including state constitutional amendments that had received overwhelming support from voters. This type of judicial mischief is of great concern to me. In a democracy, the representatives of the people ought to be heard.    
  	창I am persuaded that the state has a vital stake in the continuation of the institution of marriage as a fundamental building block of a stable society. I am very reluctant to amend the Constitution, but I voted today to allow debate on the Marriage Protection Amendment so that we could search for a logical way to allow voters to take this issue out of the hands of unelected jurists. Although I did not agree entirely with the language of the amendment, I wanted the discussion to begin.    
  	창I am disappointed by my colleagues who today voted to prevent that. It is my hope that we can continue to refine this amendment and bring it to a vote in the future.창?
