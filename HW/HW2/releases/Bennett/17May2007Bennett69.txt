  Senator Bennett Responds to Senate Agreement on Immigration  
 

"It is clear that comprehensive immigration reform is needed to address the national security and economic realities currently facing our country. For the past several months, both Republicans and Democrats have worked to find common ground on critical immigration issues, and I am pleased that an agreement was reached today. I continue to review the details of the legislation and look forward to the debate next week," said Bennett.
