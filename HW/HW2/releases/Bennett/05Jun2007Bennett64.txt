  Bennett: Sen. Thomas was a Straight Shooter, a Good Friend   WASHINGTON, D.C.Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) offered the following statement after the news that Senator Craig Thomas, of Wyoming, had died after a battle with leukemia.   As a fellow westerner, Sen. Thomas and I worked together on a number of issues of interest shared by Utah and Wyoming. You could always count on him to be a straight shooter.   Sen. Thomas was a dear friend and Joyce and I will miss him enormously. We extend our deepest sympathy to Susan and the rest of his family.# # #
