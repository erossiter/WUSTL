  Senator Bennett Disappointed the House Will Not Vote on A Fourth Seat For Utah     Senator says Utah is well-positioned for a seat after the next Census  

âI am obviously disappointed the House will not bring this legislation to a vote. However, Utah is well positioned to receive a fourth seat when the Census is completed in 2010, just a few years later than many in the state had hoped.    

âI commend the congressional delegation, Governor Huntsman, and the state legislators for their diligence throughout this process. This bill, unfortunately, was a victim to end-of-the-session and post-election politics,â? said Bennett.
