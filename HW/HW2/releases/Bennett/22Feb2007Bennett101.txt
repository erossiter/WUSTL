  Divine Strake Test Cancelled     Bennett Calls it a "Welcome Relief" for Utahns  
  "This is a welcome relief for the thousands of Utahns with serious concerns about Divine Strake.     

"When I asked the Pentagon to move this test out of southern Nevada, I also suggested that they explore other methods - besides testing - to obtain the needed data. I am pleased they now plan to go that route.    

"I agree that this data will help the military protect Americans against underground facilities that pose a serious threat to our national security. I am happy to lend my support to help secure funding to fulfill that objective."
