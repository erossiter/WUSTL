Second Quarter GDP Growth Shows Continued Positive Course for U.S. Economy, Bennett Says                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
  	âThe average of the last three quarters of GDP growth show a continued, positive course for the U.S. economy. We are on target to sustain the tremendous growth we have experienced for 19 consecutive quarters,â? said Bennett. âThe pro-growth policies supported by the president and Congress are working, and we must be vigilant in looking for opportunities to continue to boost consumer confidence and business investment.â?    
  	Below are additional highlights of the Bureau of Economic Analysis report:    
 	GDP growth in the second quarter was estimated to have been an annualized 2.5 percent rate, an expected moderation following the rapid 5.6 percent rate of growth in the first quarter.    
	The deceleration in GDP primarily reflected reduced growth in personal consumption spending, business equipment and software spending, exports, federal government spending, and residential investment.    
	The personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index excluding volatile food and energy prices, one of the Fedâs preferred measure of consumer prices, grew at an annualized 2.9 percent rate relative to the second quarter, an acceleration from 2.1 percent in the first quarter.
