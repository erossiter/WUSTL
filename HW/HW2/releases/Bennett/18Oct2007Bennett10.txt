  Bennett and Hatch Offer Senate Resolution Honoring U of U Nobel Prize Winner    WASHINGTON, D.C.  Utah Senators Bob Bennett and Orrin Hatch offered a Senate resolution today honoring University of Utah School of Medicine Professor Mario R. Capecchi for his recent 2007 Nobel Prize Award in Physiology or Medicine. I extend my congratulations to Professor Capecchi for his remarkable contributions to the scientific field and the University of Utah. Senator Hatch and I are pleased to offer this resolution honoring his fortitude and perseverance to overcome seemingly impossible obstacles with great success, said Bennett. Capecchi, a professor of human genetics and biology, shares the Nobel Prize with his colleagues Sir Martin J. Evans, professor of mammalian genetics and director of the School of Biosciences at Cardiff University in Wales, and Oliver Smithies, professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, for their joint work in gene targeting technology. Capecchi and his colleagues have made a series of ground-breaking discoveries concerning embryonic stem cells and DNA recombination in mammals. Their discoveries led to the creation of a powerful technology referred to as gene targeting in mice. It is now being applied to virtually all areas of biomedicine  from basic research to the development of new therapies. The resolution (S.Res. 350) is attached. # # #
