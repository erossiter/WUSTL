  Nearly $20,000 In Fire Training Grants On Its Way To Ivins City Department   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Utah Senator Bob Bennett announced today that the Ivins City Fire Department will receive nearly $20,000 in federal funding from the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA) to enhance its operations and safety training programs. The communities in and around Ivins benefit greatly from the tremendous sacrifice of the Ivins City Fire Department firefighters, said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that approves the funding for USFA. This grant will help provide these firefighters, most of whom are volunteers, with the best possible training so they are prepared when a disaster hits.The department, which has one full time firefighter and 60 volunteer EMT firefighters, will receive $19,808 from the Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program. The grant will be used to purchase a computer enhanced training program called Firefighter I, which provides training in firefighting and driving skills, operating equipment, and handling hazardous materials. The computer program can be done on the firefighters own time and will complement their hands-on training. The AFG grants provide us with so much more than we would otherwise be able to afford. The grants are very beneficial, said Ivins City Fire and Rescue Chief Peter Kulmann. For additional information on the grant, please contact Chief Kuhlmann or Director of Public Safety Wade Carpenter at (435)674-1083.AFG, a USFA program, provides funds for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities. In the past month, eight Utah fire departments have received over $420,000 from AFG. The USFA is an agency within the Department of Homeland Security.
