 	âIn days gone by, a judge with Sam Alitoâs experience, outstanding record, and unanimous endorsement with the highest rating by the American Bar Association, would receive more than 90 votes in the Senate.  Iâm disappointed Judge Alitoâs nomination has been politicized so heavily today.  Iâm confident Sam Alito willl be a superb addition to the Supreme Court and I am pleased to support him.â?
