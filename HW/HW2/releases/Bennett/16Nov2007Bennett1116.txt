  Bennett Calls on Congress to Move Terrorism Insurance Before the End of the Year   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, the Senate unanimously approved a seven-year extension of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act (TRIA), a program created after the September 11, 2001, attacks that helps protect American businesses from the uncertainty of terrorist acts. I agree with Chairman Dodd that extending the TRIA deadline for 120 days would be a mistake. The chairman has shown strong leadership on this issue, and now Congress must send a bill to the president by December 31st to ensure needed certainty in the economy, said Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah), a member of the Senate Banking Committee and an original cosponsor of the legislation.Bennett worked with Chairman Chris Dodd (D-Conn.), Senator Richard Shelby (R-Ala), and former Senator Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.) on the original Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002, and a two-year extension of the program in 2005. TRIA provides for a transparent system of shared public and private compensation for insured losses resulting from acts of terrorism. In addition to the seven-year extension, the proposal will also include provisions to cover domestic terrorism acts. Congress will need to pass the extension before the current December 31, 2007, expiration. # # #
