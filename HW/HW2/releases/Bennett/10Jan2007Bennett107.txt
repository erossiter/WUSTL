  Bennett Says The President's New Iraq Strategy Deserves An Opportunity   

    "I was struck by how comprehensive the president√¢s proposals were and how careful his analysis was, including all the various things that have gone wrong and an admission that the responsibility for those was his.  His proposals tonight not only focused on military operations, but also acknowledged the importance of economic and diplomatic efforts.     

    "As the president said, the consequences of failure in Iraq are too horrific to contemplate, and because of that I think we need to give this new strategy an opportunity to work."
