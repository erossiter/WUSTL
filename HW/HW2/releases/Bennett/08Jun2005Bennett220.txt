 	âI appreciate USDAâs quick response to distribute this money to southern Utah,â? said Bennett, the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Agriculture responsible for USDA funding. âThese funds are critical to the rebuilding effort underway in Washington County, and with ongoing weather concerns, will certainly help mitigate future flooding in the area.â?  
 	Bennett worked with the Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Thad Cochran (R-Miss.) to ensure that these funds were included in the emergency supplemental package that passed the Congress last month and signed into law by President Bush. USDA Undersecretary Mark Rey also called Bennett to personally underscore the Bush administrationâs commitment to assist with Washington County recovery needs and to promptly distribute funds to the county for the rehabilitation work along the Santa Clara and Virgin Rivers. Todayâs announcement fulfills that commitment.
