Senator Bob Bennett Says Pro-Growth Policies are Spurring Economic Growth and Job Creation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  	âI want to commend the president for his leadership on passage of a pro-growth agenda. Todayâs news that the deficit has dropped to 1.9 percent of GDP, compared to the 3.2 percent projection made earlier this year, is further evidence that these policies are working to spur economic growth and job creation,â? said Bennett, vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee.    
  	Below are highlights from todayâs Treasury announcement:    
 Over the past two years, the budget deficit has been cut in half, three years ahead of President Bushâs original 2009 goal, and surpassed this goal by $12 billion.  The FY2006 budget deficit was $248 billion (1.9 percent of GDP), down from a  February 2006 projection of $423 billion (3.2 percent of GDP). At this level, the deficit is 0.4 percent below the 40-year average of 2.3 percent of GDP.  Pro-growth policies are also responsible for the creation of more than 6.6 million jobs in the last three years and record high revenue growth over the past two years.
