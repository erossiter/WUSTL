  U.S. Senate Gives Utah Meth Fight and New Law Enforcement Tools a Thumbs Up     Bennett's $2 million request to address community safety and improve science and technology programs approved  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today the Senate reached a halfway point in the appropriations process by passing its sixth of 12 spending bills this year, the Fiscal Year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which includes Senator Bob Bennett's (R-Utah) request for over $2 million for the meth fight in the Uintah Basin, new space technology, and juvenile outreach programs.Utah remains one of the top meth producers per capita in the country. Fighting this disturbing statistic and epidemic in our state will take a consistent and united effort not only by the government, but local law enforcement, businesses, and schools, said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. I have worked for nearly a decade to secure funds to fight this serious problem and appreciate my colleagues recognition of its severity.  The bill also includes $350,000 for Prevention Plus, a program organized by the BYU-Public School Partnership  a group of nine Utah public school districts, Brigham Young University, Utah State University, the Utah State Office of Education, and city and state law enforcement agencies. The program identifies at-risk students enrolled in Utah elementary and secondary schools and uses intervention strategies, support groups, and behavioral skills lessons to teach them to make better choices. The program has resulted in reduced juvenile delinquency.Additional Bennett-requested projects in the spending bill include:
