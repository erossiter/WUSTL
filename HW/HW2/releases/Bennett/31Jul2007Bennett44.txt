  Bennett Asks USDA to Issue Agricultural Disaster Declaration     WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) sent the following letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns in support of Governor Huntsmans request to declare an agriculture secretarial disaster for 25 Utah counties experiencing a severe drought:Dear Mr. Secretary: On July 27, 2007, Governor Jon Huntsman requested a secretarial disaster declaration for 25 counties in Utah. I strongly support the governors request. Utah is currently experiencing a severe drought. In addition, this year Utah farmers and ranchers have encountered killing frosts, insect infestations, sustained high temperatures, flash floods, low snow packs, and the most active wildfire season in recent history. Some of our ranchers have lost their summer and winter range and have no option except to liquidate their herds. In all likelihood, 2007 will prove to be a very destructive year for Utah agriculture. I respectfully urge you to concur with Governor Huntsmans request and grant a secretarial disaster declaration to Utahs qualifying counties.To listen to Senator Bennett's remarks click here.# # #
