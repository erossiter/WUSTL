  	âEconomic development and transportation infrastructure are two key components communities rely on to support and foster growth. Consequently, the projects in this bill are extremely important to the state and its economy,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies (TTHUD). âFrom Logan to Carbon County to St. George, Utahns will soon see the positive and important impact of these projects.â?    
  	The spending bill includes $37 million for Utah transportation projects and $3 million for Bennett-requested economic development initiatives. Of the transportation dollars, $9 million is designated for design and construction on the first phase of the Ogden-Salt Lake commuter rail project.    
  	âCommuter rail will offer Utah residents an alternative to their current commute, reducing travel time and alleviating congestion along the highways,â? said Bennett. âIâm pleased we were able to secure funding again this year, and will continue this effort until the completion of the project.â?    
  	In August, Bennett and other elected officials participated in the ceremonial groundbreaking of the proposed 40-mile rail line from Pleasant View to Salt Lake City. It is expected that heavy construction will begin next spring. This yearâs appropriations brings Bennettâs total for commuter rail to over $28 million.
