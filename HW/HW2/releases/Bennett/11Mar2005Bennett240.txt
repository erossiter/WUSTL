Senator Bob Bennett is pleased to announce today that Brigham City Municipal Airport will receive $6.2 million in federal funds from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for runway extension and airport safety enhancements.This is an important boost for the airport as it prepares to meet the challenges of increased air traffic to northern Utah, said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, which approves the FAA annual budget. Providing resources to our municipal airports not only helps improve facilities, it is one important key to economic development throughout the state.In order to accommodate existing and projected aircraft traffic, the city plans to use the funds to extend the current runway and improve airport safety areas. The changes will help bring the airport in line with current FAA design and safety standards.For more information please contact Bruce Leonard, Brigham Citys director of public works, at (435) 734-6614.
