Bennett Responds to Latest Judicial Compromise Agreement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 âThe agreement reached last night with respect to the impasse on filibusters and judges is a good thing, for the moment. It preserves the right of the majority leader to use the constitutional option at any point in the future if he decides the Democrats are not acting in good faith, and at the same time, eliminates the filibuster threat for some of the current nominees. Those judges will now be confirmed.   
 âThe opportunity to use the constitutional option at some future point is still very much on the table. For now, at least, we have a degree of resolution that allows judges to get an up or down vote. That clearly is a good thing.â?
