 창Mastering reading skills will provide children an educational foundation essential to their success,창? said Bennett. 창This funding supports an important project that gives teachers the necessary tools to help improve literacy among Utah students.창?  
 Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, helped push for the grant last year in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Senate Appropriations Bill. The Achievement in Reading and Content Learning project, part of the Public School Partnership Program at Brigham Young University (BYU), will use the funds to help boost literacy performance of low-achieving students in intermediate grades. 				  
		 	In its second year, the project will assist over 40 teachers to develop a curriculum centered on enhancing literacy, as well as focus on applications geared to motivate students with reading difficulties. It is estimated that this project will impact over 1,000 students.  
 Literacy specialists from BYU and Utah school districts will provide the training, while collaborative teams work at the school level to improve student performance.
