  Bennett Says It's Time To Put Politics Aside and Send a Bill To The President He Can Sign   

  "The Democrats have known all along that the president would veto this bill. By pushing its passage, they are clearly making a political statement rather than looking for a legislative solution," said Bennett. "We now must get to work on a bill the president can sign, and send the much-needed funding to our troops."    

  The measure narrowly passed the Senate with a vote of 51-46 and President Bush has said he will veto the bill, punting it back to Congress for further negotiations. Members of both the House and Senate have indicated this is must-pass legislation and will have to draft a new bill following the president's expected veto next week.
