	창I was prepared to vote for Harriet Miers. I think she had the qualifications necessary to bring the diversity of intellect and experience to the Supreme Court that would have been useful.   
	창But the controversy surrounding her nomination probably makes her decision to withdraw the right one. I think she could have survived the hearings without too much difficulty, but apparently she did not.  So now we창ll move forward and look toward the next nominee.창?
