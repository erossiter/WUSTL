  Bennett Says $176,000 Coming to Layton City Fire Department    

            "Strengthening our firefighting departments by providing funding for new equipment ensures better protection for our citizens," said Bennett. "I am happy to announce resources have been approved to continue the honorable work of the Layton firefighters."    

            The Layton City Fire Department and its 75 full and part-time firefighters will use the grant to replace over 40 self-contained breathing apparatus units (SCBA), which provide firefighters oxygen while in dangerous environments. The new SCBAs will be compatible with other fire departments in the region.     

            Scott Adams, assistant fire chief for the department, said, "This money allows us to update our respiratory safety protection allowing our firefighters to work longer in hazardous conditions."       
  The Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) program provides funds for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities. Last year, 11 Utah departments received nearly $1.1 million from AFG, a program of USFA. USFA is an agency in the Department of Homeland Security.
