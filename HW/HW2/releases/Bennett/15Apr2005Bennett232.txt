Helping local entrepreneurs with ideas on acquiring new customers, reaching new markets and increasing productivity can have a significant positive impact on the economy of rural Utah.Hosted by Bennett and the Utah Rural Development Council, the conference will feature keynote speeches by Utah Governor Jon Huntsman, Jr. and Dr. Patrick M. Byrne, chairman of the board and president of Overstock.com, a successful Utah-based online liquidator.The conferences breakout sessions have been specifically organized to address the needs of communities in central and eastern Utah. A session on energy development will bring top officials from state and federal agencies to discuss the permitting process for oil and gas production. Farmers and ranchers can learn innovative marketing approaches from a panel of successful agriculture business owners in another session, while local government leaders will be targeted with a discussion on tools and success stories for local economic development.Shawn Nelson, chief executive officer of LoveSac, will lead a discussion on surviving in a cyclical business climate, a challenge for many of rural Utahs seasonal, tourism-based companies. Paul Allen, who has overseen several successful technology businesses (including Infobases, MyFamily.com and Ancestry.com) will teach how the Internet has given entrepreneurs more ways than ever before to do research, to find and reach customers, and to generate revenue.Representatives from Utahs business-lending entities will discuss access to business capital, while a select group of employers will talk about finding and keeping quality employees. Love Communications, one of Utahs leading marketing agencies, will provide a session on how a rural business can get the biggest bang from limited marketing dollars.A business expo held during the conference will allow attendees to network while learning of the products and services exhibited by a number of local, regional, and national companies.Attendance at the event is $20 and includes the May 3 reception and breakfast, lunch and all conference sessions on May 4.
