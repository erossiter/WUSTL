  Bennett Reacts to Failed Vote on D.C. Voting Rights Bill, Measure Would Have Given Utah Fourth Seat   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) issued the following statement after the Senate voted, by 57-42, to reject the motion to proceed to the D.C. Voting Rights Act (S. 1257) this afternoon. The motion to proceed, which wouldallow the Senate todebate and consider the bill, needed a minimum of 60 votes to pass. I was not surprised by the vote today. Many of my colleagues felt very strongly that this bill was unconstitutional, and in the end their argument prevailed, said Bennett, a cosponsor of the legislation. It is unfortunate that Utah will not receive a fourth seat in the House of Representatives, but with the Census coming in 2010, we are all but guaranteed at least one additional seat, if not two. # # #
