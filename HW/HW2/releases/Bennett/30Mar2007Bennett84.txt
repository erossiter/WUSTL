  Bennett Hails Utah's All-Time Low Unemployment Rate    

              "An all-time low 2.3 percent unemployment rate is tremendous news for the Utah economy. This reflects a healthy job market and a strong business community," said Bennett, a member and former chair of the Joint Economic Committee. "It is clear that the pro-growth policies put in place by Congress are creating positive results in the state."    

              In addition to the state unemployment numbers, the Bureau of Labor Statistics also reported 6,600 new jobs created in Utah last month, and 51,000 jobs over the past 12 months.
