  	âUtah has been a leader in space technology development for decades. The latest decision by NASA to use ATKâs launch system in future space explorations is further evidence of this,â? said Bennett. âThe president has an impressive vision for Americaâs role in future space flights, and Iâm proud that ATK will represent Utah in this endeavor.â?
