Bennett Says Immigration Bill is Not Perfect, But Will Increase Border Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
  	Following are Bennettâs comments on final passage of the bill:    
  	âThe bill passed today by the Senate is not perfect, but itâs a necessary step. It includes important provisions that will strengthen our borders, without which we have little chance of managing or resolving our immigration challenges. But focus on border security must be linked to other practical solutions, like a guest worker program, if we are to solve our immigration problems. We must enable the border patrol agents to focus on apprehending criminals, drug runners and terrorists, instead of being overwhelmed by those seeking legitimate employment.     
  	âAgain, this is not a perfect bill, but one that moves us toward comprehensive immigration reform.â?
