With more than 5 million jobs created since August 2003, Joint Economic Committee Vice Chairman Bob Bennett (R-Utah) says todays Bureau of Labor Statistics report indicates that the Bush administrations pro-growth tax policies have contributed significantly to U.S. job creation and economic growth. Todays new jobs numbers demonstrate once again how the pro-growth tax policies of the Bush administration have contributed to the strong, rapidly growing economy, said Senator Bennett. Five million new jobs since August 2003, historically low unemployment and high GDP are a few important examples of why the Congress must continue to implement these policies responsible for the impressive economic recovery weve experienced. The Bureau of Labor Statistics reported today that 211,000 new jobs were created last month. Additional economic highlights include:  As part of the nearly 5.2 million new jobs created since August 2003, employers added more than 2 million jobs in the last year.  The current unemployment rate is 4.7 percent, at or below the averages of the last four decades.  In just two-and-a-half years, real Gross Domestic Product has grown by 9.9 percent, and more than 3.5 percent in each of the past two years  faster than Japan or any major industrialized nation in Europe.  Consumer confidence reached a near four-year high in March.  Home ownership has reached all-time high  more than two-thirds of Americans own their homes today, which is more than any time in history.
