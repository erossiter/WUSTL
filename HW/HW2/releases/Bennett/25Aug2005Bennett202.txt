Three New Buses to Join Loganâs Transit System                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  	âPublic transportation is not only important to help ease congestion in highly populated areas of the state like Salt Lake County, it also plays an important role in other Utah communities whose residents rely on mass transit for activities such as getting to work and school,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation responsible for funding these type of projects.    
  	Bennett is a strong supporter of mass transit and obtains millions each year for transit systems across the state. The money set aside for Logan buses was part of the Fiscal Year 2005 Transportation, Treasury, and Independent Agencies Act of 2005, signed into law last December.
