Richfield Regional Airport to Receive $150,000 to Address Safety and Growth                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      
  	âImproving Utahâs rural airports helps foster economic development and address growth in communities where funding may not be readily available,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation, which determines the FAA budget. âThe expansion of the Richfield airport reflects the remarkable growth occurring in the area, and these funds will help the airport better serve the people of Richfield and the surrounding communities.â?     
  	 Richfield Regional Airport will use the funds to acquire land needed to increase flight approach safety. The airport has seen a significant increase in the traffic, and has had to make more services and facilities available to address this expansion. As this trend continues, the land will be used to accommodate a new runway that will be necessary for larger aircraft to land.
