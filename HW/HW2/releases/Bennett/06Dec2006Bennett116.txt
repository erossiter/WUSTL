  Washington County Land Bill Will Not Receive Vote in the 109th Congress    Senator Bennett says the bill is critical for Washington County창s future and he will push for passage next year 

	창I believe we had enough support in the Senate to pass this bill, but given the post-election environment in the House, it became clear they would not act on it, or many other pending bills, before they adjourn. Washington County will continue to experience unprecedented growth, and it is unfortunate that efforts to help address this will be delayed.    

	창I want to thank Congressman Matheson for his partnership in this initiative, and look forward to continuing this work in the new Congress,창? said Bennett.
