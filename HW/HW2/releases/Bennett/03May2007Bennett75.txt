 Bennett Discusses Land Swap Bill, Says It Is Critical For Both Utah's Public Land and School Children   WASHINGTON, D.C. - Today in a Senate hearing, Senator Bob Bennett reiterated his support for a land exchange bill that would swap 40,000 acres of Bureau of Land Management (BLM) land for an equal amount of school trust lands in eastern Utah. Bennett introduced similar legislation in the two previous Congresses - 108th and 109th - and remains hopeful that this legislation will move quickly this session. Last year the bill passed the House of Representatives, but was held in the Senate during the last hours of the session. Senator Hatch is a cosponsor of S. 390 - the Utah Recreational Land Exchange Act of 2007 - and all three members of the Utah congressional delegation support its companion bill in the House, H.R. 1210. Below is the statement Sen. Bennett offered on S. 390 today. # # #
