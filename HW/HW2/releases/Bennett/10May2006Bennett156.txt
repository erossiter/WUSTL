Bennett Hearing Concludes That Engaging Consumers in Health Care Choices Leads to Better Value in Care                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON, D.C.  Joint Economic Committee Vice Chairman Bob Bennett today held a hearing to examine the information and incentives currently available to consumers to find the best health care value - price and quality of care - and what can be done in the future to increase accessibility to health care information tools. There is a common theme as we examine consumers health care choices  the more a person knows about their health care options, including physician cost and care, the better off and more empowered they will be to take control of their health care choices, said Bennett at the conclusion of the hearing. The hearing consisted of two panels with the following witnesses: Carolyn M. Clancy, MD, director, Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality; Arnold Milstein, MD, MPH, medical director, Pacific Business Group on Health Worldwide Partner, Mercer Human Resource Consulting; Michael D. Parkinson, MD, MPH, executive vice president and chief health and medical officer, Lumenos; Paul Ginsburg, Ph.D., president, Center for Studying Health System Change; Douglas G. Cave, Ph.D., MPH, president, Cave Consulting Group; Donald W. Kemper, MPH, chairman and CEO, Healthwise, Inc.; and Walton Francis, MPA, MPP, author and independent consultant. The full text of the witnesses testimony and video of the hearing are available at the JEC website, www.jec.senate.gov. Below is the text of Bennetts opening statement: Good morning and welcome to our hearing on the next generation of health information tools for consumers. Newer financial incentives have set the stage for improving the performance of our health care system. However, we still need to provide health care consumers, employer plan sponsors, doctors, hospital administrators, and, yes, even public health program administrators with better information to improve their choices and decision making. We particularly need to arm individual consumers with better information and incentives at the point of service, so they are not left defenseless; first in the examination room and then months later when they receive a mysterious bill and cryptic explanation of benefits. As we continue our focus on Health Care Week in the Senate, its an important time to examine the current and future state of health information that is so essential to improving our current health care arrangements, whether they involve consumer-driven health plans, health savings accounts, more traditional employer-sponsored plans, Medicare, Medicaid, charitable care, or cash payment at the point of service. We all could use the assistance of more transparent and consumer-friendly information about the price, quality, and value of our health care options, as well as support tools to assist and improve our decision making. We may differ in how much information we wish to, or can, absorb but something more than what we currently have available is better for just about all of us. Neither stronger financial incentives to consumers, nor top-down efforts to reengineer health care delivery will, by themselves, be able to change future trends toward rising health care costs and disappointing quality. The intermediation of value-enhancing information holds the promise of boosting the productivity of health care services, strengthening accountability for the decisions made across the health care sector of our economy, and stimulating innovation in health care delivery. We have already witnessed the transformative power of information technology in other industries and areas of daily life. Health care need not continue to be a lagging exception. Todays hearing will examine the extent to which relevant and usable health care information involving value (the best mix of cost, price, quality, treatment outcomes, and overall health improvement) is available to empowered consumers. We will explore how it may be best delivered and utilized, and how public policy can enrich, expand, and exploit its full potential. Our witnesses will also discuss the information component of proposed initiatives for pay-for-performance and value-based purchasing, and their potential future impact on health spending growth rates and health outcomes, primarily from the perspective of end-user consumers and the agents who serve them. We have two panels of witnesses today, because they have a lot of diverse information to convey to us in a nevertheless succinct and crisp manner. I will be filling out a consumer report card on your performances today, but your written testimony already has received high grades.
