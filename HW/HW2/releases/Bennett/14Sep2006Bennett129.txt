Bennett Says Port Security Act Will Strength and Improve Security                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               
  	âThis bill puts important provisions in place that will help us continue to move in the direction of complete security,â? said Bennett. âIt is a smart balance between keeping commerce moving efficiently around the world and making sure that cargo containers are free of any chemical, biological or radioactive materials.â?    
  Bennett also pointed out that in a Senate Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee hearing earlier this week, Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chertoff said that virtually all containers now receive an intelligent screening before coming to the United States â that is we know what is in them and who ships them. Chertoff also said that electronic scanning of all cargo is on track to be at 80 percent by the end of the year and 100 percent by the end of 2007.      
	  Highlights of the Port Security Act include:    
 Strengthens our land and seaports, improves our maritime transportation security strategy, and enhances communications between the DHS and key stakeholders. 
 95 percent of our nationâs overseas trade, worth nearly $1 trillion, enters or leaves through our seaports. 
Foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approx. 800 million tons of goods that come into our country.  
In 2005 alone, more than 11 million containers arrived in the United States by sea and the number is growing.    
Requires that information about cargo be provided before the cargo is loaded on a vessel in a foreign port and shipped to our country. 
 50 new inspectors for the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism. 
750 new customs and borders agents to help facilitate commercial and revenue functions at ports nationwide.   
Requires of containers entering the U.S. for radiation and WMD. 
 By December 2007, radiation detection on all containers entering U.S. through the busiest 22 seaports.
