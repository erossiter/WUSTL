Bennett Says Hansen "Outstanding Pick" for BRAC Commission
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 	âJim is an outstanding pick for the BRAC,â? said Bennett.  âAs we begin this critical review and restructuring of our nationâs military, Iâm delighted the president recognizes the tremendous value Jim Hansen will bring to this important undertaking.  Jim has the highest professional and ethical standards and decades of firsthand experience with the programs and personnel the BRAC will assess.  I cannot think of anyone better qualified for this post.â?  
 	Former Rep. Hansenâs nomination will be the subject of hearings before the Senate Armed Services Committee and will require Senate approval.
