  Senator Bennett Calls Iraq Study Group Report Sobering, But Helpful   

	âI appreciate the candor of this report that recognizes there is no quick solution for success in Iraq. The report looks at three areas. First, the external approach focuses on a new diplomatic effort to build international consensus. Second, an internal approach appeals to a greater effectiveness and stability of the Iraqi government. And third, the U.S. militaryâs effort to adjust for the changing situation on the ground. These three are interrelated, and should be addressed together.    

âBefore we rush to implement the recommendations, I would like to hear from the military commanders on the ground with respect to how likely we are to achieve these objectives. I would also like to hear from representatives in the neighboring countries. Iraq has become a regional problem, and all the stakeholders should review this work.    

âThe study group has provided us with a very worthwhile analysis and I applaud them for taking on this challenging assignment. Their observations deserve our attention and will be useful as we in Congress continue to work with the president to find solutions in Iraq.â?
