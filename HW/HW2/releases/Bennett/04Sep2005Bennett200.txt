âI believe William Rehnquist was one of the outstanding chief justices in American history.  Although Iâm not a lawyer, I have read several of his books â additional evidence of his brilliant legal mind. Iâm grateful for his outstanding service to our nation and believe he will be sorely missed,â? Bennett said.
