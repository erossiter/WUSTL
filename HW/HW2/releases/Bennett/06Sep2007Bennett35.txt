  Senate Agrees to $40 Million for Utah Military Projects     Including $9.2 million for a new Hill facility  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today the Senate approved, by a vote of 92 to 1, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Act that will fund military construction projects across the U.S., including over $40 million for Utah projects requested by Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah).  Given the demands on the military today, it is extremely important that the facilities supporting our men and women in uniform are up to par. Hill's mission is critical to this effort. The funds included in this bill will help military operations run more smoothly, said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction.The bill includes $9.2 million for a new consolidated 388th munitions flight administrative/maintenance facility for Hill Air Force Base (HAFB). The 26,000 square foot building will support administration, training, storage, backup power supply, and three equipment bays for the 388th Fighter Wing Munitions Flight at the base. It will also include a two-story facility for maintenance bays and administrative space.Below are additional Utah projects, totaling over $32 million, included in the spending bill and part of the presidents budget. Hill Air Force Base Army National Guard House and Senate conferees, including Bennett, will now meet in a conference to reconcile the differences between the two versions of the bill. After conference, both chambers will vote on the conference report passage and the bill will be sent to the president.# # #
