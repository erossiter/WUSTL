  Federal Government Will Pay Out Over $20 Million to Utah Counties for Lost Tax Revenue   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) said today that Utah counties will receive over $20 million in Payment-In-Lieu-of-Taxes (PILT) payments from the federal government to help rural communities pay for essential services.PILT is extremely important to all 29 of Utahs counties. Communities use this funding to provide residents and visitors with critical services like emergency response, water infrastructure, and roads. It is only fair that the federal government pay its share, said Bennett. The PILT program was first authorized by Congress in 1976 and is administered by the Department of Interiors Bureau of Land Management (BLM). PILT payments are intended to off-set the loss of tax revenues due to the tax-exempt status ofpublic. The payments also help counties provide essential services such as firefighting and police protection, construction of public schools and roads, and search-and-rescue operationsrequired under the myriad of unfunded federal mandates. Since serving on the Appropriations Committee, Bennett has helped to more than double Utahs PILT payments. For fiscal year 2007, Utah will receive over $20 million, of the $232.5 million nationwide, to be distributed among the states 29 counties.
