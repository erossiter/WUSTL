Over $5 Million Heads to Utah for Commuter Rail                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  
  	âUtah residents who battle daily slowdowns along the Wasatch Front deserve a productive mass transit system that will help cut down on the areaâs traffic congestion. This funding will take us one step closer to the reality of commuter rail in Utah,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation.     
  	The $5.2 million Utah Transit Authority grant will fund the preliminary engineering phase of the Weber County to Salt Lake Commuter Rail Project, and is part of the $19 million Bennett has secured for the project since gaining a seat on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
