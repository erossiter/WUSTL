  Bennett Criticizes MoveOn.org Ad, Calls It Pure Propaganda   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) offered the following remarks today in response to a full page ad in the New York Times, purchased by MoveOn.org that questioned the integrity of General David Petreaus. It is interesting that those who think a senator is corrupted when someone picks up his lunch tab also believe the same senator can be influenced by spending $167,156.64 for a full page ad in the New York Times. The people at MoveOn.org should understand that we have sources of information more reliable than their propaganda. It isnt General Petraeus who is guilty of cooking the books; it is the ideologues who refuse to let the facts stand in the way of their partisan agendas. General Petraeus has served this country with honor for several decades, including risking his own life in combat. Hes done it without ever smearing any of his opponents or compromising the facts. They should take a lesson from him, said Bennett. # # #
