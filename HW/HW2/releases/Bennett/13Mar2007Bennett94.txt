  Bennett Votes Against 9/11 Bill, Says It Favors Unions Over National Security  
  Senator says imposing collective bargaining on the Transportation Security Administration will hurt national security  


            "This bill was intended to make Americans safer by implementing many of the 9/11 Commission recommendations, and it goes a long way in that direction. Unfortunately, it also includes language that will allow TSA workers to unionize. Such collective bargaining rights, which are appropriate in most circumstances, are not wise when addressing terrorist threats," said Bennett. "I could not in good conscience vote for a bill that will put American lives in danger."    

            Bennett also noted that S.4 - The Improving America's Security Act - fails to address many other national security challenges. Senate Republicans proposed a package of amendments to address these problems, but the Democrats refused to allow a vote. The amendments would have increased penalties for perpetrating hoaxes that result in the death, injury, or capture of a U.S. soldier during wartime; enhanced protection for Americans from terrorists and other criminals living in our country illegally; increased penalties for providing material support such as financial aid to terrorists, committing terrorist-motivated murders, kidnappings, and assaults, and paying off suicide bombers' families; and made it illegal to recruit individuals to commit terrorist acts.    

            The Senate will now meet with the House of Representatives to reconcile differences between their two bills. Once the conference report is filed, Congress will vote on final passage. The president has threatened to veto the bill, and it is anticipated that the Senate has enough votes, including Bennett's, to uphold that veto.
