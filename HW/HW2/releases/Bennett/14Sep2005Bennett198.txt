Bennett Responds to Bankruptcy Filing by Delta Air Lines                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         
 	âDramatic and steady increases in jet fuel prices, exacerbated by Hurricane Katrina, are key contributors to the situation in which Delta Air Lines now finds itself. Iâm sorry it has come to this, but have full confidence in Deltaâs leadership and believe the service of the air line will not be compromised, nor will its commitment to its employees.    
 	âTodayâs announcement increases the urgency for congressional action to ease requirements of the pension system.  Now is the time for interim measures that will protect employees from possible long-term disaster.â?
