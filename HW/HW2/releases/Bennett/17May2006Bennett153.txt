Bush at the White House for the Tax Relief Bill Signing                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
  	âWith all the political debate about the tax cuts, it should be pointed out that tax revenue is higher than ever before in history and 14 percent higher this year than last,â? said Bennett, vice chairman of the Joint Economic Committee. âDoomsayersâ claims to the contrary, we must be doing something right.â?    
	  	Below are new estimates released by the U.S. Treasury Department showing the effect the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act Of 2001 (EGTRRA) and The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act Of 2003 (JGTRRA) will have on Utah taxpayers. These estimates are based on tabulations from individual income tax returns processed by the Internal Revenue Service in 2004.     
REDUCING TAXES Â·	805,000 Utah taxpayers will have lower income tax bills under EGTRRA and JGTRRA.    
NEW 10-PERCENT BRACKET Â·	716,000 Utah taxpayers will benefit from the new 10 percent bracket enacted in EGTRRA and the JGTRRA acceleration to 2003 of the expansions of the bracket scheduled for 2008.    
REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX RATES Â·	152,000 Utah taxpayers will benefit from EGTRRA reduction in income tax rates above 15 percent and JGTRRA acceleration to 2003 of the reductions scheduled for 2004 and 2006.  	    
REDUCTION OF MARRIAGE PENALTY Â·	289,000 married couples in Utah will benefit from the JGTRRA acceleration to 2003 of the EGTRRA provisions that increase the standard deduction for joint filers to double the amount for single filers and increase the width of the 15 percent bracket to twice the width for single filers.  These two provisions were scheduled to phase in between 2005 and 2009.    
INCREASE IN CHILD TAX CREDIT Â·	222,000 married couples and single parents in Utah benefit from the increase in the child tax credit under EGTRRA and the JGTRRA acceleration to 2003 of the increase from $600 to $1,000 that was scheduled to phase in between 2005 and 2010.    
REDUCED TAX RATES ON CAPITAL GAINS AND CORPORATE DIVIDENDS Â·	165,000 Utah taxpayers in Utah will benefit from the reduced tax rates on capital gains and corporate dividends under JGTRRA.
