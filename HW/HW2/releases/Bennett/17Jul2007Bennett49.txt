  Bennett Reacts to Democrats Recent Public Relations Ploy   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) gave the following statement today regarding the Senates all night session tonight:The Senates recent 24 hour session was a public relations ploy. Republicans and Democrats had agreed to a series of rules on how to proceed at the beginning of the debate. Republicans are prepared to move ahead under the terms of that agreement, which requires 60 votes to pass any Iraq - related amendment to the bill. The Democrats now want to change the rules and embarrass the Republicans. It is too late for that  once a deal is made that agreement ought to be lived up to.   # # #
