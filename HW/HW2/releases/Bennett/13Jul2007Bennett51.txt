  Bennett Announces Over $54,000 for Salt Lake Area Fire Departments   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah) announced today that the Unified Fire Authority of Greater Salt Lake will receive more than $54,000 in federal funding for fire prevention programs. In this busy and dangerous fire season it is more important than ever to provide our firefighters with the best equipment so they are able to respond to emergencies, said Bennett. We owe a debt of gratitude to our courageous firefighters battling these horrific fires this summer and working so hard to keep our communities out of harms way. Since last fall, 24 Utah departments have received AFG grants totaling over $2.2 million. The AFG program is part of the U.S. Fire Administration (USFA), an agency of the Department of Homeland Security. AFG provides funds for training, wellness and fitness, firefighting equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
