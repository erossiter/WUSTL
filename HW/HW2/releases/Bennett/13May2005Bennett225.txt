Bennett Hails the Good News for Utahâs Military Installations                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   People of Utah Commended for Their Commitment to Excellence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     
 	âI congratulate the military and civilian personnel working at Utahâs military facilities for their continued commitment to excellence. They saved Hill by telling its story and helping the Air Force understand Hillâs valuable contributions to the countryâs military efforts. Hill is now recognized by the U.S. Air Force as one of its top bases, ranking it 14 out of the 154 total bases around the world. Utahâs Dugway also remains a preeminent component in the national military equation.  
 	âThough weâll face the elimination of some positions, many of which were already expected through the normal course of military operations, the ârealignmentâ in BRAC also brings new functions and expertise to the state and promises great things for the future.  Overall, this is a good day for Utah.  As a member of the Utah delegation, I commend the dedication of those members of the Utah Defense Alliance and others whoâve worked so diligently for todayâs great news. Together we praise the tremendous contributions of the people at Utahâs military installations who make us all look good.â?
