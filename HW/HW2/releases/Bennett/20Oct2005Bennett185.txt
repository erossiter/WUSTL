Grant Ensures Preservation of Utah's Historic Pueblo Landmarks                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   
  The stateâs renowned Alkali Ridge, the site of an ancient Pueblo village near present-day Monticello, is one of the benefactors of the Save Americaâs Treasures (SAT) program. The area stands as a National Historic Landmark, and is listed by the Bureau of Land Management as an âArea of Critical Environmental Concern,â? due to natural erosive forces and heavy visitor traffic.	    
	  Archeologists hope to use the funding to help restore and preserve Alkali Ridge in addition to nine other Puebloan sites also near Monticello. Organizers of the SAT grant selected the Utah landmarks, some dating as far back as 700 A.D., for their fragility and cultural importance. The National Park Service will manage the grant funding the preservation project.    
  Congress appropriated $14.5 million for the nationwide program as part of its Fiscal Year 2005 Interior Appropriations Bill. More than 61 organizations and government agencies received funds earmarked for the conservation and preservation of historical treasures through the SAT initiative. All SAT grants require a dollar-for-dollar non-federal match. The Bureau of Land Managementâs Monticello division is currently seeking sponsors for the matching portion of the funding.      
	  For more information, interested media should contact Sandra Meyers, Bureau of Land Management Monticello field office, at (435) 587-1506. Additional information on the SAT program can be found at www.pcah.gov/SAT2005.htm or at www.cr.nps.gov/hps/treasures/index.htm.
