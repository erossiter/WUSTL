 	âTechnological advances continue to open the door to new and exciting opportunities in all areas of society and the world of education is no exception,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. âThis grant will help Snow College use new technologies to make online education options available to more people and to provide improved resources for students.â?   
 	Bennett secured the federal funds for this project in the Fiscal Year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act, which passed the Congress and was signed into law last December. As a current member and past chairman of the Senate Republican High-Tech Task Force, he recognizes that increased technology breaks down barriers to education opportunities, particularly geographic barriers in rural counties.    
 	Snow College, which serves six rural counties, will use the funding to address the increasing demand for distance learning in central Utah. Specifically, the grant will support the following projects:  
	 	â¢	Install a system upgrade in the Snow College Library, providing greater web accessibility to resources;  
	 	â¢	Establish 10 additional online courses;  
 	â¢	Improve and extend the connection between the Richfield and Ephraim campuses, providing additional courses to both;  
	 	â¢	Introduce a new campus connection with Nephi, which will pave the way for general education, nursing prerequisites and nursing courses.
