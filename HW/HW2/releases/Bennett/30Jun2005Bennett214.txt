  	âMany of Utahâs rural schools face funding challenges, particularly in the area of literacy, because of the burden that location has on a school districtâs budget,â? said Bennett, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. âIt is my hope that these funds will help teachers in rural districts gain access to the current resources available to assist students improve and enhance literacy skills. Thatâs a good âback to schoolâ bonus.â?    
  	In the Fiscal Year 2005 Consolidated Appropriations Act, passed by the Congress last year, Bennett acquired $644,800 to fund the Literacy Improvement in Utah Rural Schools. The purpose of the program is to improve literacy achievement for students in grades K-6 living in rural areas with the following three objectives:    
  â¢	Deliver high-quality research-based professional development aimed at providing a more informed literacy teacher in the rural schools.    
  â¢	Provide knowledge about, as well as support for purchasing and implementing research-based literacy instructional materials in rural classrooms to assist in the appropriate delivery of literacy instruction.    
  â¢	Develop knowledge about, as well as support for purchasing and using appropriate assessment tools to inform literacy instruction with Utahâs rural schools.
