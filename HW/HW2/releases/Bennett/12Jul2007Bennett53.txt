  Senator Bennett Reacts to Interim Iraq Report   WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today after President Bush submitted to Congress the Initial Benchmark Assessment Report, the first of two reports required by law that outline the status of 18 benchmarks, Senator Bob Bennett issued the following statement:    This is a candid and useful report, but as required by law, it is an interim report. I look forward to the final report that will include General Petraeuss full analysis of the situation in Iraq when it is released in September.# # #
