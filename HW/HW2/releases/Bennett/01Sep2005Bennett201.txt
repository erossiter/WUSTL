Bennett Supports Aid Package for Victims of Hurricane Katrina                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    
              창I창ve been in touch with Senator Frist and am in full support of the $10.5 billion emergency appropriation the Senate will pass this evening by unanimous consent. I understand the House will act on this tomorrow.   
The president has requested this initial  disbursement and with his signature, these funds will be made available to federal agencies for their relief efforts. There is no question that more federal assistance will be needed, but this amount will cover us until we can determine what additional assistance will be necessary.  
             창Like all Utahns, my heart goes out to the people of Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida and Alabama who are in desperate need of this aid.창?
