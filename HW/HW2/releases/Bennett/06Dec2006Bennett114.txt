  Senate Approves Robert Gates as the Next Secretary of Defense     Senator Bennett endorses Gates as the right choice  

âI am pleased to join my Senate colleagues in confirming Robert Gates as the next defense secretary. He brings a fresh perspective to the Defense Department at a critical time.    

âRobert Gates is well suited to address the security concerns of our nation. He understands the threats we currently face and will work to find bipartisan solutions in Iraq. His broad experience working in national security, advising six former presidents, and his contributions to the Iraq Study Group make him the right choice for this post.â?
