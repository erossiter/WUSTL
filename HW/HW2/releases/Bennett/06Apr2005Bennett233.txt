Bennett Language Blocks Shipment of Toxic Weapons to Utah, Approved by Key Committee Today                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
	 	âIt is against the law to transport these weapons across state lines, and today my colleagues agreed with me that the law should remain unchanged,â? said Bennett.  âI appreciate their endorsement of our efforts to block the shipment of toxic munitions to our state. Utah currently houses and is successfully disposing more than 40 percent of the nationâs chemical stockpile. Thatâs more than enough.â?   
 	To meet a deadline imposed by the Chemical Weapons Convention for disposal of the nationâs stockpile by 2012, the Department of Defense is reviewing options for moving stockpiles currently housed at Pueblo, Colorado and Richmond, Kentucky to existing facilities in other states including Utah.   
 	Earlier this year, Bennett, joined Sen. Wayne Allard (R-CO) to sponsor legislation blocking funding to study shipment of chemical weapons across state lines.  The language from the legislation was added to the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill approved today by the Appropriations Committee, of which Bennett is a member. In 1996, Bennett added identical language to a DoD spending bill successfully blocking a similar action.   
 	The funding measure approved today now goes to the full Senate for consideration.  It is anticipated the Senate will act quickly to clear the measure.
