  Bennett Says National Security Threatened If Collective Bargaining For TSA Workers Remains In 9/11 Commission Bill   

  	"The War on Terror has taught us that we are dealing with an entirely different kind of enemy - one that is very patient, very intelligent, and very inventive," Bennett said Thursday on the floor of the United States Senate. "For us to treat security matters, like airport security, as a routine kind of task that can be dealt with in routine kinds of training, and therefore is eligible for routine kinds of labor relations between management and labor, would be foolish. For that reason, I would oppose the bill if this provision does not come out."    

  President Bush has threatened to veto the bill if TSA collective bargaining is part of the final package; Bennett would uphold that veto. Earlier this week, 36 Republican senators, including Bennett, sent a letter to the president expressing concerns that TSA unionization would undermine efforts to keep our country secure.
