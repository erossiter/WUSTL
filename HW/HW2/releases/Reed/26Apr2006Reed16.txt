Gouging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON  DC    With gas prices in Rhode Island approaching  3 00 a gallon  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  called on President Bush to enact a meaningful gas price gouging policy   In a letter dated April 25  2006  Reed joined with 35 Democratic senators in asking whether the President supports enactment of a federal price gouging statute and whether his Administration would fairly and vigorously enforce such a law if enacted       The letter noted that last Fall  Deborah Platt Majoras  the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  who was appointed by the President  testified before Congress that enactment of a federal price gouging law would not be    appropriate     and    likely will do consumers more harm than good      She said that an oil company   s    independent decision to increase price is   and should be   outside the purview of the law            Yesterday  President Bush asked the Justice Department and the FTC to send a letter to all 50 states attorney generals asking them to stay on top of the issue   Reed noted that under President Bush  the FTC has a record of disregarding claims of price manipulation by gas retailers          The White House   s close relationship with Big Oil has harmed the American people   said Reed    I am concerned that the President   s recent statements are merely political cover   Yesterday s announcement to investigate possible price gouging isn   t enough        In an effort to push for stronger consumer protection measures that will prevent American motorists from getting price gouged at the gas pump this summer  Senator Reed cosponsored The Energy Emergency Consumer Protection Act  S  1735    This bill would give the President authority to declare national energy emergencies and subject price gougers to new fines and criminal penalties   The legislation also ensures greater market transparency and would allow federal regulators to go after market manipulation of oil and gas prices on an every day basis   It would further require the federal government to develop a national response plan to prepare our nation for future domestic or global petroleum supply disruptions       According to rhodeislandgasprices com  http   www rhodeislandgasprices com   the average price of a gallon of gasoline in The Ocean State today is  2 935   That is slightly higher than the national average of  2 909   The average price of a gallon of gas at this time last year was  2 196   In some parts of the state  the price reached as high as  3 23 earlier this week       The average price of gas has increased more than 100  over the course of the Bush presidency  and increased 15  over the last month   And the Energy Information Administration projects that gas prices will rise 25 percent across the nation compared to last summer        The financial strains caused by these record high gas prices hurt workers and the economy   The average household with children will spend 75 percent more on gasoline costs this year than in 2001   This is money that could be spent on school supplies  food and medicine  and retirement savings   concluded Reed    We need to act now in order to prevent American motorists from getting price gouged at the gas pump this summer  and provide some degree of protection during any future oil crunches        In addition to Senator Reed  yesterday   s letter to the President was also signed by Senators Akaka  Baucus  Bayh  Biden  Bingaman  Boxer  Cantwell  Carper  Clinton  Conrad  Dayton  Dorgan  Durbin  Feingold  Feinstein  Johnson  Kennedy  Kohl  Landrieu  Lautenberg  Leahy  Levin  Lieberman  Lincoln  Menendez  Murray  Mikulski  Nelson  Obama  Pryor  Reid  Rockefeller  Salazar  Stabenow  and Wyden       Text of the letter follows       April 25  2006      The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President       Last week  you said that    the government has the responsibility to make sure that we watch very carefully and investigate possible price gouging    in the sale of gasoline  and that your Administration    will do just that          Last November  however  in a joint hearing before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources and the Senate Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation  the Chair of the Federal Trade Commission  Deborah Platt Majoras  testified that no    Federal statute makes it illegal to charge prices that are considered to be too high  as long as companies set those prices independently      She went on to say that     t he omission of a Federal price gouging law is not     inadvertent     but    reflects a sound policy choice             Moreover  in her prepared statement  Chair Majoras suggested that enactment of a federal price gouging law would not be    appropriate     and    likely will do consumers more harm than good      She said that an oil company   s    independent decision to increase price is   and should be   outside the purview of the law            It is unclear how your statement that your Administration will take action against price gouging squares with Chair Majoras   s statements that price gouging is not illegal  that it should not be made illegal because it is both    difficult to define    and    difficult to enforce     and that making it illegal    would unnecessarily hurt consumers            Do you  in fact  support enactment of a federal price gouging statute  and will your Administration fairly and vigorously enforce such a law if enacted         Sincerely
