                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  DC    In an effort to provide America s veterans with access to quality  affordable health care  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI   the acting Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  is supporting a measure to boost veterans health care by an additional  3 6 billion in the fiscal year 2007 continuing resolution         In the coming days the Senate will debate a  463 billion spending bill that provides a total of  36 46 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA    Senator Reed  who served in the 82nd Airborne Division as an Infantry Platoon leader  has been a strong proponent for providing veterans with first rate health care and has made this increase a priority             We need a VA system that is able to serve all our veterans as honorably as they served our country   It is imperative that we meet our veterans  health care needs now and in the future   said Reed    The biggest cost of any war is the human cost   President Bush s past budgets have shortchanged our veterans   This increase will bring us closer to where we need to be to provide adequate care for all the veterans who need it         Last year  the Republican Congress did not finish work on the majority of the appropriation spending bills   So the current Congress is forced now in the middle of the fiscal year to come up with appropriations funding to fill in the gaps until October of 2007            We are asking a lot of young Americans to go risk their lives and limbs in Iraq   If we don t give them concrete examples of how much we respect their sacrifice and service  then we are not going to have as many young people signing up to serve in the military   said Reed    The best way to do that is to treat our veterans today in a way that shows these youngsters that if someday they need health care assistance  the VA will be there for them   We have to do it and we must follow through with real resources         The following is a breakdown of the  36 46 billion in discretionary funding for the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA                         VA Medical Services is funded at  25 512 billion   This provides an additional  2 964 billion above the FY 2006 appropriated level for Medical Services   This account provides funding for medical care  including in patient  out patient  mental health and long term care                      Medical Administration is funded at  3 177 billion   This provides an additional  319 million above the FY 2006 appropriated level for Medical Administration                      Medical Facilities is funded at  3 569 billion   This provides an additional  271 million above the FY 2006 appropriated level for Medical Facilities   This account funds maintenance and utility costs for VA hospitals and clinics as well as food and dietetic services for veterans seeking inpatient care                      General Operating Expenses is funded at  1 481 billion   This provides an additional  70 million for General Operating Expenses above the FY 2006 appropriated level for General Operating Expenses   The Veterans Benefits Administration s employees are paid out of this account   In recent years  the VBA has seen a rise in compensation claims leading to an increase in waiting time for adjudication of a claim   Last year  the waiting time was 177 days  almost 6 months  for a claim to be fully processed   The additional funding will allow the VA to continue to hire claims personnel to reduce the waiting times and backlog                        The National Cemetery Administration is funded at  160 7 million   This provides an additional  5 million for the National Cemetery Administration above the FY 06 appropriated level for the operation of 125 national cemeteries and 33 other cemeterial installations  as well as their maintenance as national shrines          Earlier today  Reed delivered the following remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate         MR  REED  Madam President  I want to speak very briefly about the resolution pending  H J  Res  20  the resolution that is funding the Government for the remainder of the fiscal year        I particularly want to talk about the veterans health care issues in this continuing resolution  This is not a perfect solution to the problem of funding our Government going forward  Nevertheless  it is  I believe  an equitable and fiscally responsible approach  particularly since we are trying to address the failure of the leadership in the last Congress to pass all the appropriations bills        We are in a very difficult position where this continuing resolution will get us through this fiscal year and allow us to begin to work on the following year 2008 fiscal year appropriations bills and budget so we can take all of those in regular order and hopefully pass them all by the end of this fiscal year  which would be September 30  The continuing resolution we are discussing today freezes the level of spending at most agencies at fiscal year 2006 levels  while at the same time increasing funding for priorities such as caring for our Nation s veterans  This is one of the key priorities Senator Byrd and others insisted upon  Frankly  I want to commend Senator Byrd for his leadership  as well as other members of the Appropriations Committee  for bringing this continuing resolution to the floor        The resolution before the Senate would make veterans funding a priority by adding  3 6 billion above the fiscal year 2006 appropriated levels for the VA health care system  This is one of the few areas where there is a substantial growth in spending  and it is appropriate  If we do not take care of our veterans  then we are breaking a trust that they established by serving valiantly in the uniform of the United States  and we are sending a very bad signal to those young men and women who serve today  We honor their sacrifice by taking care of today s veterans  and certainly giving them the confidence that they will be taken care of in the future        The VA estimates it will treat 219 000 more patients in fiscal year 2007 than it did in fiscal year 2006  So obviously they need the increased resources  The VA estimates it will have 4 2 million more outpatient visits this year than it did in fiscal year 2006  and the Veterans  Administration estimates it will treat almost 26 000 more patients on an inpatient basis this year than it did last year        For medical services and administration not provided  this increase would mean that the VA would be short more than  250 million a month  not total but  250 million a month  in funding for critical medical services  leaving the VA with little choice but to push out waiting times  defer maintenance  and put off purchasing new equipment         Included in this  3 6 billion increase is an additional  271 million for medical facilities  First rate medical facilities are essential to deliver first rate health care services to our veterans  The additional funding will ensure that leaky roofs and broken pipes will be fixed in a timely fashion  It also means there will be no disruption in food and dietetic services for veterans seeking inpatient care at any of our VA medical centers throughout the nation        These are not designed to scare veterans or the American people  that the VA was close to facing some of these maintenance problems and some of these basic problems of feeding veterans at hospitals  That is the reality unless we act today  That is why it is so essential that we not only increase this funding for the Veterans  Administration but we also pass this continuing resolution in a timely fashion        We don t need to look too far back in history to see what shortchanges at the VA would mean  This Senate stood united on both sides of the aisle a year and a half ago when the administration s poor actuarial modeling and budget created a shortfall of almost  3 billion  It was the Congress that responded  If we do not pass this resolution  which includes the needed additional funding for the Veterans  Administration health care system  we will have no one to blame but ourselves for this shortfall        I don t think we can face veterans and active soldiers and say we did not pass this budget  this continuing resolution  That is why the resolution made veterans the number one priority  They have defended this country bravely  honorably  and at a minimum we owe them this increase        I thank Chairman Byrd for his leadership  I urge my colleagues to swiftly pass this measure so we can continue to serve those veterans who have served this country so well        I yield the floor
