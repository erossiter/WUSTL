of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee  today delivered a major health policy address at the National Press Club in Washington  DC  Reed gave the keynote address at the First Focus Childrens Budget Summit  In 2006  Senator Reed was instrumental in preserving health coverage for hundreds of thousands of low income children across America  when he refused to allow Congress to adjourn until they addressed the funding shortfall in the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   Reed was given the First Focus Champion of Children Award for his efforts to protect the health coverage of hundreds of thousands of low income children and families  Reeds speech was delivered one day after a key Senate panel approved a five year   35 billion expansion of SCHIP that would be financed through higher tobacco taxes  This bipartisan measure  which the Finance Committee passed 17 4  would allow 6 6 million people to maintain their current health coverage  and would provide coverage for an additional 3 2 million uninsured children  President Bush has threatened to veto the bill  Nationally  SCHIP provides health insurance to approximately 6 6 million children in low  and moderate income families who are just above the cut off for Medicaid eligibility  In Rhode Island  approximately 11 000 kids are covered under the SCHIP portion of RIte Care  the state s Medicaid and SCHIP program   along with 11 000 adults and a few hundred pregnant women  A copy of Senator Reeds remarks  as prepared for delivery  follows  MOVING TOWARDS A HEALTHIER SOCIETY First Focus Childrens Budget Summit National Press Club   Washington  DC July 20  2007 SEN  REED  Good morning  I would like to thank First Focus President Bruce Lesley for the kind introduction and for inviting me to be here with you today  It is a pleasure to address such a distinguished array of child advocates from around the country about issues of mutual interest and concern  I would like to acknowledge Elizabeth Burke Bryant of Rhode Island Kids Count who is with us today and thank her for all of her incredible work to defend and protect the interests of vulnerable children in my home state  I commend her and all of you for your tireless work and commitment to improving the lives of children  Indeed  your mission is more important and needed than ever  Remarkably  the nations poverty rate is higher now than it was in the 1970s  but no President since Lyndon Johnson has made fighting poverty a major administration goal  It is estimated that 37 million Americans are now living in poverty  including 13 million children  And we know what the effects of poverty on children are  It negatively impacts their health and impedes their ability to succeed in school  It deprives them of some of the experiences that we think are essential for their progress  Sadly  this nations is becoming less a land of opportunity and increasingly a stratified society where birth largely determines ones future  One of the fundamental principles of our country and our economy is that people should be able to support and advance their families by their efforts  by their labors  by their works  That is when the economy is working well  The reality today  however  is there are people working two or more jobs sometimes  working 50  60  70 hours a week  who still don t have sufficient income to meet the basic demands of the family  In this country we should at least be able to guarantee to someone that if they are working that hard and can work their way out of poverty  Earlier this year  the Urban Institute released a groundbreaking report that examined the portion of federal spending dedicated to children  It also provides an insightful look at historical trends in federal spending aimed at improving the lives of children  There are over 100 federal initiatives that aim to support children and families  in terms of income security  housing  nutrition  social services  education  and tax credits and exemptions  And while federal spending on children grew from  53 billion in 1960 to  333 billion in 2006  as a percent of domestic spending  the share dedicated to children actually fell from 20 1 percent to 15 4 percent over this period  Moreover  spending on children has largely shifted away from broad based middle class support to programs targeted at the poor  These low income programs quickly phase out with additional household income  discouraging the climb up the ladder of economic opportunity  Meanwhile  the costs of basic demands of life escalate  health insurance premiums  college tuition  housing  and utility costs  all continue to spiral up into the stratosphere  Health insurance premiums have increased 87 percent since 2000 alone  while average wages have remained stagnant  How does one afford health care if your wages don t go up  You dont  Additionally  if you look at college tuition  another aspect of family life which is part of the American dream  the notion  again  that if you work hard  you can ensure your children will do better  go to college  Again  recent economic studies have shown that because there is not full access and affordability of college  the class structure is becoming more rigid  A few decades ago  only 20 percent of a sons future income would be determined by his father s income  Today it is 60 percent  In fact  some recent economic research indicates that economic mobility is greater in many European countries than it is in the United States  Indeed  the adage of Horatio Alger  strive and succeed no longer seems to hold true in America  So  if you are a wealthy parent  you will probably have wealthy children  But the reverse is also true  if you are a low income working parent  the chances of your son or daughter rising to the top in this economy are much less likely than they were 40 and 50 years ago  It is not too late to reverse these troubling trends  It is incumbent upon Congress and the Administration to reinvigorate the fight against inequality and restore the stepping stones that provide the foundation to broad based economic stability  opportunity  and success in this country  We need to bolster and support domestic policies that will enhance education  health  and economic security of hard working middle income families  One of the keys to this is education and I am pleased that the Senate just passed the Education Reconciliation Act  which provides a long overdue boost in need based grant aid to students pursing a college education  Bringing the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 next year and  5 400 over five years for eligible students is a good start  but it is just that  a start  This is the kind of effort that is going to help reorient our focus on creating greater economic opportunities and strengthening American families and developing a real  comprehensive economic plan that benefits all Americans  not just a select few  Our government has a very important role to play in terms of supporting the social and economic well being of our children and families  We can help to ensure quality and affordable child care for working families  support effective early education programs like Head Start  reducing the achievement gap  improving literacy rates  strengthening student aptitude in math and science  and promoting after school programs  However  if children are going to have what it takes to excel in school  they must also be healthy  Again  there are a range of sensible initiatives that go a long way to get children off to a safe and healthy start in life  Whether its reducing the incidence of childhood lead poisoning  protecting children against vaccine preventable diseases  or improving the chances of surviving deadly forms of childhood cancer  these efforts have a life long benefit  However  one way to address all of these issues and more is to provide access to meaningful and affordable health insurance coverage  Yesterday  the Senate Finance Committee passed the 5 year reauthorization of the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   It allocates an additional  35 billion in resources and would expand coverage to an additional 3 million children  The bill is expected to be considered by the full Senate next week  While the agreement provides much needed enhancements to facilitate outreach and enrollment of eligible children as well as important new quality care initiatives  the bipartisan agreement also passed up on an historic opportunity  In particular  the agreement leaves sitting on the table  15 billion in resources that had been set aside for childrens health coverage in the Congressional Budget Resolution  According to estimates  while the agreement will extend coverage to 3 3 million more children  6 million children will remain uninsured under this proposal  Every public major opinion survey out there indicates overwhelming support dedicating resources to childrens health and the additional resources would have made a significant dent in further reducing the numbers of uninsured children in this country  When you consider that we are spending  10 billion a month in Iraq  spending  10 billion a year to provide health insurance coverage to millions of children seems like a wise and effective use of our resources  I was also disappointed that the bill did not provide a federal standard for mental and dental benefits for children enrolled in SCHIP  While many states offer access to mental and dental care in their plans  the scope and breadth of these benefits varies greatly  The bill also passes up on the chance to support working families by curtailing the ability of states to expand coverage to increase the likelihood that children are ensured  My home state of Rhode Island is one of the 11 fortunate states to have been granted a waiver from the Department of Health and Human Services to cover parents of eligible children  Consequently  our state has been among the top in the country in terms of insured individuals  Under the agreement  states with existing coverage expansion waivers will be given a period of transition and no new states will be granted the opportunity to extend coverage under SCHIP  Yet  despite these shortcomings  I believe that the bill strikes a careful balance in terms of politics and policy that reinforces our commitment to childrens health  Given the masterful work of the Senate Finance Committee to craft an agreement that garnered the approval of all but four members during the mark up  I was frankly confounded when the President threatened to veto the bill before the ink had even dried last Friday  Indeed  in 2009 the next Administration faces a daunting list of challenges  comprehensive health care reform being at the top  We can and should continue to protect childrens health coverage  However  we must also begin to tackle the escalating cost of health insurance as well as the myriad of other factors that are contributing to the rapid erosion of our health care system  Simply allowing our children to mire in a spiral of poverty and despair  not only does them a great disservice  it is also harmful to us  our nation  and our society as a whole  Many of us in this room are part of the baby boom generation  we are products of the post World War II era  During that time  our government made a substantial investment in programs that resulted in the proliferation of the middle class  one of the greatest accomplishments of the last century  The fact of the matter is that this generation and future generations of children will be the drivers of our economy well into the 21st century  Without the essential supports to enable our children to strive and succeed  our nation is destined for failure  Investing in our children is not only morally compelling  it is just sensible policy  We must not allow ourselves to become complacent co conspirators in shortchanging our children of the right to excel  achieve  and succeed  Thank you again for the opportunity to be here with you today
