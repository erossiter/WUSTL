watershed including projects in the East Bay  Blackstone River  Greenwich Bay  Fox Point and South County as well as funds to aid medical training and research at Brown University         Reed stated     Rhode Island   s coastline and waterways are some of its greatest resources   I am glad I am able to play a role in helping to maintain their environmental quality and economic value by securing funding to protect these resources          The Commerce  Justice  Science Appropriations Bill for Fiscal Year  FY  2006  provides funding to research lobster shell disease in Rhode Island and throughout New England  for Save the Bay   s    Explore the Bay    Marine Education Program  for Aquaculture development and for land conservation       Reed stated     This funding is essential to the continued economic and environmental viability of Rhode Island   It will help conserve and preserve important habitat  educate Rhode Islanders about the value of Narragansett Bay and fund

150 000 in federal funding to continue a feasibility study of a project to restore estuarine habitats along the Narrow River in Narragansett and South Kingstown   The Army Corps of Engineers has prepared a Preliminary Restoration Plan to reduce tidal restriction between Narrow River and Rhode Island Sound        Narrow River  also known as Pettaquamscutt River  is located near the entrance to the West Passage of Narragansett Bay   Narrow River is a constricted and poorly flushed estuary   Shoaling in the lower Narrow River and high nutrient concentrations may be contributing to a decline in eelgrass and shellfish habitat   Eelgrass beds and other submerged aquatic vegetation provide valuable nesting  spawning  nursery  cover  and foraging habitat for aquatic and semi aquatic animals        The river provides important estuarine and freshwater habitats that contribute to the productivity of Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound   The degradation of these habitats adversely affects Rhode Island coastal ecosystems   The feasibility study will investigate alternatives to restore eelgrass  shellfish  waterfowl  and finfish habitats  and salt marshes in the Narrow River         Last year Reed secured  150 000 for the study        For more information contact  Grover Fugate  Coastal Resources Management Council   401  783 7112      Brown University Magnetic Resonance Imaging

Brush Neck Cove in Greenwich Bay   Brush Neck Cove was once home to prime shellfish habitat that has been lost due to accelerated sedimentation of the cove   The Costal Resource Management Council  CRMC  has developed a restoration plan that would restore this habitat  place the sediment on eroding public beaches and develop a management plan to maintain this once productive area   Ultimately  it is hoped that this site could be seeded as part of a public aquaculture project and serve as a spawner sanctuary   In FY 04  Reed secured  100 000 to support CRMC   s development of a management

 250 000 to support the restoration of fish runs in the Ten Mile River  which runs in eastern Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts   The construction of dams over the last 200 years has prevented fish passage to upstream spawning habitat   Restoring the fish run to the lower Ten Mile River would provide a wide range of benefits to the freshwater and marine fishery and to the surrounding communities         The Army Corps of Engineers has worked with the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management to finalize a feasibility report for the project   The federal funds would be used to initiate design for projects identified in the report  including the construction of fishways or dam removal       Reed worked with Senator Chafee to secure funding       For more

Southern New England lobster population and incidence rates have grown steadily  now affecting more than 30  of harvestable lobsters       The apparent northward movement of this disease calls for an aggressive research initiative to determine its causes  as well as its relationship to the collapse of the southern New England lobster fishery  which has become economic and environmentally troubled
