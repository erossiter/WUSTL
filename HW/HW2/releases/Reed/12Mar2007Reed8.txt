                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON  DC    With several states running out of money to help low income residents pay their home heating bills  U S  Senators Jack Reed  D RI  and Susan Collins  R ME   today sent a letter to the Senate Budget Committee requesting that they include  5 1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in the fiscal year 2008 budget   Reed and Collins were joined by 48 of their Senate colleagues in making the request        LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households   Each year  over 5 5 million low income families nationwide rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating and or cooling their homes           Too many families and seniors are unable to pay their home heating bills   We need to step up and help people struggling with historically high energy prices   said Reed  the Chairman of the Northeast Midwest Coalition    We need an emergency boost in funding to LIHEAP in the near term and to provide adequate resources to put the program on sound financial footing for the future           Senator Collins  also a Chair of the Coalition  said    The weather may be warming up in some parts of the country  but much of the Northeast and Midwest will still contend with cold temperatures in the weeks and months to come   The extended cold makes it very difficult for some families who can not afford to heat their homes  and LIHEAP makes an enormous difference in their ability to pay the bills to get their families through the winter         A recent report by the National Energy Assistance Directors  Association shows that Alabama  Indiana  Iowa  Minnesota  Nebraska  Tennessee  Washington  and West Virginia are either out of LIHEAP money or dangerously low on energy assistance funds   Additionally  several other states  including Rhode Island  are running low on funds and may be forced to scale back the number of households served   Currently  about 30 000 Rhode Island households rely on LIHEAP assistance to off set their home heating costs and maintain their utility services         In Rhode Island  the average annual LIHEAP benefit is  450 per home   But unless we act quickly  the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance could be reduced by as many as 2 000   Congress must take swift action   concluded Reed    I will continue my efforts to push for additional LIHEAP funding this year in the emergency supplemental spending bill         Reed and Collins succeeded in securing a total of  3 2 billion for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2007          The full text of the letter is below       March 9  2007          Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg        The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  provides a vital safety net for our nation s low income households   LIHEAP helps low income families and seniors remain healthy and secure from bitter cold winters in the North and hot summers in the South   We are writing to request that the budget provide  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in fiscal 2008  the full amount authorized  and that the allocation provide for advance appropriations for fiscal 2009          Our request to fund LIHEAP at its full funding level is consistent with the  5 1 billion LIHEAP allocation included in the Senate passed fiscal 2007 budget resolution  S  Con  Res  83    Funding LIHEAP at this level in regular funding and advance appropriations can help working low income families  senior citizens  and disabled individuals maintain economic stability                      For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable   These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans   spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills   Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil  propane  and electricity prices continue to increase                       In addition  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden   Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year                      Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing  and food   In 2005  the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills   The survey found that in the last five years        44  skipped paying or paid less than their entire home energy bill in the past year    Households with children or households with income below 50  of the poverty level were more likely to do so      47  went without medical or dental care due to unaffordable energy bills in the past five years    32  did not fill their prescriptions or took less than their full dose of a prescribed medicine due to energy bills in the past five years    16  became ill in the past five years because their home was too cold                        We also request  5 1 billion in advance funding for LIHEAP in fiscal 2009   Advance funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer as well as plan for a summer cooling program   Advance LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve program management  and therefore  be more economical with limited federal resources    It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait                            Thank you for your consideration   We look forward to working with you to make sure that working families  seniors  and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs
