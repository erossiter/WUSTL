Education Reauthorization Bill

Senate today passed a bill to reauthorize the Higher Education Act  This legislation builds on the passage last week of the Higher Education Access Act  which makes a nearly  14 billion investment in additional need based grant assistance for low income students  and will help middle class students and families pay down and manage their student loan debt by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income and providing loan forgiveness to students who continue in public service professions for 10 years  including teachers  nurses  and librarians  Rhode Islanders want us to address the real problems they face  Problems like affording a college education for their children  and this bill does that  It also ensures that more teachers have the necessary skills and support to effectively raise student achievement in our neighborhood schools  said Reed  a member of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee  The Senate passed Higher Education Act reauthorization bill includes several important provisions authored by Senator Reed  including key elements to  Simplify the Financial Aid Process and Forms Reeds measure will reform the Free Application for Financial Aid  FAFSA  by creating a new 2 page EZ FAFSA for low income students  and phasing out the current 7 page FAFSA for all applicants  It will also help facilitate student planning by creating a pilot program that allows students to receive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high school  Applying for college can be a stressful and daunting task  We should make the process of applying for financial aid as simple and streamlined as possible  said Reed  The FAFSA Act will take some of the guess work out of the process and give more students the opportunity to complete financial applications earlier and receive early estimates of aid eligibility  Expand Access to College Through Early Outreach and State Partnerships Building on the success of the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership  LEAP  program  Reeds provision creates a new federal incentive for states to form partnerships with businesses  colleges  and non profit organizations to provide low income students with increased need based grant aid  early information and assurance of aid eligibility  beginning in middle school   and early intervention  mentoring  and outreach services  Research has shown that college access programs that combine these elements are successful in making the dream of higher education a reality  Students participating in such programs are more financially and academically prepared  and thus  more likely to enroll in college and persist to degree completion  Since 1972  the federal state partnership embodied by LEAP  with modest federal support  has helped leverage state grant aid to low and moderate income students  Without this important federal incentive  many states would never have established need based financial aid programs  and many states would not continue to maintain such programs  noted Reed  Last year  states matched approximately  64 million in federal LEAP funds with over  840 million in supplemental need based aid  In Rhode Island  federal investment of approximately  350 000 in LEAP funds spurred the state to expend over  13 million in need based aid  Enhance Recruitment  Preparation  and Retention of Teachers and Early Childhood Educators This initiative will strengthen the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program and improve college teacher preparation programs  The PRREP Act uses proven strategies to provide teachers and early childhood educators with effective teaching skills  high quality mentoring and support  and enhanced opportunities for professional development  It also seeks to ensure that teachers have the ability to integrate technology into the classroom  use assessments to improve instructional practices and curriculum  and involve parents in their childrens education  Improving teacher quality is the single most important measure we can take to increase student achievement  Highly effective teachers are essential to providing students with a strong  quality education  said Reed  This legislation will provide federal support to ensure that teachers not only have the credentials to be considered a highly qualified teacher under the No Child Left Behind Act  but also the skills and training to be truly effective in the classroom  Put Highly Qualified Librarians in Every School District Key provisions from the LIBRARIAN Act  which Reed authored along with Senator Thad Cochran  R MS   will help address the shortage of librarians in low income areas across the country  This measure will cancel Perkins student loans for full time librarians with a masters degree in library science  Librarians working full time in low income areas would qualify for up to 100 percent Perkins student loan forgiveness depending on their number of years of experience  Librarians play an essential role in our schools and public libraries  and help to foster a lifelong love of reading in our young people  noted Reed  With a shortage of librarians across the country and with many more set to retire  we must urgently encourage more people to enter the library science field and work to retain valuable librarians who are already serving our communities  Increase Loan Forgiveness for Members of the Armed Forces The Higher Education Amendments also include provisions Reed authored to expand Perkins loan forgiveness for members of the Armed Forces from 50 to 100 percent  Provide Greater Opportunities for Students with Disabilities The bill also includes provisions Reed authored to create career pathways for students with disabilities by providing training and support to middle school  high school  and university staff to encourage interest and understanding of educational and work based opportunities for students  including those with disabilities  in disability related fields  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 also helps reform the student loan system to ensure that college financial aid offices are acting in the best interests of the students they serve  I am pleased this reauthorization bill includes provisions responding to recently uncovered conflicts of interests between lenders and college financial aid offices  This legislation provides students and families with increased disclosure about special arrangements between lenders and colleges and the terms and conditions of a schools preferred lender list  prohibits payments  gifts  and other inducements from lenders to colleges and financial aid administrators  and requires colleges to establish and follow a student loan code of conduct  concluded Reed
