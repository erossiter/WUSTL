Bureau show an economy that   s failing to deliver for ordinary Americans   After five years of the Bush Administration  the income of the typical American household is almost  1 300 lower after inflation  5 4 million more Americans live in poverty  and the ranks of those without health insurance have increased by 6 8 million        Inflation adjusted median household income rose to  46 326 in 2005  down from  47 599 in 2000  The proportion of Americans living in poverty was 12 6 percent in 2005  1 3 percentage points higher than the 11 3 percent reported in 2000   The number of Americans without health insurance increased to 46 6 million in 2005  up from 39 8 million in 2000            Today   s Census report confirms that most families have not been able to make much economic progress in the last year and they still have not made up the ground lost since President Bush took office     said Sen  Jack Reed  D RI   Ranking Democrat on the Joint Economic Committee      Slow job growth and stagnant wages during the Bush administration have left families with lower incomes  made it easier to fall into poverty and harder to escape  and contributed to the growing number of Americans without health insurance  The President   s policies have simply not produced broadly shared prosperity or greater economic opportunity for the middle class               Key findings from the Census report include the following      INCOME  The typical American household   s real  inflation adjusted  income rose a modest 1 1 percent from  45 817 in 2004 to  46 326 in 2005   Despite the gain in 2005  real median household income has declined by  1 273 during the Bush Administration   s first five years       The real income of American households has declined since 2000 across the income distribution   Since 2000  real income has declined by 7 5 percent for the poorest fifth of households and by 1 0 percent for the richest fifth of households      Median household income has decreased since 2000 among Americans of different races   Since President Bush took office  median income has declined by 1 8 percent among white  non Hispanics  by 8 0 percent among blacks  and by 4 3 percent among Hispanics      The real median earnings of both male and female full time  full year workers declined between 2004 and 2005   Since 2004 the median earnings of full time  full year working women declined by 1 3 percent  falling from  32 285 to  31 858 in 2005 dollars  and the median earnings of full time  full year working men declined by 1 8 percent  falling from  42 160 to  41 386 in 2005 dollars    The female to male earnings ratio was unchanged at 0 77      POVERTY  The poverty rate in 2005 was 12 6 percent  statistically unchanged from its level of 12 7 percent in 2004   Since 2000  the poverty rate has increased by 1 3 percentage points  There were nearly 37 million people in poverty in 2005  an increase of 5 4 million during the Bush Administration   The Census defines the poverty line for a family of four as  20 144 in 2005       Almost one in 6 American children lives in poverty   The poverty rate for children under 18 years old was 17 6 percent in 2005  statistically unchanged from the previous year   While the number of children living in poverty has increased by 11 3 percent during the first five years of the Bush Administration  the number of children receiving Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  TANF  has declined by 15 5 percent over the same time period  according to the Department of Health and Human Services      The poverty rate was 24 7 percent for blacks in 2005 and 21 8 percent for Hispanics  very high poverty rates compared with that of the population as a whole      HEALTH INSURANCE  The number of uninsured Americans rose to 46 6 million in 2005   1 3 million more than in 2004   More Americans are now without health insurance than at any point since Census began collecting comparable data starting in1987   Since 2000  the number of uninsured Americans has grown by 6 8 million         The percentage of Americans with employment based health insurance fell to 59 5 percent in 2005  down slightly from 59 8 percent in 2004   Employment based coverage is the largest component of the U S  health insurance system   The percentage of Americans with employment based coverage has not been this low since 1993      The percentage of people without health insurance increased in all income groups  but the greatest increase was for those with incomes between  50 000 and  75 000   The percentage of people without health insurance increased from 13 0 percent in 2004 to 14 1 percent in 2005 for those with incomes between  50 000 and  75 000   The uninsured rate held relatively steady at 24 4 percent for those with incomes of less than  25 000  while the rate for those with incomes of  75 000 or more rose 0 3 percentage points to 8 5 percent        The number of uninsured children under 18 years of age  increased by 400 000 between 2004 and 2005   Even with the prior enrollment success of the State Children   s Health Insurance Program  the percentage of uninsured children increased from 10 8 percent in 2004  to 11 2 percent in 2005   The number of all uninsured non elderly adults over 18 years of age also increased  rising by 945 000 from 2004 to 2005      Enrollment in Medicaid remained constant in 2005 at 13 0 percent of the population   Without Medicaid coverage of the poorest Americans  the number of people without health insurance would almost certainly be higher
