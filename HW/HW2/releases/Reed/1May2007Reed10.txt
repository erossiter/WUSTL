help low income residents pay their home heating bills  U S  Senators Jack Reed  D RI  and Susan Collins  R ME   today sent a letter to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health  and Human Services requesting that they include  5 1 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in the fiscal year 2008 budget   Reed and Collins  Co Chairs of the Northeast Midwest Coalition  were joined by 47 of their Senate colleagues in making the request        LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households   Each year  over 5 5 million low income families nationwide rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating and or cooling their homes           With energy prices on the rise  it is becoming increasingly difficult for many families to pay their utility bills   said Senator Reed    Unless President Bush and Congress work together to increase funding for LIHEAP  many states will be forced to either cut funding for seniors and low income families or turn away people in need   We must act now to increase federal assistance for LIHEAP and provide more consumers with some relief          LIHEAP is critical to so many families in Maine and throughout the nation   said Senator Collins    No family should ever be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on their table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   That is why Senator Reed and I have long fought to ensure that LIHEAP funds are available to help needy families         The full text of the letter is below       Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter        We thank you for your support in the FY2007 Supplemental Appropriations Act for increased funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   We share your strong support for this program and respectfully request an appropriation of  5 1 billion to fund it in FY2008        For many low income families  disabled individuals  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes  home energy costs are unaffordable  These families often carry a higher energy burden than most Americans   spending up to 17 percent of their income on home energy bills  Each year  this burden grows as natural gas  heating oil  propane  and electricity prices continue to increase  Providing  5 1 billion for LIHEAP will help states reach a greater percentage of LIHEAP eligible households  and as a result  create an effective and broad safety net for those people least able to pay their utility bills        In addition to providing assistance with home energy bills  LIHEAP also helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year        Energy is a basic need  and without LIHEAP assistance  low income families and senior citizens face the impossible choice between paying their home energy bills or affording other basic necessities such as prescription drugs  housing  and food  In 2005  the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  NEADA  surveyed over 2 000 LIHEAP recipients on the choices made by households when faced with high energy bills  The survey found that in the last five years             44  skipped paying or paid less than their entire home energy bill in the past year   Households with children or households with income below 50  of the poverty level were more likely to do so              47  went without medical or dental care due to unaffordable energy bills in the past five years            32  did not fill their prescriptions or took less than their full dose of a prescribed medicine due to energy bills in the past five years  and           16  became ill in the past five years because their home was too cold        In addition to our request for funding in FY2008  we also request  5 1 billion in advanced funding for LIHEAP in FY2009  Advanced funding enables states to pre purchase fuel and start planning for the winter heating season in spring and early summer as well as plan for a summer cooling program  Advanced LIHEAP funding allows states to plan more efficiently and improve      program management  and therefore  he more economical with limited federal resources  It also ensures that states provide timely assistance to low income families who cannot afford to wait        Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to ensure that working families  seniors  and disabled individuals have the resources necessary to provide for their basic energy needs        Thank you for your consideration of our request
