Rising Energy Costs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      CRANSTON  RI  In an effort to help consumers deal with rising energy prices  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today joined with Joanne McGunagle  Executive Director  Comprehensive Community Action Program  Robert Murray  Senior VP Corporate Affairs  AAA Southern New England  and Dennis Brennan  President of Brennan Oil  in calling for federal action to help families struggling with the consequences of soaring oil costs  The Bush Administrations mishandling of the war in Iraq has significantly contributed to a major spike in oil prices  Today  we have the largest trade deficit ever with oil imports accounting for nearly a third of that trade deficit  The economy is exposed to oil price shocks and supply disruptions  and families are feeling the pinch of oil prices at the pump and in their homes  said Reed  The billions of petrodollars being exported out of the United States to pay for energy have a very real effect on local economies and our national security  In Rhode Island  gas prices have increased by  1 87 per gallon  an increase of 156 percent  since 2001 and the cost of heating oil has increased by  1 97 per gallon  an increase of 159 percent  since 2001  Rates are also expected to be higher for natural gas and electricity service this winter  Soaring energy prices mean less money for food  shelter  and life saving medicine  leaving Rhode Islanders with very tough choices  The Bush Administration must step up and address these problems now to help ease the burden on struggling families  They can help provide working families with much needed relief by supporting Congress efforts to increase funding for LIHEAP  raising fuel economy standards  investing in energy efficiency and renewable energy  and cracking down on price manipulation and excessive speculation in the energy markets  stated Reed  who recently cosponsored the Close the Enron Loophole Act with Carl Levin  D MI  to help prevent price manipulation and distortions that lead to high gas  oil  and electricity prices for U S  consumers  On November 13  President Bush vetoed the Labor HHS Education appropriations bill  which would have provided  2 4 billion for LIHEAP   629 million above the Presidents request  The administration also currently has  20 million of LIHEAP funding that could be released immediately to provide families and seniors with additional assistance to meet rising energy costs  Senator Reed and several of his colleagues today sent a letter to President Bush urging him to release contingency funding for LIHEAP and support Congress funding level for the program  The text of the letter follows  The President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500 Dear Mr  President   We are writing to request that you release the remaining  20 million in contingency LIHEAP funds and to urge you to support at least  2 411 billion for the LIHEAP program in FY2008  With the price of oil approaching  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter   Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million   LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances
