members of the 143rdAirlift Wing in touching down at Quonset State Airport to deliver the eighth and final C 130J Super Hercules airplane to the Rhode Island Air National Guard  This is a great day for the Guard and a great day for Rhode Island  said Reed  a senior member of the Armed Services Committee  The men and women of the Rhode Island National Guard do an outstanding job of protecting our country  both at home and abroad  They deserve the best equipment and I am pleased to have led the charge to help modernize their fleet of C 130s  These planes will help the 143rd Airlift Wing transport troops  equipment  and supplies to combat and humanitarian missions around the world  For over a decade  Senator Reed has been a tireless advocate for modernizing the Air Guards fleet and securing these eight state of the art C 130J 30 planes for the Rhode Island Air National Guard  In 1994 Senator Reed began working to ensure the delivery of eight new C130J cargo planes to the Rhode Island National Guard to replace the Guard s aging C130E cargo airplanes  built in 1963  Senator Reed ensured that funding for the planes was included in the Defense Appropriations bill  In June of 2000 an attempt was made to redirect some of these aircraft from Rhode Island to California  Senator Reed intervened and succeeded in authoring a legislative provision ensuring the Air Force would direct future C 130Js to Rhode Island  The C 130J Super Hercules is the most modern tactical airlifter in the world  It can fly further  faster  and carry a heavier payload than its predecessors  noted Reed  who has flown in theater with the 143rd Airlift Wings C 130s while visiting troops in Iraq and Afghanistan in January 2006  Ive seen firsthand what these planes can do under the leadership and direction of our outstanding Rhode Island airmen and women  These new planes will help the 143rd provide improved combat airlift and support to forces in the field and quickly and efficiently respond to a natural disaster or emergency here at home  The 143rd received its first C 130J 30 in December of 2001  In 2004  the 143rd was the first U S  unit to deploy a C 130J to Iraq  Over the years  Senator Reed secured  37 million for construction of a new maintenance hanger for the planes at Quonset Point  The old maintenance hanger  built in 1941 was not large enough to accommodate the new planes  The older planes lacked updated avionics and defense systems  These C 130J Super Hercules planes have new technologies to help them perform well in severe weather or blackout operations  said Reed  They will help increase our military readiness and the Guards ability to respond to emergencies here at home  In January of 2005  the Bush Administration proposed terminating the multiyear C 130J procurement contract  This would have left Rhode Islands Guard unit only partially modernized  Senator Reed called the cut ill advised and untimely and worked to undo it  noting that scrapping the program would have resulted in spending billions of dollars to repair and maintain older planes  In March of 2005 the Pentagon relented and Rhode Island was able to receive the rest of its new planes  FACTS  FIGURES  Rhode Islands C 130J 30s are over 112 feet long  15 feet longer than the short length C 130J aircraft  which translates to 30 percent more usable volume for increased seating and cargo  With a wingspan of 132 feet and seven inches and Rolls Royce engines coupled to an all composite  six bladed propeller system  the planes can reach speeds of up to 410 miles per hour  travel a range of over 2 400 miles  and carry a payload of up to 44 000 pounds  It can carry seven pallets of cargo  two more than the standard C 130J  or 92 paratroopers and their equipment  28 more than a C 130J        The C 130J 30 also features a strengthened cargo ramp and improved airdrop system which helps minimize exposure to anti aircraft fire in hostile areas  It only requires three crew members for most missions  so fewer flight crew members are exposed to potential threats in theater        The C 130J 30s cost approximately  64 million each         After Hurricane Katrina struck in the fall of 2005  the 143rds fleet of C 130Js executed over 20 support missions  logging over 200 flight hours while moving over 600 military passengers and 200 tons of cargo in the region         In May of 2007 a 143rd J supported the U S  Coast Guard efforts in their search for a missing sailboat and its 4 Rhode Island crewmembers    According to the Rhode Island National Guard  here are some of the numbers the 143rd helped compile as part of a C 130J joint force deployment for high tempo intra theater operations over twenty  20  months  During the deployment  four C 130Js conducted 5 444 sorties over 10 750 flight hours  delivered 12 681 tons of cargo and carried 70 350 passengers
