                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  DC  By a vote of 79 12 the U S  Senate passed a bipartisan  landmark education bill this morning that halves interest rates on loans to college students  increases grant assistance  and makes it easier for more students to qualify for financial aid  I am pleased the Senate passed this important bill to help put college within reach for more deserving students  said U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI   a senior member of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee and member of the Conference Committee that developed the legislation  It will provide an immediate financial boost to thousands of deserving students in Rhode Island and will help millions of students and their families pay down their student loans  Lowering Interest Rates for Middle Class Families  The College Cost Reduction and Access Act of 2007 includes provisions to stem the increasing numbers of middle class families falling further into debt to finance a college education  The legislation phases in a lower interest rate on new subsidized Stafford loans to undergraduate students  reducing the rate in half over four years from 6 8 percent to 3 4 percent  It seeks to protect borrowers by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of their discretionary income  The bill also provides loan forgiveness to students who continue in public service professions for 10 years  including teachers  nurses  and librarians  In Rhode Island  61 percent of students graduating from four year institutions in the 2004 5 school year graduated with debt averaging over  20 000 per student  Too many students graduating college are facing the daunting prospect of paying back thousands of dollars in student loans  often taking years to pay back  said Reed  We must do what we can to help our young people get their degrees without being over burdened by their student loans  This bill will go a long way to helping hardworking students and their families secure a brighter future  Increasing Pell Grants  This legislation provides nearly  20 2 billion in additional student aid to students and their families including an additional  7 8 million in need based grant aid for Rhode Island students next year and nearly  85 million in the next 5 years  It also increases the maximum award of Pell Grants next year by  500 and will increase the grants to  5 400 by 2012  That increases the average grant in Rhode Island by  360 in 2008 to  2 880  The Pell Grant is named after former Rhode Island senator Claiborne Pell  Pell Grants are a key source of funding for students who have the talent but not the financial means to go to college  said Reed  We must ensure that these grants keep up with the ever increasing cost of college  I am pleased that my colleagues have recognized the importance of increasing funding for this essential program  Simplifying the Financial Aid Process  Also included in the legislation are provisions from Senator Reeds Financial Aid Form Simplification and Access  FAFSA  Act  S  939  to make it easier for more students to qualify for student financial aid  With an estimated 12 000 Rhode Island students graduating high school this year  Reeds provision will simplify the financial aid process for low income students by raising the Automatic Zero Expected Family Contribution threshold to  30 000  Reeds provision will ensure that all students from families with incomes of  30 000 or less will receive a maximum Pell Grant  Currently  only families making  20 000 or less automatically qualify for such grants  The provision not only increases the number of low income students eligible for need based aid  but also simplifies the financial aid process by providing such students with early information and assurances of financial aid for college  This automatic eligibility level would also be tied to the Consumer Price Index to ensure that the benefit keeps pace with inflation and does not become diluted  Reed also authored a provision in the legislation to reduce the penalty faced by students when they work in order to pay for college  This provision doubles the Income Protection Allowance for dependent students from  3 000 to  6 000 over four years and increases the Income Protection Allowance for independent students  including adult learners and veterans  by 50 percent over four years  These increases will protect students who have to work during college so they can earn more without having it count against their financial aid  This bipartisan legislation tackles the twin goals of access and affordability for students and families and helps ensure that our nation remains competitive in todays global economy  concluded Reed  The House is expected to pass the bill later today and the President has stated his intent to sign the legislation into law
