From Foreclosure                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                PROVIDENCE  RI    With the number of foreclosures tied to subprime mortgages on the rise  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today unveiled comprehensive legislation to expand access to foreclosure prevention services to homeowners who are experiencing financial hardship   The Homeownership Protection and Enhancement  HOPE  Act of 2007 is a  615 million initiative that will help prevent financially distressed homeowners from losing their homes and assist in steering more people away from the brink of foreclosure        There were 1 2 million foreclosures reported nationwide last year  up 42  from 2005  according to RealtyTrac  a database of foreclosed properties   RealtyTrac also reports 430 000 foreclosure filings in the first quarter of 2007  a 35  jump over the same period in 2006        The increasing rate of foreclosures across the country is troubling   Not only are individual families losing their homes and their financial nest eggs  but foreclosures can have a negative ripple effect across communities and the economy   said Reed  a senior member of the Banking Committee  which oversees federal housing policy    The HOPE Act will help states establish and enhance outreach programs to proactively find homeowners at risk of losing their homes and help them avoid foreclosure          Foreclosure rates are on the rise in Rhode Island   In 2006  Rhode Island had the highest home foreclosure rate in New England and exceeded the national average   According to First American Loan Performance  in 2006  nearly 16  of all home purchase loans in Rhode Island were subprime or  interest only    However  as home prices have declined  many people who took out these exotic loans are now finding they owe more than the value of their property         We need better protections to help people from losing their homes   said Reed    The money in this bill will reward states that have already set up effective programs to help curtail foreclosures with additional funding and resources   It will also provide an incentive for more states to reach out to delinquent borrowers  provide them with financial counseling  and  when appropriate  help them negotiate a plan to restructure their debt         The Center for Responsible Lending estimates that one in five subprime loans originated during the prior two years will end in foreclosure  costing homeowners  164 billion  mostly in lost equity          The HOPE Act would provide                                 50 million for the creation and operation of State Homeownership Protection Centers   The centers can serve as a one stop resource  offering consumers a broad range of services and assistance  such as providing financial assessments  counseling  or referrals to families in need                                260 million in federal funding to states who operate State Homeownership Protection Centers for revolving loan funds to offer one time grants or subsidized loans to qualified families                                300 million to increase funding for effective HUD approved counseling agencies                                5 million for the creation of a federal database on defaults and foreclosures to improve oversight of public and private efforts to sustain homeownership        To help prevent future borrowers from taking on unsustainable mortgages and falling into foreclosure  the HOPE Act would also establish new federal guidelines to                                Create an affirmative duty for lenders and servicers to engage in reasonable loss mitigation prior to foreclosure                               Require notifications by lenders to provide borrowers with information on the full array of counseling services available in their state at every critical step   at application  at closing  and upon delinquency                                If a state has a State Homeownership Protection Center  require lenders and servicers to refer delinquent borrowers to the center so that it can proactively attempt to reach distressed borrowers          Reed noted that when a house gets foreclosed on  it is not just the borrowers and lenders who pay the price  whole neighborhoods can suffer   Housing industry experts estimate that for every foreclosure within an eighth of a mile of a house   two and a half city blocks in every direction   the surrounding home s property value drops by about 1 percent         The federal government has a responsibility to step in and ensure that millions of Americans   people who never took out a risky loan and have scrimped and saved to pay their bills on time   are not adversely affected by the subprime foreclosure crisis   concluded Reed    This legislation is not a bailout  it is targeted relief that will help more families keep their homes and save communities nationwide millions of dollars   We need to act swiftly before personal financial tragedies turn into a full blown national financial crisis
