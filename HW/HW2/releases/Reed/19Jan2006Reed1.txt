                                                                                              January 19  2006     Press Release        Reed Reaction to FERC Decision on LNG Terminals in Providence and Weaver   s Cove                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator Jack Reed stated     I am pleased that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has reaffirmed its decision to reject the proposed construction of an LNG storage facility in Providence           Unfortunately LNG supertankers serving the Weaver   s Cove LNG terminals would pass by several Rhode Island towns and cities and along miles of populated coastline        In its process for approving the siting of these terminals FERC has chronically failed to take into consideration the safety of citizens and how to balance security with the long term  regional energy needs of New England          I will continue to work with my colleagues in Rhode Island and Massachusetts to discuss what we can now do to stop the Weaver   s Cove decision  It is my hope that the Army Corps of Engineers rejects dredging permits for this project         On January 17  2006  Senator Jack Reed  and Congressmen Patrick Kennedy and Jim Langevin sent a letter urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to reject a request by KeySpan LNG and Algonquin Gas Transmission for a rehearing for a liquefied natural gas  LNG  storage facility in Providence       Text of the letter follows      We write to urge the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to reject a request from KeySpan LNG  L P  BG LNG Services  LLC  BGLS  and Algonquin Gas Transmission  LLC for a rehearing for a liquefied natural gas  LNG  storage facility in Providence  Rhode Island   Further  we encourage FERC to grant a request for a rehearing on its approval of the Weaver   s Cove Energy LNG marine terminal in Fall River  Massachusetts          While we recognize that natural gas is an important and growing component of New England   s energy supply  we are extremely concerned about the safety and security risks associated with siting LNG marine terminals in urban communities and requiring LNG tankers to pass by eleven Rhode Island towns and cities and more than 25 miles of densely populated coastline         We have long worked with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  to identify safer ways to deliver LNG to our region   Unfortunately  the Commission refused to consider a regional approach to LNG terminal siting  one that would take a comprehensive look at all the options  including offshore terminals  remote facilities that are being built in Canada  and other sites in the northeastern United States that are not in the heart of densely populated urban communities         We urge the rejection of these LNG proposals for a variety of reasons  including a concern that the approval process for LNG terminals is deeply flawed and leaves too many questions unanswered   We do not know exactly what impact the arrival and departure of 100 or more LNG tankers each year will have on recreational and commercial traffic on Narragansett Bay  or on transportation in the region due to bridge closures during LNG tanker transits    Further  the Coast Guard has told our offices repeatedly that it does not have the resources to adequately secure these LNG tankers and marine terminals while fulfilling its other post 9 11 responsibilities   Adequate security would require a whole new level of personnel and infrastructure  yet we have no cost estimate and no guarantee that new federal resources will be made available   Similarly  a tremendous new burden will be placed on our state and local law enforcement and first responder agencies       We hope we can work with FERC to explore other means  including offshore facilities  to bring more natural gas to our region while minimizing the risk to our citizens          Thank you for your attention to this matter
