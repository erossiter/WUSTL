                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON  DC In an effort to provide more children with improved access to quality pre school programs  the U S  Senate last night passed a bill to reauthorize the highly successful Head Start program for another five years  The Head Start for School Readiness Act  which includes key provisions authored by U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI   authorizes increased funding levels for Head Start from  6 9 billion in the current fiscal year to  7 3 billion in FY 2008   7 5 billion in FY 2009  and  7 9 billion in 2010  Head Start provides comprehensive early childhood development services to low income children up to age five and helps prepare them for school  Head Start programs in Rhode Island include free part time and full day preschool programs to income eligible children  In addition to educational instruction  kids enrolled in the program receive healthy meals and snacks  social services  and access to on site health care  According to the latest Rhode Island Kids Count Factbook  in 2006 over 2 400 children throughout the state benefited from these Head Start programs  Head Start is a vital program that helps thousands of children in Rhode Island and across the country develop basic reading  writing  arithmetic  and social skills  said Reed  a senior member of the Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee  By providing a safe and healthy learning environment for their children  Head Start helps more working parents keep their full time jobs and care for their kids  A landmark study by the High Scope Educational Research Foundation documents how investing in pre school education programs like Head Start can save taxpayers money in the long run  Initiated in 1962 and lasting over 40 years  the study found that a high quality early childhood program exerts a dramatic impact on the lives of low income children  The High Scope study found programs like Head Start improve childrens educational success  increase their adult earnings  reduces criminal activity  and returns nearly  13 to taxpayers for every dollar invested in the program  Head Start has been a real success story in Rhode Island and throughout the nation  I am pleased to support this program and help make it stronger  said Reed  Head Start is a wise investment in our young people and a down payment on helping them to secure a brighter future  Senator Reed authored several key provisions of the bill  including language to increase the income eligibility requirements to allow more children to qualify for the program  Currently  Head Starts income thresholds are lower than most other mean tested federal programs  Reeds provision lifts the eligibility requirements so that families living below 130 percent of the federal poverty rate  approximately  26 000 for a family of four  can qualify and participate in Head Start  Reeds provision will allow low income working families and children who may be just above the poverty line to participate in the program  The success of the Head Start program in shaping the lives of young people has been demonstrated time and time again  It is important that we serve as many children and families in need of these important services as possible  said Reed  This new legislation will give more working parents a hand up and get their kids on the right track  Reed also led efforts to ensure that parents are able to participate more fully in the Head Start program through the Parent Policy Council  This council  made up of Head Start parents  would become a decision making authority within the governing structure of Head Start  Strong parental involvement has been a key tenet of the Head Start program since its inception  and is one of the primary reasons for the programs continuing success  The Parent Policy Council will afford parents an even greater opportunity to participate and help shape their childs early educational development  Reed stated  Reed also worked to ensure that the Head Start reauthorization bill ensures enhanced coordination and partnerships between grantees and school and public libraries  to help children foster a love of reading  assist in literacy training for Head Start teachers  and support parents and other caregivers in literacy efforts  and ensure wider Head Start community participation on the State Advisory Council  The Head Start community is deeply appreciative of Senator Reeds initiative to increase our eligibility guidelines to 130  of poverty  allowing the inclusion of Rhode Island children from very low income working families  stated Rhode Island Head Start Association Director  Lynda Dickinson  We are extremely proud that Senator Reed has provided the leadership that will ensure the continued participation of low income parents in the governance of Head Start  He has always been  and remains  a true champion of low income children and their families  The Head Start program is administered by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   Federal Head Start funds are provided directly to local grantees  and are locally designed and administered by a network of over 1 600 public and private nonprofit and for profit agencies  The program was created in 1965 and was last reauthorized in 1998  Since its inception  it has helped provide over 15 million young children with the skills to succeed in the classroom and beyond  Now that the bill has passed the full Senate  it goes to conference with the House of Representatives  Senator Reed has been named a conferee and will help negotiate the bills final language
