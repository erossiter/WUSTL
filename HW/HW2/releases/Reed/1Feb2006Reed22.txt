Funding                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today was joined by his colleagues in calling on President Bush to support funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   At a press conference  Senator Reed called on the President to support supplemental funding for LIHEAP for fiscal year 2006  and fully fund LIHEAP in fiscal year 2007 at  5 1 billion       Reed has consistently asked Congress and the President to provide  5 1 billion in funding for LIHEAP    Unfortunately  while receiving a majority of Senate support  Reed   s efforts were defeated on a budget technicality   In December  the Republican Congress approved only  2 183 billion   http   reed senate gov news energy funding 10 19 05 cfm          Record high heating prices could wipe out many families across the country this winter  Many families and seniors are being forced to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table   The President must work to ensure that these families receive the assistance that they need by fully funding the LIHEAP program          Reed reiterated that oil companies  which have been making record profits  should also work to help low income families and seniors pay their heating bills this winter       Reed was also joined by his colleagues in sending a letter to the President requesting full funding for LIHEAP       Text of the letter follows      Dear President Bush        High energy prices continue to threaten the health and economic well being of households across the United States  but especially low income families   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by supporting an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in FY 2006  and requesting  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in your FY 2007 budget request  the level authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005           The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   Unfortunately  energy prices do not appear to be dropping falling in the near future   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation           Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education         Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted four times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate   s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote         In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans    Your leadership on this issue will help ensure that low income families and seniors get the help they deserve from the federal government            We respectfully request that you support supplemental funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006  and full funding for the program in FY2007 at its authorized level of  5 1 billion           We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs         Thank you for your consideration for this essential request
