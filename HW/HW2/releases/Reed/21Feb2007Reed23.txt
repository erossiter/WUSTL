Heating Assistance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  DC    In an effort to help the elderly  low income families  and disabled individuals pay their heating bills  U S  Senators Jack Reed  D RI  and Susan M  Collins  R ME  today urged the White House to immediately release  200 million which is available in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  emergency contingency fund        The release of LIHEAP contingency funds is needed to help states meet additional energy related needs resulting from the extended arctic cold wave which has covered much of the nation during the past several days  causing temperatures in some regions to dip to forty two degrees below zero   At least nine deaths spread over five states have been attributed to the surge of cold weather   wrote the senators  who were joined by 34 of their Senate colleagues in signing the letter           Too many families and seniors do not have adequate resources to pay their energy bills   This money will be a real help for those who continue to struggle with record high energy prices   said Reed  the Chairman of the Northeast Midwest Coalition    In Rhode Island  nearly 30 000 households rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes each year and to pay delinquent utilities bills so they can re establish service         LIHEAP is critical to so many families in Maine and throughout the nation  It is imperative that dollars be immediately available to help these families heat their homes this winter   said Senator Collins    We will continue to work to ensure that the LIHEAP program is funded at a level to meet the needs of families this winter and in future years        LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households   Each year  over 5 million low income families rely on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating and or cooling their homes       The full text of the letter is below      February 21  2007      The President      The White House      Washington  DC  20500      Dear Mr  President       We urge you to immediately release  200 million which is available in the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  emergency contingency fund           The release of LIHEAP contingency funds is needed to help states meet additional energy related needs resulting from the extended arctic cold wave which has covered much of the nation during the past several days  causing temperatures in some regions to dip to forty two degrees below zero   At least nine deaths spread over five states have been attributed to the surge of cold weather       Between FY 2005 and FY 2006 the number of households receiving heating assistance increased from 5 1 million to 5 7 million   Preliminary reports from state officials suggest that the number of households applying for energy assistance for FY 2007 is likely to remain at FY 2006 levels   However  as a result of the recent surge of cold weather  several states across the Union are already running out of funds   They have few or no funds remaining to address crises conditions  and the situation is expected to get considerably worse in the next few weeks         No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills   We urge you to immediately release the remaining balance of funds in the LIHEAP contingency fund                Respectfully       Jack Reed      Susan M  Collins      Edward M  Kennedy
