Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON  DC    The U S  Senate approved a spending bill last night to provide  463 5 billion for several national priorities including education  medical research  veterans and military health care  transportation  and energy and environmental programs   Senator Jack Reed  D RI   a member of the Appropriations Committee  supported the fiscal year 2007 funding resolution to boost funding that will benefit many Rhode Islanders          Under the new spending plan  Pell Grants will be increased  260 per year  up to  4 310 per student   The National Institutes of Health  NIH  will get a  620 million boost to fund over 500 research grants to help find a cure for deadly diseases   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  will get a  3 6 billion increase to improve its vital medical care    including in patient  out patient  mental health and long term care   for our nation s veterans   And in order to take better care of our current military members  the bill includes an additional  1 4 billion to help treat service members wounded in action in Iraq and Afghanistan        The bill will also boost funding for programs to help improve energy efficiency  helping Rhode Islanders save money on their energy bills  In addition  it will restore vital funding that was cut by the Bush Administration  to help communities provide safe  clean water to residents  and provide funding for Rhode Island transportation projects as authorized in the 2005 highway and transit reauthorization legislation       Expanding College Financial Aid  The legislation will provide  13 6 billion for Pell Grants    an increase of  615 4 million over last year    raising the maximum Pell Grant by  260 to  4 310         This legislation provides significant funding to help educate our kids and allow more deserving students to attend college   After several years of work  I am pleased we were finally able to raise Pell grants   said Reed    But with college tuitions continuing to rise  Pell Grants need to keep pace   We need to do better and increase the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100        Boosting Health Research and Medical Care   The National Institutes of Health is funded at  28 9 billion  an increase of  620 million over last year  for research to cure debilitating and possibly deadly diseases   Meanwhile  Community Health Centers would receive  1 9 billion  an increase of  207 million  to finance more than 300 new or expanded health centers         We were also able to provide a modest increase to NIH to allow them to expand groundbreaking research efforts to better treat and cure conditions such as cancer  diabetes  and heart disease   said Reed    Community Health Centers provide invaluable health services to communities and people who otherwise may not have access to quality care  This legislation will help these centers to continue their important work in Rhode Island and across the nation         Each year  Community Health Centers in Rhode Island receive about 350 000 visits and perform over 600 000 procedures  reducing the burden on the state s hospitals and emergency rooms       Improving Medical Care for Veterans and Active Duty Personnel   The bill provides  32 3 billion for the VA  an increase of  3 6 billion over the Fiscal 2006 level to help our brave men and women who have served  with  271 million to improve veteran medical care facilities         We need a VA system that is able to serve all our veterans as honorably as they served our country   It is imperative that we meet our veterans  health care needs now and in the future   said Reed  the acting Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs    The biggest cost of any war is the human cost   President Bush s past budgets have short changed our veterans and our current military personnel   This increase will bring us closer to where we need to be to provide adequate care for all the soldiers and veterans who need it        Improving Energy Efficiency and Clean Water Infrastructure  The bill also increases funding for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy programs to  1 5 billion and provides  5 million for the Northeast Home Heating Oil Reserve  which Reed worked to include in the legislation   The bill also restores  1 billion in vital funding  cut by the Administration  to help states and communities with the construction of drinking water  wastewater  and storm water infrastructure and for water quality protection         The funding included in this bill will help protect our environment and natural resources while at the same time helping our citizens save money on their energy bills   stated Reed        Fully Funding Rhode Island Transportation Projects  The legislation will also fully fund the federal highway program as authorized in the Safe  Accountable  Flexible  Efficient  Transportation Equity Act of 2005         Reed stated   The federal funding guaranteed to Rhode Island through the highway reauthorization bill is essential to maintaining ongoing and future transportation projects throughout the state  I am pleased that we have taken this step to make sure that this full funding is available         The bipartisan measure  which was approved by a vote of 81 to 15  also eliminated billions of dollars worth of special interest provisions that were inserted into previous appropriations bills with little or no oversight         I commend Chairman Byrd and Chairman Obey for their leadership in quickly passing this vital legislation   These spending bills should have been completed by the last Congress   concluded Reed    By passing this bill we are taking an important step toward cleaning up the financial mess left over by the Republican led Congress and making wise investments in America s future
