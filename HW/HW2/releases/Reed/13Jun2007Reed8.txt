Military Construction and Veterans Affairs  VA  today approved a  64 7 billion spending bill to boost military construction  upgrade veterans health care  and improve the quality of life for military

veterans  fund new claims processors to address the VAs backlog  and invest in VA repair and maintenance needs to prevent a Walter Reed type situation in the VA system  This increase in funding is a major victory for our veterans  soldiers  and their families  said Reed  a former Army Ranger  The money in this bill will help address the health needs of our service members and allow the VA to accelerate its efforts to clear the current backlog in the processing of benefits claims   The Senate bill also addresses key quality of life needs for U S  troops and their families  It provides  21 56 billion for military construction projects  such as barracks  hospitals  and runways  including money to upgrade the National Guard facilities at Quonset and Naval Station Newport  Rhode Island

9 9 million for the reconstruction of the wharf connecting Piers 1 and 2 at the Naval Station in Newport  These piers are an integral part of naval operations at the base with Pier 1 anchoring two inactive carriers and Pier 2 serving as the primary operational pier for the Naval Station supporting four Coast Guard ships  visiting ships  and a building that houses port operations  Coast Guard

and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill Total Discretionary Funding  Subcommittee Mark   64 7 billion President s Request   60 7 billion 2007 Enacted   49 8 billion  Excluding  6 6 Billion in emergency supplemental funding  Department of Veterans Affairs  The VA faced catastrophic budget shortfalls in fiscal years 2005 and 2006  due in large part to the growing needs of veterans of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan  In the fiscal year 2007 supplemental funding bill  Congress provided an additional  1 8 billion for veterans health care  veterans benefits  and construction needs  This included  1 3 billion targeted primarily to the unique health care needs of veterans from the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and to ensuring that VA facilities are maintained at the highest level  The Senate legislation includes  43 billion for the VA   3 6 billion over Presidents request  and  6 5 billion above FY 2007 level  excluding  1 8 billion in emergency supplemental funding   Veterans Health Administration   37 2 billion   2 6 billion over the President s request and  4 5 billion  13 9   over FY 2007 level  not including FY 2007 Supplemental   This includes funding for medical services  facilities  administration  and research  o Medical Services   29 billion   1 8 billion above the Presidents budget request and  3 5 billion above FY 2007 to improve access to medical services for all veterans  The additional funding for Medical Services provided in the Senate bill directs the VA to prioritize its emphasis on polytrauma care and mental health services  including the treatment of Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   which has become an issue of major concern among returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans  as well as Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   o Medical Administration   3 6 billion   200 million above the Presidents budget request and  464 million  14 6   above FY 2007  excludes  250 million in emergency supplemental funding   o Medical Facilities   4 1 billion   500 million above the Presidents budget request and  522 million  14 6   above FY 2007  excludes  595 million in FY 2007 emergency supplemental funding   Veterans Benefits Administration   1 3 billion   131 million above the Presidents budget request  Includes  131 million in additional funds for the VA to hire at least 500 additional claims processors to reduce the backlog of VA medical claims  This is in addition to  61 million included for claims processors in the FY 2007 supplemental  Minor Construction and Non Recurring Maintenance  Adds  1 billion over the Presidents budget request for minor construction and non recurring maintenance of VA hospitals and clinics  The purpose of this funding increase is to ensure that VA facilities do not experience the same type of deterioration experienced at Walter Reed    Military Construction  Excluding the carve out for base realignment and closure activities  BRAC  and for the President s Grow the Force initiative  the Administrations request for military construction remains consistent with  and  in some instances  significantly below  the level of funding in fiscal year 2007  particularly in the case of the National Guard and Reserve  For example  the budget request for the Army National Guard is down 14 5 percent from the fiscal year 2007 appropriated amount  The Air National Guard request is down 32 percent  the Army Reserve is down 27 9 percent  and the Air Force Reserve reflects a 41 percent reduction  These reductions reflect a troubling multi year downward trend in the Department s investment in infrastructure for the Reserve components  The Senate legislation provides  21 56 billion for military construction  approximately  400 million above the Presidents request and  8 8 billion above FY 2007  excluding FY 2007 supplemental   Grow the Force Initiative   2 74 billion to support the Administration s proposal to increase the size of the Army by 65 000  the Marine Corps by 27 000  and the Guard and Reserve by 9 200 during the next five years  The bill requires GAO to study the adequacy of the Administration s planning and budgeting process for construction of housing and operational facilities to support this growth  Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  and Re stationing Costs   8 17 billion for BRAC 2005  fully funding the Presidents budget request  to implement base closures and realignments  as well as the re stationing of 70 000 troops and their families from overseas bases to bases in the United States  National Guard and Reserves   929 8 million   234 7 million above the Presidents budget request  The National Guard and Reserve have been stretched to near breaking point with continual and extended deployments  Infrastructure requests to support Guard and Reserve training and readiness have been steadily declining  Without the support of Congress  the infrastructure so vital to the preparation of U S  Guard and Reserve forces would be in failing condition  This legislation continues to invest in the Guard and Reserve and to ensure that they are prepared to answer the call to duty  whether here at home or on battlefields around the world    All major construction projects funded through the military construction appropriations accounts are included in either the President s budget request or the Services  Future Years Defense Programs
