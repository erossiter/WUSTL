                                                                                              May 21  2007     Press Release        Reed Joins Local Families in Promoting Childhood Cancer Research and Family Support Services                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       PROVIDENCE  RI   Flanked by local health officials and families who have struggled with childhood cancer  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI   today called for expanding research programs aimed at preventing childhood cancer   To increase the emphasis on combating cancer  Reed authored the bipartisan Conquer Childhood Cancer Act of 2007   This legislation would authorize  150 million over a five year period for childhood cancer research and increase services to patients and families affected by the disease         Each year  over 12 000 American children are diagnosed with cancer and more than 2 000 end up succumbing to this devastating disease   stated Reed  a senior member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Committee   While we have made great advances in treating cancer  there is still much more to be done  The Conquer Childhood Cancer Act will deliver much needed hope and support to children and families battling cancer and more resources for vital pediatric cancer research programs         Reed was joined by Cindy Schwartz  MD  director of pediatric hematology oncology at Hasbro Children s Hospital who stated   Hasbro Children s Hospital provides care to almost all of the children in our community who are diagnosed with cancer   While we have made great strides in treating childhood cancer  there is still much more that can be done  Additional funding and a national research network will greatly assist us as we continue in our fight to treat childhood cancer and hopefully find a cure   We thank Senator Reed for his foresight to introduce this bill   His commitment and support will help us to bring research to new levels and ultimately help so many families in our region          Reed s legislation would encourage and expand support for pediatric cancer research by authorizing  20 million for the next five years for biomedical research programs at the National Cancer Institute   In addition  it would establish the Children s Cancer Research Network   a population based childhood cancer database to evaluate the incidence trends of childhood cancers and research into genetic causes of the disease   It would also establish a fellowship program to foster career development in clinical and translational research for pediatric oncologists early in their careers         Reed was also joined by local families whose children have battled pediatric cancer  including the family of Ben Haight of Warwick  Rhode Island  who sadly passed away from an aggressive form of childhood cancer in 2003         Ben s mother  Nancy Haight  stated   No parent wants to think that their child may be diagnosed with cancer   When I was told that our son  Ben  had a mass in his abdomen  I thought  it can t be cancer  he s only 4 years old    Unfortunately  2 days later  on February 14  1999  my worst fears were confirmed  he was diagnosed with Neuroblastoma  a very aggressive pediatric cancer   Ben fought so valiantly and with such spirit   It was inconceivable to us that a better treatment for this disease did not exist  and very little progress has been made since that day   Ben never let cancer interfere with living his life to the fullest  experiencing all the important things in a boy s life   Ben never complained   His courage and strength inspired us and many others   Though Ben ultimately lost his battle  we continue on  trying to bring attention to this problem   Our dream is that when our son  Nick  has children of his own  the diagnosis of cancer will no longer be as devastating as it is today   From the first time that we met with Senator Reed  he has been so supportive   His landmark legislation will go a long way in helping us to realize our dream   We cannot thank him enough for his support          The heart wrenching story of Ben Haight highlights the importance of this legislation   It is my hope that one day Ben s story  and thousands of other children like him  will be one of survival   stated Reed    I thank the Haights and all of the many families who have struggled with this devastating disease for their commitment to helping the thousands of children facing childhood cancer   Their efforts are heroic and have increased public awareness and helped boost efforts to hopefully one day find a cure         In addition to providing support for childhood cancer research  Reed s bill would also help provide support for families and patients coping with childhood cancer by establishing a comprehensive online public information system which would be available to provide information on pediatric cancer and support services         When a child is diagnosed with cancer  suddenly the whole family s life changes overnight   Often times  parents will have to quit their job to stay home and care for their child   This bill is designed to help more families find the best care possible and at the same time provide some comfort and needed research   concluded Reed
