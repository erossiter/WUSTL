Heating Aid                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON  DC    In an effort to help more Rhode Island families heat their homes this winter  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  along with Senator Susan Collins  R ME  and 35 of their Senate colleagues today urged President Bush to release  586 million in contingency funds for the Low Income Housing Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  as soon as he signs the 2008 Appropriation bill into law  Earlier this week Congress passed an appropriations spending bill containing a total of  2 57 billion for LIHEAP  including  586 million in emergency contingency funds  which are released to states at the Presidents discretion  In a bipartisan letter to President Bush today the senators wrote  We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder  Congress approved this money to help people deal with severe weather and rising energy prices  President Bush should quickly sign the bill into law and release the LIHEAP money  said Reed  Chairman of the Northeast Midwest Coalition  This additional funding will help provide heating assistance to thousands of Rhode Islanders and millions of American families in jeopardy of losing service  It is important we get this money out to people quickly before they have their heating shut off during the cold winter months  Despite the fact that energy prices have soared during his Administration  President Bush proposed cutting LIHEAP funds this year  His 2008 budget blueprint called for  1 782 billion for LIHEAP  However  Senators Reed  Collins and others fought for additional funding and succeed in including  2 57 billion for the program   788 million more than the Presidents proposal and an increase of over  406 million over the 2007 spending level  Last year  nearly 30 000 Rhode Island households relied on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes and to pay delinquent utilities bills to re establish service  In 2008  Rhode Island is expected to receive at least  13 5 million dollars in LIHEAP block grant funding  plus additional money from the contingency fund  Rising energy costs are making it more difficult for families and seniors to stretch their household budgets  Releasing this contingency funding now would go a long way towards helping ensure that more Rhode Islanders are not forced to choose between keeping the heat on and buying groceries or filling their prescriptions  said Reed  The text of the letter follows   December 21  2007  The President The White House Washington  D C  20500  Dear Mr  President   The Consolidated Appropriations bill for FY2008 included  2 57 billion in funding for the Low Income Housing and Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   including  586 million in contingency funds to be released at your discretion  We are writing to urge you to release the LIHEAP funds immediately  The high energy prices facing consumers and the severe weather of the past few weeks warrant this release    This winter  the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimates that households can expect to pay between 10 to 22 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2006 2007 winter  and many of these families are carrying energy debt from previous years  As such  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden on families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens to ensure their health and safety through the cold winter months   Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  Home heating prices are projected by the EIA to reach almost  1 000 this year for the typical family  an increase of almost 80 percent higher than the average cost of home heating during the winter of 2001 02  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million   LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances    We request that your Administration release the  586 million in FY2008 LIHEAP contingency funds that were recently approved by Congress to help low income seniors and families with their home energy expenses during a winter that has already seen a significant share of severe winter weather and cold conditions and promises only to get colder    Sincerely   Jack
