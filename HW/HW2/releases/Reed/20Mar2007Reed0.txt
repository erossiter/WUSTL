working families afford the rising cost of a college education and simplify the process of applying for financial aid  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today introduced the Accessing College through Comprehensive Early Outreach and State Partnerships  ACCESS  Act and the Financial Aid Form Simplification and Access  FAFSA  Act   Both bills are cosponsored by Senators Susan M  Collins  R ME   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Patty Murray  D WA   and Bernie Sanders  I VT         The ACCESS Act would authorize  500 million in federal grant funding to spur states to provide more students with need based financial aid   Senator Reed s FAFSA Act would make it easier for more students to qualify for financial assistance and simplify the application process   FAFSA is a form that must be filled out in order for students to get federal financial assistance such as grants  loans  and work study jobs           These bipartisan bills will help put college within reach for more deserving students   said Reed  a member of the Committee on Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP     With college tuitions skyrocketing over the last decade  we must take important steps to lower financial barriers  eliminate student debt  and help more families prepare to bear the cost of college tuition         The ACCESS Act builds on the success of the Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership  LEAP  program by forging a new federal incentive for states to form partnerships with businesses  colleges  and non profit organizations to provide low income students with increased need based grant aid  early information and assurance of aid eligibility  beginning in middle school   and early intervention  mentoring  and outreach services   Research has shown that college access programs that combine these elements are successful in making the dream of higher education a reality   Students participating in such programs are more financially and academically prepared  and thus  more likely to enroll in college and persist to degree completion           Since 1972  the federal state partnership embodied by LEAP  with modest federal support  has helped leverage state grant aid to low and moderate income students   Without this important federal incentive  many states would never have established need based financial aid programs  and many states would not continue to maintain such programs   noted Reed    Last year  states matched approximately  65 million in federal LEAP funds with over  840 million in supplemental need based aid   In Rhode Island  federal investment of approximately  350 000 in LEAP funds spurred the state to expend over  13 million in need based aid             With an estimated 12 000 Rhode Island students graduating high school this year  the FAFSA Act will simplify the financial aid process for low income students by raising the Automatic Zero Expected Family Contribution threshold to  30 000 and aligning its eligibility with the standards for other federal means tested programs  such as school lunch  SSI  Food Stamps    The bill calls for the creation of a short  paper Free Application for Federal Student Aid  EZ FAFSA  for low income students  as well as a tailored web based application form to ensure that all students and their parents answer only the questions needed to determine financial aid eligibility in the state in which they reside   Students who do not have web access will be able to use a free tele file system for filing by phone           Applying for college can be a stressful and daunting task   We should make the process of applying for financial aid as simple and streamlined as possible   said Reed    The FAFSA Act will take some of the guess work out of the process and give more students the opportunity to complete financial applications earlier and receive early estimates of aid eligibility           Reed s FAFSA Act would also create a pilot program to test an early application system under which participating students would complete a FAFSA and receive an aid estimate in their junior year of high school  subject only to a later short update of information in the student s senior year   The pilot program directs the Secretary of Education study the feasibility  benefits  and adverse effects of utilizing information from the IRS in order to simplify the financial aid process  including pre populating the electronic FAFSA and implementing a data match           In 2008 we will see the largest number of students in our history graduating from high school  We have to be ready for them  not just in terms of preparing them academically  but ready to provide the financial aid they will need to go off to college  Over the last several years the Bush Administration has shortchanged Pell grants and other programs to help low  and middle income students afford college   We ve got to do better   Our future depends on it   concluded Reed        Both bills are supported by a range of higher education and student groups  including the American Association of Community Colleges  the American Council on Education  the Association of American Universities  the Association of Jesuit Colleges and Universities  the Center for Law and Social Policy  the National Association of College Admission Counseling  the National Association of Independent Colleges and Universities  the National Association of State Student Grant and Aid Programs  the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators  the United States Student Association  and the College Parents of America
