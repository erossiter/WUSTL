                                                                                                                                          PROVIDENCE  RI  In an effort to help support victims of domestic violence who have left their abusers  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today joined with Karen Allen  Executive Director of Sojourner House  and Judith Earle  President of the Board of Directors for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence  to announce a  255 000 federal grant for Sojourner House to expand its transitional housing program  Sojourner House offers 24 hour assistance to victims of domestic violence  providing emergency support and crisis intervention  shelter  counseling  and legal advocacy  The group will use this Transitional Housing Assistance Grant to offer aid to victims of domestic violence  stalking  and sexual assault who are homeless  or in need of transitional housing  short term housing assistance  and related support services  For over thirty years  Sojourner House has been making a difference and providing shelter to victims of domestic violence  I commend their dedicated staff and volunteers for helping thousands of women and families throughout Rhode Island  said Reed  a member of the Appropriations subcommittee which oversees federal funding for the Department of Justice s Office on Violence Against Women programs  When victims of domestic violence summon the courage to leave their abuser  it is imperative that they have a safe place to go where they can get the resources and support they need to rebuild their lives  This federal investment will allow Sojourner House to expand its transitional housing program to help victims  many of whom are women and children  move beyond emergency shelter and find permanent housing  Sojourner House is fortunate to be able to bridge the gap between shelter and permanent housing for mothers and their children who are victims of domestic violence  Without transitional housing  many families would be homeless or forced to return to their abuser because they have no other option  This funding allows us the time to meet the needs of the families and assist in their stabilization  said Karen Allen  Executive Director of Sojourner House  According to a report issued this year by the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence  RICADV   Rhode Island s domestic violence crisis hotlines received 19 133 calls for crisis intervention  support  and referrals in 2006  During this time  the six member agencies of RICADV provided community services for 9 481 unduplicated victims of domestic violence  Last year  611 women and children sought relief from abuse at one of Rhode Island s six domestic violence emergency shelters  These women and children remained sheltered for a cumulative total of 22 417 nights  Sojourner House provides victims of domestic violence with more than just a safe place  they provide them with hope and the resources they ll need to transition from emergency shelters to self sufficiency  said Reed  a key cosponsor of the Violence Against Women Act reauthorization bill  which was signed into law last year  This federal grant will help domestic violence victims who are in Sojourner s transitional housing program deal with critical necessities  such as rent and utility payments  as they get back on their feet  We are thrilled that Sojourner House was been awarded this money to expand their transitional housing program  said Judith Earle  President of the Board of Directors for the Rhode Island Coalition Against Domestic Violence  In times of funding cuts and tighter budgets  it s great that the need for this work has been recognized on a federal level  Sojourner House offers a comprehensive network of support that helps victims of domestic violence rebuild their lives  piece by piece  The center provides emergency support and crisis intervention  shelter  counseling  and legal advocacy  and addresses any other special needs a victim might have  Additionally  the agency supports the Rhode Island community in domestic violence prevention by offering a variety of educational and awareness programs  Since 1976  Sojourner House has served over 50 000 individuals  In 2006  RICADV noted that on any given day in Rhode Island  nearly 50 people call a domestic violence hotline  60 women and children spend the night in a domestic violence shelter  and 30 people seek community based domestic violence services  RICADVs 2006 annual report states that 4 699 victims of domestic violence received individualized advocacy services  321 victims attended support groups  and 189 children received specialized children s services  The Coalition also reported that from 1992 to 2006  at least 93 Rhode Islanders died as a result of domestic violence
