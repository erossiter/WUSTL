                                                                                              October 12  2005     Press Release        Reed Remarks from Iraq                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Senator Jack Reed  D RI   a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  stated     It appears that Saturday   s constitutional referendum will be successful and the constitution will be approved   But most observers  and the military commanders on the ground  agree that the referendum will not end the violence and that it may increase   It is also possible that the referendum may further alienate the Sunni community        Having a constitution is not the same as having a stable government that has the capability and the resources to effectively manage the country   s security  health  economic  industrial and education needs   While the hope is that the December 15th election will establish a government that can begin to address those needs  the unfortunate reality is that Iraq and the U S  military will face months of continued violence until then
