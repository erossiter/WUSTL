                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON  DC     In an effort to provide more children with improved access to early education  the U S  Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee today voted to reauthorize the Head Start program for another 5 years        The Head Start program  administered by the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   provides comprehensive early childhood development services to low income children up to age five  to help them prepare for school   In Rhode Island  Head Start provides around 3000 children with essential education  social  and health services        Senator Reed  a member of the Senate HELP Committee  supported S  556  the Head Start for School Readiness Act  which passed the Committee unanimously  In addition to several provisions authored by Reed  the legislation would authorize significant increases in funding for Head Start over the next five years  Head Start received  6 79 billion in federal funding last year  and the Bush Administration is again seeking this level of funding for this year  The program has been cut by 11 percent since 2002         Reed stated   Head Start is a vital initiative for children in Rhode Island and nationwide  Since its inception  it has helped over 15 million children prepare for a successful education  I am pleased that the HELP Committee has passed this important legislation to provide the Head Start program with the federal funding and improvements it needs to keep helping children         During development of the legislation  Reed authored a provision to increase the income eligibility requirements to allow more children to qualify for the program  Currently  Head Start s income thresholds are lower than most other mean tested federal programs  This change will allow low income working families and children who may be just above the poverty line to participate in the program         The success of the Head Start program in shaping the lives of young people has been demonstrated time and time again  It is important that we serve as many children and families in need of these important services as possible   stated Reed   This new legislation will give more working parents a hand up and get their kids on the right track          Reed also led efforts to ensure that parents are able to participate more fully in the Head Start program through the Parent Policy Council  This council  made up of a majority of parents  would become a decision making authority within the governing structure of Head Start         Strong parent involvement in their children s early education and development has been a key tenet of the Head Start program since its inception  and is one of the primary reasons for the program s continuing success  The Parent Policy Council will afford parents an even greater opportunity to participate and help shape their child s early educational development   Reed stated         Reed also worked to ensure that the Head Start Reauthorization bill does not allow employers to discriminate based on religion  It also included his provisions to ensure enhanced coordination and partnerships between grantees and school and public libraries  to excite children about the world of books  assist in literacy training for Head Start teachers  and support parents and other caregivers in literacy efforts  and would ensure wider Head Start community participation on the State Advisory Council           The Head Start community is deeply appreciative of Senator Reed s initiative to increase our eligibility guidelines to 130  of poverty  allowing the inclusion of Rhode Island children from very low income working families   stated Rhode Island Head Start Association Director  Lynda Dickinson   We are extremely proud that Senator Reed has provided the leadership that will ensure the continued participation of low income parents in the governance of Head Start   He has always been  and remains  a true champion of low income children and their families          Head Start has been a real success story in Rhode Island  I am pleased to support this program and make it stronger   I will continue to press for increased funding for Head Start so that more children and families have the necessary educational and developmental skills and tools they need and deserve  as well as access to health  social  and nutritional services to help them succeed   concluded Reed        The Head Start program is administered by the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   Federal Head Start funds are provided directly to local grantees  and are locally designed and administered by a network of over 1 600 public and private nonprofit and for profit agencies         In FY2005  Head Start funded enrollment for 906 993 children  The program was created in 1965 and was last reauthorized in 1998
