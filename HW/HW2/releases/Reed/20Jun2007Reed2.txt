                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON  DC  In an effort to boost college access and affordability for students and their families  the U S  Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions  HELP  Committee today passed two important higher education bills  The legislation includes several key provisions authored by U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  to increase student financial aid and help simplify the application process  and to improve teacher preparation programs so that early childhood educators have the skills and tools to be effective in the classroom   These bipartisan initiatives will help put college within reach for more deserving students  said Reed  a senior member of the HELP Committee  With college tuitions skyrocketing over the last decade  we must take meaningful steps to reduce financial barriers to college access  assist students and their families in paying down their student loans  and help more families prepare to bear the cost of college tuition   Included in the legislation are several provisions from Reeds Financial Aid Form Simplification and Access  FAFSA  Act  S  939  to make it easier for more students to qualify for student financial aid and streamline the application process  Every family must fill out the FAFSA form to get federal financial assistance such as grants  loans  and work study jobs   With an estimated 12 000 Rhode Island students graduating high school this year  Reeds provision will simplify the financial aid process for low income students by raising the Automatic Zero Expected Family Contribution threshold to  30 000 and aligning its eligibility with the standards for other federal means tested programs  such as school lunch  SSI  Food Stamps   This will ensure that all students from families with incomes of  30 000 or less will receive at least a maximum Pell Grant  Currently  only families making  20 000 or less automatically qualify for such grants  The legislation would also raises the maximum Pell Grant to  5 100 from its present level of  4 310  providing an extra  10 million in federal financial aid to Rhode Island students per year   Reeds provision will also help simplify the process of applying for financial aid by creating a short  paper Free Application for Federal Student Aid  EZ FAFSA  for low income students  phasing out the complex  one size fits all long form of 7 pages and over 80 questions  It will also develop a tailored web based application form to ensure that all students and their parents answer only the questions needed to determine financial aid eligibility in the state in which they reside  Students who do not have web access will be able to use a free tele file system for filing by phone   Reed also authored a key measure to create a pilot program to test an early application system under which students would complete a FAFSA and receive an aid estimate or determination in their junior year of high school   Applying for college can be a stressful and daunting task  We should make the process of applying for financial aid as simple and streamlined as possible  said Reed  This legislation will take some of the guess work out of the process and give more students the opportunity to complete financial applications earlier and receive early assurances of aid eligibility   The HELP Committee also approved a Reed initiative from the FAFSA Act to increase the Income Protection Allowance  IPA  and reduce the penalty faced by students when they work in order to pay for college  Currently  a dependent students aid is reduced for every dollar they earn in excess of  3 000  The bill doubles the IPA for dependent students from  3 000 to  6 000 over four years and increases the IPA for independent students  including adult learners  veterans  and those students in foster care  by 50 percent over four years   Senator Reed said  We should be rewarding work  not penalizing it  These increases will help working families and students better afford a college education by stemming the perverse income protection limits that punish those students and parents who work one  two  or more jobs to afford college   The legislation also includes key provisions from Reeds Accessing College through Comprehensive Early Outreach and State Partnerships  ACCESS  Act  S  938  to help forge a new federal incentive for states to form partnerships with businesses  colleges  and non profit organizations to provide low income students with increased need based grant aid  early information and assurance of aid eligibility  beginning in 7th grade   and early intervention  mentoring  and outreach services  Research has shown that college access programs that combine these elements are successful in making the dream of higher education a reality  Students participating in such programs are more financially and academically prepared  and thus  more likely to enroll in college and persist to degree completion   The legislation also includes Reeds Librarian Incentive to Boost Recruitment and Retention in Areas of Need  LIBRARIAN  Act  S  1121  to help recruit students to go into the field of library sciences by canceling Perkins student loans for full time librarians with a masters degree in library science  Librarians working full time in low income areas would qualify for up to 100 percent Perkins student loan forgiveness depending on their number of years of experience   Reed also authored a provision to expand Perkins loan forgiveness for members of the Armed Forces from 50 to 100 percent   Our brave men and women in uniform make huge sacrifices for our nation  stated Reed  It is the least we can do to provide them with the opportunity to further their education  This legislation will help to recognize the service of our military members and their families and help invest in their future   Finally  the legislation includes provisions from Reeds Preparing  Recruiting  and Retaining Education Professionals  PRREP  Act to strengthen the Teacher Quality Enhancement Grants program to provide prospective and new teachers  including early childhood educators  with effective teaching skills  high quality  sustained mentoring and support  and enhanced opportunities for professional development   Improving teacher quality is the single most important measure we can take to increase student achievement  Highly effective teachers are essential to providing students with a strong  quality education  said Reed  We must provide federal support to ensure that teachers not only have the credentials to be considered a highly qualified teacher under the No Child Left Behind Act  but also the skills and training to be truly effective in the classroom    end
