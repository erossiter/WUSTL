United States                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON     The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has announced that the President has granted Liberians permission to remain in the United States for one more year under Temporary Protected Status  TPS        Each year since 1992  these Liberians have relied on a reprieve from the White House extending their legal right to remain in the United States   This year their status was to expire on October 1  2005   Earlier this month Senator Jack Reed  D RI  wrote President Bush urging him to extend the current TPS designation       A majority of the Liberians living in the United States entered the country in 1989 after fleeing Liberia when civil war broke out       Reed  who has sponsored a bill to grant the Liberians permanent residency stated     While I am extremely pleased that the President has extended their ability to remain in the US  it is frustrating that these Liberian families continue to live in limbo when they could easily be given the opportunity to live here permanently   The Liberian community has been living  working  and paying taxes  in the United States     some for a decade or more     and has been ineligible for the benefits afforded to other tax payers   They are quality members of our communities  are homeowners  property owners and business owners   Many are professionals who have started families and have children who are American citizens   I urge the President to work with Congress to approve permanent residency for these Liberians          Following is the notice from the U S  Citizenship and Immigration Services  Department of Homeland Security         Extension of the Designation of Liberia for Temporary Protected Status      SUMMARY  The designation of Liberia for Temporary Protected Status  TPS  will expire on October 1  2005  This Notice extends the designation of Liberia for 12 months  until October 1  2006  and sets forth procedures necessary for nationals of Liberia and aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia with TPS to re register and to apply for an extension of their employment authorization documents  EADs  for the additional 12 month period  Re registration is limited to persons who registered under the current designation  which was announced on August 25  2004   Certain nationals of Liberia  or aliens having no nationality who last habitually resided in Liberia  who previously have not applied for TPS under the current designation may be eligible to apply under the late initial registration provisions       DATES  The extension of TPS for Liberia is effective October 1  2005  and will remain in effect until October 1  2006  The 60 day re  registration period begins August 16  2005 and will remain in effect until October 17  2005       FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT  Colleen Cook  Residence and Status Services  Office of Programs and Regulations Development  U S    Citizenship and Immigration Services  Department of Homeland Security  111 Massachusetts Avenue  NW   3rd Floor  Washington  DC 20529  telephone  202  514 4754         In 1991  President George Bush s Attorney General  William Barr  granted Temporary Protected Status  TPS  to these Liberians  providing temporary relief from deportation while the conflict prevented their safe return home   For the next eleven years  the Attorney General annually renewed this TPS status   The Homeland Security Act of 2002 shifted the functions of the Immigration and Naturalization Service to the DHS  which extended the TPS another year to October 1  2004       To end this yearly cycle of reprieves  Reed has introduced the Liberian Refugee Immigration Fairness Act  S  656  a bill to grant permanent residency to Liberians        Very troubling to many Liberian parents is that if they are deported they will be forced to decide whether to leave their US born children in the safety and comfort of the United States or bring them with them to the dangers of Liberia       Few groups who have received protected status have remained in this immigration limbo longer than the Liberians   In the time since the Liberians left their homeland because of a bloody civil war  Congress has passed a law allowing 4 996 Poles  387 Ugandans  565 Afghanis and 1 180 Ethiopians to adjust their status   The 102nd Congress passed a law to change the status of over 50 000 Chinese nationals who had been granted DED after the Tiananmen Square massacre   And when Congress passed legislation known as NACARA  150 000 Nicaraguans  5 000 Cubans  200 000 El Salvadorans and 50 000 Guatemalans also became eligible to change their status
