in Interior Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                WASHINGTON     The United States Congress has given final approval to several requests by Senator Jack Reed  D RI  for funding of environmental preservation projects in Rhode Island   The  4 175 million in funding  part of the Fiscal Year  FY  2006 Interior Appropriations Conference Report  provides money for land acquisition  drinking water and storm water infrastructure  and conservation and preservation projects       Reed stated   This funding helps preserve the many natural resources and valued wildlife refuges in Rhode Island and will contribute to cleaner waterways and drinking water throughout the state   We need to protect and maintain our environment so generations of future Rhode Islanders can enjoy the scenic state we have today         The President is expected to sign the bill shortly after receiving it from Congress       The projects include       East Providence Waterfront Storm Water Management Analysis    250 000      The bill provides  250 000 for the City of East Providence to analyze and develop an innovative storm water management plan for its newly revitalized waterfront   East Providence has commenced a major revival of more than 300 acres of its waterfront that includes the cleanup of contaminated industrial sites and the development of residential  retail  and commercial facilities   Redevelopment of these vacant  polluted coastal properties has been hindered by the inability to efficiently and effectively address storm water management on a project by project basis         The federal funding will allow the city to conduct an engineering analysis that will look at innovative storm water management approaches on a district wide basis       Reed has helped East Providence secure  5 million in Section 108 Loans and Brownfields Economic Development Initiative  BEDI  Grants for the redevelopment of the waterfront site       Town of Cumberland Water Infrastructure   1 000 000      Reed worked with Representative Patrick Kennedy  D RI  to ensure the bill includes  1 000 000 for the Cumberland Water Department to upgrade and improve the town   s water supply infrastructure   The town   s water supply is produced at the Sneech Pond water treatment plant and two municipal well fields   Additional water is purchased wholesale from the neighboring Pawtucket Water Supply Board  PWSB          The Water Department is facing increased challenges transmitting more water from the PWSB connection point to the growing and developing northern areas of the town   Also  Cumberland   s treatment process for Total Organic Carbon  TOC  removal was below standards last year         Cumberland will use the federal funding to improve the TOC testing and removal process and to bring the Abbott Run well field to full service  which would result in the availability of 300 000 gallons per day   The town will also use the funds to loop dead end water mains and clean and line a 10 inch transmission line laid in the 1930s        The Water Department currently provides water to approximately 22 000 residential  commercial  and industrial properties through 7 600 service connections       Town of North Smithfield Water Infrastructure   200 000      The bill provides  200 000 for the Town of North Smithfield to extend municipal water from the City of Woonsocket to the Waterford neighborhood in North Smithfield   Approximately 80 homes in Waterford have been notified by their current water source  the Town of Blackstone  Massachusetts  that they must find an alternate source of drinking water   Blackstone has recently experienced numerous water shortages due to rapid growth        Deerfield Commons  an 80 unit assisted living residence also located in the Waterford is served by wells and does not have an adequate supply of water for fire suppression   Elevated levels of arsenic have also been detected in the wells serving the facility and the Rhode Island Department of Health has indicated that it probably does not meet the 2006 drinking water standards for arsenic       The federal funds would support the installation of 3 100 feet of 10    water lines from a water tank on Rhodes Avenue in Woonsocket to Waterford        Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex  Land Acquisition    525 000      The bill includes  525 000 to help the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex to purchase two high priority properties adjacent to the John H  Chafee and Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuges   The land contains a variety of important habitats including barrier beaches important to the threatened piping plover  coastal wetlands  shoreline  upland forest  and forest wetlands       The properties to be purchased include the Stone Property at the Trustom Pond National Wildlife Refuge and the Howland II Project at the John H  Chafee National Wildlife Refuge       In FY 04  Reed secured  1 million for the Rhode Island National Wildlife Refuge Complex   Last year he secured  500 000 for the Complex         For more information

      500 000       The bill provides  800 000 in partnership funds and  500 000 in construction funds for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor   s activities to preserve and revitalize this nationally significant region        The Blackstone Heritage Corridor recognizes the national and historical significance of the Blackstone region as the birthplace of the American Industrial Revolution   Spanning two states and encompassing two communities and a half million people  the partnership between the National Park Service  the States of Rhode Island and Massachusetts and several local communities has been a national model for revitalization projects        The Corridor   s planned construction projects include river restoration  historic preservation  and educational programming       In FY 04 Reed secured  1 865 million for the Blackstone River Valley National Heritage Corridor   Last year he secured  1 65 million for the Corridor          For more

the 66 acre Bugnet property in West Greenwich   The property features extraordinary biodiversity and natural resource as well as a sustainable timber operation  which has been a Rhode Island certified American Tree Farm since 1970 and has continually demonstrated a long term commitment to active forest management        Protecting this land will enhance public use and enjoyment of the adjacent lands which host cycling  birding  hiking and hunting as well as a public drinking water supply
