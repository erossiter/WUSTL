flooding and protect the state s coastline  waterways  and estuaries  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today announced that the U S  Army Corps of Engineers will direct nearly  2 million in federal funding for projects throughout the state        The Corps annual operating plan  which it released today  contains  1 963 000 for initiatives throughout the Narragansett Bay watershed  including projects in Providence and South County   This funding is provided through the continuing resolution that Congress passed last month that Senator Reed supported         I am pleased to have secured this important funding for Rhode Island s coastline and waterways   said Reed  a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee    Rhode Island s rivers and waterways are vital to our economy and have a significant impact on our state s culture   I will continue to work to secure federal funding to protect these resources         The plan also contains funding to upgrade and repair the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier which would protect Providence and the surrounding coastal area in the event of a hurricane          Upgrades to the Fox Point barrier are long overdue   stated Reed   This barrier protects thousands of people and billions of dollars in property in and around Providence   By investing in this vital infrastructure now  we can potentially help save lives and prevent millions of dollars in damage to people s homes   This is a wise use of taxpayers  money and will prevent costly reconstruction          A list of projects follows         Fox Point Hurricane Barrier Upgrades and Repairs   1 100 000  Providence    In its fiscal year 2007 plan   1 1 million will be used to upgrade and repair the Fox Point Hurricane Barrier which stretches from Allens Avenue to India Point Park in Providence   In the event of a hurricane  this important barrier protects the city and surrounding coastal areas from storm surges from Narrgansett Bay and the Providence River basin   The barrier is in need of essential maintenance to its electro mechanical control system   Recent studies by the City of Providence and the Corps have shown that the barrier s 40 year old system consisting of 35 foot high gates  dykes  and electrically driven pumps  are in disrepair         Last year  Reed authored key provisions to a supplemental appropriations bill to include over  1 1 million for upgrades to the structure         For more information contact  Karen Southern  Office of Mayor Cicilline   401  421 2489      Narrow River Aquatic Ecosystem Restoration Project   165 000  Narragansett South Kingstown   The U S  Army Corps of Engineers will receive  165 000 in federal funding to continue a feasibility study of a project to restore estuarine habitats along the Narrow River in Narragansett and South Kingstown   The Corps of Engineers has prepared a Preliminary Restoration Plan to reduce tidal restriction between Narrow River and Rhode Island Sound         Narrow River  also known as Pettaquamscutt River  is located near the entrance to the West Passage of Narragansett Bay   Narrow River is a constricted and poorly flushed estuary   Shoaling in the lower Narrow River and high nutrient concentrations may be contributing to a decline in eelgrass and shellfish habitat   Eelgrass beds and other submerged aquatic vegetation provide valuable nesting  spawning  nursery  cover  and foraging habitat for aquatic and semi aquatic animals         The river provides important estuarine and freshwater habitats that contribute to the productivity of Narragansett Bay and Rhode Island Sound   The degradation of these habitats adversely affects Rhode Island coastal ecosystems   The feasibility study will investigate alternatives to restore eelgrass  shellfish  waterfowl  and finfish habitats  and salt marshes in the Narrow River          Reed has secured a total of  300 000 for the study         For more information contact  Grover Fugate  Coastal Resources Management Council   401  783 7112     Charlestown Breachway navigation study   1 000  Charlestown   The Corps will receive funding to complete a navigation project design for the Charlestown Breachway and Inlet   There is growing concern for navigation safety through the breachway  which connects Ninigret Pond to Block Island Sound   The Army Corps of Engineers is considering a project to remove large boulders on the ocean side of the breachway as well as some dredging of the natural channel farther inland   The Corps will already be dredging in Ninigret Pond for habitat purposes under the South Coast Habitat Restoration Project  minimizing the cost of the project        Reed has secured  295 000 for the project since 2003        For more information contact  Grover Fugate  Coastal Resources Management Council   401  783 7112     Ninigret and Cross Mills Ponds Habitat Restoration   650 000  Charlestown    Ninigret Pond is the largest saltwater pond in Rhode Island providing critical habitat for wildlife  The Corps will use  650 000 to complete restoration of eelgrass and other coastal pond habitat to the flood tidal shoals        The Rhode Island Coastal Resources Management Council  CRMC  and the Corps have been working cooperatively on this project for several years   Reed had championed restoration of Ninigret Pond since 2000          For more information contact

Pond which currently has a high level of pollution and no eelgrass        The restoration project when completed will remove more than 75 000 cubic yards of sand to improve water quality in the pond   Sand from the projected will be pumped onto Misquamicut Beach which will help address coastal erosion along the shore   The funding will be used to complete final designs for this important restoration project        For more information contact  Grover Fugate  Coastal Resources Management Council   401  783 7112
