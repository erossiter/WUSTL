                                                                                              September 29  2005     Press Release        Reed Introduces Bill to Help Communities Prevent and End Homelessness                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON    Originally created as a program to serve as an emergency federal response to the crisis of homelessness  the McKinney Vento Act instead has become a safety net for low income households who are inadequately served by mainstream programs such as Section 8 and Medicaid       To reverse this trend U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  has introduced legislation to provide  1 6 billion for homelessness assistance grant programs to prevent and end homelessness       United States Senator Jack Reed  D RI  stated     A relatively small number of long term chronically homeless persons continue to utilize a disproportionate number of the beds in our nation   s shelters   I believe that limited federal dollars need to be focused on preventing and ending homelessness  not maintaining it          Reed   s bill  the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act  amends the housing titles of the McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 to realign the incentives behind the Department of Housing and Urban Development s  HUD  homelessness assistance programs  simplify and consolidate three competitive HUD homelessness assistance programs into one program and allow more funding to flow to communities that can demonstrate a commitment to accomplishing the goals of preventing and ending homelessness         It would also increase current levels of funding for homelessness assistance grant programs by  575 million and would allocate funding to be used for the creation of permanent housing for the disabled  as well as homelessness prevention       Reed stated     We should devote significant energy and resources to ending homelessness in the United States   A safe and decent home should not just be the American dream and the American promise   It should be the American commitment          The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act would           Provide Funding for Preventing Homelessness  It would allow communities to use up to 5  of their grant funding on programs prevent homelessness            Provide Incentives for Ending Homelessness           Create National Funding Priority for Permanent Housing  It would require HUD to use 30  of total funds available nationally under this title for permanent housing development activities for disabled homeless persons or families with a disabled adult   In addition  funds in addition to the 30  can be used for permanent housing for homeless people without disabilities            Provide Communities with Bonus for Production of Permanent Housing Stock  It would allow for a bonus for new project based permanent housing units for chronically homeless individuals or families  or for non disabled families who are homeless          Preserve Funding for Effective Permanent Housing Programs for Disabled Persons  It would allow HUD to renew permanent housing projects through a noncompetitive process  as long as the projects are in compliance with the rules and are still needed in their communities   Successful experience with this approach for Shelter Plus Care renewals shows that this solves the problem of investor confidence and prevents people from being at risk of losing their housing           Consolidate Competitive Grant Programs  By simplifying the application process  the bill would reduce the administrative burden on communities caused by different program requirements   It would allow funding to be used for an array of eligible activities    maximizing flexibility  creativity  and local decision making            Require Outcome based Performance Evaluations  It would require local planning boards to conduct outcome based evaluations of their own performance in ending and preventing homelessness  as well as the performance of project sponsors awarded funds under this title           Encourage Identification of Policies and Practices Impeding the Ending and Preventing of Homelessness  It would requires community planning boards to review relevant public policies and practices  including those related to discharge planning and service termination from publicly supported facilities and systems of care  as well as zoning ordinances  that may result in imminent  repeated  or prolonged homelessness           Promote Access to Mainstream Resources for Supportive Services  It would encourage communities to connect persons who are homeless to mainstream resources  such as food stamps and Medicaid  so that HUD can use more of its funds for housing   Three years after bill enactment  allowable supportive services would be restricted to case management  life skills training  outreach  housing counseling  and others services determined by the Secretary of HUD to be directly relevant to helping homeless persons to access and maintain housing            Maximize Local and State Resources through Community Planning and Collaboration  It would integrate decision making regarding funding for shelters and prevention activities into a collaborative and inclusive community planning process to ensure that a community effectively addresses the full Continuum of Care     from prevention and shelter to permanent housing and access to mainstream supportive services            Increase Authorization for Appropriation   1 6 billion for fiscal year 2006  and such sums as necessary for years 2007  2008  2009 and 2010            Require Technical Assistance  HUD would have to provide technical assistance to potential and actual applicants to improve their capacity to engage in effective planning and implementation processes that reduce and prevent homelessness           Create Uniform Match Requirements  Cash match of 25  for all activities except for renewals of permanent housing operating costs in some circumstances            Require Timely Award and Use of Funds  It would require HUD  grantees and project sponsors to award  obligate  and utilize funds within certain time periods           Administrative Funds  It would allow 6  of awarded funds to be used by the entity managing the homeless system at the local level to carry out grant administration  management information  and monitoring activities  as well as preparation of financial and performance reports   An additional 5  would be available to project sponsors providing direct services for administrative costs
