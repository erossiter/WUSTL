Accounting and Collection Process for Oil and Natural Gas Produced from Federal and Indian Leases

colleagues in calling on the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to review and report on the adequacy of the royalty accounting and collection process for oil and natural gas produced from federal and Indian leases         The Minerals Management Service  MMS   an agency within the U S  Department of Interior  DOI   is responsible for the management of the program  Recent press reports have alleged that the MMS has under collected on these leases  costing American taxpayers  700 million  In a separate letter  Reed called on the U S  Department of Interior  DOI  to take steps to correct any under collection of royalties from oil and natural gas on federal and Indian lands       Reed stated     In light of skyrocketing energy prices this winter  in addition to a soaring budget deficit  it is irresponsible for the federal government to not fully collect royalties on federal and Indian oil and natural gas leases   While rising energy prices threaten to financially overwhelm low income families and seniors this winter  forcing them to choose between heating their homes and eating  it seems likely that uncollected revenues were not passed on to consumers  and instead increased the profit margins of the oil and gas industry          Families and seniors are expected to spend 32 percent more for heating oil  48 percent more for natural gas and 30 percent more for propane this year        Text of the letter to GAO follows      The Honorable David M  Walker      Comptroller General      U S  Government Accountability Office      441 G Street  N W       Washington  D C   20548      Dear Mr  Walker       The purpose of this letter is to request that the GAO undertake a review and report on the adequacy of the royalty accounting and collection process for oil and natural gas produced from Federal and Indian leases   As you know  the Minerals Management Service  MMS   an agency within the Department of the Interior  is responsible for the administration of the royalty management program   In this time of rising oil and gas prices  the program has been the subject of criticism for alleged under collections resulting in the public not receiving fair value for its mineral resources   It is essential that the U S  Treasury  the States and the Tribes receive the amounts owed to them for production from Federal and Tribal leases        Specifically  we request that you respond to the following questions          1  At a time when prices for natural gas are increasing  why are royalty collections on federally owned natural gas not increasing at a commensurate rate       2  Has MMS reduced the number of auditor positions   If so  how many positions have been cut  Why       3  Has MMS reduced the number of audits that it undertakes   How many audits were initiated in 2005 as compared to each of the five preceding years       4  Does MMS have adequate resources to ensure that the royalties are properly collected on Federal and Indian leases       5  Have funding levels for State and Tribal cooperative agreements for auditing been reduced   If so  please provide information regarding the amount of the reductions   How has this affected the amount of production that can be audited by States and Tribes on an annual basis       6  Are the deepwater royalty relief provisions being implemented in accordance with law   Is MMS collecting royalties in deepwater when the price reaches the threshold requiring royalty payment   If not  why not       7  Has MMS implemented all recommendations in the Department of the Interior Inspector General   s March 2003 Report that concluded that    MMS    audit process was ineffective because it lacked accountability  did not cover all audit work  and was incomplete          8  What is the basis for withholding information about royalty payments by individual payors   What reported information is proprietary         9  What specific changes in the royalty collection process should MMS make to ensure that the U S  Treasury  the States  and the Tribes get fair value for oil and gas resources produced from Federal and Indian leases          We hope that you will give this request the highest priority and provide a response within thirty days   Thank you for your attention to this important matter         Sincerely     Text of letter to DOI follows      The Honorable Gale Norton      Secretary      U S  Department of the Interior      1849 C Street  NW      Washington  DC  20240        Dear Secretary Norton       We write in response to allegations in yesterday   s New York Times article  As Profits Soar  Companies Pay U S  Less for Gas Rights  which implies the Department of Interior has been grossly negligent in its duty to ensure Americans receive fair compensation for the use of their public lands for natural gas development         Specifically  a three month New York Times investigation found that even though energy costs have skyrocketed under the Bush Administration  the Department of Interior collected about the same amount of royalty payments from profit rich companies as they did five years ago   The Times estimates that just last year  the Administration   s lax enforcement and loophole laden regulations may have short changed American taxpayers by more than  700 million dollars         With natural gas costs busting American family budgets and harming our economy  it seems likely that these forgone revenues were not passed on to consumers  but rather  padded the profit margins of the oil and gas industry   Particularly at a time of soaring budget deficits  this situation is unacceptable        Yesterday   s report highlighted a series of steps the Interior Department can take to remedy this situation  such as reinstating the full audits that have been scaled back during the Bush Administration   a step that has been criticized by the Interior Department Inspector General   Another initiative would require enforcement of existing rules  such as those requiring companies to start paying royalties when market prices reach a    threshold    level   Given the billions of dollars of lost revenue at stake  we hope the Department will take immediate action to remedy this situation on behalf of the American taxpayer   We would be willing to work with the Department to enact supportive legislation such as requiring greater transparency of oil and gas industry revenues  or support funding for additional auditors       In addition  we are troubled by the suggestion that companies involved in the federal leasing program have made differing representations of average natural gas costs to the Securities Exchange Commission and Department of Interior   both of which are federal agencies   In order for Congress to carry out its own oversight responsibilities and probe the magnitude of these discrepancies  we respectfully request that you provide us with the average sale price of natural gas reported to the Department of Interior over the past five years  by each individual firm participating in the leasing program with revenues of over  500 million       We look forward to working with you on this matter  which is so crucial in ensuring a fair and transparent result for American taxpayers          Sincerely
