Complete the North Cape Lobster Restoration Program

with Governor Donald L  Carcieri  federal officials  and representatives from the lobster  fishing and oil shipping industries to celebrate the completion of the North Cape Lobster Restoration Program and to  V notch  the program   s last lobster   The event marked the culmination of more than six years of effort to restore Rhode Island s lobster population  which was significantly impacted by the 1996 North Cape oil spill       The 1996 North Cape oil spill occurred when the 340 foot North Cape oil barge ran aground off Moonstone Beach  after its tug caught fire during a severe winter storm  Over 828 000 gallons of home heating oil spilled into local waters  killing an estimated nine million lobsters  millions of surf clams  fish  birds  and other organisms  DEM and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  NOAA  scientists recommended that the notching and protection of female lobsters was necessary to eventually replace the estimated nine million lobsters killed by the oil spill       The North Cape Lobster Restoration Program began in 2000  and was completed in June of this year  The project manager  Ocean Technology Foundation  hired and trained observers and worked with over 150 fishermen in RI and MA to complete the project  The restoration involved cutting a V shaped notch in the tail of 1 248 million female lobsters and restocking them into RI and southeastern MA coastal waters  These female lobsters are now protected from harvest for an additional one to two years while the v notch is still visible  harvesting of V notched lobsters is prohibited by law  Allowing lobsters to live longer gives them more opportunity to reproduce  yielding increased numbers of offspring        I commend all the Rhode Islanders and federal agencies who pulled together to clean up our coastal environment and rebuild our state s lobster and shellfish populations after the North Cape oil spill   said Senator Reed   The North Cape settlement set a national precedent for restoring the environment after oil spills  Today we celebrate how far we have come in restoring our fisheries and we renew our commitment to preserving these natural resources for future generations         This partnership between Rhode Island s fishermen and marine biologists has been a tremendous success  It has helped to restore our lobster population  and it has ensured that this important piece of our economy will continue   Governor Carcieri said   Restoring the lobster population represents part of a larger effort to restore our coastal habitat  We have worked closely with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the U S  Fish   Wildlife Service to increase our shellfish population  protect sensitive wetlands  and allow piping plovers to flourish         This project was a tremendous success for the lobster resource and for those who depend on it for their livelihood   said Patricia Kurkul  administrator of NOAA s National Marine Fisheries Service Northeast Region   The cooperative effort between the state and federal government  K Sea Transportation  and the fishing industry is a terrific model for similar oil spill restoration activities        After extensive scientific assessment of oil spill damages  trustee agencies under the authority of the federal Oil Pollution Act reached a settlement with the responsible party  K Sea Transportation  in June 2000  The terms of the settlement required the responsible party to implement and manage the lobster restoration program and to pay to the trustee agencies         1 6 million for land acquisition adjacent to Rhode Island s coastal salt ponds        1 5 million for a multi species shellfish restoration project        3 million to purchase and protect loon nesting habitat        400 000 to purchase and protect eider nesting habitat        140 000 to manage and protect piping plover nesting habitat        160 000 to implement an anadromous fish restoration project        800 000 to oversee and monitor the lobster restoration project  The Trustees and the Responsible Party began restoration in 2000  Key accomplishments to date        Completed the v notching and protection of 1 248 million legal size female lobsters in Rhode Island Sound      Purchased a conservation easement and secured permanent protection for 60 acres of land adjacent to Ninigret Pond      Contributed to the acquisition and protection of 1 5 million acres of land in Maine to protect over 125 loon nesting pair and their habitat      Acquired and protected a 42 acre island off the coast of Maine to conserve over 600 nesting pair of eider      Constructed a fish ladder on Indian Lake in South Kingstown  opening up 220 acres of spawning habitat for migrating alewife      Increased the number of piping plover nesting pairs on Rhode Island s South County beaches by 60       Increased populations of oysters  bay scallops  and quahogs in numerous locations in Narragansett Bay and the coastal salt ponds    Today s celebration highlights an immensely successful program that restored fish and wildlife from Rhode Island to Maine   remarked Michael Thabault  assistant regional director of the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service s Region 5  Government  industry  private organizations and foundations  and hundreds of volunteers worked together to protect and improve natural resources destroyed by the North Cape oil spill         The completion of the North Cape Lobster Restoration Project is a perfect example of industry working together with state and federal agencies to accomplish a positive outcome for the resource   noted Lanny Dellinger  President of the Rhode Island Lobstermen s Association   The Rhode Island lobster industry is optimistic that this positive co management relationship will continue  including the process of determining future management decisions that are vital for the future of a sustainable fishery  The Rhode Island Lobstermen s Association has purchased v notching tools for its members to encourage the industry s continuation of this program  With the continued support of state and federal agencies working together with industry  we can leave this resource in a better condition for future generations to come
