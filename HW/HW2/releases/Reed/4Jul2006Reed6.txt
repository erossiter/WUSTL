                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              BRISTOL  RI     Today  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  delivered the Patriotic Speech at the 221st Bristol Fourth of July Patriotic Exercises      Text of Reed   s remarks follow     Mr  Reed  Today  Bristol commemorates and celebrates the birth of our freedom and the beginning of our nation  For 221 years  Bristoleans have gathered to remember the brave deeds that purchased our freedom and the brave deeds over two centuries that have sustained our freedom     Bristol is remarkable not only for the longevity of its observances unmatched by any other community in America  but also for the pride and profound patriotism of its celebration     This is a community that once a year becomes the heart of America and a symbol of the faith and the commitment that has allowed this nation to endure and prosper     Our freedom was won in battle and preserved through continued sacrifice  And  so it is fitting that we salute those who have served     We are in the presence of many who have served and who continue to serve     I am continually impressed with the young Americans who wear the uniform of our armed forces  Their fidelity to duty  their willingness to risk all for their country and their innate decency are inspirational     They are  in turn  inspired by generations of Americans who preceded them  The legacy of courage and service represented by so many here is one of the most powerful forces that support their efforts today      At its birth  America represented a new and breathtaking idea  A free people could organize itself based on Constitutional principles  not on ethnicity or traditional loyalty to a king or sovereign    In America  the people were sovereign      We understand today that the original outline of our Constitutional order did not embrace all the people of America  nor did it fully empower every American  But  the genius and the glory of our country is that succeeding generations have built upon the vision of the founding fathers to seek    a more perfect union       This process continues today  or  as Roger Williams might have said     the lively experiment    continues     Today  we are once again being tested as a nation and as a people    The agonizing moments of 9 11 demonstrated that we are in a worldwide struggle with ruthless adversaries and that we are vulnerable here as well as across the oceans     For me  there is one enduring image from 9 11    It stays with me    It is not the image of the burning towers or the broken Pentagon    Rather  it is an image contained in a news photo of one New York City firefighter climbing the stairs of the World Trade Center to an uncertain fate as scores of office workers filed past him down the stairs to safety    Like that firefighter  it is our moment and our duty to climb those stairs    It is our obligation to defend the nation and preserve our national principles    And  what upsets our adversaries is not just our power but also our principles    the notion that government is not ordained from on high but is the act of people coming together to chose their leaders  that the measure of a person is not gender or race or sectarian belief but an understanding that we are all children of God and we are all entitled to share in shaping the future    We are truly engaged in a battle of ideas  not simply a battle of military dimensions    And in such a battle  we cannot surrender our principles  Indeed  we must insist that we remain a nation of laws that also respects international norms    We must maintain our commitment to a democracy that respects individual rights while insisting upon individual responsibility  Our example  our deeds  rather than mere words  will inspire not only admiration throughout the world but imitation     At another moment of great challenge  President Lincoln struggled to preserve the nation and its noblest values    On one occasion  soldiers from an Ohio Regiment paid tribute to the President by an impromptu evening serenade    The President  moved by the warmth and sincerity of these soldiers  spoke to them    He asked them to rise up to a generation worthy of the sacrifice of so many and to dedicate themselves to the task of giving every American a    fair chance    in the race of life    Lincoln   s words speak to us today as we face daunting challenges    We too must rise up to a generation worthy of the sacrifice of so many    We too must strive to build a nation where everyone has a    fair chance    in the race of life and to help build a world of peace and hope    And  like every other generation of Americans  we will not shrink from this challenge     Today  we remember    We remember the great deeds that won our freedom  the wise deliberations that shaped our Constitution  the scores of battles across our land and across the globe that preserved this remarkable country      We remember parades of the past  pleasant summer days secure in the embrace of family and friends     We especially remember those who have served and sacrificed      As often as I can  I try to visit soldiers at Walter Reed Army Hospital in Washington    It is a humbling experience    As you see these young men and women overcome their injuries with a spirit of determination  you first ask yourself    What have we done to deserve such men and women    But then  you ask a more telling question    What must we do today and in the days ahead to deserve these patriots     As we remember  we must recommit ourselves to the great task of America    to build a just and decent society worthy of their great sacrifice     From this day  from Bristol  and these ceremonies  we renew our vow and pledge to defend our nation  to live up to its noblest principles and to make real the spirit and the promise of America in the days ahead     Thank you
