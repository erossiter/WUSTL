                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON  DC     Urging the Bush Administration to engage in the process of protecting our global environment  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  yesterday sent a letter to President George W  Bush calling on the Administration to increase the federal response to global climate change            Climate change is a real and serious problem that must be addressed   A year ago today  the Senate passed a resolution calling for mandatory action to    slow  stop  or reverse    global warming emissions  A year later  the Bush Administration has still not taken action to address this issue     Reed stated     As the world   s largest contributor of carbon dioxide emissions  the United States must take steps to reduce its human impact on global climate change          In June of 2005  the Senate passed a resolution expressing the sense of Congress that the United States should demonstrate international leadership in reducing the health  environmental  and economic risks posed by climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions  generating climate friendly technologies  participating in negotiations under the United Nations  UN  Framework Convention on Climate Change  and supporting the establishment of a long term objective to prevent the global average temperature from increasing by greater than 3 6 degrees Fahrenheit above pre industrial levels        Reed   s letter to the President requests that the Administration take steps to reduce carbon dioxide emissions including increasing fuel efficiency of automobiles  creating a mandatory emissions reduction program  and supporting a renewable portfolio standard requiring 20 percent of the nation   s electricity to be derived from renewable energy by 2020       Reed stated     Each day we hear new confirmation from scientists across the globe that global warming is not only occurring  but occurring at an alarming pace  We must do more to stop or reverse the trend of global warming before it is too late  This is an issue that affects us all as citizens of the world  and it cannot be ignored any longer          In June of 2005  Reed supported a bipartisan amendment to the Energy Policy Act of 2005 which would have required that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions be reduced to 2000 levels by 2010    This amendment was defeated in the Senate by a vote of 38 to 60       Reed is a cosponsor of the Clean Power Act in the U S  Senate  which seeks to require reductions in carbon dioxide  sulphur dioxide  nitrogen  and mercury emissions from both new and older power plants   He has also cosponsored a resolution which would express the sense of Congress that the United States should act to reduce greenhouse gas emissions       Text of the letter follows      June 22  2006      Dear President Bush       I am writing to express concern about the lack of progress that the United States is making to address climate change    Global warming is one of the most serious environmental  social  and economic threats facing our world  and I urge you to provide meaningful leadership to address this issue       Over the past several years  an increasing number of our nation   s leading scientists have concluded that there is a discernible human influence on the global climate    More than 2 400 prominent scientists and more than 2 500 economists  including eight Nobel Laureates  have stated that action is necessary to reduce the environmental  economic  and social risks of continuing accumulation of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere    On January 18  2006  six former administrators of the Environmental Protection Agency announced that they believe global warming is a real problem that should not be ignored  and in the last year  leading climate scientists have stated that the world may be warming more quickly than expected  with potentially more damaging consequences          A year ago  the Senate passed a resolution calling for mandatory action to    slow  stop  and reverse    global warming emissions    Decisive action is needed to protect our children and future generations from the long term consequences of climate changes  and I believe that our nation should play a leading role in addressing this threat    A growing number of states and cities are acting to address climate change  and the federal government must be a partner to both the international community and our governors and mayors    Therefore  I urge you to support five meaningful steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions     1  initiate mandatory emissions cap programs   2  increase CAFE standards   3  support a national renewable portfolio standard  RPS    4  fully fund energy efficiency and renewable energy programs  and  5  support an oil savings program to reduce our dependency on foreign oil       First  as you mentioned during your 2000 election campaign  a mandatory emissions reduction program with carbon dioxide targets is needed to reduce global warming    Local and regional initiatives to reduce emission levels are being implemented  and it is critical that the federal government support these efforts    Such a program will reduce uncertainty for investments and allow businesses to create their long term business plans with emission caps in mind    I believe that we must act now to reduce our current emissions levels       Transportation accounts for one third of our nation   s global warming emissions  and gasoline consumption in the transportation sector represents about 44 percent of total oil consumption in the United States each year    To bring about any serious reduction in our dependence on foreign oil and these greenhouse gases that we release into the atmosphere  we must increase the fuel efficiency of our cars and light trucks    This can be accomplished through an increase in CAFE standards as well as by promoting the use of hybrids and vehicles that use alternative fuels    In model year 2002  the average fuel economy for cars and light trucks was 20 4 miles per gallon     a 22 year low    Yet  if performance and weight had stayed constant since 1981  the average fuel economy would have improved 33 percent     enough to displace the amount of oil we import from the Persian Gulf 2 5 times over    I urge you to support an increase of CAFE standards for both passenger cars and sport utility vehicles of roughly ten miles by 2017 from the current overall fleet average of 25 2 miles per gallon       I request that you show your support for recent state initiatives by backing a renewable portfolio standard  RPS  requiring 20 percent of the nation   s electricity to be derived from renewable energy by 2020    Ensuring that a minimum amount of renewable energy is included in our nation   s electricity portfolio will put us on the path toward increasing sustainability    Across the nation  state governments have restructured their electricity portfolios with their own renewable portfolio standards and are taking the lead on reducing emissions    It is my hope that your leadership can help set a uniform federal policy that will encourage investments in the renewable energy field and aid in decreasing our nation   s greenhouse gas emissions          Fully funding energy efficiency and renewable energy programs can reduce our demand for fossil fuels that contribute to global climate change    Funding for these programs is also our nation s best means of addressing a secure energy future    The Energy Policy Act of 2005 called for a 50 percent increase in energy efficiency funding over the next five years    Unfortunately  your Administration   s FY07 budget request cuts funding for core energy efficiency programs by over  100 million  or about 18 percent compared to the FY 2006 level    Under your Administration  there has been a six year decline in efficiency spending          Lastly  I urge you to support the oil savings strategy included in the bipartisan Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  S  2025    This legislation would direct the federal government to develop and implement a plan to reduce U S  oil dependence  starting with oil savings of 2 5 million barrels of oil per day within ten years and increasing these savings significantly by 2025          We need aggressive action to address global warming and encourage investments to reduce harmful emissions    The United States will only face more painful environmental  social  and economic effects by delaying meaningful action on global warming    Thank you for your consideration  and I look forward to your response         Sincerely         Jack Reed      United States Senator
