continues to grow  the state s Congressional delegation today joined advocates for Rhode Islanders who are homeless to announce a  4 million federal grant to provide more homes and services  Rhode Island Housing applied for the grant on behalf of the Rhode Island Continuum of Care        This federal funding is vital to our state   I am pleased that Rhode Island was awarded this grant  ensuring that Rhode Islanders experiencing homelessness have access to the range of supportive services and housing they need to get back on their feet and become productive and active members of our communities again   said Senator Jack Reed  who sits on the subcommittee which oversees federal housing and authored the Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act       The money  from the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  renews funding for 36 grants that are providing homes and services for the homeless in Rhode Island        With the cost of health care  energy  and a good education rising  no one should be forced to choose between paying rent or a mortgage and providing for their families   Senator Sheldon Whitehouse said    I m delighted that these critical funds will be available to help Rhode Islanders secure housing and supportive services        The grant goes to Rhode Island Housing  which will distribute the money to 24 organizations including the Urban League  Crossroads Rhode Island  Advent House in Providence  House of Hope of Warwick  Family Resources in Woonsocket and the McKinney Shelter in Newport        This funding will directly assist some of the most vulnerable people in Rhode Island   said U S  Rep  Patrick J  Kennedy   My colleagues and I were successful in increasing funding for homeless programs by over  100 million for the current fiscal year   This money will help some key facilities such as Crossroads  in the near term        Over 6 400 Rhode Islanders stayed in emergency shelters from July 1  2004 to June 30  2005  the most recent year for which this information is currently available   Of those  more than 1 700 were children        Affordable housing is a rare commodity in Rhode Island and throughout the nation   said Rep  Jim Langevin   The fact that the average Rhode Islander is forced to earn more than twice the minimum wage simply to cover monthly rent is unjust and it is wrong  Through all initiatives that provide funding for housing  the federal government can and does take an active role in helping Rhode Islanders achieve the American dream        HUD also announced that the State  through the Office of Housing and Community Development  will receive almost  750 000 in Emergency Shelter Grants    It is imperative that we meet the comprehensive needs of the homeless and this funding sets the stage for helping us to achieve that goal   said Gov  Donald Carcieri   Addressing the complex issue of affordable housing has been a top priority of my administration        The grant comes at a time when the cost of homes in Rhode Island is at an all time high   The average rent for a two bedroom apartment is more than  1 100 a month   The median sales price of a single family home was  282 500 last year        This grant ensures that formerly homeless Rhode Islanders will not lose their housing and services when the original funding expires this year  That said  we simply must continue to build more supportive housing   said Susan Bodington  Deputy Director of Rhode Island Housing        We are grateful to our Congressional delegation for securing the funding for the continuation of vital programs   said Anne Nolan  president of Crossroads    Any time we can help low income families address the uncertainties of homelessness we make our state a better place in which to live       Grant
