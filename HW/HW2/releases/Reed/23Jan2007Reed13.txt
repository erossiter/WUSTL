                                                                                              January 23  2007     Press Release        Statement by Senator Jack Reed on the President   s State of the Union Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       WASHINGTON  DC     U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  tonight issued the following statement on President George W  Bush   s State of the Union address         I am pleased the President seized this opportunity to address some very difficult issues here at home   But I am concerned that under this administration   s policies  too many middle class Americans are struggling to make ends meet         The American people want a health care plan that works for everyone   They are willing to make sacrifices to ensure a better system for their children and grandchildren   The President   s proposal won   t benefit many people who need health insurance and endangers the coverage of some who already have it         The President   s energy policy was laudable  but the question is  will he follow through          I was also hoping to hear some details about a plan to address the issue of affordable housing   Since President Bush took office  wages haven   t kept up with the blistering increase in the cost of housing   I will be working with my colleagues in Congress to establish an affordable housing fund that could supply as much as  800 million per year in grants for bricks and mortar development for low income families   I hope the President will join us in supporting this initiative         Tonight  we heard nothing new that suggests the President is willing to change his failed strategy in Iraq   I will continue to press for a phased redeployment of our troops that will bring our soldiers home and protect our national interest         I remain optimistic that with new leadership in Congress we can turn things around
