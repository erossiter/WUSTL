                                                                                                                                     PROVIDENCE  RI    In an effort to help local communities reduce homelessness nationwide  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today unveiled bipartisan legislation to provide over  1 8 billion for targeted homelessness assistance grant programs   The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act of 2007 would increase current levels of funding for homelessness assistance grants by  350 million and allocate  250 in additional funding for homelessness prevention initiatives         Homelessness is an extremely complex and pervasive problem that touches every state across the nation   said Reed  a senior member of the Banking Committee  which oversees federal housing policy    This bill will increase federal investment in helping America s neediest citizens and ultimately move them from homelessness to independence and self sufficiency         The Homelessness Research Institute at the National Alliance to End Homelessness reports that as many as 3 5 million Americans    including 1 35 million children    experience homelessness each year   Studies show that on any given night approximately 744 000 American men  women  and children are without homes         The higher cost of living and lack of affordable housing have made even more Rhode Islanders vulnerable to the effects of homelessness   With more people living from paycheck to paycheck  an increasing number of families are on the brink of becoming homeless   noted Reed    We cannot afford to ignore this problem   Homelessness leads to untold costs  including expenses for emergency rooms  shelters  and foster care   This legislation combines federal dollars with new incentives to help local communities prevent more families from becoming homeless   It is a wise investment of federal resources that will save taxpayers money in the long run by preventing homelessness  promoting the development of permanent supportive housing  and optimizing self sufficiency            Reed  a former Army Captain  noted that many homeless people have served our country in uniform   The Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  estimates that on any given night nearly 200 000 veterans are living on the streets or in homeless shelters across the country           After they leave the service  some veterans struggle with issues ranging from substance abuse to post traumatic stress disorder   said Reed    A lot of our homeless vets need treatment for mental health issues and ongoing support to get back on their feet   For many of these individuals  housing alone  without some attached services  may not be enough   These are people who made great sacrifices for our country and we need to make sure they have access to the healthcare and benefits they earned           The Community Partnership to End Homelessness Act seeks to reauthorize the landmark McKinney Vento Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 to help communities break the cycle of repeated and prolonged homelessness   It would simplify and consolidate three competitive U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD  homelessness assistance programs into one program and allow more funding to flow to communities that can demonstrate a commitment to accomplishing the goals of preventing and ending homelessness          Additionally  the bill would        Create a new  250 million prevention initiative that would allow communities to apply for funding to prevent homelessness   This would allow cities and towns to serve people who have moved frequently for economic reasons  are about to be evicted  live in severely overcrowded housing  or otherwise live in an unstable situation that puts them at risk of homelessness   The program could fund short  to medium term housing assistance  housing relocation and stabilization  and supportive services          Require HUD to provide incentives for communities to use proven strategies to end homelessness   These strategies would include permanent supportive housing for chronically homeless people  rapid re housing programs for homeless families  and other research based strategies that HUD  after public comment  determines are effective        Provide local communities with greater flexibility to spend money on preventing homelessness   Communities that demonstrate results   reducing the number of people who become homeless  the length of time people are homeless  and recidivism back into homelessness   would be allowed to use their homeless assistance funding more flexibly and to serve groups that are at risk of becoming homeless         Allocate thirty percent of total funds available nationally for permanent housing for individuals with disabilities or families headed by a person with disabilities   At least ten percent of overall funds would be to permanently house families with children        Create a more flexible set of requirements for rural communities by modifying HUD s long dormant Rural Homelessness Grant Program  Under the new requirements  a rural community could use funds for homelessness prevention and housing stabilization  in addition to transitional housing  permanent housing  and supportive services   The application process for these funds would be streamlined to be more consistent with the capacities of rural homelessness programs        Reed s bill has 13 cosponsors  Senators Wayne Allard  R CO   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Kit Bond  R MO   Richard Durbin  D IL
