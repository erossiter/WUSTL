missile defense   s problems and potential extending back decades has revealed a steady stream of authoritative criticisms of the program       The technical problems that plagued the program in the 1980 s continued through the 1990 s and up to today       The report was compiled by Victoria A  Samson  Research Analyst for the Center for Defense Information       Today Reed and Senator Carl Levin  D MI  will introduce an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill to strip  50 million in funding from the missile defense program       A 1987 General Accounting Office report  for example  found that    SDIO needs to improve its ability to provide timely and effective management direction and oversight       It has experienced several problems that result from inefficiencies in contracting  inadequate oversight related to existing work directives  and limited progress in integrating system and battle management architectures          A 1998 official report by a blue ribbon panel  the    Welch report     found      The rush to failure in flight testing has been partially caused by a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of developmental testing          This past March  an independent review team appointed by the Pentagon recommended major changes in the program because of recent test failures    T he Independent Review Team recommends the Ground based Midcourse Defense Program enter a new phase focused on Performance and Reliability Verification       Reed stated     These reports provide overwhelming evidence that rather than thoroughly testing the missile defense system  the Administration is blindly spending billions of dollars every year with the exclusive goal of deploying a system that is ineffective and its capabilities untested             After more than 50 years of research  there is no compelling evidence that national missile defense will provide a reliable defense of the United States     Reed stated       While it had been expected that the Bush Administration would initiate round the clock deployment last year  the program appears to have been put on hold in light of persistent problems  The most recent official panel was established after national missile defense tests failures in December and February       Following is the compilation of the reports       Independent Review Team Findings and Recommendations  Presented to

welch index html   Quote     The rush to failure in flight testing has been partially caused by a fundamental misunderstanding of the purpose of developmental testing  Some of these tests were treated as demonstrations of known capabilities where    fly to verify    was the purpose  The    demonstration mindset    was evident in flight tests conducted without complete component qualification and ground testing  In practice  the unknowns made them    fly to learn    experiences  One program office espoused the concept of    test a little  learn a lot     The drive for early capability based on minimum capability demonstration has been a factor in this    key demonstration    mentality that is  a single success is regarded as a large step forward and becomes the criteria for a key program decision  such as exercising an option to buy operational missiles  This approach and mindset are sharp departures from experience on successful flight test programs that have followed the practice of

technical challenges  Such a system will push the cutting edge of technology  SDIO must rely on some technologies that are as yet unproven  and learn how to integrate them into a reliable system  Designing  developing  and deploying a system with these uncertainties increases the risk that the system will not provide the level of protection SDIO currently promises          GAO Report GAO IMTEC 90 61  Strategic Defense System  Adequate Testing Must Precede Decision to Deploy   July 6  1990  http   archive gao gov d23t8 141805 pdf   Quote     The Strategic Defense System is being developed in several phases  Phase I will be built using existing technologies   Phase I has not received the scrutiny and oversight that Defense initially envisioned   The lack of effective agency oversight has contributed to the failure of other automated weapons systems  none of which matched the scale and technological complexity of Phase I  Consequently  any executive decision in 1993 to deploy Phase 1 would be premature and fraught with high risk          And          SDIO has not yet solidified the role of Brilliant Pebbles or what elements will be in the final design  This causes problems because without a stable design detailed Strategic Defense System requirements cannot be determined   Further  an unstable design increases the probability that system requirements will not be adequately determined and sufficient testing will not be performed to ensure that the system works          GAO Report GAO NSIAD 88 26  Strategic Defense Initiative Program  Better Management Direction and
