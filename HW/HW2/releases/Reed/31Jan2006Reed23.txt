                                                                                              January 31  2006     Press Release        Statement by Senator Jack Reed on the President   s State of the Union Address                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Senator Jack Reed  D RI  stated     As the President delivers his fifth State of the Union address this evening  I again urge him to be forthright with the American people about the full cost of the war in Iraq and the need for a long term commitment of U S  troops   During my recent trip to Iraq and Afghanistan  I was again able to witness the courage and character of our brave troops and officials   However  I believe that it is essential that the President recognize that although the morale of our soldiers is high  the military is being stretched  with soldiers serving multiple tours  and recruitment efforts being strained           The threat of terrorism remains real  and it is essential that the President explain to the American people how we will rebuild Iraq and Afghanistan  and what the costs will be  The President must also address the recent elections in Palestine  and its impact on security in the Middle East           While our nation is dealing with many issues abroad  the President must also address some very difficult issues here at home   We need to work to bring the benefits of economic growth to middle income American families  who are dealing with increasing inflation levels and decreasing wages   The President must address the impact of record high energy costs forcing many families and seniors to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table           I expect the President to talk about fiscal discipline  but it is unfortunate that he is apt to ask for a series of tax cuts that will benefit only the wealthiest Americans  while leaving our nation with the largest budget deficit in our history           The President also will highlight his plans for health care   However  as we have seen with the recent implementation of his prescription drug program  the Administration did not have a plan  leaving thousands of seniors and low income American   s behind once again  Like the war in Iraq  or the devastating consequences of Hurricane Katrina  the Administration has shown too often a lack of planning and preparation  It is time for the President to provide real strategies to help protect our nation  while at the same time ensuring that our citizens are not left behind
