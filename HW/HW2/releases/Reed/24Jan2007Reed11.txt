                                                                                                                                         MR  REED  I rise to address my strong support for the increase in the minimum wage that we are debating today in this Chamber        Minimum wage workers deserve this long overdue raise  The minimum wage  which today stands at  5 15 per hour under Federal law  hasn t increased since 1997  Since then  inflation has entirely eroded that pay raise  In the meantime  the pay of CEOs of large corporations has increased to an average of  10 5 billion per year  about 369 times the average wages of a worker and 821 times the average wage of a minimum wage worker        That discrepancy  that disparity  that growing bifurcation between the very well compensated and struggling families in America  cannot be tolerated any longer        This legislation would raise the minimum wage to  7 25 over the next 2 years  This measure is important because workers have been left out of the economic growth that we have seen so far in this limited recovery that we are experiencing  Strong productivity growth has translated into higher profits for businesses  not more take home pay for workers  And this is not just the low  entry level workers  This is very far up the income range for working Americans  The stagnation of earnings in the face of soaring prices for health care  education  and food is squeezing the ability of families to meet their demands  of providing opportunities for the children  In fact  for the first time in my lifetime  I am beginning to sense that so many people are worried whether their children will be able to enjoy the same level of progress of income  of housing that they have  a fact that they took for granted        No one who works full time should have to live in poverty  but the current minimum wage is not enough to bring even a single parent with one child over the poverty line  even if the parent works full time 52 weeks a year  That should never be the case in this country        Five million more Americans have fallen into poverty since President Bush took office  37 million Americans are now living in poverty  including 13 million children  And we know what the effects of poverty on children are  It impedes their ability to succeed in school  It deprives them of some of the experiences that we think are essential for their progress  Ultimately  it impairs their ability to contribute to this country as workers but  more importantly  as citizens  to fully participate  to bear the responsibilities of this great country  An unacceptably low minimum wage is a key factor in the problem of poverty in our country  This measure would go right to that problem in a very efficient way        People who are working deserve to be rewarded for their work  deserve to be out of poverty  Congress is failing to catch up with reality  Many States have taken it upon themselves to raise their minimum wage  During the election this past November  six States passed ballot initiatives  not just a legislative effort but the voice of the people of those States  to raise the minimum wage  Today 29 States and the District of Columbia have minimum wages above the Federal level  anywhere from  6 15 per hour to  7 93 per hour  In addition  the States of Washington  Oregon  Vermont  and Florida have gone so far as to index the minimum wage to the rate of inflation  allowing workers to share in the benefits of a growing economy        Raising the minimum wage will make a real difference for working families  putting an additional  4 400 per year in their pockets  Almost two thirds of those who would benefit are adult workers  more than a third of whom are the sole breadwinners for their families  More than 6 million children would benefit from this raise that their parents would receive        One of the fundamental principles of our country and our economy is that people should be able to support their families by their efforts  by their labors  by their works  That is when the economy is working well  That is the reality  Here we have a situation where there are people working two jobs sometimes  working 40 and 50 hours a week  who still don t have sufficient income to meet the demands of the family  Here in this country we should at least be able to guarantee to someone that if they are working that hard  they should at least be able to support their family out of poverty  That is at the core of what we are trying to do today         While the minimum wage has remained stagnant  because it is not just a question of how much a family earns  it is also a question of how much they must pay to support the basic demands of life  we have seen  for example  health insurance premiums increase 87 percent since 2000 alone  How does one afford health care if your wages don t go up  These premiums now average roughly  11 000 per year  and that is more than the annual wages of a full time minimum wage worker  Clearly  they are not going to be buying health insurance policies  And  by the way  I don t think they are going to be able to take advantage of the President s proposal for a tax deduction because  simply  they are not able to buy the health insurance in the first place  nor are they able to wait a year to get a tax deduction on a tax liability that is probably close to zero  if not  in fact  zero        Additionally  if you look at college tuition  another aspect of family life which is part of the American dream  the notion  again  that you can go ahead and ensure or help at least your children to do better  to go to college  one of the things that recent economic studies have shown is that because we do not have the full access and affordability of college  the class structure is becoming more rigid  Back in the 1950s and 1960s  if you were predicting the income of a son based on his father s income  the correlation was somewhere at 20  30  40 percent  Today it is 60 percent  If you are a wealthy parent  you will probably have wealthy children  But the reverse is also true  if you are a low income worker  the chances of your son or daughter rising to the top in this economy are much less than they were 40 and 50 years ago  Horatio Alger is not alive and well in America today as he once was        This economy has to be more representative of giving people a chance to move up  The key to that  or one of the significant keys  is access to higher education  We have to do more  One thing at least we can do  if the prices of higher education are rising so much  is certainly to at least raise wages and raise the minimum wage        Every day the minimum wage is not increased it continues to leave workers behind because inflation continues unabated at levels that are modest in terms of historical comparisons  but it still is eating away at that existing minimum wage  Today the real value of the minimum wage is more than  4 below what it was in 1968  Think of that  In 1968  we could afford to pay much higher wages to those people engaged in minimum wage work  and it didn t upset our economy  To have the purchasing power that it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be more than  9 37 an hour  not  5 15 as it is today  or even  7 25  If we could do it in 1968  why can t we do it today        History also suggests that raising the minimum wage does not have a negative impact on jobs  You will hear a lot of people say this is going to distort the employment numbers  and it is going to inhibit employment        In the 4 years after the last minimum wage increase passed in 1997  the economy experienced the strongest growth in over three decades  We have not seen that kind of growth since the late nineties or during this administration  But following the last increase  nearly 12 million new jobs were added  at a pace of about 248 000 a month  In contrast  in the most recent 4 year period  the minimum wage has remained stagnant and only a small fraction of that number of jobs has been created  Because of the increase in productivity  because of the fact that workers are more effective  they should be able to be compensated more  That is not happening as it should        Working families are struggling to meet their most basic needs  and a fair increase in the wage floor is the right direction to take for this Congress  I am disappointed that our most recent efforts to clearly and simply raise the minimum wage are being linked to other provisions  American families deserve the much needed boost that this raise will provide  They deserve to hear a clear signal from this Senate that we are on their side  they are not an afterthought to be added to other provisions        Mr  President  this is long overdue  I urge my colleagues to work as quickly as possible to pass the minimum wage increase        I yield the floor
