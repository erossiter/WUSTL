and improve public school libraries  U S  Senators Jack Reed  D RI  and Thad Cochran  R MS  today joined with scores of librarians from Rhode Island and all around the country to unveil the Strengthening Kids Interest in Learning and Libraries  SKILLs  Act  The SKILLs Act reauthorizes and strengthens the Improving Literacy through School Libraries program of the No Child Left Behind Act  This legislation will help ensure that more schools have highly qualified librarians and the resources they need to help students harness new technologies to find information  We know that school libraries are a critical component in improving student literacy skills and academic achievement  This legislation recognizes what makes this success possible  highly trained librarians  said Senator Reed  As technology rapidly changes the way our children learn  it is imperative that we have experienced librarians who can help kids harness these new technologies and access the information they need  The SKILLs Act underscores the value of school libraries by encouraging the hiring of highly qualified school library media specialists in our nations school libraries  Senator Cochran said  School librarians play an important role in the lives of students of all ages  The ability to foster confidence in a student to research a topic about which he or she wants to learn is a unique gift  A child who understands and is comfortable with information technology is a child who will grow up with the ability to learn throughout his or her lifetime  The SKILLs Act will provide federal support and incentives to strengthen our school libraries  which I hope will improve education in America  The No Child Left Behind Act requires a highly qualified teacher in every core academic classroom  but since librarians currently dont qualify as highly qualified teachers  school districts facing budget cuts sometimes replace them with less expensive paraprofessionals  The SKILLs Act will require that all K12 public schools have a state certified media specialist  In 2005 the Department of Education found that the Improving Literacy Through School Libraries program was successful in improving the quality of school libraries receiving grants  Todays librarians do so much more than catalogue collections and check out books  they are educators in every sense of the word  noted Reed  School libraries and librarians play an essential role in helping students get the skills they need to succeed in an increasingly competitive world and this legislation will help provide the necessary support in that endeavor  The SKILLS Act will also help ensure that federal funding serves more elementary  middle  and high school students  and expand professional development to include information

strategies  Summary  Strengthening Kids Interest in Learning and Libraries  SKILLs  Act Reauthorizes and Strengthens the Improving Literacy through School Library program of the No Child Left Behind
