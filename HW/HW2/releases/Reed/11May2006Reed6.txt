                                                                                              May 11  2006     Press Release        Reed Asks President to Extend Deadline for Prescription Drug Enrollment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON  DC     Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today joined his colleagues in sending a letter to President Bush requesting that the Administration extend the enrollment deadline for the Medicare prescription drug benefit program and eliminate financial penalties through the end of the year   The deadline for enrollment in the program is May 15  2006       Since the implementation of the program began  Medicare beneficiaries have faced challenges with enrollment  and many have been denied or delayed access to Medicare prescription coverage   Beneficiaries who do not act before the May 15th deadline will be penalized by a one percent increase in their premium for each month that they delay their choice          As we approach the May 15th enrollment deadline  many Medicare beneficiaries are still struggling to navigate through the complex and confusing prescription drug program   It is upsetting that many recipients of this benefit  particularly low income seniors and individuals with disabilities  are being forced to make decisions that may not be in their best interest   stated Reed    It is essential that beneficiaries are given an appropriate amount of time to choose the best plan   I will continue to work with my colleagues to urge the Bush Administration to ensure that seniors and the disabled will have access to life saving medications  without facing financial hardship        Reed voted three times to extend the enrollment deadline for the Medicare prescription drug benefit in November of 2005 and February and March of 2006   Each time  the Senate opposed the extension       In 2003  Senator Reed  a member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor  and Pensions Committee opposed legislation creating the prescription drug benefit   At that time Reed stated   Affordability and dependability have been needlessly sacrificed to current and future tax cuts   Seniors expect  and deserve  that this prescription drug benefit is a commitment to reduce how much they pay for prescriptions and a promise that they will start saving money soon after the President signs the legislation   I do not believe that this bill will deliver on either promise for the majority of elderly and disabled Americans        In February  Senator Reed held a forum on the Medicare Part D benefit in Pawtucket  RI  to discuss changes to the prescription drug plan and solutions to help seniors navigate through the program       Text of the letter follows      May 11  2006      The President  The White House Office  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  N W    Washington  D C  20500      Dear Mr  President         Across the country  over 40 million Medicare beneficiaries have been presented with the choice of signing up for the Medicare prescription drug program   Unfortunately  many seniors and individuals with disabilities are understandably concerned and confused about the new benefit         Beneficiaries face a number of prescription drug plan options  and choosing the right plan can be a challenge   Each of the options differs in terms of premiums  cost sharing requirements  drugs covered and pharmacy access   Sorting through these plans has proven to be difficult and time consuming for many beneficiaries   Further complicating matters  the Medicare drug program has experienced a variety of implementation problems that have disproportionately affected the most vulnerable beneficiaries         Yet  beneficiaries who do not act by the May 15  2006  deadline and who enroll at a later date will face a financial penalty   Seniors who choose a plan after May 15  2006  will be penalized by a one percent increase in their premium for each month they delay their choice         We are writing to request that you direct Secretary Leavitt to extend the enrollment deadline through the end of the year  and eliminate the financial penalty during this period           The Congressional Budget Office  CBO  has estimated that an additional 1 1 million beneficiaries would sign up for the Medicare prescription drug program during this year if the May 15th deadline was extended   In addition  they calculate that eliminating the penalty for this year would ultimately lower premiums for 7 5 million beneficiaries         Since Congress has not yet passed legislation expanding the existing six month open enrollment period  we urge you to take action   The stakes here are too high to deny seniors the time and resources they need to make an informed decision         As you know  Secretary Leavitt has already extended the enrollment deadline for some low income beneficiaries and hurricane Katrina evacuees   We believe the Secretary has the legal authority to provide the same benefit to all Medicare beneficiaries             We all share the goal of ensuring that Medicare beneficiaries have sufficient time and assistance to make a wise decision regarding prescription drug coverage   We respectfully urge you to announce your intention to delay both the enrollment deadline and penalty as soon as possible         Thank you for your attention to this important matter
