                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON  DC    With gas prices rising at an alarming rate and tensions in the Middle East causing prices to increase even further  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today joined his colleagues in the Senate in sending a letter to Senator Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  to urge him to have the Senate consider legislation to take positive steps to reduce America   s dependence on foreign oil and reduce energy prices          Two years ago the U S  Senate passed energy legislation that provided virtually no relief to Americans in the face of ever increasing energy costs  while at the same time providing energy companies with huge corporate giveaways and subsidies     Reed stated      These policies have done nothing to help our country achieve independence from foreign oil and have translated into skyrocketing prices at the pump        Reed continued     Since passage of this inefficient and costly energy legislation  nearly 100 energy related bills and amendments have been proposed to make real changes to the United States    energy policy and to end our nations    addiction to oil     The nation needs policies that promote renewable energy and energy conservation and efficiency  We cannot drill our way to energy independence   It is time that the Senate Majority Leader allows a full and open debate so the Senate can consider these important measures to finally address America   s energy needs        The letter outlined several steps that the Senate should take to create real energy solutions for our country including setting a firm goal to reduce our overall dependence on foreign oil by 40 percent by 2020 through increasing fuel efficiency standards for automobiles  requiring the United States federal government   the nation   s single largest energy consumer   to adopt fuel efficient vehicle technologies  and increasing incentives for manufacturers and consumers to develop and use renewable and energy efficient technologies  In the short term  the letter urges Senator Frist to allow the Senate to consider measures that will ensure that the American people are protected from price gouging at the pump        Energy prices have been steadily increasing under the Bush Administration and the events taking place in Middle East will only exacerbate this problem  The financial strains caused by these record high prices are hurting workers and our economy in Rhode Island and nationwide     said Reed      Travel costs  tourism costs  shipping costs  and even food costs are adversely affected by high fuel prices   The Administration must act more aggressively to help ease the burden facing our nation             The Administration has failed to come up with a comprehensive energy policy to ensure that consumers are not vulnerable to tremendous swings in prices   We need comprehensive energy legislation that truly helps Americans reduce dependence on Middle East oil     said Reed     Text of the letter follows     Dear Majority Leader Frist      Energy prices continue to be of great concern to Americans    record fuel prices and growing supply volatility and unreliability are hurting consumers and the economy   Substantial and comprehensive changes to the nation   s energy policy continue to be needed to improve our national security  promote economic growth  and protect consumers and the environment           As you may be aware  approximately 100 energy related bills and amendments have been introduced in the Senate since passage of last year   s energy bill  by Senators of both parties   These include a number of significant proposals to improve the nation   s energy policy that have been sponsored by numerous members of our caucus  for example  S 2829  the Clean EDGE Act of 2006   as well as a number of groundbreaking bipartisan proposals  for example  S 2025  the Vehicles and Fuels Choices for American Security Act  S 2747  the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006  or S 2677  the Securing America   s Energy Independence Act    As many of us noted in a letter to the President on May 17  2006  we are eager to work to increase America   s energy security and independence          The Senate can still accomplish significant energy policy changes this year  if it avoids getting bogged down in lengthy  unproductive debates on divisive issues  such as rolling back the environmental standards that protect the air we breathe and the water we drink    We believe this effort should begin with a set of core principles that can help America achieve forward looking energy goals  and that can be embraced by Senators in both parties   We think that the following points summarize those core principles  and we stand ready to work with you to pass legislation that would reflect these principles         The Senate should take as its starting point the setting of a firm and actionable national goal to reduce our overall national dependence on petroleum  coupled with a serious strategy for achieving this goal   We believe that the President correctly observed last January that    America is addicted to oil     and that we need to work both to diversify our supplies of liquid fuels as well as to promote strong efficiency gains in our uses of petroleum  across the U S  economy   Our suggested goal would be to reduce our dependence on petroleum by an amount equivalent to 40 percent of our projected level of imports by 2020           As part of reducing our national dependence on petroleum  the United States must launch an aggressive effort designed to ensure that an increasing number of new vehicles sold in America can run on alternative fuels  starting with 25 percent in 2010  In order for this to make a real difference in reducing our dependence on oil  this effort must be paired with a bold initiative to make smart investments in American infrastructure and promote real competition at the gas pump          The United States government   our nation   s single largest energy consumer   must help lead the transition to lower petroleum dependence  by adopting the best available fuel efficiency and alternative vehicle technologies  The federal fleet should reduce its petroleum consumption by 20 percent over the next five years  and save at least 40 percent by 2020          In the nearer term  the United States must ensure that our consumers are protected from gasoline price gouging and energy market manipulation    Numerous bills have been introduced on this topic     it is time for them to be acted upon         The United States must level the playing field for new renewable and energy efficiency technologies  We can provide incentives for consumers and manufacturers to accelerate the market for these technologies and the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles  by ensuring major oil companies pay their fair share in taxes and royalties owed to the American public         The United States must recognize that our future energy policy and climate policy are inextricably linked   The United States must start taking steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions in any new energy bill  including diversifying sources of electric generation to include a greater percentage of renewable resources   Proposals for increased use of alternative fuels must also reflect an assessment of the total systems greenhouse gas impact of producing and using those fuels         Finally  new energy proposals that affect spending or revenues must be fiscally responsible and take into account the true long term impact of those proposals     We believe all of these goals can be achieved in a way that makes energy more affordable and reliable for America   s families  farmers  and businesses   We hope that you will choose to work with us to provide all Americans with a cleaner and more secure energy future
