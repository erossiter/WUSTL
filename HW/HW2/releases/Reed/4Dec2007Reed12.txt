                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON  DC    In an effort to help more Rhode Islanders pay their home heating bills this winter  U S  Senator Jack Reed  D RI  today requested an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   In a letter sent to the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and cosigned by a bipartisan group of 37 Senators  Reed requested a total of  3 412 billion in fiscal year 2008 for LIHEAP  a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households  Rhode Islanders are already being hit with high gas prices at the pump  As temperatures drop and the cost of oil continues to rise  it is imperative that we provide more assistance for families in need  said Reed  chairman of the Northeast Midwest Coalition  This additional  1 billion in emergency funding for LIHEAP will help ease the strain on more low income families and elderly citizens and provide states with immediate relief to help people heat their homes this winter  Last year  nearly 30 000 Rhode Island households relied on LIHEAP to assist with the costs of heating their homes and to pay delinquent utilities bills to re establish service  A recent report by the Energy Information Administration estimates that heating oil costs are likely to jump as high as 26 percent this winter  However  that didnt stop President Bush from vetoing the Labor HHS spending bill last month  which contains  2 4 billion for LIHEAP  This funding is  250 million above last years spending level and  629 6 million above Presidents budget request  The Presidents veto of LIHEAP is preventing states from receiving critical funds to cope with the next fiscal year and unnecessarily delaying heating assistance to thousands of Rhode Islanders who need help with their heating bills  said Reed  The Administration should reverse course and work with Congress to quickly release emergency LIHEAP funding now rather than leaving families out in the cold this winter  The text of the letter follows    The Honorable Tom Harkin  Chairman  The Honorable Arlen Specter  Ranking Member Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  and Related Agencies Committee on Appropriations Washington  DC 20510  Dear Chairman Harkin and Ranking Member Specter   We are writing to request that you include an additional  1 billion in emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in fiscal year 2008 to provide for a total of  3 412 billion  We recognize the difficult budget constraints that the Subcommittee faces and appreciate your support for additional funding for the LIHEAP program in FY2008 Labor  Health and Human Services  and Related Appropriations Conference Report that was vetoed   With the price of oil hovering near  100 per barrel  and the Energy Information Administration  EIA  estimating that households can expect to pay between 10 to 26 percent more for heating fuels than during the 2007 2008 winter  states need additional funding immediately to reduce the energy burden of families  individuals with disabilities  and senior citizens and ensure their health and safety this winter   Between FY2003 and FY2007 the number of households receiving LIHEAP assistance increased by 26 percent from 4 6 million to about 5 8 million or about 15 6 percent of the eligible population  During this same period  the federal appropriation increased by only 10 percent with the resulting average grant declining from  349 to  305  Unfortunately  energy prices are not decreasing proportionally  but instead continue to rise  As a result  there has been a significant decrease in the programs purchasing power  According to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association  states are planning to reduce the number of households served by about 15 percent in the absence of additional federal and supplemental state funding  The result would be a decline in the number of households served from about 5 8 million in FY2007 to 4 9 million  For these reasons  we believe an additional  1 billion in emergency funding is warranted   LIHEAP is vital to protecting the public health and safety of low income families  According to the Childrens Sentinel Nutrition Assessment Program  C SNAP  out of Boston Medical Center  babies and toddlers who live in energy insecure households are more likely to suffer poor health  require hospitalization  manifest developmental problems  and lack adequate food  C SNAP found that when families do not have access to sufficient energy  they may resort to unsafe heating methods and do not have the proper means to refrigerate or prepare food for their children  In addition  without a sufficient LIHEAP benefit  seniors living on fixed incomes often have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions and paying utility bills  For individuals and households that may have to face these difficult choices  LIHEAP makes a real difference in their ability to cope with adverse circumstances   Moreover  the program helps low income homeowners weatherize their homes to save energy and lower their energy burden  Weatherization  on average  reduces heating bills by 31 percent and overall energy bills by  200 to  250 per year   Thank you for your consideration  We look forward to working with you to increase funding for the LIHEAP program to ensure that low income seniors  individuals with disabilities  and families have the resources that they need to stay warm this winter  Sincerely
