                                                                                                                                         Senators Jack Reed  D RI  today was joined by several of his colleagues in sending a letter to Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  to bring a measure before the Senate by February to fund the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  at  5 1 billion  a level approved by the U S  Senate six times        LIHEAP is a federal block grant program that provides states with annual funding to operate home energy assistance programs for low income households   In addition to helping to pay energy bills for low income families and the elderly  LIHEAP helps to fund energy crisis intervention programs  low cost residential weatherization and other energy related home repairs       Reed stated     Record high heating prices could wipe out many families across the country this winter  Many states are already overwhelmed with an increased number of LIHEAP applications this winter due to record high heating oil and natural gas prices  It is essential that we fund LIHEAP at  5 1 billion          Reed has consistently asked Congress and the President to provide  5 1 billion in funding for LIHEAP    Unfortunately  while receiving a majority of Senate support  Reed   s efforts were defeated on a budget technicality  The Republican Congress last month approved only  2 183 billion   http   reed senate gov news energy funding 10 19 05 cfm       Text of the letter follows      Dear Majority Leader Frist       High energy prices are threatening the health and economic well being of low income households across the United States   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills           Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by bringing a measure to the floor that provides an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   as supported by the majority of the Senate           Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted six times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate   s support         Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Comittee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans   These families and seniors deserve help from the federal government           As you know  the Department of Defense  DoD  Appropriations Conference report originally provided an additional  2 billion for LIHEAP   The LIHEAP funding provided by the DoD conferees was designated as emergency funding   The emergency designation funding is warranted given the high cost of energy this winter  and the lack of growth in workers    wages           Unfortunately  other more controversial matters included in the conference report prevented the retention of the LIHEAP money in final action on that bill           The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation         Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education          We respectfully request that you bring a measure to the Senate floor at the end of this month  or at the latest  early February  that funds LIHEAP at the  5 1 billion level supported by the Senate         We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs         Thank you for your consideration for this essential request
