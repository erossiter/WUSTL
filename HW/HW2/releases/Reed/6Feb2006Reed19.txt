                                                                                              February 6  2006     Press Release        Senator Reed   s Statement on the President   s Budget Cuts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Senator Jack Reed  D RI  stated     It is tremendously disappointing that President Bush has cut funding in his fiscal year  FY  2007 budget for important programs that are vital to the well being  education  economic success and safety of Rhode Islanders     Reed continued     While the budget has appropriately invested in national security  it unfortunately leaves our citizens behind here at home  In addition  the President   s budget seeks to make costly tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans permanent at a time when we are facing one of the largest deficits in our nation   s history        In his FY2007 budget  the President makes substantial cuts to important health care programs  including Medicare and the Health Resources Services Administration  HRSA    At a time when Rhode Island and the entire nation is facing nursing shortages  the President is attempting to make it more difficult to train health professionals and make health care less obtainable for Rhode Islanders and Americans by eliminating several Health Professions Training Programs which are designed to train primary care providers to meet the needs of special and underserved populations  as well as increase minority representation in the health care workforce       The budget also eliminates at least 15 other health programs including Emergency Medical Services for Children  Newborn Hearing Screening  Trauma Care  and the newly created Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank  which Reed worked to enact and the President signed into law late last year      The budget again proposes level funding for the National Institutes of Health  directly impacting research grants in Rhode Island     Additionally  the Bush Administration   s budget would only provide  2 652 billion for pandemic influenza preparedness  even though Congress approved  3 320 billion last year     The President has abandoned students who expect and deserve quality education as well as teachers and school systems trying to provide a solid education   The FY 07 budget eliminates almost  1 billion in 48 federally funded education programs  including GEAR UP  Teacher Quality Enhancement  Leveraging Educational Assistance Partnership  LEAP   Even Start  TRIO Upward Bound Talent Search  and Safe and Drug Free Schools and Communities State Grants   Additionally  the budget would provide no additional funding for the Head Start and Early Head Start program       In Rhode Island  thousands of students have received LEAP funding and support from the GEAR UP program which helps prepare low income and at risk children for college        In addition to cuts to several health programs  the budget does not make clean and safe drinking water a priority by cutting both the Clean Water State Revolving Fund and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund     In his State of the Union Address  the President spoke of the importance of increased funding for renewable energy  yet his budget comes up short   Weatherization grants to increase energy efficiency would be deeply cut under the President   s proposal  and the Department of Energy   s  DOE  program for energy efficient Building Codes Training and Assistance and Inventions and Innovations program would be eliminated       When the Administration stresses the importance of security and protecting our nation  he has proposed large cuts to the successful Fire Grant program through the Department of Homeland Security  DHS    Rhode Island fire departments received over  1 7 million last year through the fire grant program  The budget again provides inadequate funding for transit security   Reed has proposed several amendments to increase funding for transit security     The budget also would eliminate all vocational and technical education programs and the Community Services Block Grant  CSBG  and decrease funding for job training programs
