     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Bill to Correct Mistake in Agriculture Disaster Payments Becomes Law          August 13th  2007   Washington  D C    The President today signed into law a bill authored by Senator John Thune  S 1716   correcting a potentially devastating mistake in the  3 billion agriculture disaster aid package that passed Congress in May  The Senate passed Senator Thune s bill on July 27th and the House passed it on July 30th    Congress clearly intended disaster assistance to be available to crop and livestock producers who suffered devastating losses due to natural disasters in 2005 and 2006   said Thune    The assistance provided by Congress includes payments for livestock losses under the Livestock Indemnity Program  LIP  and compensation for grazing and other losses under the Livestock Compensation Program  LCP     This correction to the disaster relief bill is critically important   said Thune   I am pleased Congress recognized the urgency in passing my legislation and President Bush quickly signed this important measure into law    Without Thune s bill  as many as 90 percent of the livestock and forage producers who suffered losses would have been ineligible for the assistance Congress intended for them to receive  Earlier this summer  the Department of Agriculture s Office of General Counsel interpreted language in section 9012 of the disaster legislation to mean that in order to be eligible for the LIP  or the LCP  a producer must have participated in the Non Insured Crop Disaster Assistance Program  NAP   or a federal crop insurance pilot program during the year LIP or LCP assistance is requested  According to USDA  nationwide participation in NAP during the required years was less than 13 percent  The reason the participation rate in NAP is so low is because payments for losses generally amount to only  1 or  2 per acre    If disaster benefits had been limited to only those livestock producers who obtained NAP or pilot crop insurance policies for the year they request disaster assistance  the vast majority of livestock producers across the country with 2005 and 2006 losses would have been ineligible for disaster assistance   said Thune   I found that unacceptable  It is not sound policy to exclude livestock and forage producers from disaster assistance because they chose not to participate in what many consider an ineffective program      SDCA thanks Senator Thune for his hard work on behalf of South Dakota s cattlemen   Senator Thune s work to help producers recover a portion of their losses due to natural disasters will help not only producers  but everyone in South Dakota who is economically reliant on agriculture  This illustrates the importance of the relationship between livestock producers and our elected officials   said Scott Jones  South Dakota Cattlemen s Association President    As President Bush signs this legislation  South Dakota Farmers Union members commend Senator Thune for seeing this oversight in the disaster aid package and correcting it  We are pleased that the government is allowing up to 90 percent of our livestock producers who have no need for crop insurance on their ranch to receive disaster aid  Again  this brings to light the need for a permanent disaster title in the next farm bill  which the South Dakota Farmers Union and Senator Thune will continue to advocate in the upcoming debates regarding this legislation   said Doug Sombke  President of the South Dakota Farmers Union    Over the past few years  drought conditions and other natural disasters have financially strained tens of thousands of agriculture producers across South Dakota and the country  Congress responded to the needs of America s producers by enacting emergency disaster assistance for our farm and ranch families  My legislation ensures that forage and livestock producers in need of assistance due to 2005 and 2006 natural disasters are not denied the assistance they are entitled to receive   said Thune   I will continue working with the USDA to ensure disaster assistance is not further delayed    USDA plans to issue disaster payments to agriculture and livestock producers this fall                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
