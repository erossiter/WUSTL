     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Senator John Thune statement on U S  District Court Ruling to Block Canadian Cattle Imports          March 2nd  2005   Washington  D C      The Court  s ruling is a huge victory for South Dakota ranchers and the safety of American consumers  Hopefully the decision will redefine the border issue  Since the moment I was sworn in as a Senator  I have worked to delay the border opening  Now the courts agree   The Administration moved in the right direction when it agreed to roll back the importation of products from cattle older than 30 months  but it  s still not enough  as today  s ruling shows    Given the difficult politics of getting something through Congress by March 7  the courts decision is a welcome one  Today  s decision sends a loud and clear message that the border opening should be delayed  Rather than further litigate the issue  I hope that USDA now agrees to delay the border opening                                                                                                                                                    SR 493
