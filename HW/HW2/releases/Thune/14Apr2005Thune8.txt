     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Thune introduces Flag Protection Amendment          April 14th  2005   Washington  D C    Sen  John Thune today introduced a Constitutional Amendment to protect the American flag  seeking to protect a universal symbol of freedom and a reminder of what veterans have sacrificed to defend it     When brave Americans risk life and limb defending our flag abroad  they should know the flag is safe at home     Thune said    The American flag is a symbol of freedom and a constant reminder of those who died defending it  Out of respect for our men and women in uniform and our veterans  the flag should be protected      Thune co sponsored the Amendment with a bipartisan group of senators  including Senators Hatch  Feinstein  Talent  and 47 other Senators  Thune said the strong bipartisan endorsement behind the Amendment and overwhelming public support would be critical to passing the Amendment     Given the strong bipartisan support for this issue in Congress and throughout the nation  I am hopeful we can enact this important Amendment     Thune said    The American people overwhelmingly believe the American flag should be protected  I am introducing this Amendment so those who have bravely defended our nation in the past    and those defending it today    can have the flag protected      Members of Congress have worked since 1989 to protect the American flag  after the United States Supreme Court  in Texas v  Johnson  found a right within the Constitution that never before existed    the right to desecrate the American flag  A Constitutional Amendment with 41 Senate co sponsors was introduced in the 108th U S  Congress  but was not acted upon by the full Senate   FLOOR STATEMENT BY SENATOR JOHN THUNE INTRODUCING CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT   FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOHN THUNE  April 14  2005  Thank you Mr  President   Today  it is my distinct honor and privilege to rise and speak on behalf of Senator Hatch  Senator Feinstein  Senator Talent  myself and 47 other Senators  as we introduce bi partisan legislation we believe to be long overdue    It is not reform legislation   It does not authorize new government programs  create    new sources of tax revenue or provide incentives to stimulate our economy   It is none of those things   But it is a matter of great importance         the events of  9 11 have reminded us all of that   It is  instead  legislation that speaks to the core of our beliefs and hopes as a nation  and as a people   It is about a national treasure and a symbol of our country that the vast majority of Americans    and the majority of this great body  I might add    believe is worth special status and worthy of protection    It is about the American Flag   Mr  President  our American flag is more than mere cloth and ink   It is a symbol of the liberty and freedom that we enjoy today thanks to the immeasurable sacrifices of generations of Americans who came before us    It represents the fiber and strength of our values and it has been sanctified by the blood of those who died defending it     I rise today  Mr  President  to call upon all members of this body to support a Constitutional Amendment that would give Congress the power to prohibit the physical desecration of the American flag    It would simply authorize  but not require  Congress to pass a law protecting the American flag    This amendment does not affect anyone  s right to express their political beliefs    It would only allow Congress to prevent our flag from being used as a prop   to be desecrated in some ways simply not appropriate to even mention in these halls      This resolution and similar legislation have been the subject of debate before this body before   There is  in fact  a quite lengthy legislative history regarding efforts to protect the American Flag from desecration     In 1989  the Supreme Court declared essentially that burning the American flag is   free speech       I think that is a decision the American people should make    particularly when this country finds itself fighting for democracy and expending American lives for that cause  on battlefields overseas   South Dakota veterans and members of the armed forces from my state know exactly what I  m talking about  as I  m sure they do from every state   In recent months  units of the 147th field artillery and 153rd engineer battalions of the South Dakota National Guard returned home after spending a difficult year in Iraq   Likewise  the 452nd ordinance company of the United States Army Reserve is preparing to depart for Iraq in September    My father  like many other veterans of World War II  understands the importance of taking this step    Veterans from across South Dakota have asked me to step up and defend the flag of this great nation and today I am answering that call     Today  members of both political parties will introduce a proposed constitutional amendment that would give back to the American people the power to prevent the desecration of the American Flag    We know the gravity of this legislation    There is nothing complex about this amendment  nor are there any hidden consequences  This amendment provides Congress with the power to outlaw desecration of the American Flag  a right that was widely recognized by Madison  Jefferson  and Supreme Court Justice Hugo Black  one of the foremost advocates of First Amendment freedoms   Most states officially advocate Congress passing legislation to protect the Flag  Frankly  I do not see this as a First Amendment issue   It is an attempt to restore the traditional protections to the symbol cherished so dearly by our government and the people of the United States    Some acts are not accepted as   free speech    even in societies like ours where we consider free speech a cherished right   For example  an attempt to burn down this capital building as a political statement would never be viewed as someone  s right of free speech   Our laws would not tolerate the causing of harm to other  s property or life as an act of   free speech       Well  this flag happens to be the property of the American people in my opinion  and I believe this question should be put before the states and their people to decide how and if to protect it    I think the answer will come back as a resounding   yes      There is little doubt that the debate over state ratification will trigger a tremendous discussion over our values  beliefs and whether we will ultimately bestow a lasting honor on our traditions   Importantly  it will be an indication of how we recognize our servicemen and women who are sacrificing   right now    in Iraq and Afghanistan  to protect those traditions and values for us   Will we honor them  and all the veterans who served and died in wars for this country and our flag over the last 200 years     That  s not a question which a court should hold the final answer    I believe the time has finally come    I believe our country wants this debate    The majority of this Senate  I believe  wants this Amendment   We begin it here  and we begin it now    Mr  President  let the debate begin  Thank you  and I yield the floor                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
