agreement set to pass Congress  South Dakota will see a 30 percent increase in its federal transportation funding over the last highway bill     A 30 percent increase is a huge victory for South Dakota     Thune said    This is long overdue  but I am proud we are delivering and delivering big  The federal funding we secured for South Dakota over the next five years will create new jobs and grow our economy  These projects will improve the quality and safety of South Dakota  s roads  bridges and highways      The conference report also keeps the Senate  s protection for South Dakota  s formula funding  which guarantees that our state  s funding will not decrease over the next five years     Locking in our state  s funding will protect South Dakota  s share of federal transportation dollars     Thune said    I  m proud to have fought hard to protect South Dakota  s funding level      Thune  s  150 million in earmarks is in addition to the  75 million secured by Senator Tim

Total Thune projects    150 million    We appreciate Senator Thune  s efforts and dedication in developing a highway reauthorization bill that provides record funding for South Dakota over the next five years     said Leon Schochenmaier with the South Dakota Department of Transportation    Senator Thune  s leadership has been instrumental in securing a substantial increase in formula funding for South Dakota  In fact  Senator Thune  s efforts as a member of the EPW Committee ensure that our state  s overall share of highway funding is locked in over the coming years  Basically this means that South Dakota will continue to receive a 2 1 rate of return for every dollar of motor fuel tax that  s collected      As a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and the Transportation Conference Committee  Thune played a critical role in crafting the multi year reauthorization bill concerning the nation  s surface transportation program    The previous transportation bill expired in September 2003 and has languished in both the House and Senate since then  The legislation reported out of the conference committee would re authorize the nation  s surface transportation program
