all we can to ensure the privacy of our veterans who have sacrificed so much for all of us          May 25th  2006   Washington  DC   Today Senator John Thune joined members of the Senate Committees on Veterans  Affairs  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs at a joint hearing on the recent ID theft of more than twenty six million veterans  Senator Thune is a member of the Senate Committee on Veterans  Affairs  Please find below Senator Thune s opening statement from today s hearing   Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this emergency hearing to review the theft of the personal information of millions of our veterans earlier this month   I would also like to thank Secretary Nicholson for appearing today to answer questions about this very serious breach of security   Mr  Chairman  I share your commitment to understanding all the facts of this case before taking action  and I hope this hearing will generate more light than heat   Having said that  this breach of information security at the VA is causing a lot of anxiety among our veterans  and they are rightfully demanding that we act quickly on this issue   I have many veterans in my state who are justifiably concerned about identity theft  and they deserve to have peace of mind about their privacy   That s why we must work quickly to learn all the relevant facts and then take appropriate action     In the short term  we must learn the exact proportions of this problem  and then develop a proportionate remedy   However  as policymakers  we are also responsible for looking at the bigger picture  and analyzing what can be done to prevent this sort of thing from happening again   We must search for a long term solution to ensure the security of information at the VA  and I believe this can be achieved by adopting a centralized information technology management system at the VA     As our panelists today no doubt are aware  the VA s Office of Inspector General s most recent strategic plan indicated that one of its strategic goals was in the area of information management   The strategic plan noted that one of the many challenges the VA faces is the privacy of and security of the information it manages   The strategic plan further states that  information systems security has been identified as a material weakness as early as 1998  within the VA   Then there is this key passage found on page 58 of the Inspector General s Strategic Plan for fiscal years 2005 2010    The potential vulnerability of Federal information systems cannot be overestimated  Presently  VA systems are not protected from unauthorized access  Risks of potential disclosure or loss of sensitive data  fraudulent claims  and disruption of critical activities remain  Security over VA IT resources needs to assure that only authorized users access VA resources and only authorized use is made of VA resources  Legal requirements such as the Privacy Act  the Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002  FISMA   and the Health Information Portability and Accountability Act of 1996  HIPAA   impose detailed duties on VA to protect sensitive medical and personal information it maintains on veterans  their families  and its employees     Clearly  what the Inspector General was worried about in terms of information security has now become a reality that we must deal with   I believe that this event occurred at least in part because many of the VA s IT systems are compartmentalized within the VA s three administrations  Health  Benefits  and Cemeteries   and there is not a uniform policy in terms of information security across the entire VA   That is why I introduced a bill last fall to improve the management of information technology within the VA   My bill would provide for the VA s Chief Information Officer  CIO  to have authority over resources  budget  and personnel related to the support function of information technology   An identical version of this bill passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 408 to 0     As we search for long term solutions  I hope my colleagues will consider my bill  S  2001  the VA Information Technology Management Improvement Act  as a reform measure that will help prevent this kind of security breach from ever happening again    In conclusion  Mr  Chairman  we are here to understand the entire context of the situation we are faced with  and then to work on short term and long term solutions   We must do all we can to ensure the privacy of our veterans  who have sacrificed so much for all of us   Thank you again  Mr  Chairman  for holding this important hearing    The VA has set up a manned call center that veterans can call to get information about this situation and learn more about consumer identity protections  The toll free number is 1 800 FED INFO                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
