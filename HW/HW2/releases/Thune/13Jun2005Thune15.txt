     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      THUNE  SNOWE DEMAND PENTAGON IMPLEMENT BRAC RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY AFTER CONGRESSIONAL APPROVAL  ALLOW PERSONNEL TO TESTIFY           June 13th  2005   Washington  D C    With the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission having barely begun its work reviewing the Pentagon  s BRAC recommendations  U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  R ME  and John Thune  R SD  are making sure the Department of Defense  DoD  does not attempt to get a head start on implementing its recommendations or prevent any member of the armed forces or civilian employee from testifying before the Commission   In a letter to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  Snowe and Thune asked for his assurance that DoD not preemptively identify or carry out any permanent transfer of activities or personnel from any installation identified by the Department for possible closure or realignment prior to Congressional consideration of the final list   The Senators also called on Secretary Rumsfeld to permit any member of the Armed Forces to freely testify before the Commission as to the military value of any military installation  and asked that no member of the Armed Forces who does so be punished in any way       I believe it is absolutely imperative that the Department of Defense not attempt to get a head start on closing and realigning bases across the country before this process has come to an end     said Snowe     In the interest of maintaining an open process and making sure the BRAC Commissioners receive all the information they need  it is also of paramount importance that all members of the Armed Services or civilian employees be able to freely provide information requested by the Commission without fear of reprisal              The Defense Department must respect the BRAC process and not prematurely begin to realign or shift missions from any base before that process has run its course     said Thune     It would be perceived as a slap to the Commission and all the Communities who intend to defend their installations if the Pentagon opts to treat their recommendations as foregone conclusions  Likewise  the BRAC Commissioners should be able to ask questions and receive a free response from servicemen and women during their site visits and hearings to ensure they hear views of actual military operators on the installations    not just budget analysts working from within the Pentagon                  Following is the full text of the letter   Dear Mr  Secretary   As you know  we are currently reviewing the information supporting your recommendations to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission  and we will be presenting information to the Commission in connection with installations in our states that we believe have mistakenly been included in your proposed list for closure or realignment     In connection with that effort  we request your assurance that there will be no effort by the Department of Defense to preemptively identify or carry out any permanent transfer of activities or personnel from any installation identified by the Department for possible closure or realignment prior to Congressional consideration of the final list of BRAC recommendations  except for reasons of national security or a military emergency  as required by Section 2909 of the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act   To enable the BRAC Commission to obtain authoritative information regarding decisions on military value taken by the Department in connection with its recommendations  we request that you permit any member of the Armed Forces to freely answer questions and or provide to the Commission testimony as to the military value of any military installation for purposes of the Commission  s consideration of the Secretary  s recommendations   Further  we seek your assurance that no member of the Armed Forces may be discharged  demoted  suspended  threatened  harassed  or in any other manner discriminated against because such member provided  caused to be provided  or is about to provide testimony or other information to the Commission   Finally  we ask that these same assurances be provided with respect to civilian employees at military installations   Thank you for your attention to this matter                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
