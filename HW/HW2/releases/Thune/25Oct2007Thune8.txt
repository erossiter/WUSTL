Good for South Dakota Thune s Provisions and Amendments Adopted by Senate Agriculture Committee         October 25th  2007   Washington  D C    Today the Senate Agriculture Committee continued its work on the 2007 Farm Bill  Senator Thune  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  successfully persuaded his Senate Agriculture Committee colleagues to include every one of his proposals and amendments in the bill    Every one of my amendments adopted by the Committee makes this farm bill better for all South Dakotans  The 2007 Farm Bill is critically important to the future of South Dakota s family farms and South Dakota s agriculture dependent economy   said Thune   This bill builds on the success of the 2002 Farm Bill I helped draft with serving on the House Agriculture Committee  and should continue to move South Dakota s food  fiber and now fuel producers forward    The following is a list of Senator Thune s amendments that were adopted by the Senate Agriculture Committee during consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill  FSA Office Closure Amendment Thune s amendment would prevent the closing of  Critical Access FSA County Offices   Critical Access FSA County Offices are defined as county FSA offices that were proposed for closure during Calendar Year 2007  Offices that were proposed for closure during 2007 and are in close proximity of another FSA office  or have zero full time equivalent employees would still be allowed to close under this amendment  Critical Access FSA County Offices would remain open for the life of the 2007 Farm Bill  five years  unless Congress approves of the closures  The House passed Farm Bill includes a 1 year moratorium on all FSA office closures with the exception of those offices with zero employees  Loan Deficiency Payments Amendment Senator Thune s amendment preserves a critical component of the family farm safety net  In particular  this amendment removed a potentially harmful requirement in the Committee s bill that would negatively affect all grain producers by requiring that they sell their crop at the time of claiming an LDP  By establishing this new requirement  producers would have lost a valuable marketing tool that allows them to sell their crops in response to market signals  not according to government rules  After an intense debate with USDA representatives and Members of the Senate Agriculture Committee in which Senator Thune successfully defended America s agriculture producers  Senator Thune s amendment was accepted by the full committee  E10 Blend Wall Amendment Senator Thune s amendment is a  Sense of the Senate  Resolution that describes the importance of intermediate blends of ethanol in non flex fuel vehicles  More importantly  this amendment directs the U S  Department of Agriculture to work with the Department of Transportation  Department of Energy  and Environmental Protection Agency in approving higher blends of ethanol fuel within one year of the successful completion of all necessary parts compatibility and environmental studies   This resolution also directs the U S  Department of Agriculture to conduct a study on the rural economic impacts of the E10 blend wall and of increasing the demand for ethanol in general  This study would examine the impact on rural economic activity and job creation if the demand for ethanol is constrained to the E10 blend market and E85 infrastructure and transportation infrastructure continues to expand at current pace  The study would be submitted to the U S  Senate Agriculture Committee within 180 days after the enactment of this bill  Native American Nutrition Tribal Assistance Amendment This amendment would authorize  5 million per year  for the life of the 2007 Farm Bill  for the purchase and distribution of traditional  locally grown food produced by Native American farmers  ranchers and producers  The following is a list of Senator Thune s other provisions that were included in the Committee s base bill  Biofuels Innovation Program Last May  Senator Thune introduced a bipartisan first of its kind program to provide producer incentives for growing energy dedicated crops like switchgrass and fast growing trees  in conjunction with the construction of nearby biorefineries  This program would provide a cost share payment and per acre rental payment to producers who have committed to growing energy dedicated crops for a local biorefinery  This program would also provide a per ton payment to farmers for collecting  storing  and transporting biomass  such as corn cobs  to cellulosic ethanol plants  In total  this program will provide almost  160 million to producers to jumpstart the cellulosic ethanol industry  The per ton payment alone would incentivize almost 60 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production  Senator Thune s biofuels bill  which provides incentives and tools to encourage sustainable and rapid development of cellulosic ethanol  is the nucleus of both the House passed farm bill and now the Senate version  Above all  this program will help to jumpstart the next generation of our nation s ethanol production which will less our dependence on foreign sources of oil  Stronger Mandatory COOL Language On October 3  2007  Senator Thune requested that the House passed COOL language be strengthened to clarify that all categories of red meat are required to be labeled  At Senator Thune s request  the Agriculture Committee s bill corrected a potentially fatal flaw to the House passed COOL provisions that will make implementing mandatory COOL clear  concise  and beyond legal challenge  Thanks to Senator Thune s efforts on the Senate Agriculture Committee  the implementation of mandatory COOL will be clear  concise  and beyond legal challenge  Sun Grant Initiative The Agriculture Committee s bill includes  25 million in mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  which is coordinated by South Dakota State University  For months  Senator Thune has been working with members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to underscore the important renewable fuels research taking place at South Dakota State University and four other Universities across the country through the Sun Grant Initiative  This provision would provide much needed mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  while reauthorizing this program through the life of the farm bill  Under the Senate 2007 Farm Bill  the Sun Grant Initiative would also be authorized for annual appropriations up to  70 million per year through 2012  The House passed bill includes  0 of mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  Conservation The Committee s bill includes continuing in this farm bill with the 39 2 million acre Conservation Reserve Program  CRP  cap Senator Thune fought for when he helped draft the 2002 Farm Bill  Several of Senator Thune s recommendations to strengthen and reauthorize the Wetlands Reserve Program and Grasslands Reserve Program were included in the Committee s Conservation Title  Stronger Sodsaver Provision After months of working with the Senate Agriculture Committee  Senator Thune was successful in including a common sense sodsaver provision  This provision would not allow crop insurance and NAP coverage for crops planted on native sod  Between 2002 and 2005  almost 300 000 acres of native sod in South Dakota was converted from native grassland to cropland  The House passed farm bill only applies to crop insurance eligibility for four years after native sod is converted to cropland  Expanded Tribal Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program At Senator Thune s request  the Agriculture Committee s bill expands the successful Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program to a minimum of 100 Indian Tribal Organizations across the country  Although the House passed bill expanded the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program nationwide  it did not expand access to Indian Reservations  The Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program was started in the 2002 Farm Bill as a pilot program   Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was chosen as one of three reservations to participate in the pilot program  Thanks to Senator Thune s efforts this program will be expanded to over 100 Indian Reservations nationwide  Open Fields Legislation In May  Senator Thune joined a bipartisan group of Senators in cosponsoring in the Open Fields Act  For the first time ever  federal funding   20 million per year  will be available to expand the already successful walk in program in South Dakota and in other states  South Dakota landowners have voluntarily enrolled more than 1 million acres of privately owned land in South Dakota s program  Included in the Open Fields language is a provision Senator Thune championed which will give states like South Dakota that publicize their access areas a priority for the  20 million  Committee consideration of the Senate Farm Bill continues this morning and is expected to wrap up later today                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
