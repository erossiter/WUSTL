Introduce Measure to Greatly Increase Availability of Alternative Fuels for American Consumers Bill Incentivizes Installation of Alternative Fuel Tanks Across the Country         April 7th  2006   Washington  DC   Senators John Thune  R SD  and Barack Obama  D IL  today introduced S  2614  the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006   The bill would provide incentives for gas station owners across the country to install alternative fuel tanks  giving consumers greater opportunities to opt for cleaner  more environment friendly fuels such as those containing ethanol  compressed natural gas or bio diesel  in an effort to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil     Today s legislation would provide gas station owners with a reimbursement for 30 percent of the costs  not to exceed  30 000  for the replacement of a petroleum tank or the addition of an alternative fuel tank  It would allow station owners to receive reimbursement for up to two tanks per facility  unlike the existing tax credit that is currently available only once per owner     As automakers continue to manufacture an increasing number of Flex Fuel Vehicles  FFVs   there is a significant need for more refueling sites across the country   Currently  of the 180 000 gas stations across the country  less than 1 percent of those stations  600   offer alternative fuels such as E 85   Encouraging gas station owners to install alternative refueling systems will give more American consumers the ability to refuel their vehicles with alternative fuels that are better for the environment and our nation s security    As the vulnerability of our overdependence on foreign oil becomes a top concern for American consumers who are paying high gasoline prices  our nation needs to shift its focus to alternative sources of energy to meet our energy needs   said Thune   The Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 we ve introduced today would greatly increase the availability of alternative fuels  such as E 85  compressed natural gas  and bio diesel  allowing more American consumers to fill up using cleaner  more cost effective fuels that are better for the environment and made here in America    I m confident that as the demand for alternative fuels continues to grow  gas station owners across the country will be quick to take advantage of the reimbursement this legislation provides and begin installing additional alternative fuel tanks to give their consumers greater options that lessen our dependence on foreign oil  This will also greatly benefit farmers in rural states like South Dakota and Illinois and create American jobs in the growing alternative fuels industry      Both Democrats and Republicans agree that we need to get serious about our energy problems and realize that our national security and economic competitiveness in the world is at stake   said Senator Obama   Increasing availability of renewable fuels is a crucial part of ultimately reducing our dependence on foreign oil and putting America s energy future back in our hands  which is why I am pleased to join Senator Thune in this effort    Provisions of the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006    Expands the eligible uses of the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program  LUST  to reimburse gas station owners who replace and or add new alternative fuel storage tanks  such as E 85  Compressed Natural Gas  Natural Gas  Liquefied Natural Gas  Liquefied Petroleum Gas  and Hydrogen  or other alternative fuels as defined by the Environmental Protection Agency  Provides gas station owners with a  reimbursement for 30 percent of the costs  not to exceed  30 000  of replacing a petroleum tank with or adding an alternative fuel tank   Allows gas station owners to receive reimbursement for up to two tanks per facility  unlike the tax credit that is currently only available once per gas station owner   Reduces dependency on foreign sources of oil by placing the necessary infrastructure around the country to allow consumers to purchase alternative fueled vehicles   Reduces the overall number of petroleum tanks  which can cause leaks of contaminants that impact public health and drinking water sources  Increases the availability of ethanol  E 85  and other alternative fuels  and  In no way reduces existing environmental safeguards and legal obligations of gas station owners     Below  please find Senator Thune s floor statement on the introduction of the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006        Remarks of Sen  John Thune Introduction of S  2614  the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 April 7 2006  Mr  President  I rise today to introduce legislation along with my colleague from Illinois  Senator OBAMA  concerning what we believe is yet another important step in reducing our Nation s dependence on petroleum fuels       S  264  the Alternative Energy Refueling System Act of 2006 would provide an incentive for gas station owners across the country to install alternative refueling systems for automobiles  This legislation builds upon the existing tax credit that gas station owners can receive for installing alternative energy tanks  Most importantly  I would like to point out to my colleagues that this legislation does not require any additional taxes       Currently  as a result of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  a tax credit of up to  30 000 is available through 2009 for gas station owners who install an alternative refueling system   Eligible alternative fuels include those that contain 85 percent by volume of ethanol  natural gas  compressed natural gas  liquefied natural gas  liquefied petroleum gas  hydrogen  or any mixture of biodiesel or diesel fuel that is composed of at least 20 percent biodiesel       Our legislation basically allows gas station owners and operators to be reimbursed for 30 percent of the costs  not to exceed  30 000  of installing an alternative energy system        One of the primary benefits of this legislation is that it can be used for up to two alternative refueling systems per gas station  This is important because under the tax credit that was part of last year s energy bill  a gas station owner can only utilize the  30 000 tax credit one time  even for those individuals who own multiple refueling stations       For example  if a gas station owner in South Dakota  Illinois  or elsewhere wanted to install three new alternative refueling systems at his or her gas station  under the current system that owner would be limited to the  30 000 tax credit for a single alternative fuel system        Under our legislation  that same gas station owner would continue to receive the tax credit for the first alternative fuel system   However  the station owner could also be reimbursed for 30 percent of the costs  not to exceed  30 000  for up to two additional alternative refueling systems  Therefore  the legislation we have introduced today would drastically increase the incentives for gas station owners to install additional alternative fuel systems       I am hopeful that if this bill is signed into law  gas station owners across the country will be able to use this reimbursement mechanism to help consumers who already own or are thinking of purchasing an alternative fuel vehicle       Senator OBAMA and I are both strong supporters of alternative fuels  In fact  South Dakota and Illinois are leaders in the production of ethanol  our Nation s leading renewable fuel  The legislation we are introducing today in no way preferences ethanol over other alternative fuels  In fact  they are all treated equally under our bill       Alternative fuels such as E 85  which is composed of 85 percent ethanol  are starting to gain popularity  However  while automakers such as Ford and General Motors are producing an increasing number of flex fuel vehicles  which can run on either E 85 or gasoline  there is a critical need for more alternative refueling sites across the country  Many individuals would be shocked to know that of the 180 000 gas stations across the country  only 600  far less than 1 percent  offer alternative fuels such as E 85       There are approximately 5 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road today  The addition of alternative refueling systems  such as E 85  compressed natural gas  biodiesel  and hydrogen  will allow American consumers the ability to refuel their vehicles with alternative fuels that are better for both the environment and our Nation s security       As President Bush noted in his State of the Union Address earlier this year    America is addicted to oil  which is often imported from unstable parts of the world    Since being elected to Congress I have worked hard in promoting the development of alternative energy sources  In fact  last year s energy bill marked an important milestone due to the 7 5 billion gallon renewable fuels standard that I and others advocated       S  2614 utilizes the interest earned from the Leaking Underground Storage Tank Trust Fund  which currently has a  2 6 billion surplus  to reimburse eligible gas station owners who add alternative refueling systems       This trust fund continues to grow from a portion of the Federal gas tax  one tenth of a cent per gallon  which amounted to roughly  190 million last year  The fund also continues to grow from the interest that is earned on the balance of the fund  which amounted to roughly  67 million in 2005       I firmly believe that the Leaking Underground Storage Tank program serves an important function in keeping our land and water safe from storage tank releases  Our legislation simply seeks to use a portion of the interest earned annually to reimburse gas station owners for a portion of the costs associated with the installation of new alternative refueling systems       An added benefit of using a portion of the interest from this trust fund is that the installation of alternative refueling systems reduces the overall number of petroleum tanks that can cause leaks       Additionally  this bill ensures that States are not required to use their annual allocation of appropriated funding to reimburse gas station owners for the installation of alternative refueling systems  Such reimbursement would come directly from the EPA Administrator       Mr  President  this bill would help to lessen our Nation s dependence on foreign sources of oil and  increase the use of alternative fuels  It is a step in the right direction  and is something I hope my colleagues will support                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
