     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Senator Thune introduces bipartisan bill to delay BRAC          May 18th  2005   Washington  D C    Legislation introduced today by Sen  John Thune  R SD  would delay the current Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  round  The legislation would delay the process until most troops return from Iraq  a complete analysis is conducted on overseas facility requirements and several pending reports are released and their impact on BRAC is determined  including two Homeland Security related reports and the Pentagon  s long term planning document  the Quadrennial Defense Review  The bipartisan bill would  in effect  nullify the base closings recommended by the Pentagon on May 13     It doesn  t make sense to close bases now     Thune said    Given the permanence of base closings  the Pentagon should take the time to review the recommendations of the QDR and other reports first  We need to slow down the process and fully understand the military  s long term needs  Furthermore  we should not be undertaking massive BRAC realignments and closures while we are engaged in a war   This bill will correct what I believe to be a grave error by the Pentagon      A bipartisan group of senators is co sponsoring the legislation  including Senators Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Susan Collins  R ME   Pete Domenici  R NM   Judd Gregg  R NH   Tim Johnson  D SD   Trent Lott  R MS   Lisa Murkowski  R AK   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Ted Stevens  R AK  and John Sununu  R NH      Senators from Maine to Alaska are standing united against the Pentagon  s premature plans to close military bases     Thune said    The Pentagon  s recommendations got a very cold reception in Congress  It  s common sense to wait for the Overseas BRAC and QDR before we move forward      The Quadrennial Defense Review Report is due to be released early next year   The QDR is a comprehensive examination of America  s future defense needs  including potential threats  force structure  strategy  defense infrastructure  and other elements of the defense program  The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States    Overseas BRAC    or   Overseas Basing Commission     was established in 2003 to provide Congress and the President with a thorough study and review of U S  military structure and facilities overseas  The Commission publicly released its report earlier last week  but no action has been taken   The legislation would also stop the BRAC from moving forward until the implementation and development by the Secretaries of Defense and Homeland Security of the National Maritime Security Strategy and the completion and implementation of the Secretary of Defense  s Homeland Defense and Civil Support Directive    only now being drafted  These two planning strategies should be key considerations before beginning any BRAC process                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
