Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Sends Bipartisan Letter to President Urging Higher Ethanol Blends          October 31st  2007   Washington  D C    Senator Thune led a bi partisan group of Senators in writing a letter to the President urging him to direct the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  to approve higher blends of ethanol in commercial gasoline  The current maximum blend for non flex fuel vehicles is 10  ethanol    The current 10  standard  or blend wall  will soon impact production capacity and could be very harmful to the ethanol industry in South Dakota and across the country   said Thune   By increasing the percentage of ethanol in gasoline  we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of energy and make renewable fuels a key component of our nation s energy policy    Over the past months  Senator Thune has met with the President and a number of Administration officials to highlight the urgency of this situation  Additionally  Senator Thune successfully inserted into the Senate 2007 Farm Bill a study of the E10 blend wall and a  Sense of the Senate  resolution directing the federal government to approve higher blends of ethanol after the successful completion of the appropriate drivability and environmental studies    Senator Thune has taken an active role with both the Farm Bill and the Energy Bill to expand the market for domestic ethanol  The total market demand for E10 ethanol is expected to be 12 to 14 billion gallons  Current U S  ethanol production capacity totals approximately 6 8 billion gallons per year  Ethanol plants currently under construction or expansion will double this figure in the next 18 to 24 months  creating a need for higher blends of ethanol in the near future        The text of the letter follows    President George W  Bush The White House Washington  DC 20500  Dear Mr  President   We write to you regarding the future of our nation s renewable energy sector   In particular  we want to bring your attention to the very real barriers that exist to greater use of alternative fuels by the general motoring public   Without your assistance  we feel that a great opportunity will be missed to reduce our nation s dependence on foreign sources of energy    We recognize and thank you for your strong leadership in promoting renewable fuels as a key component of our nation s energy policy   Your leadership  coupled with significant legislative accomplishments in Congress and historic private sector innovation and investment  has created a strong and growing renewable fuels industry that is creating jobs throughout America and strengthening our nation s energy security     Current U S  ethanol production capacity totals approximately 6 8 billion gallons per year   Ethanol plants currently under construction or expansion will double this figure by adding almost 6 7 billion gallons of capacity in the next 18 to 24 months  for a total of roughly 13 5 billion gallons   Additionally  you have called for and the Senate has acted upon a higher Renewable Fuels Standard in the recently passed Energy bill that would require 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel in the coming years   As additional production comes on line  the U S  ethanol industry is increasingly mindful about the short term market demand for ethanol   Domestic ethanol production is quickly approaching the maximum market demand for E10  10 percent ethanol and 90 percent gasoline   which is projected to be 12 to 14 billion gallons of ethanol per year   At this production level  the blend market for ethanol will become fully supplied   While it is difficult to predict precisely when the ethanol industry will saturate the blend market and hit the  E10 Blend Wall   the federal government must now begin the testing process to approve higher ethanol blends and ensure that demand for ethanol keeps pace with industry expansion   If we fail to act now  excess production capacity could have harmful effects on the overall ethanol industry   not to mention a missed opportunity to further reduce our current dependence on foreign sources of energy    In addition to an increased Renewable Fuels Standard  Congress and the Administration must work together with the ethanol  automotive  and small engine industries to begin the process of approving intermediate blends of ethanol blended gasoline for non flex fuel vehicles   Upon the successful completion of the appropriate emissions  drivability  and compatibility tests in variable climate conditions  we ask that you direct the Environmental Protection Agency to approve appropriate higher blends of ethanol  such as E15  E20  and E30  in a safe and timely manner following all required scientifically based testing  and in conjunction and coordination with other relevant federal agencies and private sector industries   We thank you for your time and consideration of this request and for your continued support for America s renewable fuels industry                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
