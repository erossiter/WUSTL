to Begin Preparing for Upgrade to E20          March 12th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune recently sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  Administrator Stephen L  Johnson urging the EPA to begin preparations for an expeditious review of an application to approve the use of E 20  20 percent ethanol and 80 percent gasoline  in automobiles  Presently  roughly half of all gasoline sold in the United States includes 10 percent ethanol   Senator Thune made the following comments       Conditions are ripe for the next big step forward in bolstering America  s energy independence   After several years of success  it is time for the federal government to prepare for the production and use of a new blend of ethanol  E 20   I have requested that EPA begin preparing for certification of the E 20 ethanol blend for use in automobiles       With approval of gasoline with a higher percentage of ethanol that American consumers can safely use in all types of vehicles  we can expand and ensure the market for ethanol and further reduce America  s dependence on foreign sources of energy  I  m hopeful that the EPA will move forward on my request and begin preparing for this upgrade       Moving forward in certifying the use of E 20 also paves the way for the future production and use of cellulosic ethanol to flow seamlessly into the marketplace     Lisa Richardson  Executive Director of the South Dakota Corn Growers Association  made the following statement      Senator Thune is on the money on this one   The greatest threat facing our industry is market access   It is critical that we have the ability in the Midwest to use a higher blend     said Richardson    Senator Thune currently serves as the ranking member of the Energy Subcommittee of the Senate Agriculture Committee   Full text of the letter below    March 9  2007  Stephen L  Johnson Administrator U S  Environmental Protection Agency 1200 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington  DC  20460  Dear Administrator Johnson    I write to bring your attention to an issue that will be before the Environmental Protection Agency  EPA  in the near future which will have a major impact on our nation  s growing biofuels industry   As you are aware  ethanol and other renewable fuels are breathing new life into rural communities across our nation   The rapid increase of ethanol production is also offsetting the need of oil imports from unstable regions of the world  thereby strengthening our nation  s energy security   Both from a rural economic development and national security perspective  it is critical that our developing biofuels industry continues its steady growth over the remainder of this decade and beyond    The need for fuel with a higher ratio of ethanol to gasoline is growing by the day   Flex fuel vehicle production is increasing  and I continue to work with my colleagues in the Senate to expand the availability of E85 pumps at the retail level   However  the actualization of E85 capable vehicle production and E85 availability is not expected to keep pace with the rapid expansion of domestic ethanol production   According to the Congressional Research Service  approximately 99  of domestically consumed ethanol is E10 or blends of gasoline with up to 10  ethanol    while only one percent is consumed as E85    Recently  Guy Caruso  Administrator of the Energy Information Administration  in testimony before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee  stated that the supply of ethanol will soon exceed the demand because refiners primarily blend E10 for use in automobiles   Similar concerns have been expressed by industry leaders in my state who are concerned that we will hit an   E10 Wall    in the next two to three years if gasoline with a higher ratio of ethanol is not timely approved and made available to consumers   In the coming months  I understand the EPA will receive a waiver request from the state of Minnesota asking that the EPA approve the use of E20 in automobiles   Pursuant to section 211 of the Clean Air Act  EPA has limited time to act on such an application   Given the importance of this impending request  and the required analysis involved to ensure that E20 does not impair the emissions control systems of vehicles  I urge the EPA to begin preparations now by reviewing any and all issues associated with such a waiver application   In the event you become aware of any legislative hurdles that may need to be addressed in this process  I ask that you inform my office as soon as possible    In summary  the President has made a historic commitment to ethanol production by calling for 35 billion gallons of alternative fuel by 2017   I believe this goal  while ambitious  is achievable if we have the courage to continue to grow our nation  s biofuels industry   By approving higher grades of ethanol blended gasoline for use in non flex fuel vehicles  the EPA can ensure a viable market for ethanol  give consumers greater choice of transportation motor fuels  and ensure that our ethanol industry does not hit the   E10 Wall    as automakers and consumers transition away from traditional fossil fuels    Thank you for your consideration regarding this matter and please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any additional questions                                                               Kindest regards                                                               JOHN THUNE                                                             United States Senate
