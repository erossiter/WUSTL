Omnibus Appropriations Bill          December 18th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune issued the following statement after the Senate approved the FY 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill  This bill contains several requests Senator Thune made on behalf of South Dakota   The Democrat led Congress has been far behind in completing action on the annual appropriations bills   Despite the fact that the new fiscal year began on October 1  2007  only one of the twelve annual appropriations bills have been sent to the President and signed into law   Due to this delay  Congress has been forced to fund all federal agencies with three short term funding measures   the latest of which expires on December 21st      While it is regrettable that Congressional gridlock forced us to pass eleven of the twelve appropriations bills at once without proper debate and scrutiny  there are many important provisions in this bill which will spur economic growth across South Dakota   said Thune   Whether
