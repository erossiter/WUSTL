     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Senate moves closer to passing higher ethanol requirements Thune fights for 8 billion gallon RFS in new Energy Bill         June 14th  2005   Washington  D C    The U S  Senate began debate on the long stalled energy bill today  moving closer to establishing a renewable fuels standard  RFS  and reducing America  s dependence on foreign sources of oil    As debate began  Senate Energy Committee Chairman Pete Domenici introduced an amendment on behalf of Senator John Thune to establish an 8 billion gallon renewable fuels standard    dramatically increasing America  s reliance on ethanol  Thune said the energy bill would not be possible without the leadership of Domenici and Senate Environment and Public Works Committee Chairman James Inhofe     Passing the energy bill will dramatically increase ethanol demand  guaranteeing a good market for South Dakota farmers     Thune said    The Senate is poised to make ethanol a cornerstone of America  s energy policy  I hope we can move quickly to send a final bill to the President  s desk and strengthen America  s energy security  I am proud to work with the Chairmen Domenici and Inhofe to promote renewable fuels and strengthen our energy security      If the Senate agrees to Thune  s amendment  the 8 billion renewable fuels standard would displace as much as 2 billion barrels of imported crude oil  lower the U S  trade deficit by  67 billion  create  51 billion in new farm income and cut government farm payments by an estimated  5 9 billion    all by 2012      The energy policy will create new jobs and invigorate South Dakota  s economy     Thune said    An energy policy won  t just make it easier to fuel our cars  tractors and homes    it will fuel our nation  s economy      The renewable fuels standard would also function as a rural economic stimulus package by creating the need for  5 3 billion in new investments  while generating 230 000 new rural jobs  It is estimated that  overall  a new energy policy would create as many as 800 000 new jobs for Americans   In his campaign for the U S  Senate last year  Thune cited the gridlocked energy package as a primary reason for entering the race  President Bush proposed a comprehensive energy policy shortly after taking office in 2001  but was blocked in the U S  Senate for the last four years     America needed an energy policy four years ago    and we need an energy policy even more today     Thune said    We came here to get things done and at the top of our list was passing an energy policy  This will be a great accomplishment that will create new jobs and strengthen America  s security                                                                                                                                                    SR 493
