     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Comments on Modifications to FSA Office Closing Plans Bottom Up Streamlining Still Unacceptable         July 12th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator Thune made the following comments today after South Dakota Farm Service Agency  FSA  State Executive Director Steve Cutler announced changes to the initial FSA county office streamlining and closing plan proposed earlier this year    I have heard from hundreds of South Dakotans regarding the plan to close and consolidate FSA offices across the state   said Thune   While I strongly support and encourage finding cost savings and improving efficiencies at every level of government  they should be initiated from the top down  not the bottom up    Senator Thune introduced S  944  legislation that would stop any potential FSA county office closures until the U S  Secretary of Agriculture conducts a study on cost savings and or efficiencies at the three FSA headquarters locations and all state FSA offices  Additionally  this legislation requires that the report recommendations must be implemented at all FSA headquarters and state offices before any county FSA offices may be closed    The modified South Dakota FSA county office closure plan released this morning was announced with no public statement that FSA will conduct a study or implement a formal plan to improve efficiencies at any FSA Headquarters locations  I find FSA s business and streamlining plan still unacceptable  simply because it begins rather than ends at the local level  I believe our farmers  ranchers  and local employees would be much more accepting of suggested changes at the county office level if they knew all FSA headquarters offices were undergoing the same degree of scrutiny and modifications to improve their operational efficiencies    Cutler modified the original plan for office consolidations and closings which now consists of closing four South Dakota county FSA offices  The current plan no longer includes the initial proposal to consolidate of the Mellette and Jones County offices  and no longer includes transferring administration of services from Todd County  which has no office  to Tripp County  Mellette and Jones County offices are proposed to operate under a shared management plan  Todd County producers will continue being served by the Mellette County office under the current proposal   The newly proposed plan still calls for the consolidations of Campbell County to Walworth County  Hyde County to Hand County  Sanborn County to Jerauld County  and Jackson County to Haakon County                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
