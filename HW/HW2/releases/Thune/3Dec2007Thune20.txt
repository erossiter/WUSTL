Successful USDA Agrees to Livestock Disaster Program Change More South Dakota Livestock Producers Now Eligible for Disaster Assistance         December 3rd  2007   Washington  D C    Acting U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Secretary Chuck Conner has informed U S  Senator John Thune that the USDA would immediately modify an eligibility requirement for the Livestock Compensation Program  LCP   This policy change will make additional livestock eligible for disaster assistance   Last week Senator John Thune sent a bipartisan letter  attached  signed by 24 U S  Senators to Acting Secretary Conner requesting that the USDA make changes to LCP eligibility requirements to ensure that livestock producers who suffered legitimate feed losses were not arbitrarily excluded from receiving assistance   A high percentage of South Dakota livestock operations occur in more than one county   USDA initially informed livestock producers who were applying for LCP assistance that livestock were required to be located in a disaster county on the first day of the disaster  in order to prove qualifying feed losses       The USDA s original rule meant that a cattle producer who wintered his livestock in Jones County  but owned or leased pasture in Jackson County  was not allowed to use the pasture loss in Jackson County to show a required feed loss  making that producer ineligible for LCP   said Thune   This requirement made no sense whatsoever for thousands of livestock producers in South Dakota and most other Western grazing states    Acting Secretary Conner told Senator Thune that as a result of his letter  state and county Farm Service Agency  FSA  offices had been informed via a teleconference call that they should immediately begin approving losses from the entire livestock operation  even if it covered multiple counties and the eligible livestock were located in only one county on the first day of the disaster period    The intent of Congress is that livestock producers who have waited more than two years in some cases for livestock assistance not be unduly burdened by eligibility requirements that would result in denying them much needed assistance   Thune commented   I am pleased that USDA made this policy change which was foremost on our list in last week s letter signed by 23 of my Senate colleagues  I will continue to work with USDA on other implementation policies to ensure that South Dakota livestock producers receive their long awaited disaster assistance     Senator Thune has been working throughout the year to ensure that USDA is correctly administering the  3 2 billion disaster assistance that Congress passed this spring  For instance  this summer Senator Thune introduced a bill  S  1716  that was passed by both the U S  Senate and House and signed into law by the President  This particular bill struck a provision of the disaster statute  which according to USDA s interpretation would have required all livestock producers to have purchased forage insurance in order to qualify for livestock disaster assistance  Fewer than 15 percent of the nation s livestock producers had purchased the ineffective Non insured Assistance Program insurance  which was the only insurance available  nationwide  Thune s legislative fix was especially important to South Dakota producers due to the multiyear drought that has impacted our region  Senator Thune also introduced legislation  S  2012  this summer  which would extend crop and livestock disaster assistance to cover losses that occur through the end of calendar year 2007  The current statute covers natural disaster losses only through February 28  2007     November 28  2007  The Honorable Chuck Conner Acting Secretary of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue Southwest Washington  DC 20250  Dear Acting Secretary Conner   The purpose of this letter is to express our concern regarding implementation of the Livestock Compensation Program  LCP  authorized by P L  110 28  The U S  Troop Readiness  Veterans  Care  Katrina Recovery  and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act of 2007   According to current LCP procedure the Farm Service Agency  FSA  has issued for the purpose of conducting sign up  the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  has made livestock eligibility and other policy determinations which very clearly are not in accordance with the intent of Congress   We are disappointed that the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  has chosen to effectuate very restrictive  unnecessary  and administratively cumbersome LCP implementation policies that would result in producer ineligibility for millions of dollars authorized by Congress under P L  110 28 to assist producers who suffered legitimate livestock losses in 2005  2006  and part of 2007   We find this current USDA LCP policy unacceptable   Three issues of concern regarding LCP implementation have been brought to our attention  Livestock ineligibility due to livestock not being physically located in a declared or contiguous county after the beginning date of the eligible disaster  Attachment 1  Issue  1   and Livestock physically located in a declared or contiguous county on the beginning date of the disaster  but determined ineligible due to USDA perceived producer intent as to the disposition of the livestock  Attachment 1 Issue  2    Reduction in payment amount due to the FSA County Committee setting inaccurate maximum loss caps   The statute  P L  108 28  specifically outlines the intent of Congress for USDA to implement the LCP for 2005  2006  and 2007 losses   Section 9002 provides that the Secretary shall   carry out the livestock compensation program established under part 1416 of title 7  Code of Federal Regulations  as announced by the Secretary on February 12  2007  72 Fed  Reg  6444     The statutory mandate is for USDA to carry out a livestock compensation program  LCP   not in the  same manner  as is the mandate   for the crop disaster assistance   which references 2001 statute  because the LCP referenced in 7 CFR part 1416 included specific requirements that applied only to hurricane related damages and losses   The damages and losses that Congress intended to be covered under the LCP authorized under P L  108 28 are for multiple natural disasters  predominately long term drought   The following statutory guidelines provided in P L  110 28 govern administration of LCP   The last sentence of Section 9002  a  1  provides   In addition  section 1416 102 b  2  ii  of Title 7  Code of Federal Regulations  72 Fed  Reg  6444  shall not apply   Section 1416 102 b  2  ii  of title 7 of Code of Federal Regulations  72 Fed  Reg  6444  provides     b  To be considered an eligible livestock producer  a producer must have   2  suffered a loss of feed   ii  the value of such loss  as determined by CCC  equals or exceeds the amount calculated according to  Sec  1416 104 a   LCP payments are calculated by multiplying the national payment rate for each livestock category  as provided in paragraph  c  of this section  by the number of eligible livestock in each category   The national payment rate represents the cost of the amount of corn needed to maintain the specific livestock for 30 days  as determined by CCC   Adjustments shall be applied in accordance with paragraph  b  of this section and Section 1416 105   b  The LCP payment calculated in accordance with the paragraph  a  of this section shall be reduced by the amount the applicant received for the specific livestock under the Feed Indemnity Program in accordance with subpart D of part 760 of this title    Section 1416 105 applies to the  95 million appropriated for previously authorized programs  therefore it does not apply to this disaster program   According to the statutory provision referenced above  last sentence of Section 9002  a  1    the referenced subparagraph of the regulation  section 1416 102 b  ii  shall not apply    Accordingly  it is Congress  intent that the requirement in the LCP regulation that a feed loss must occur as an LCP eligibility requirement no longer applies    Section 9002  Subparagraph  a  2  A  provides that   In carrying out the program described in paragraph  1   the Secretary shall provide assistance to any applicant that conducts a livestock operation that is located in a disaster county with eligible livestock specified in paragraph  1  of section    According to this provision an eligible applicant must conduct a livestock operation that is located in a disaster county with eligible livestock specified in paragraph  1  of section 1416 102 a   Section 9002  Subparagraph  B  requires that an eligible applicant must meet the requirements of  3  and  4  of section 1416 102 a  of the regulation      According to this provision  livestock must meet the following requirements    3  been maintained for commercial use as part of a farming operation on the beginning date of the disaster period  and  4  Not have been produced and maintained for reasons other than commercial use as part of a farming operation    It is important to note that the statute  P L  110 28  specifically omits any reference to 7 CFR Section 1416 102  a  2  which provides that livestock must have    been physically located in an eligible county on the beginning date of the disaster period      Accordingly  this omission clearly indicates that the intent of Congress is that subparagraph  7 CFR Section 1416 102  a  2   shall not apply as an eligibility requirement for the implementation of the LCP   It is the intent of Congress that the USDA would modify or exclude certain mandates in the regulation governing specific hurricane related disaster programs   Sufficient legal authority exists for USDA to administer the livestock programs in the 2005 2006 2007 ad hoc disaster programs with policies that are germane to and make sense for non hurricane long term disasters such drought   Regarding Issue 3  above  we are concerned that FSA County Committees are establishing average feed and grazing losses rather than maximum grazing losses in eligible counties   County Committees have the responsibility to establish maximum grazing losses in each county and to reduce loss amounts for applicants from areas of a county with smaller losses who attempt to obtain assistance based on maximum loss thresholds established for the county   Additionally  we request that you provide us with legal authority that would preclude livestock being housed in feedlots from being eligible for LCP  provided all other eligibility requirements are met   We respectfully request that USDA consult with us prior to publishing the regulation governing the 2005 2006 2007 livestock disaster programs authorized under P L  110 28 to ensure that the intent of Congress is carried out in administering these programs that are critical to the economic health of livestock producers who have suffered losses due to natural disasters   In summary  we respectfully request that you reexamine the current implementation policies for the LCP and that prior to publishing the regulation governing this program that you meet with us to discuss and understand the intent of Congress to provide much needed assistance to the livestock producers who suffered damages and losses due to natural disasters in 2005  2006  and 2007                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
