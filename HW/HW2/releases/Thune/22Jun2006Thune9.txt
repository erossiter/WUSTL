Secretary  Open CRP Acres For Emergency Haying and Grazing          June 22nd  2006   Washington  DC   As drought conditions in South Dakota worsen  U S  Senators Tim Johnson  D SD  and John Thune  R SD  and Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth  D SD  urged USDA to release CRP acres for emergency haying and grazing   The United States Department of Agriculture s  USDA  Farm Service Agency  FSA  is in the process of receiving a request for emergency haying and grazing from the South Dakota state FSA for six counties  and the state is working on a number of requests for additional counties      Drought is nothing new in South Dakota  but conditions seem to be cause for early concern this year   Past years of minimal rain have added to the problem   While we all pray for rain soon  our farmers and ranchers need something they can count on today   The USDA can and should take this simple step to help alleviate the pain   Johnson said    Opening up CRP acres for emergency haying and grazing is a step that will provide significant relief to our farmers and ranchers as drought conditions make an unfortunate early arrival this year   Senator Thune said   I m hopeful Secretary Johanns will honor our request and release this land to soften the blow of a dangerously dry season for our farmers and ranchers  the backbone of South Dakota s economy    Herseth said   Producers and small communities across many parts of South Dakota are feeling the strain of increasingly severe drought conditions   Without timely assistance  many ranchers will be forced to decrease or even liquidate their cattle herds and many could be forced out of business completely   Releasing CRP acreage now  while it still has some feed value  is a critical first step that USDA should take to provide some relief to livestock producers    Haying and grazing of CRP acres are restricted in South Dakota from May 1st through August 1st   By August 1st  however  the majority of the acres targeted for release are unusable   the forage is all stem and it lacks feed value   The DC office has the opportunity to waive the August date for emergency release of CRP and open the acres up in a timely and beneficial fashion   If a county is approved for emergency haying and grazing  the producer can then apply at their local FSA office for approval   A producer electing to graze the acres has to leave 25  of the acreage alone  grazing at 75  of stocking rate   If a producer chooses to hay the acreage  only 50  of the acres can be used   With either option  the producer is assessed 25  of his annual payment     Emergency haying and grazing doesn t count against managed haying and grazing   For managed haying and grazing acres  a producer still needs to adhere to the August 1st date      Full Letter to the USDA follows   June 22  2006  The Honorable Mike Johanns Secretary of Agriculture United States Department of Agriculture 1400 Independence Avenue SW Washington  DC 20250  Dear Secretary Johanns   We write in support of applications you have received from the South Dakota Farm Service Agency  FSA  office in Huron pertaining to the emergency haying and grazing of Conservation Reserve Program  CRP  acres    Mr  Secretary  producers in South Dakota are experiencing significant challenges yet again this year with drought conditions   This circumstance is merely compounded by the unfortunate conditions that many producers faced during 2005 in addition to a significant blizzard that hit parts of South Dakota in April of this year   We recognize that agriculture disaster is like any other disaster  and we support additional assistance to promote economic recovery in a timely fashion   South Dakota producers would greatly benefit from the timely emergency haying and grazing of CRP acres   It is our understanding that many counties in South Dakota meet the approval conditions for the emergency release of CRP acres  entailing at least a 40  loss of precipitation for the four most recent months  plus the days in the current month   Additionally  a 40  reduction in pasture and hay must be documented during that same timeframe   We also request that you approve these acres in as timely a manner possible to ensure that the acres released retain a substantial feed value   While we recognize that consideration must be made for the nesting season in South Dakota  we are concerned that releasing these acres after the 1st of August will significantly reduce the benefit of allowing CRP acres to be used to alleviate impacts from the drought     While we urge the Department of Agriculture to authorize emergency haying and grazing of CRP land in a timely manner  we also encourage the USDA to open up CRP acres that would ensure maximum benefit for producers   including land enrolled in the CP 23 program   Producers continue to express the importance of accessing these acres  and we urge the Department to grant this request   Mr  Secretary  our producers need assistance in this very critical time   We respectfully request that you release CRP acres for emergency haying and grazing to allow our producers to receive some relief during this tremendously challenging time   Sincerely  Senator Tim Johnson  Senator John Thune  and Representative Stephanie Herseth
