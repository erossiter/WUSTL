     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Applauds Administration for Tapping Oil Reserve to Relieve Consumers Urges Colleagues to Support ANWR Exploration         September 14th  2005   Washington  D C    Sen  John Thune  R SD  today praised the Administration for approving the sale of 11 million barrels of crude oil from the nation s emergency oil stockpiles and called on Senate colleagues to support ANWR exploration to further alleviate gas prices and secure the nation  s energy supply  Combined with the 12 6 million barrels of crude previously approved for loans  these SPR releases  in response to the disruptions caused by Hurricane Katrina  will provide 23 6 million barrels of crude for the U S  market     The Administration has made the right move for South Dakotans and for all Americans today    Tapping the nation  s petroleum reserve in light of one of the worst disasters to ever hit our nation is both logical and necessary   It will go a long way toward alleviating burdensome gas prices and ensuring an undisrupted supply of gasoline to American families and businesses     Thune said    But there is more to be done in the long run to secure America  s energy supply against future crises  Some of my colleagues have until this point been reluctant to support environmentally responsible exploration and drilling in a small portion of Alaska  s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  despite government estimates that billions of barrels of recoverable oil exist beneath its Coastal Plain       The Senate is poised to vote on ANWR exploration this fall when a reconciliation package comes to the floor   This time  with the knowledge of how natural disasters like Hurricane Katrina can threaten our nation  s energy supply  I hope my colleagues in the Senate will join me in supporting ANWR exploration as an important step in boosting America  s energy independence and security                                                                                                                                                    SR 493
