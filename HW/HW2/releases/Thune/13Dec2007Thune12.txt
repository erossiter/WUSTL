Bill with Historic Increased Renewable Fuels Standard Thune Praised for Leadership on Passing RFS         December 13th  2007   Washington  D C    Today the United States Senate passed  86 to 8  the Energy Bill  H R  6  the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007  which includes an historic increased Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS   Senator John Thune has been working for months to get an increased RFS through the Senate  Several South Dakota agriculture and ethanol groups and others praised Thune for his leadership and tireless efforts to pass an RFS      After months of hard work  I am pleased to have helped move an increased RFS through the Senate  Without an increased renewable fuels standard  South Dakota s ethanol industry would have faced an unnecessary setback  This is an important victory for South Dakota s renewable fuels industry  as well as families across the nation who are suffering from high fuel prices   said Thune   The Energy Bill  with higher fuel efficiency standards for automobiles and the RFS  will help America lessen its dependence on foreign sources of oil  Rather than sending our energy dollars to hostile regimes in unfriendly parts of the world  it is time for America to invest in domestic alternative energy sources  Reducing this nation s dependence on foreign sources of energy is absolutely critical and achievable  America has the resources  the will  and the need to produce more of our energy here at home    The increased RFS would require refiners to blend 9 billion gallons of ethanol into our fuel supply in 2008  The current standard requires 7 5 billion gallons by 2012  which the ethanol industry will meet by the end of this year  The new standard increases ethanol usage to 15 billion gallons by 2015   more than doubling the current production of corn based ethanol  Beyond 2015  the new RFS calls for the production of 36 billion gallons of advanced biofuels by 2022  Twenty one billion gallons must be cellulosic ethanol  which is made from energy dedicated crops such as woodchips and switchgrass  In total  this bill calls for a five fold increase in ethanol production over the next 15 years   Senator Thune has been a leader in the renewable fuels movement dating back to his time in the U S  House of Representatives  In 2005 Senator Thune  then a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  spearheaded an effort to establish the nation s first renewable fuels standard that was included as part of the 2005 Energy Bill   That legislation required the production and use of 7 5 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2012     Since enactment of the 2005 Energy Bill  Senator Thune has worked with leaders on both sides of the aisle to increase the RFS  due to the significant growth in domestic ethanol production  Because our nation s ethanol producers are close to meeting the 7 5 billion gallon RFS four years ahead of schedule  Senator Thune strongly supported an expanded RFS earlier this year  36 billion gallons by 2022  as part of the Senate passed Energy bill  While completion of the Energy bill languished in Congress this year  Senators Thune  Domenici  R NM   and Ben Nelson  D NE  offered an amendment during the Farm Bill reauthorization to ensure that an RFS could be signed into law this year  Shortly after Thune  Domenici  and Nelson offered their RFS amendment to the Farm Bill  Democrat leadership in the House and Senate finally agreed to put together an Energy Bill and on December 6  2007 the House passed an Energy Bill  which included 36 billion gallons of renewable fuel by 2022     Thune Receives Praise for Leadership on RFS    The final passage of an increased RFS is a huge victory for agriculture and the ethanol industry  South Dakota Corn Growers thank Senator Thune for his relentless work on the RFS  Senator Thune s efforts to attach the RFS to the farm bill earlier this year is what finally broke loose the energy bill and made passage of the RFS possible  Thune s efforts made the difference   said Lisa Richardson  Executive Director of the South Dakota Corn Growers    A new RFS is essential if we are to meet our country s domestic energy goals  Passage of the RFS is a major step toward energy independence  Senator Thune s leadership on the RFS was critical to its success and I applaud his efforts   said Jeff Broin  Chief Executive Officer of POET    Senator Thune has been a leader in the U S  Senate in shaping a new  renewable energy future for this country  His understanding of the importance of a diversified motor fuel market  including the increased use of renewable fuels like ethanol  has been instrumental in ensuring that America s domestic ethanol industry continues to thrive   said Bob Dinneen  President   CEO of the Renewable Fuels Association    Senator Thune is an ardent supporter of ethanol  His leadership in passing a robust Renewable Fuels Standard in the Senate will foster the continued development of our industry   said Don Endres  Chairman and CEO of VeraSun Energy   The economic revitalization of rural Midwestern communities will expand to other regions of the county as our domestic fuel production grows and develops  This is an important milestone for the economic growth and energy security of our country      It is vitally important that we diversify our fuel supply by enacting a robust Renewable Fuels Standard  Senator John Thune is a forceful leader on this issue   I m proud to have teamed up with him on this issue  which will help America rely less on foreign oil and more on homegrown biofuels  There is no doubt that his efforts played an instrumental role in its success   said U S  Senator Pete Domenici  ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee   Because the Senate modified controversial provisions in the House passed Energy Bill  the bill will now be sent back to the House of Representatives and upon passage will then go to the President for his consideration   Expanding the RFS Will Benefit South Dakota and Rural America By the end of 2008  South Dakota will be producing over 1 billion gallons of ethanol  mainly from locally owned ethanol plants  According to John Urbanchuk  an economist at LECG  LLC  the expanded RFS would result in the following economic benefits  Add nearly  1 5 trillion  in today s dollars  to GDP between 2008 and 2022  Generate an additional  435 billion  in today s dollars  of household income for all Americans between 2008 and 2022  and Support the creation of as many as 1 1 million new jobs in all sectors of the economy by 2022                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
