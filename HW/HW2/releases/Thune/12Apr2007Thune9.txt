     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Jessica FergusonPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Introduces Bill to Help Travelers Avoid Airline Delays                April 12th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune  R SD  has introduced S  1085  the Informed Air Traveler Act of 2007  legislation that would ensure travelers are better informed about airline performance when booking travel  in light of increased flight delays and cancellations in recent years     Whether it s a firsthand experience or hearing a friend or family member s account  we can all relate to the stress and inconvenience caused by delayed and cancelled flights  and in recent years  it only seems to have gotten worse  In the past year  thousands of travelers have spent uncomfortable nights on airport floors  or hours stuck on tarmacs  when they should be enjoying family vacations or attending important business meetings   Thune said     While some reasons for flight delays and cancellations cannot be avoided or solved easily  such as dangerous weather or flying conditions  there are certain steps we can take to help travelers avoid delays  My legislation would require airlines to publish important performance statistics  such as the percentage of on time departures and delays for each passenger flight  on their web sites so travelers can make informed decisions about an airline s track record      At the same time  better informing travelers before they purchase airfare could increase airline competition  as airlines will have a greater incentive to improve their on time performance if they know their customers will have this information and will be making purchasing decisions based on it     I hope my colleagues in the Senate will give this bill the all clear as soon as possible  so more Americans can take to the skies on time and better informed     The Informed Air Traveler Act of 2007 would require airlines to publish relevant performance statistics for all passenger flights  as reported by Department of Transportation for the previous 12 months  for each airline ticket that is purchased on the Internet  at the ticket counter or over the phone  including   Percentage of on time departures Average departure delay Percentage of flights cancelled Number of flights with taxi out times over 2 hours  The bill would also flag and ensure customers are notified of flights that are  chronically delayed  and  chronically cancelled  before customers purchase tickets on the web or over the phone    Chronically delayed  is defined as a flight that has failed to arrive on time at least 40 percent of the time during the most recent 3 month period    Chronically cancelled  is defined as a flight in which at least 30 percent of scheduled departures have been canceled during the most recent 3 month period                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
