Letter Supporting BioEnergy Research          June 15th  2006   Washington  DC   Senator John Thune today sent a bipartisan letter to U S  Department of Transportation Secretary Norman Mineta requesting assistance concerning BioBased Transportation Research  Section 5201 of the Transportation Reauthorization bill that Congress passed last year provides funding to five land grant universities for the Sun Grant Initiative  which organizes and coordinates research across the country concerning alternative energy  The five Sun Grant Centers are located at South Dakota State University  Cornell University  the University of Tennessee  Oklahoma State University  and Oregon State University   Last year s Transportation bill included  50 million for BioBased Transportation Research between 2006 and 2009   However  after the bill was signed into law the U S  Department of Transportation notified Sun Grant Centers that they would be required to provide a dollar for dollar match before the research can get underway  Traditionally  education and research programs are subject to a 20 percent matching requirement      The Sun Grant Initiative is important to the advancement of ethanol and other bio based research   said Thune   The research that these universities have done has moved the U S  forward in the use of biomass and bioenergy  Their work is very important to our nation s energy future   This important type of research should not be held to such a high matching requirement and I am hopeful that Secretary Mineta will use his authorities to lower the matching requirement to 20 percent    Senator Thune secured  8 3 million for Sun Grant Research at South Dakota State University as part of last year s Transportation bill   The text of today s letter is below and was also signed by Senators Clinton  Inhofe  Frist  Smith  Wyden  Johnson  and Schumer  and Representatives Herseth  Lucas  and Hooley    Secretary Mineta U  S  Department of Transportation 400 7th Street  S W   Washington D C  20590 Dear Secretary Mineta   We write to request your assistance regarding the BioBased Transportation Research that was included in Section 5201 of SAFETEA LU  This particular initiative provides regionally coordinated funding to land grant universities to conduct research and education programs concerning the development of bioenergy and biomass products   In his recent State of the Union address  President Bush stressed the importance of developing bioenergy as a part of our nation s energy future  The Sun Grant Initiative was developed years ago to harness the research and education Infastructure of the land grant university system  which has research field stations and extension agents distributed through every state and territory  The Sun Grant Initiative organizes these local and state based  capacities into regions  which are in turn coordinated with the national goals and programs of the federal agencies   The Sun Grant Initiative divides all of the land grant universities across the country into five regions  with a regional Center of excellence that are tasked to provide leadership within their region  The five regional centers are respectively located at South Dakota State University  Cornell University  the University of Tennessee  Oklahoma State University  and Oregon State University  Presently  the Sun Grant Initiative is conducting on going bioenergy research with the Department of Agriculture  and the Department of Energy   While SAFETEA LU included  50 million for BioBased Transportation Research  between FY 2006 2009  members of the Sun Grant Initiative have approached us with their concern about the dollar for dollar match requirements that they are subject to  While this match requirement may be an appropriate amount for traditional transportation research programs  it is a high matching requirement for research and education programs    which commonly are subject to a twenty percent matching requirement  Above all  the dollar for dollar match requirement in the Transportation bill is extremely difficult for university programs that do not have the flexibility to redirect large amounts of non federal funding to new purposes  To avoid inhibiting the implantation of important bioenergy research across the country  we respectfully ask that you exercise your discretion under Title 23 to reduce the matching requirement to twenty percent for BioBased Transportation Research   We thank you for your leadership and assistance in resolving this matter   Please don t hesitate  to contact us if you have any questions   Sincerely  Senators Thune  Clinton  Inhofe  Frist  Smith  Wyden  Johnson  and Schumer  and Representatives Herseth  Lucas  and Hooley                                                                                                                                                SR 493
