Bipartisan Plan to Jumpstart Homegrown Cellulosic Ethanol Production  Thune Bill Would Provide Incentives for U S  Farmers to Grow Energy Dedicated Crops to Boost Ethanol Production  Make America More Energy Independent         May 23rd  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune  R SD   along with Senator Ben Nelson  D NE   today unveiled bipartisan legislation that would spur the production of cellulosic ethanol  an alternative fuel produced from homegrown crops  which holds great potential to meet America s energy needs  Senator Thune s legislation  the Biofuels Innovation Program Act  BIP   takes a two pronged approach to assist farmers and ranchers with the transition to biofuels production    First  the BIP proposal allows for feasibility studies to be conducted to establish BIP project areas on land surrounding future biorefinery sites  These studies would evaluate the likelihood of construction of a future biorefinery  the local potential for production of biomass resources  such as switchgrass and fast growing trees  the number of interested producers  and the economic impact a future biorefinery would have on the local community    Once a BIP proposal is approved by the USDA  participating producers could enroll eligible land in the BIP program   During the first 5 years of their BIP contract  or during the timeframe for the biorefinery to be constructed and the establishment of the biofuels crops  producers would receive a cost share for planting energy dedicated crops and a per acre rental payment  Once the biorefinery is operational  the rental payment would end and the producer would receive a matching payment up to  45 for each ton of biomass delivered to the biorefinery for up to two years   Secondly  this legislation also authorizes matching payments on a per ton basis to producers anywhere in the United States who sell crop by products and residues such as corn stover and straw to biofuels facilities for the production of ethanol or other alternative energy  These matching payments may be made for up to two years beginning with the date the biofuels facility begins purchasing the feedstock  and are also capped at  45 per ton     In South Dakota and in corn states across the country  corn based ethanol is being produced at record levels  Because corn is also used as a food and feed source  the production of corn based ethanol will be limited to approximately 15 billion gallons of ethanol each year  despite a rapidly growing consumer demand for this promising alternative fuel   Thune said   Thanks to new technology and research  however  a new generation of ethanol is being developed that could supplement corn based ethanol production and further reduce our nation s dependence on foreign oil     Cellulosic ethanol  produced from homegrown sources like corn stover  wheat straw  switchgrass and wood chips  has incredible potential to supplement corn based ethanol  But if cellulosic ethanol is to achieve its potential  it is critical that Congress help this industry overcome initial market barriers  My legislation would spur the construction of biorefineries across the country and provide incentives to farmers in surrounding areas to grow energy dedicated crops that can eventually supply these biorefineries in a cost effective  environment friendly way    If we are going to be serious in this country about reducing our dependence on foreign oil  we have to be serious about giving the necessary jumpstart to America s budding alternative fuels industry and the farmers who will be expected to fuel it  so they can overcome initial economic and technical hurdles and transform this infant industry into the future answer to America s energy needs    Senator Nelson said   Celluosic ethanol has always faced a chicken or the egg problem   it s difficult to start commercial production without a guaranteed supply of biomass  but it s hard to encourage farmers to grow the biomass unless they know they ll have a market  This legislation will help resolve that problem by the encouraging the construction of biofuel facilities while simultaneously pushing the production of biomass    The BIP proposal would also reauthorize the Sun Grant Initiative through 2012   South Dakota State University is one of five Sun Grant universities nationwide conducting valuable research on the production and economical delivery of cellulosic ethanol from the field to the marketplace      I am pleased to have secured valuable funding for the Sun Grant Initiative as part of the Transportation Reauthorization Act of 2005  and I look forward to strengthening this program as part of the 2007 Farm Bill   Thune said     Senator Thune is Ranking Member of the Energy Subcommittee of the Senate Agriculture Committee and will be working with his colleagues to incorporate this important initiative into this year s reauthorization of the Farm bill   Background  Demand is Growing for Renewable Fuels  Although the current Renewable Fuels Standard requires the use of 7 5 billion gallons of ethanol per year  rapid industry growth will far exceed this standard    Congress may soon increase this standard to 36 billion gallons by 2022 USDA estimates that by 2030 1 3 billion tons of biomass could be available for bioenergy production  including electricity from biomass  and fuels from corn and cellulose    This amount of biomass could replace 70 billion gallons of gasoline per year
