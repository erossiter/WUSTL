     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Like Fall Harvest  Farm Bill Passage Can t Be Delayed          October 2nd  2007   Washington  D C    Since being elected to the U S  Senate in 2004  I have been preparing for authorization of a new Farm Bill   Hundreds of hours on my schedule have been spent productively consulting with South Dakotans on farm bill issues for the past two years     South Dakota farmers  ranchers  and agri business men and women have shared with me  as have many of others from across America  their farm bill suggestions and concerns   And  wisely  they didn t wait until the  last minute  to do so   Many federal farm programs authorized under the 2002 Farm Bill expired on September 30  2007   How did this deadline  sneak up  on the Democrat controlled Senate with such subtlety that they missed the deadline for passing a new farm bill   It didn t   There s no excuse for their hand wringing now and talk of short term extensions  while farmers and ranchers are planting their 2008 winter wheat crop and making plans for the 2008 crop year  without knowing what the next farm bill holds in store   Several major factors affecting the 2007 Farm Bill that have been used as excuses by the Majority for not getting it completed in a timely manner have been dominating farm bill discussions for more than a year   For example  Congress has been painfully aware that funding levels for farm bill spending would be dramatically smaller than for the 2002 Farm Bill   International trade agreement compliance issues have been prominent for more than two years   Additionally  spending needed for the Energy Title for research and development of alternative fuels has certainly been recognized for some time   It s past time for the Democrat controlled Senate to move beyond farm bill rhetoric   It s time for their leadership to take prompt action and work to pass a comprehensive bill out of the Senate Agriculture Committee   Now is the time to move forward so this important measure can be considered on the Senate floor and reconciled with the House passed bill     I ve been engaging with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee  both Democrat and Republican  to work out differences and compromise ideas so we can mold them into a farm bill we can all be proud of   and most important  one that well serves production agriculture and promotes sustainable efficient alternative energy   I remain optimistic that Congress will be able to shape the various farm bill components into a sound product  however  I can assure you that I will not settle for  or support  a farm bill that is inadequate or one that fails to meet the needs of South Dakota s agriculture community      It s time to get this farm bill  in the bin    Just like harvest   the longer the wait  the greater the chance of losing out                                                                                                                                                  SR 493
