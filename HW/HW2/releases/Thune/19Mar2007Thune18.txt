     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Jessica FergusonPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Requests Approval of Ethanol Pumps          March 19th  2007   Washington  DC   Senator John Thune along with a bipartisan group of Senators sent a letter today to Underwriter Laboratories  UL  CEO Keith Williams requesting the approval of fuel pumps capable of dispensing higher blends of ethanol  The bipartisan letter comes as a result of UL s decision last year to suspend its authorization of E85 dispensers due to concerns about the potential corrosive effects that E85 may have on fuel dispenser components  E85 is fuel that contains 85 percent ethanol and 15 percent gasoline    For years now  Congress has made ethanol an important part of our nation s energy policy  As we work to promote E85 and higher grades of ethanol like E20  fuel that contains 20 percent ethanol  it is critical that UL provide the necessary certification for fuel dispensers to deliver alternative fuels at local gas stations  I urge UL to act in a timely manner to certify these pumps and remove this unnecessary barrier to the use of higher blends of ethanol   said Thune   Presently  there are over 1 100 E85 pumps in operation nationwide  While UL has no evidence to suggest that there are problems with existing E85 pumps  on October 5  2006  UL suspended its certification of multi product fuel dispenser components and announced that it would embark on an extended recertification procedure  While UL certification isn t required for the operation of E85 pumps  Fire Marshalls and State and County officials regularly rely on UL s certification regarding the acceptability of refueling components that are used in the marketplace     Senator Thune has been a leading advocate of expanded use of alternative fuels such as ethanol   Earlier this year  Senator Thune introduced a bipartisan bill  S  331  with Senator Ken Salazar  D CO   which would provide grants up to  30 000 to gasoline retailers who install alternative fuel infrastructure such as E85  bio diesel and other alternative fuels  This legislation is needed because less than one percent of all gas pumps nationwide  roughly 1 100  offer alternative fuels such as E85 ethanol   Full text of the letter appears below     March 19  2007   Mr  Keith Williams President and CEO Underwriters Laboratory 333 Pfingsten Road Northbrook  Illinois 60062 2096  Dear Mr  Williams   We are writing in regard to the recent decision by Underwriter Laboratories  UL  to rescind its previously issued certifications for components of E85 refueling systems  and the new efforts by UL to establish E85 component and fuel dispenser testing protocols   UL initiated a review of the safety of multi product fuel dispenser components and approved their use several years ago   On October 5  2006  UL rescinded the certification for these components and announced that it would embark on an extended recertification procedure for the dispensers themselves    We understand that re evaluation of material testing protocol is not uncommon and indeed should occur in the normal course of time  and we appreciate that you and your staff have undertaken a new effort to establish E85 component and dispenser testing protocol   We are concerned  however  why this initiative is being undertaken after the withdrawal of the prior approvals     especially when UL has acknowledged no documented reports of corrosion for UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  no field incidents related to UL Listed or Recognized components used with E85  and no reported safety issues associated with Listed or Recognized components used with E85  Moreover  the actions taken by UL have not provided equipment manufacturers  ethanol producers  and the motoring public with adequate certainty and clarity as to the timetable for completion of the process   We know and agree that any device that displays the UL imprimatur must have its characteristics fully reviewed and tested according to key standards and procedures   We request your assurances that both timetable and testing are not mutually exclusive goals   Congress has taken significant steps to transition to alternative fuels such as E 85   setting mandatory targets for increased ethanol use  enacting a federal income tax credit to offset the cost of installation of E85 fueling systems  and funding efforts to expand E 85 refueling infrastructure nationwide  of which now there are more than 1 100 pumps   UL is essential to these transition efforts     UL has tested products for public safety for more than a century and has earned its well deserved reputation as an unbiased gatekeeper for the introduction of American innovation in the marketplace     As a result of UL s decision to rescind its previously issued certifications  however  fire marshals  code administrators  and other officials having jurisdiction may block the installation of new E85 fueling systems   Potential vendors of E85 may have significant problems installing new equipment as a result of risk management issues associated with no UL Listing     Accordingly  we ask UL to comment on the process of the issuance of certifications provided to E85 components prior to the October 5  2006 announcement  and the subsequent withdrawal of certifications  to establish an estimated timetable or list of milestones required to complete your updated testing and analysis  to identify what equipment or facilities would be required to complete this work and the time periods associated with those activities  and to issue a revised draft protocol to industry as soon as practicable     We look forward to working with you and your highly respected organization to ensure that American motorists are able to enjoy a wide range of fuels choices in a safe and convenient manner                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
