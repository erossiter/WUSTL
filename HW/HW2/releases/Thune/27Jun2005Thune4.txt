     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      A Team Effort to Save Ellsworth          June 27th  2005   Rapid City  S D    With thousands of Ellsworth supporters rallying behind us last week in Rapid City  we presented a compelling and fact filled case before three members of the Base Realignment and Closure Committee  BRAC   But our work is not finished   It was a first class presentation and event organized by the Ellsworth Task Force  Chamber of Commerce and staffs of our local  state  and federal elected officials  The overwhelming show of support from the Black Hills area residents should be burned into the minds of the attending commissioners as they continue their process of analyzing the list presented to them by the Department of Defense   As I told the commissioners  the B 1 bomber is the backbone of our nation  s bomber force and plays a critical role in our War on Terror  My question to them was  Does it make military sense to house the entire B 1 fleet in a single location  We presented solid arguments that it does not   Past base closures managed to cut out some of the fat and excess of our nation  s military structure  but now they are cutting the muscle  That is a serious concern as we assess our national security interests   Ellsworth has proven itself over and over in different theaters of operation around the world  It should continue to be a part of our force structure because of the military principle of strategic redundancy  That principle says that we should distribute our military assets to different locations in the country to make them less vulnerable to attack   I agree with retired Air Force Four Star General John Loh  former commander of Air Combat Command  who told the commissioners that the Air Force would be violating his long standing principle of not putting more than 36 heavy bombers at a single base  Closing Ellsworth would put all 67 B 1s at one base in Texas  with one runway   The B 1 Bomber is the heart of our bomber force and delivered more weapons and struck more targets than any other bomber or fighter in Iraq and Afghanistan  We simply don  t know what the future threats to the United States will be  If we need firepower and airpower to get to a conflict in a hurry  we cannot risk having our sole B 1 base grounded because of bad weather  flocks of geese  or a terrorist attack   I am proud that so many concerned and active citizens turned out to support Ellsworth while we made these arguments to the BRAC commissioners  The commission will continue taking testimony and scrutinizing arguments made regarding the 180 military base closings and realignments before them  Be assured  over the coming weeks and months  we intend to keep presenting our arguments and supporting evidence to the commission as to why Ellsworth should stay open   The commissioners will make their recommendations to President Bush by September 8th  and then he has until September 23rd to accept or reject the entire report  Before they offer the report to the President  the commission can make changes to the list    with at least five of nine commissioners needed to remove Ellsworth from the list   Working together  we will continue to fight to the end to secure those five votes and breathe new life into Ellsworth  Thank you all for your help                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
