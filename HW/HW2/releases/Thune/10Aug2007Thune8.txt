Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Addresses 20th Annual American Coalition for Ethanol  ACE  Conference          August 10th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune yesterday addressed approximately 1 800 ethanol industry leaders at the 20th annual American Coalition for Ethanol  ACE  Conference in St  Paul  MN  Senator Thune spoke on the challenges and opportunities facing the growing ethanol industry and gave a legislative update on activities in Washington  DC   Senator Thune highlighted the need for an increased Renewable Fuels Standard  approval of higher blends of ethanol  increased research for cellulosic ethanol  and access to E85 at the retail level   Following are excerpts from Senator Thune s prepared remarks   In 2001  ethanol production totaled approximately 1 8 billion gallons of ethanol  At the end of last year  this number was approximately 5 4 billion gallons of clean renewable fuel  With more plants coming on line  nationwide ethanol production will soon double   In the coming years  as ethanol contributes an ever greater portion of our fuel supply  ethanol will transition from being a fuel additive to a petroleum replacement  Corn based ethanol will also be supplemented by future supplies of commercial scale cellulosic ethanol production    Congress has a role to play  Congress also has an important role to play as ethanol transitions through a critical period in the industry s history  We need effective public policy that keeps the ethanol industry growing in a sustainable and productive manner  A higher Renewable Fuels Standard  greater access to renewable fuel pumps  more research and development of cellulosic ethanol  and  perhaps most importantly  the approval of intermediate ethanol blends are critical to the growth and sustainability of the ethanol industry   During debate of the CLEAN Energy Act  several anti ethanol amendments were introduced that would have derailed domestic ethanol production    I am proud to have actively worked to defeat  these  anti ethanol amendments during the recent Senate debate on the energy bill  and I am also pleased that several key ethanol provisions were included in the Senate passed bill     Senator Thune s Alternative Refueling System Legislation  In particular  the Senate energy bill included my bi partisan legislation to boost the number of alternative fuel refueling pumps  This provision would give station owners grants for 30 percent  not exceeding  30 000  to offset the costs of installing E85 refueling pumps  Roughly one percent of our nation s gas stations offer E85  and with over 6 million flexible fuel vehicles on the road today  consumers must have access to E85 in every part of our country    Congressional Action Inaction on a Renewable Fuel Standard  The Senate passed CLEAN Energy Act would also increase the Renewable Fuels Standard to 36 billion gallons in 2022  During the last Congress  I was proud to have played a role in passing the first ever Renewable Fuels Standard of 7 5 billion gallons by 2012 as part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  After four long years of delay  members from both sides of the aisle came together and declared that ethanol will be part of our nation s energy future     Since the passage of the Energy Policy Act of 2005   which the President signed into law two years ago this week  the American farmer and the ethanol industry have responded to this call by ramping up production in a historic fashion  We are now on pace to exceed the current Renewable Fuels Standard over three years ahead of schedule  Mandating more biofuels in our nation s fuel supply is a critical step toward energy independence  Unfortunately  the Democratic leadership in the House of Representatives does not believe the Renewable Fuels Standard should be increased  Just last Saturday  as the House worked to finish last minute legislation before the August recess  the House passed its energy bill    which excluded an increase to the Renewable Fuels Standard     Overcoming the E 10  Blend Wall  In addition to the RFS  Congress and the Administration must work together with the ethanol and automotive industries to approve intermediate blends of ethanol blended gasoline for non flex fuel vehicles  Many industry leaders  including some of those present today  have concern about the short term market for ethanol as we approach what some call an  E10 wall     EPA approval of intermediate ethanol blends would complement their recent decision to reclassify fuel ethanol plants under the Clean Air Act   Prior to this reclassification  fuel ethanol plants were classified under an arbitrary 100 ton per year major source permitting threshold   I have been working for years with the EPA on this important rulemaking  which will result in greater  more efficient ethanol production   I am pleased that the EPA acted on this issue  and I hope the EPA will once again support reasonable measures to promote homegrown energy by approving intermediate blends of ethanol for non flex fuel vehicles   Senator Thune Biofuels Innovation Program  As a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  I have proposed a Biofuels Innovation Program  which will provide incentives for farmers to grow energy dedicated crops while cellulosic ethanol biorefineries are being constructed    Under this program  communities  ethanol companies  and producer groups can apply as single entity for inclusion in this program  If the U S  Department of Agriculture determines that a cellulosic biorefinery is feasible in that particular area  participating producers would receive a cost share for planting energy dedicated crops and a per acre rental payment while the crops are being established and the biorefinery is being constructed     Producers who deliver energy dedicated crops or crop residues to the gate of a biorefinery are also eligible for a dollar for dollar match up to  45 per ton for the harvest  storage  and transportation of cellulosic biomass  This is a critical component to an economical cellulosic ethanol supply chain  and the 2007 Farm Bill is an ideal vehicle to move this legislation   I am pleased that House Agriculture Committee Chairman Collin Peterson included a similar provision in the House passed farm bill  His leadership on this issue is strong and his Biomass Energy Reserve Program is forward looking and critical to the success of cellulosic ethanol  I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee to ensure such a provision is included in the Senate Farm Bill   America s Energy Security  Last week  a barrel of crude oil hit another record high at over  78 per barrel  I believe that with each increase  the American consumer pays a higher terrorism tax  The terrorism tax is the excessive profits collected by countries like Venezuela and others in the Middle East that want to harm the United States     It is up to the ethanol industry leaders present today  state legislators across the country  and Congressional leaders in Washington D C  to replace the terrorism tax with positive energy production here in the United States  Increased ethanol production is the key to reversing our dangerous dependence on foreign oil and thus reducing the terrorism tax on U S  consumers     As the ethanol industry expands into new markets  attacks from ethanol s opponents will ultimately follow  World hunger groups and extreme environmental groups are now singing the siren song of doomsday consequences of increased ethanol production   Leftist foreign leaders are criticizing the U S  for taking proactive measures to promote our domestic renewable resources  Big Oil is stifling access to ethanol through a variety of tactics that restrict access to E85 at franchise stations    It is easy to get caught up in these arguments and to lose sight of the admirable goal of energy security   However  we must remind ourselves that collectively  we are striving for something far greater  No one ever said that transforming the primary energy source for the world s largest economy would be easy  but America s farmers and ethanol producers are meeting this challenge  The industry continues to grow  more plants are being constructed  technology is advancing  and legislative victories are being won in Washington  DC     My message for your today is simple  Keep moving forward   Keep investing in new technology and new plants  Keep creating jobs in rural America   Keep America on a path to energy independence  And Congress will continue to support ethanol as the cornerstone of our nation s energy policy   Thank you again for the opportunity to address you today   I look forward to working with you as we continue to make our country stronger and more energy independent                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
