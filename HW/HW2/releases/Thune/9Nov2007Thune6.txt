top priorities  national defense   said Thune   South Dakota will make a significant contribution to our national security thanks to the many important provisions in this bill  These defense related projects and research initiatives  create new jobs  improve vital technologies  boost our state s economy  and make America a safer place    In the Fiscal Year 2008 Defense Appropriations Conference Report  Senator Thune was successful in securing funding for the following defense programs   Next Generation Lightweight Electric Drive Systems for Army Weapon Systems   2 million   Dakota Power Incorporated  Rapid City Provides a reduction in weight and enhanced performance for Future Combat System vehicles and Unmanned Aerial Vehicles  With reduced weight  increased fuel efficiency  and the ability to free wheel  it has quieter operations that are harder to detect and is scalable for multiple applications     B 1 Bomber 16 Carry Adapter   9 million  Ellsworth Air Force Base The B 1 bomber deployment footprint can be reduced along with improvements in flexibility with this adapter  The adapter fitting increases the amount of munitions that the B 1 can carry from 14 per aircraft to 48  This increases the B 1 s flexibility to employ multiple types of weapons in a single sortie     Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration   Army Missile Defense  Rosebud Sioux Tribe    4 million  The Rosebud Sioux Tribe advances Army defense system electronics by reducing the size  weight  and cost of electronic circuit cards  components  wire harnesses  and electronic cabling with an emphasis to reduce hazardous substances materials and employ lead free components in micro electronic products    Alternative Power Technology for Missile Defense  Rosebud Sioux Tribe     3 2 million  Advances  adapts  and demonstrates photovoltaic  PV  technology to meet Army requirements for stealth  short to mid range energy needs with minimal sustainable logistics  A prototype device will harness solar energy converted to narrow wavelengths and will validate PV power electronic controls    HiSentinel   4 64 million  Aerostar International Inc   Sioux Falls Provides a long duration platform for 24 7 capability for intelligence  surveillance  communications  and networking  Current platforms are limited to short duration missions of 24 hrs or less  this provides an unmanned airship capable of carrying different payloads for durations greater than 30 days    Aging Weapons Systems Structural Repair   1 6 million  H F  Webster Engineering Services  Rapid City Provides for the qualification of Friction Stir Welding technologies and for the development of a mobile friction stir welding capability  This has significant potential for extending the structural life and reducing the cost to sustain aging weapons systems     Smart Bomb Rack Unit  S BRU  Upgrade   4 56 million  Ellsworth Air Force Base The S BRU increases the amount of weapons that can be carried by 25 percent  reduces the mission turn around time and the logistics footprint by 30 percent  With this upgrade  the B 1 will be capable of carrying 30 inch  as well as 14 inch weapons on a single CBM type     LITENING 4th Generation  LG4  Advanced Targeting Pods   39 6 million The Air National Guard has identified the need for 33 more LITENING LG4 advanced targeting pods for precision strike capability  training  counter IED operations  and for missions supporting Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom as well as Homeland Security and Disaster Relief capabilities   Department of Defense Experimental Program to Stimulate Competitive Research  DEPSCoR    11 2 million  Provides funding for competitive research proposals in 24 states   From defenses against IEDs to the electronic battlefield  to advanced communication systems  our nation s safety depends upon advances made possible through this type of research     DOD STARBASE   4 million Provides funding for new and existing DOD STARBASE academies in 33 states   This program focuses on science  math  technology  and engineering   In Fiscal Year 2006  over 50 000 youths participated in STARBASE    Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics Health and Usage Management System  IMDS  and Condition Based Maintenance  CBM  for CH 53   4 64 million IMDS automates and simplifies maintenance tasks and collects data to support the transition to CBM  The Marines have purchased over 50 IMDS for the fleet and it has provided a significant improvement in readiness rates and the ability to maintain aircraft while improving the accuracy of the fleet health     The Defense Appropriation s Bill includes  1 05 million in funding for projects associated with the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology   Improvised Explosive Device  IED  Simulation in Different Soils   400 000  Provides IED simulation in different soils to develop tools to design countermeasures for IEDs  Once a numerical model is developed  it can be used for the simulation of shallow buried explosive blasts in different soils and eventually design equipment to help counter this threat     Transparent Nanocomposite Armor   300 000  Provides for the development of transparent armor for the Army s Future Combat Systems  This is a critical requirement for Army vehicles  as evidenced by assaults on soldiers in Iraq  The materials being used offer great promise in saving lives and improving performance     Shielding Rocket Payloads   350 000 Develops low frequency acoustic shielding technologies for the Air Force  This project would reduce sound pressure levels within space vehicles to avoid damage to payloads during launch     The U S  House of Representatives passed the Defense Appropriations Conference Report yesterday by a wide margin and it will now be sent to the President for his consideration  Combined with the Defense Appropriations bill  is a Continuing Resolution provision that provides temporary funding to keep the government operating    The Continuing Resolution was added because none of the annual appropriation measures have been completed by the Democrat led Congress  This is the second such temporary
