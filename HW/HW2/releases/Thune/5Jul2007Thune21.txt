     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Condemns Black Footed Ferret Reintroduction          July 5th  2007   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune issued the following statement in reaction to the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service and National Park Service release of seven black footed ferrets in Wind Cave National Park yesterday    After months of listening to concerns from local ranchers about the release of black footed ferrets within the boundaries of Wind Cave National Park  and sharing those concerns with officials at the Department of Interior  I am shocked that the Department of Interior has proceeded with this particular black footed ferret release  Coupled with neighboring ranchers  concerns is the fact that the prairie dog landscape in the Park is smaller than those of other attempted black footed ferret releases  This appears to me as a recipe for a disastrous reintroduction      The only positive factor I see regarding this black footed ferret release is that the Department of Interior has attempted to address several concerns expressed in my April 26  2007 letter regarding the proposed reintroduction of black footed ferrets  Despite the endangered status of the ferrets reintroduced under a recovery permit  incidental take is still permissible by private landowners implementing normal ranching and other private lands activities  including prairie dog control on private lands  Individuals or entities conducting lawful activities such as lethal prairie dog control will not need individual take permits to undertake those activities  The Wind Cave prairie dog management plan addresses encroachment of prairie dogs onto other properties   The National Park Service and the U S  Fish and Wildlife Service have committed to the retrieval of ferrets that leave Wind Cave if a landowner so wishes and authorizes such removal   Current state law also provides control of unwanted prairie dogs coming from public lands  the proposed ferret reintroduction will not circumvent this State law  One of the objectives of the experimental reintroduction plan is to avoid or minimize adverse effects on local economies  life styles  and the natural environment    However  I still have several concerns because the black footed ferret reintroduction process at Wind Cave National Park is inconsistent with other reintroduction activities of this species  an issue that does not seem to be adequately justified by officials at the Department of Interior     The Department of Interior chose to ignore a  common sense  approach to black footed ferret introduction   said Thune   It baffles me that the Department of Interior doesn t focus its reintroduction efforts on federally owned land not already plagued with prairie dog created problems on surrounding ranches and on one with a larger prairie dog population within its boundaries  to ensure success and minimize problems   I plan to make sure the  good neighbor  policies they ve provided me in writing are adhered to                                                                                                                                                   SR 493
