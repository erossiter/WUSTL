Provisions Included in Senate 2007 Farm Bill as the Senate Agriculture Committee Begins Debate          October 24th  2007   Washington  D C    Today the Senate Agriculture Committee begins consideration of the 2007 Farm Bill  Senator Thune  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  has been successful in getting several of his provisions included in the base bill  and will offer several amendments to improve the bill for South Dakota s agriculture producers as the debate unfolds    There is a good opportunity to build on the successes of the 2002 Farm Bill and propel South Dakota into a more profitable era of food  fiber  energy production  and outdoor recreation   said Thune   Following is a list of Senator Thune s provisions that have been included in the base bill   Biofuels Innovation Program Last May  Senator Thune introduced a bipartisan first of its kind program to provide producer incentives for growing energy dedicated crops like switchgrass and fast growing trees  in conjunction with the construction of nearby biorefineries  This program would provide a cost share payment and per acre rental payment to producers who have committed to growing energy dedicated crops for a local biorefinery  This program would also provide a per ton payment to farmers for collecting  storing  and transporting biomass  such as corn cobs  to cellulosic ethanol plants  In total  this program will provide almost  160 million to producers to jumpstart the cellulosic ethanol industry  The per ton payment alone would incentivize almost 60 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production     Stronger Mandatory COOL Language On October 3  2007  Senator Thune requested that the House passed COOL language be strengthened to clarify that all categories of red meat are required to be labeled  At Senator Thune s request  the Agriculture Committee s bill includes minor changes to the House passed COOL provisions that will make implementing mandatory COOL clear  concise  and beyond legal challenge   Sun Grant Initiative The Agriculture Committee s bill includes  25 million in mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  which is coordinated by South Dakota State University  For months  Senator Thune has been working with members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to underscore the important renewable fuels research taking place at South Dakota State University through the Sun Grant Initiative  This provision would provide much needed mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  while reauthorizing this program through the life of the farm bill  Under the Senate 2007 Farm Bill  the Sun Grant Initiative would also be authorized for annual appropriations up to  70 million per year through 2012   Stronger Sodsaver Provision After months of working with the Senate Agriculture Committee  Senator Thune was successful in including a common sense sodsaver provision  This provision would not allow crop insurance and NAP coverage for crops planted on native sod  Between 2002 and 2005  almost 300 000 acres of native sod in South Dakota was converted from native grassland to cropland  The House passed farm bill only applies to crop insurance eligibility for four years after native sod is converted to cropland   Expanded Tribal Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program At Senator Thune s request  the Agriculture Committee s bill expands the successful Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program to a minimum of 100 Indian Tribal Organizations across the country  Although the House passed bill expanded the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program nationwide  it did not expand access to Indian Reservations  The Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program was started in the 2002 Farm Bill as a pilot program   Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was chosen as one of three reservations to participate in the pilot program  Thanks to Senator Thune s efforts this program will be expanded to over 100 Indian Reservations nationwide   Open Fields Legislation In May  Senator Thune joined a bipartisan group of Senators in cosponsoring in the Open Fields Act  For the first time ever  federal funding   20 million per year  will be available to expand the already successful walk in program in South Dakota and in other states  South Dakota landowners have voluntarily enrolled more than 1 million acres of privately owned land in South Dakota s program   Live audio should be available at the following sites
