     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      Thune vows continued fight for Ellsworth          May 13th  2005   Washington  D C    Senator John Thune  R SD  made the following statement today regarding the Pentagon  s recommendation to close Ellsworth Air Force Base      Although this is only the first step in the process  this is upsetting news for all South Dakotans  The Pentagon is flat wrong in failing to recognize Ellsworth  s importance to our nation and state  We will continue to fight to keep Ellsworth open     Thune said    We should not close a single base here in America before the Pentagon decides which overseas bases to close  It defies common sense to close a base like Ellsworth before its strategic value is addressed in the Pentagon  s Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR       The Quadrennial Defense Review Report is due to be released early next year   The QDR is a comprehensive examination of America  s future defense needs  including potential threats  force structure  strategy  defense infrastructure  and other elements of the defense program  The Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States    Overseas BRAC    or   Overseas Basing Commission     was established in 2003 to provide Congress and the President with a thorough study and review of U S  military structure and facilities overseas  The Commission publicly released its report earlier this week  but no action has been taken     I will help lead the fight in the Senate to delay this BRAC round  Closing domestic bases before we complete the Overseas BRAC and QDR would be putting the cart before the horse     said Thune   As a member of the Armed Services Committee  Thune has already raised concerns about the timing of the current BRAC round and is calling for hearings on the Pentagon  s BRAC recommendations   In addition to calling for Senate hearings  Senator Thune plans to introduce bipartisan legislation to stop or delay the BRAC round from moving forward  saying all legislative options are on the table     I expect the Senate Armed Services Committee to take a hard look at why  when  and where bases should close  With so many threats facing America  and with Ellsworth serving such a vital role in the War on Terror  closing Ellsworth would weaken America  s homeland security     said Thune    I will fight to delay the current BRAC round until we have a better understanding of our future military and security needs      Immediately following today  s announcement  Thune spoke with members of the Ellsworth Task Force in Rapid City  The Senator met with the full Task Force during a trip to South Dakota last week and pledged to continue to closely coordinate with the group     The Ellsworth Task Force has done everything it can to date  and we will continue to do everything we can in the future  Working with the rest of South Dakota  s Congressional delegation and Governor Rounds  we will keep fighting to convince the BRAC Commission of the importance of Ellsworth     Thune said    For decades  Ellsworth has defended our state and nation  Now  we will unite to defend Ellsworth      The Secretary  s recommendations will now be reviewed by the nine member BRAC Commission  The review will include field hearings and base visits by the BRAC Commission  Senator Thune is calling on the BRAC Commission to hold a field hearing in Rapid City and visit Ellsworth Air Force Base as soon as possible                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
