     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                                      John Thune statement on Energy Bill                June 28th  2005   Washington  D C      Today  s vote is a major step towards a national energy policy that promotes ethanol and creates jobs  The Senate bill makes ethanol a cornerstone of our energy policy and creates jobs in America  s heartland  Since the Senate version includes the Domenici Thune ethanol amendment for an 8 billion gallon Renewable Fuels Standard  we are in a strong position to dramatically increase ethanol use  Today  s high gas prices reflect Congress  s failure to pass an energy bill in recent years  Passing a national energy plan is long overdue  I hope Congress moves quickly to send a final energy bill to the President        Senator John Thune                                                                                                                                                SR 493
