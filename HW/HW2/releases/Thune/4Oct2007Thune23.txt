following Senate passage of the FY2008 Defense Appropriations bill  which included several requests Senator Thune made on behalf of various South Dakota defense related initiatives     After months of attempts by the Democrat Leadership to improperly use this important military funding bill as a political football  I am pleased that the Senate has finally gotten some of its work done  The significant funding in this bill would not only help our entire Armed Forces  it would directly enhance South Dakota s defense related operations  These projects represent important research and new technology that will create jobs  boost our state s economy and provide for a stronger  safer America   Thune said    The FY2008 Defense Appropriations bill passed by the Senate today includes the following requests made by Senator Thune    400 000 for the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to study Improvised Explosive Device  IED  simulation in different soils to develop tools to design countermeasures for these explosive devices   300 000 for the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology and the Army Research Laboratory to provide for development of transparent armor for the Army s Future Combat Systems  FCS    There is a need for windows in military vehicles to be both ballistically strong and light   Polycarbonate and polymethylmethacrylate materials offer great promise to improve performance   400 000 for the South Dakota School of Mines and Technology to develop low frequency acoustic shielding rocket payloads technology for the Air Force  This project would reduce sound pressure levels within space vehicles to avoid damage to payloads during launch   2 000 000 for the Next Generation Lightweight Electric Drive Systems for Army Weapon Systems at Dakota Power Incorporated in Rapid City  which provides a reduction in size and weight  which can enhance performance for FCS vehicles  UAVs and ROVs   4 000 000 for the Advanced Electronics Rosebud Integration Center  AERIC    Army Missile Defense program  The Rosebud Sioux Tribe advances the capabilities of the Army defense system electronics by reducing size  weight  and cost of electronic circuit cards  components  wire harnesses and electronic cabling with an emphasis to reduce hazardous substances materials and employ lead free components in micro electronic products   4 000 000 for the Rosebud Sioux Tribe s Alternative Power Technology  APT  for Missile Defense program  which advances  adapts and demonstrates alternative technology to meet Army requirements for stealth  short to mid range energy needs with minimal sustainable logistics   A prototype device will harness solar energy converted to narrow wavelengths and will validate alternative power electronic controls   5 800 000 for the HiSentinel program at Aerostar International Inc   in Sioux Falls  which provides a long duration unmanned airship for 24 7 capability for intelligence  surveillance  communications and networking   Current platforms are limited to short duration missions of 24 hours or less  this provides an unmanned airship capable of carrying different payloads for durations greater than 30 days   2 000 000 for the Friction Stir Welding  FSW  Qualification for Aging Weapons Systems Structural Repair program at H F  Webster Engineering Services in Rapid City  which provides for the qualification of Laser Engineered Net Shaping and Friction Stir Welding technologies and the development of a mobile friction stir welding capability   This has significant potential for extending the structural life and reducing the cost of sustaining aging weapons systems   5 800 000 for the Integrated Mechanical Diagnostics Health and Usage Management System  IMDS  and Condition Based Maintenance  CBM  for CH 53 at Goodrich Corp  Vergennes  VT and Raven Industries in Sioux Falls  The IMDS automates and simplifies maintenance tasks and collects data to support the transition to CBM   The Marines have purchased over 50 IMDS for the 148 aircraft fleet and it has provided a significant improvement in readiness rates and the ability to maintain aircraft while improving accuracy of the fleet health   49 500 000 for LITENING 4th Generation  LG4  Advanced Targeting Pods for Air National Guard  F 16 and A 10 Aircraft  Advanced Targeting Pods will help the Air National Guard with precision strike capability  training and counter IED operations   It will also help support Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom as well as Homeland Security and Disaster Relief capabilities   5 700 000 for Smart Bomb Rack Unit Upgrade for B 1Bs at Ellsworth AFB and Dyess AFB  The S BRU increases weapon load out by 25   reduces mission turn around time and the logistics footprint by 30    Upgrading the BRU 56 to the S BRU  the B 1 will be capable of carrying 30 inch  as well as 14 inch weapons on a single CBM type   Multiple CBM configurations will not be needed and maintenance will be reduced  10 000 000 for a 16 Carry Adapter for B 1Bs at Ellsworth AFB and Dyess AFB  This 16 Carry Adapter fitting for the B 1 bomber will improve its flexibility and reduce its deployment footprint   The adapter increases B 1 load out of JDAM bombs from 14 per aircraft to 48   It also exploits the B 1 s flexibility to employ multiple types of weapons in a single sortie     The Senate bill now goes into conference to be reconciled with the Defense Appropriations bill that was passed earlier this year by the House of Representatives   Sadly  so far this year  none of the 12 annual appropriation measures have been sent to the President for his consideration despite the fact that the new Fiscal Year started on October 1  2007
