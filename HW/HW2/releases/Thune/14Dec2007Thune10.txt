Farm Bill Thune s Provisions and Amendments Make Bill Better for South Dakota          December 14th  2007   Washington  D C    The United States Senate today passed the 2007 Farm Bill  H R  2419  by a vote of 79 to 14  after weeks of stalled debate  Senator John Thune  a member of the Senate Agriculture Committee  was instrumental in shaping the bill which outlines our nation s agriculture policy through 2012    The 2007 Farm Bill is a winner for South Dakota  Our state s economy is built around agriculture  and this bill will help strengthen family farms and ranches and rural communities   said Thune   This bill builds on the successful 2002 Farm Bill and makes great strides in advancing renewable fuels production     The Senate Agriculture committee has held 29 full committee hearings on the Farm Bill reauthorization  Earlier this year  Senator Thune hosted an Energy Subcommittee field hearing in Brookings  SD to explore the possibility of expanding cellulosic ethanol production  Following the field hearing in Brookings  Senator Thune successfully worked to include a comprehensive biofuels provision in the Farm Bill Energy Title to jumpstart cellulosic ethanol production  Thune also Chaired the Ag Posse  a group of Senators who are not members of the Senate Ag Committee  but who represent states with agricultural interests  The Ag Posse provided these Senators the chance to meet informally with Senate Republican Agriculture Committee members to discuss the 2007 Farm Bill  and related issues    We have a tremendous obligation  through the Farm Bill  to every American farmer and rancher to responsibly provide assistance when and where it is needed in an efficient and timely manner  This bill preserves a proven direct and counter cyclical payment safety net  an expanded Conservation Title  and an Energy Title that will move Rural America into efficient alternative fuel production     This bill also continues our great strides in ethanol development  both in corn based ethanol and cellulosic ethanol  I am proud of our work to secure  25 million in mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative and the inclusion of the Biofuels Innovation Program to encourage growing energy dedicated crops and incentivizing nearly 60 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol    Another important component of this Farm Bill includes a permanent disaster program  This program would provide  5 billion in timely assistance to both crop and livestock producers when losses occur due to natural disasters  Senator Thune has fought tirelessly for ad hoc disaster programs for the past several years and recognizes the importance of including a permanent disaster program in the Farm Bill  Eligibility for assistance under the Disaster Title requires that a producer participate in crop insurance  which will strengthen the crop insurance program and encourage producers to better manage their risk  The House did not include a permanent disaster program in its version of the 2007 Farm Bill    Today  the Senate acted to end the politics of ad hoc disaster programs  South Dakota s farm and ranch families should not have to wait for several years for assistance when disaster strikes   said Thune   Senator Thune s Farm Bill Priorities Retained in Final Senate Passed Bill   Biofuels Innovation Program This Thune provision in the Farm Bill Energy Title would provide a cost share payment and per acre rental payment to producers who have committed to growing energy dedicated crops for a local biorefinery  This program would also provide a per ton payment to farmers for collecting  storing  and transporting biomass  such as corn cobs  to cellulosic ethanol plants  In total  this program will provide almost  160 million in mandatory funding to producers to jumpstart the cellulosic ethanol industry  The per ton payment alone would incentivize almost 60 million gallons of cellulosic ethanol production    Conservation The Senate bill includes a continuation of the 39 2 million acre Conservation Reserve Program  CRP  acreage cap that Senator Thune fought for when he helped draft the 2002 Farm Bill  Several of Senator Thune s recommendations to strengthen and reauthorize the Wetlands Reserve Program and Grasslands Reserve Program were included in the Conservation Title  Overall  the Senate passed bill includes an additional  1 3 billion for conservation programs   Loan Deficiency Payments  LDPs  Senator Thune preserved a critical component of the Farm Bill family farm safety net  A Thune amendment  passed in the Agriculture Committee  removed a potentially harmful requirement in the Committee s bill that would negatively affect all grain producers by requiring that they sell their crop at the time of claiming an LDP  which provides a payment to producers in times of low commodity prices    E10 Blend Wall Resolution Senator Thune s  Sense of the Senate  Resolution in the Farm Bill describes the importance of intermediate blends of ethanol in non flex fuel vehicles  More importantly  it directs the Federal Government to approve higher blends of ethanol fuel within one year of the successful completion of all necessary parts studies   This resolution also directs the U S  Department of Agriculture to conduct a study on the rural economic impacts of the E10 blend wall and of increasing the demand for ethanol in general  This study would examine the impact on rural economic activity and job creation if the demand for ethanol is constrained to the E10 blend market and E85 infrastructure and transportation infrastructure continues to expand at current pace    Sun Grant Initiative The Agriculture Committee s bill includes  25 million in mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  which is coordinated by South Dakota State University  Thune has been working with members of the Senate Agriculture Committee to underscore the important renewable fuels research taking place at South Dakota State University and other Land Grant Universities across the country  This provision would provide much needed mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative  while reauthorizing this program through the life of the Farm Bill  Under the Senate 2007 Farm Bill  the Sun Grant Initiative would also be authorized for annual appropriations up to  70 million per year through 2012  The House passed bill does not include any mandatory funding for the Sun Grant Initiative   Stronger Sodsaver Provision Senator Thune was successful in including a common sense sodsaver provision in the final Farm Bill  This provision would not allow crop insurance and Noninsured Crop Disaster Assistance Program  NAP  coverage for crops planted on native sod converted to cropland  Between 2002 and 2005  almost 300 000 acres of native sod in South Dakota were converted from native grassland to cropland  The House passed Farm Bill has a weaker sodsaver provision that only eliminates crop insurance eligibility for four years on native sod after it is converted to cropland   Stronger Mandatory Country of Origin Labeling  COOL  Language Senator Thune requested that the House passed COOL language be strengthened to clarify that all categories of red meat are required to be labeled  At Senator Thune s request  the Agriculture Committee corrected a potentially fatal flaw to the House passed COOL provisions that will make implementing mandatory COOL clear  concise  and beyond legal challenge    Tighter Payment Limitations The Agriculture Committee reported Farm Bill contains significant reform to the payment limitations imposed upon participants in commodity programs  Senator Thune fought for the tighter restrictions in the Committee   which reduce the current payment cap of  360 000 to  100 000 for each individual  This bill also eliminates the  three entity rule  and provides for direct attribution  which means payments would be tracked on a per person or individual basis   Farm Service Agency  FSA  Office Closure Thune s provision would prevent the closing of  Critical Access FSA County Offices   Critical Access FSA County Offices are defined as county FSA offices that were proposed for closure during Calendar Year 2007  Critical Access FSA County Offices would remain open for the life of the 2007 Farm Bill  five years  unless Congress approves of the closures  The House passed Farm Bill includes a 1 year moratorium on all FSA office closures with the exception of those offices with zero employees    Native American Nutrition Tribal Assistance  This Thune provision in the Farm Bill would authorize  5 million per year  for the life of the 2007 Farm Bill  for the purchase and distribution of traditional  locally grown food produced by Native American farmers  ranchers and producers   Expanded Tribal Access to Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program The bill expands the successful Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program to a minimum of 100 Indian Tribal Organizations across the country  thanks to a Thune provision that passed in the Agriculture Committee  Although the House passed bill expanded the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Program nationwide  it did not expand access to Indian Reservations  Under the 2002 Farm Bill  Pine Ridge Indian Reservation was chosen as one of three reservations to participate in the pilot program  The Senate passed bill would expand this program to over 100 Indian Reservations nationwide   Open Fields Legislation In May  Senator Thune joined a bipartisan group of Senators in cosponsoring the Open Fields Act  For the first time ever  federal mandatory funding   20 million per year  will be available to expand the already successful walk in program in South Dakota and in other states  South Dakota landowners voluntarily enroll more than 1 million acres of privately owned land in South Dakota s program every year   Included in the Senate Farm Bill Open Fields language is a provision Senator Thune championed which will give states like South Dakota that publicize their access areas a priority for the  20 million in federal funding   Many provisions of the 2002 Farm Bill expired on September 30th  It is very likely a three month extension of expiring 2002 Farm Bill programs will be passed to allow time for the Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate bills and send a final farm bill to the President for his approval                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
