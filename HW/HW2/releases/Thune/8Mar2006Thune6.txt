     United States Senator   John Thune                                                                  July 31  2008                                                                         Press Releases                                                                   Press Office                                           Contact  Kyle DowneyPhone  202 224 2321           Thune Cosponsors Bill to Allow Gas  Oil Exploration in Gulf of Mexico                                    March 8th  2006   Washington  DC   Senator John Thune this week cosponsored S  2253  legislation that would open up certain areas within Lease Sale 181 in the Gulf of Mexico for oil and gas exploration  Today the Senate Energy Committee passed this legislation  which will now be sent to the Senate floor for consideration    Lease Sale 181 is located in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico that spans 2 9 million acres and would provide the greatest near term option for the additional supply of natural gas in the United States    With the summer driving season around the corner and gas prices on the rise  America must take viable steps to become more energy independent and bring down fuel costs for all consumers   Thune said   The bill I ve cosponsored would open up acres in the Gulf of Mexico known to be rich in untapped oil and natural gas reserves so we can start extracting and using more of our own energy sources   The untapped natural gas in this part of the Gulf would be enough to heat nearly 6 million homes for 15 years  Those are meaningful statistics in states with long and harsh winters like South Dakota    It is not wise for America to rely so heavily on foreign oil  Political unrest and instability in oil producing regions can disrupt our supply at any moment and leave Americans paying burdensome prices not just for utilities but also at the gas pump       Legislation like this is yet another way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and bring down gas prices for all Americans  and I m hopeful my colleagues will join me in passing this bill when it comes to the Senate floor           Provisions of S  2253    Opens an area that is close to existing infrastructure in the Gulf of Mexico and provides the greatest near term option for the additional supply of natural gas in the United States   The lease sale authorized in the bill would bring nearly 5 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to market in the near future  That is enough gas to heat and cool nearly 6 million homes for 15 years  according to the American Gas Association  This untapped resource amounts to more than 25 percent of the total amount of natural gas consumed in America last year  The United States has the highest natural gas prices in the world  Families in the over 60 million homes that use natural gas for heat are struggling to pay their utility bills    The Department of the Interior s Minerals Management Service estimates there are 930 million barrels of undiscovered oil in this region   Does not alter in any way the existing executive or congressional moratoria on the Outer Continental Shelf   Does not allow leasing within a 100 mile area from the coastline of the State of Florida  protecting the viewscapes from the Florida coast                                                                                                                                                 SR 493
