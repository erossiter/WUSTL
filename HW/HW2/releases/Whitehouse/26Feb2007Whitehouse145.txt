SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON LEAD PAINT DECISION
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today issued the following statement on today's Superior Court decision to allow lead abatement to proceed in Rhode Island:  
   "I'm very heartened by Judge Silverstein's ruling to let the jury's decision in our historic lead paint case stand and to proceed to abate the lead. This was a critical victory for our state and our kids, and I congratulate Attorney General Patrick Lynch and his legal team for their outstanding work. We have a significant task of abatement before us, and I hope the parties will move quickly to appoint a special master and begin that important process. This decision is a turning point from litigation to remediation - from fighting to fixing - that is long overdue for the kids whose health is at stake." 
   Whitehouse, who initiated the first state litigation against lead paint manufacturers during his tenure as Rhode Island's Attorney General, is in New Orleans today attending a field hearing of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee on the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.
