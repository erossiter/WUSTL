SEN. WHITEHOUSE TOURS HISPANIC SMALL BUSINESSES
  Tuesday, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force, toured Hispanic small businesses on Providence's Broad Street. The tour gave Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse an opportunity to meet directly with constituents and hear from them about the issues on their minds, from the war in Iraq to securing a better education for young people in the community. "I look forward to continuing to work with the vibrant and growing Latino community in Rhode Island," said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse. "I will take the concerns I've heard today to Washington and continue to fight to make the American dream a reality for more of our families." Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse visited more than 10 local Hispanic-owned businesses on the tour, which began at Compare Supermarket and included stops at Quisqueya Market, Elegant Beauty Salon, and Ada's Creation. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse joined the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force in his first term as Senator. The Task Force was created in 1989 by Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) to expand Congressional awareness of and representation to the Hispanic community. The 110th Congress is the first time the task force will be co-chaired by two Democratic Hispanic Senators, Sens. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) and Robert Menendez (D-N.J.).
