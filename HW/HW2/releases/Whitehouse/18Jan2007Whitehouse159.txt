SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE PASSAGE OF ETHICS REFORM LEGISLATION
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse tonight released the following statement on the Senate's passage of legislation to reform lobbying and ethics rules:  
   "Last November, Rhode Islanders sent a clear message: it's time to clean up Washington. Today, as its first order of business, the new Democratic Senate delivered on its promise, passing tough ethics reform that will go a long way toward ensuring our government reflects the true will of the American people. Corrupt special interests have had far too much power over our political process. I'm proud to be part of this effort to put the people back in charge."
