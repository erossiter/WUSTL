SEN. WHITEHOUSE: SENATE GOP MINORITY AGAIN BLOCKS SENSIBLE STRATEGY TO BRING TROOPS HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement today on the Senate's vote on a measure that would begin redeploying American troops from Iraq in 90 days. The amendment to the Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1585) was offered by Senate Armed Services Committee chairman Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and Senator Jack Reed (D-R.I.) 
   "I share Rhode Islanders' frustration at President Bush's failure to change course in Iraq. That's why I've voted for every measure that would put pressure on the President to redeploy our troops and seek a new direction. It's time - long past time - for our troops to come home.
   "I'm proud that Rhode Island's own Jack Reed is among the leaders of our fight. His amendment today would have set a smart, responsible strategy to safely redeploy American troops - but once again, the Republican minority in the Senate has used Senate rules to block the way.
   "We face a simple question: is it in the long-term best interests of our nation for American troops to remain in Iraq? Americans have overwhelmingly answered no. I will keep fighting to bring our troops home safely, and bring them home soon."
