SEN. WHITEHOUSE TO TAKE PART IN 'SHAPE UP RHODE ISLAND'
  For the next three months, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) will be watching his step - literally - as part of a statewide program to combat obesity. Whitehouse has signed up to participate in Shape Up Rhode Island, a program that focuses on healthier lifestyles and increased physical activity to raise awareness of the problem of obesity nationwide.  
  Whitehouse, along with some of his staff members, will wear pedometers to measure the number of steps taken each day, and report their progress online bi-weekly for twelve weeks. Teams can compete with each other in one or more of the three competition divisions: weight loss, total exercise hours, and pedometer steps. 
  "Between work, picking kids up from school, and the thousand other things our families have to do every day, finding time to exercise can seem impossible - but it can be just as easy as taking the stairs or parking on the other side of the parking lot," Whitehouse said. "Shape Up Rhode Island emphasizes teamwork, so I'm excited that members of my Senate team are joining me to make sure we're getting the exercise we need."
  Nearly 7,000 Rhode Islanders participated in Shape Up Rhode Island in 2007, recording 4.7 billion steps, 327,844 hours of exercise, and 28,519 pounds lost. This year's competition begins Monday, February 4 and runs until April 27. Over 11,000 people have already enrolled. 
  According to the National Institutes of Health, being overweight or obese are known factors for developing Type 2 diabetes, heart disease, high cholesterol, and some forms of cancer. In addition to the health concerns, the Department of Health and Human Services estimated the economic cost of obesity in America to be $117 billion dollars in 2000.
