SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE VOTE ON IRAQ ESCALATION
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) released the following statement following today's Senate vote:  
   "I'm proud that the Democratic leadership brought up this critical vote today. Importantly, the outcome was 56 seeking to vote against the President's escalation of troop levels in Iraq, to 34 seeking to block that vote. 56 to 34 is a strong message. 
   "Yesterday, I spoke again on the Senate floor, and read from a few of the thousands of messages I have received from Rhode Islanders calling on us to bring our troops home. It's troublingly clear the President isn't listening, but the Democrats in the Senate are. We will keep pressure on this administration to change course in Iraq. 
   "If the President does not offer the new direction Americans demand, we will."
