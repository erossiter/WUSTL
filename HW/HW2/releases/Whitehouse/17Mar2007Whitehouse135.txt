SEN. WHITEHOUSE TRAVELS TO IRAQ ON SENATE FACT-FINDING MISSION
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) is in Iraq this weekend to assess the situation on the ground there as part of an official congressional delegation visit.  
   Whitehouse and his colleagues will participate in meetings with soldiers, military leaders, and Iraqi officials. During their return trip, the group plans to visit the Landstuhl Regional Medical Center, where soldiers who have been injured in Iraq and Afghanistan receive treatment. The facility is located near Ramstein Air Base in Germany. 
   "I wanted to come to Iraq to express my gratitude to our men and women in uniform, especially those from Rhode Island, for their courageous service, and to hear directly from them and their leaders, as well as Iraqi officials, about the challenges and dangers they face," Whitehouse said. "For the past two years, Rhode Islanders have told me we need to bring our troops home from Iraq, and I hope to learn more on this trip about steps we can take to effect a rapid and responsible redeployment." 
   U.S. Senator John Sununu (R-N.H.) is leading the trip, with Senators Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) and Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) also participating.
