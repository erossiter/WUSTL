SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUBPOENAS FOR PRESIDENT BUSH ADMINISTRATION OVER WARRANTLESS WIRETAPPING
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on the decision by the chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee to subpoena the Bush White House for documents and other information on the administration's illegal warrantless wiretapping program. 
  Whitehouse serves on the Judiciary Committee and voted last week to authorize the subpoenas. 
  "At every turn, this administration has tried to evade its responsibility to tell the truth - the whole truth - to this Congress and the American people," Whitehouse said. "If the Bush administration believes it can operate entirely outside the rule of law and not be held accountable, it is mistaken." 
  The committee is seeking materials on the administration's legal justification for the program, documents concerning the shutting down of an investigation by a Justice Department internal watchdog office concerning the surveillance, and agreements between the executive branch and telecommunications companies concerning liability for providing information to aid in surveillance efforts.
