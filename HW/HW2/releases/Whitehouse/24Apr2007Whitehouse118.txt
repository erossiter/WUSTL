SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON ARMENIAN GENOCIDE REMEMBRANCE DAY
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today released the following statement commemorating Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day:  
   "The only way to prevent crimes against humanity in the future is to shine light on the past. I'm proud to support the Senate's efforts to recognize the tragedy that befell the Armenians for what it was - a genocide that must never, ever be repeated." 
   Whitehouse is a cosponsor of Senate Resolution 106, which calls on the President to ensure that U.S. foreign policy acknowledges as genocide the killings of 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923.
