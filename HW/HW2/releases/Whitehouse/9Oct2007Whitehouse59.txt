SEN. WHITEHOUSE PRAISES AMERICAN ELECTRIC POWER CLEAN AIR SETTLEMENT
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), who as Rhode Island's Attorney General joined the 1999 federal lawsuit against American Electric Power (AEP), praised today's $4.6 billion settlement to require AEP to cut pollution at its 16 power plants. 
   "This is an historic victory for clean air and the health and safety of the people of Rhode Island," Whitehouse said. "I'm proud that Rhode Island was part of the original lawsuit against American Electric Power, brought during the Clinton administration. We joined that fight because it was the right thing to do for our state and our environment. This settlement will make a significant difference in emissions levels for years to come."
   According to the Department of Justice, under the terms of the settlement AEP will be required to cut air pollution by at least 813,000 tons per year, including the installation of new emission control equipment. AEP will also pay a $15 million penalty, the highest paid by any electric utility in a settlement related to the Clean Air Act's New Source Review provision, and spend $60 million on environmental cleanup projects.
