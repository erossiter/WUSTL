SEN. WHITEHOUSE DECRIES GOP FILIBUSTER OF BILL TO BRING TROOPS HOME
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) commented today on Senate Republicans' filibuster of legislation that, if enacted, would begin redeploying U.S. troops from Iraq: 
  "Over and over again, we've pressured President Bush to change course in Iraq and take action to begin redeploying American troops. And over and over again, this President and Republicans in Congress have stood in the way. 
  "Today was no different. Today, unbelievably, Senate Republicans filibustered a bill to give our troops the resources they need, and to begin bringing them home. 
  "Rhode Islanders, and people all across America, are fed up with a President who failed to listen - and they're furious with Senate Republicans who pay lip service to supporting our troops but refuse to vote for a new direction.
  "We will not stop fighting to bring our troops home." 
   Whitehouse traveled to Iraq in March. He has met with President Bush in the Oval Office to urge him to change course in Iraq.
