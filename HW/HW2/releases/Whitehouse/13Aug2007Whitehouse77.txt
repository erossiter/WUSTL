SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON KARL ROVE'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) released the following statement today on the resignation of Karl Rove: 
  "Karl Rove leaves behind an administration whose relentless pursuit of partisan political gain, at the expense of the principles of justice, our nation's security, and the rule of law, have seriously damaged our credibility at home and around the world. Americans still have significant questions about Mr. Rove's role in the firing of several U.S. attorneys and decisions related to national security, and I trust the Senate will continue to push for answers to those questions."
