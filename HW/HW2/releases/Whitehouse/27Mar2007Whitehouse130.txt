SEN. WHITEHOUSE JOINS DECISIVE SENATE VOTE SETTING DATE FOR IRAQ REDEPLOYMENT
  The Senate took a critical step toward bringing our troops home from Iraq with a vote this evening in support of a March 31, 2008 redeployment date, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) said today. The 50-48 vote defeated an attempt to remove language specifying the date from a bill providing $122 billion in funding for the war. Whitehouse voted in favor of keeping the redeployment date.  
   "The American people have said it's time for a new direction, and both the House and the Senate have listened," Whitehouse said. "Bringing American troops home and handing over security responsibilities to the Iraqis is now our best and only step forward, and I hope the President will not miss this opportunity to change course." 
   The Senate is expected to vote soon on the underlying supplemental war spending bill. Once the Senate's version is reconciled with similar legislation passed by the House of Representatives, the consensus measure will go to the President's desk for signature or veto. 
   Whitehouse traveled to Iraq from March 16-19 to meet with American troops and assess the situation on the ground there. While in country, he met with American military commanders, including General David Petraeus; as well as several high-ranking Iraqi officials and members of the U.S. embassy and intelligence staffs. Whitehouse also spoke with Marines from Rhode Island now serving in Fallujah.
