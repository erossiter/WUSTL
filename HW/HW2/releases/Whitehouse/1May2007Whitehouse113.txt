SEN. WHITEHOUSE MEETS RHODE ISLAND'S TEACHER OF THE YEAR
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met with Catherine Davis Hayes, Rhode Island's 2007 Teacher of the Year, last week in Washington.  
   "Cathy's passion and commitment to education is enriching her students' lives every day," said Whitehouse. "Rhode Island is proud to have her, and I was delighted to talk with her about education reform." 
   Ms. Hayes has been a visual-arts teacher at the Oakland Beach Elementary School in Warwick for 11 years. She is credited for Oakland Beach School's classification as a "SmART School," where arts are placed at the center of the school's curriculum. Oakland Beach is one of 20 SmART schools nationwide, and one of nine in Rhode Island.
