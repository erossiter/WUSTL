SEN. WHITEHOUSE RECEIVES SENATE 'GOLDEN GAVEL' AWARD
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) was presented with the Senate's "Golden Gavel" award today, commemorating 100 hours spent presiding over the Senate in the first session of the 110th Congress.  
  "Presiding over the Senate is one of the great privileges afforded freshmen senators, and I've been excited to take every chance I could to learn more about this institution and my distinguished colleagues," Whitehouse said.
  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.) said: "Senator Whitehouse has truly earned this tremendous recognition. He has been a workhorse not only as the presiding officer - quickly logging 100 hours in that role - but on important legislation in the Judiciary Committee and this body as a whole. I'm certain this is only the first of many accolades Senator Whitehouse will collect during his Senate career."
  In the past few decades, the task of presiding over the Senate has typically fallen to the Senate President pro tempore, usually the longest-serving member of the majority party. That senator often delegates the job to junior members, for whom presiding duties offer the opportunity to gain valuable experience and insight into Senate rules and procedure. The Golden Gavel award was instituted in the 1960s, and is given to senators who preside over 100 hours of Senate business in any single year.
  Whitehouse received the award at the weekly Democratic caucus luncheon. It was originally announced by Majority Leader Reid on the Senate floor on August 3rd, in the waning hours of debate before the Senate adjourned for its yearly August district work period.
