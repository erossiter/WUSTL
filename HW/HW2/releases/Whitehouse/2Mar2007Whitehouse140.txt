HENDRICKEN STUDENT MEETS SEN. WHITEHOUSE IN WASHINGTON
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met this week with Mauri Dimeo, a sophomore at Bishop Hendricken High School, who was visiting Washington as part of the National Young Leaders Conference (NYLC). 
  Dimeo, of Scituate, met with Whitehouse in his Senate office, and discussed his time in Washington thus far and his interests. 
   "It is wonderful to see a young Rhode Islander who is already determined to make positive contributions to our country," said Whitehouse. 
   The NYLC program is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC), a non-partisan, non-profit educational organization. Since its inception in 1985, more than 200,000 young people have participated in CYLC's programs.
