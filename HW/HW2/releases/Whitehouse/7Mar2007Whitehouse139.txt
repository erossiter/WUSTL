SEN. WHITEHOUSE JOINS SENATE DEMOCRATIC HISPANIC TASK FORCE
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) last week joined the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force, chaired by Sen. Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) and Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.). The task force has focused on strengthening relationships with Hispanic leaders and ensuring the issues that matter most to Latinos, including improved access to higher education and health care, are top legislative priorities in the Senate. 
  "No family should have to wonder whether they'll be able to afford a college education for a son or daughter, or quality health care for an older parent," Whitehouse said. "The work of the Senate Democratic Hispanic Task Force goes to the core of the American Dream, and I'm looking forward to working with them and with our vibrant and growing Hispanic community in Rhode Island to make that dream a reality for more of our families." 
   The Senate Hispanic Task Force was created in 1989 by Senator Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) to expand Congressional awareness of and representation to the Hispanic community. The 110th Congress is the first time the task force will be co-chaired by two Democratic Hispanic Senators, Senators Salazar and Menendez.
