SEN. WHITEHOUSE MEETS CRANSTON JUNIOR STATESMAN
  Bart Johnson-Harris, of Cranston, met this week with Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) during his stay in Washington for the Junior Statesman Summer School program. Johnson-Harris will be a senior at the Wheeler School in September.  
  The Junior Statesman Summer School program conducts intensive college-level programs at Georgetown and three college campuses across the country, with programs in U.S. Government, U.S. Foreign Policy, and Law. The course, in conjunction with the school year Junior State of America program, has provided leadership development training for more than 500,000 students since its inception in 1934. During their summer stays in Washington and around the country, students have the opportunity to engage in discussions about policy issues facing the nation with elected officials, members of the media and civic and business leaders.
