WOONSOCKET, WARWICK MENTORING PROGRAMS AWARDED FEDERAL GRANT
  An initiative that connects at-risk children in Warwick and Woonsocket with adult mentors who can make a positive difference in their lives is getting an infusion of federal funds, U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) announced today.  
  The Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership will receive $185,537 from the U.S. Department of Education for mentoring programs for Warwick and Woonsocket students in grades 4-8. 
  "When I was Attorney General, I saw first-hand the enormous change that supportive, involved adults could make in students' lives through the after-school and mentoring programs we built at Oliver Hazard Perry Middle School in Providence," Whitehouse said. "This federal funding, combined with the tireless work of volunteer mentors, will make a real difference in these young people's lives."
  Whitehouse, who helped kick off the Woonsocket mentoring program at Pothier Elementary School in April, wrote to the Department of Education to support the partnership's grant application. He also co-signed a letter with several other Senators to express strong support for providing $100 million in federal funding for mentoring programs in fiscal year 2008.
  The Rhode Island Mentoring Partnership recruits, trains, and supports adults to serve as positive role models for disadvantaged, at-risk children - young people with emotional difficulties, low self-esteem, poor peer relationships, or low academic performance - across the state. Volunteer mentors commit to serving at least one hour per week for one year, and receive regular training from partnership staff.
