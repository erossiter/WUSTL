SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a former United States attorney and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today issued the following statement on the resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales: 
   "It's been clear for months that Alberto Gonzales's resignation is in the best interest of the country. This is also good news for the Department of Justice, but a great deal of work remains to be done to restore Americans' confidence in this great Department, to restore its traditions and spirit, and to restore its ability to fairly and dispassionately enforce the law. Fortunately, there are many people of both parties who know and love this Department who I'm sure would be glad to help. 
   "I hope that whoever the President nominates to be he new Attorney General at this critical time will put the interests of the Department, its employees, and the American people foremost - before partisanship, and before politics."
