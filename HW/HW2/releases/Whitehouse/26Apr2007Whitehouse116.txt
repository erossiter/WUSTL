SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT COMMEMORATING ANNIVERSARY OF VERMONT CIVIL UNIONS LAW
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, issued the following statement commemorating the 7th anniversary of the legal recognition of civil unions in Vermont.  
   "Seven years ago Vermont took a courageous step forward for civil rights in this country through the civil unions law," said Whitehouse. "I'm proud of the efforts of Rhode Island's gay community in their fight for equal marriage in our state, and I'll do all I can in the Senate to support this important battle." 
   On April 26, 2000, Vermont became the first state to grant legal recognition of same-sex couples through civil unions.
