SENS. BOXER, LAUTENBERG, WHITEHOUSE JOIN CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO DISCUSS DEMOCRATS' EFFORTS TO MAKE AMERICA MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT
  Sen. Barbara Boxer, Chairman of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works, and Sens. Frank Lautenberg and Sheldon Whitehouse joined environmentally friendly CEOs Tuesday to discuss the Senate's energy legislation and how its energy-efficiency provisions would stimulate innovation and competition, strengthen our economy, and protect our environment. Democrats are moving ahead this week with The Renewable Fuels, Consumer Protection, and Energy Efficiency Act of 2007, which will also create jobs, protect consumers and strengthen national security.  
   "A sound energy policy must include real steps to reduce global warming pollution," Boxer said. "By making government buildings more energy-efficient, ensuring the government buys fuel-efficient vehicles, and providing support for cities and counties to improve their own buildings, this energy bill would go a long way toward making the government a model of energy efficiency, an important first step in addressing the challenge of global warming."
  Said Lautenberg: "Our current energy policy is taking a tremendous toll on the bottom line of families and businesses across the nation. The Senate's energy bill moves us in the right direction by reducing our dependence on foreign oil and creating markets for alternative energy, while combating global warming. I am pleased my green buildings bill is a part of this effort to set a bold, new energy policy for America." 
  "Senate Democrats understand that our energy needs in the future must be met in ways that safeguard our air, water, and open spaces today," Whitehouse said. "I'm proud to support legislation that will make the federal government a leader in energy-efficient, environmentally-sound building standards - further reducing the threat of global warming.".
