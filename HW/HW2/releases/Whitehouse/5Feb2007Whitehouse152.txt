SEN. WHITEHOUSE MEETS WITH BLOCK ISLAND STUDENTS
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) last week met with six Block Island High School students visiting Washington as part of their participation in the national Close Up Foundation. 
  The students, all seniors, have been in Washington for the Foundation's week-long learning adventure designed to develop the students' knowledge and interest in civics. The students, accompanied by Marlee Lacoste of Block Island, visited the capital's many museums, monuments and memorials while learning about participatory democracy. Meeting and talking with Senator Whitehouse capped off their week in Washington. 
   "Meeting with young Rhode Islanders, many of them visiting Washington for the first time, is very exciting," said Whitehouse. "I hope their participation in this program and the opportunity to talk with their representatives in Congress will help encourage some of them to enter public service." 
   The students talked with Whitehouse about their concerns regarding the Medicare prescription drug program, the potential for future internships in Washington, and their shared love of Block Island's natural beauty. 
   The Close Up Foundation was established in 1971 with the mission to "inform, inspire, and empower people to exercise the rights and accept the responsibilities of citizens in a democracy." Annually 20,000 students, teachers, and other adults take part in the foundation's Washington, D.C. programs. Since its inception, over 600,000 people have participated in the program.
