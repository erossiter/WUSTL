SEN. WHITEHOUSE MEETS HOPKINTON, WEST GREENWICH HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI) met Thursday with two high school students visiting Washington as part of their participation in the National Young Leaders Conference (NYLC). 
   Theresa Fuller of Hopkinton, a sophomore at Chariho Regional High School, and Geoffrey Swann of West Greenwich, a junior at Exeter West Greenwich High School, had been in Washington as part of their six-day program since Tuesday. The program is designed to give students a better understanding of their roles as citizens and leaders in a democracy. 
   "Visiting Washington and speaking with me and their other representatives in Congress will, hopefully, develop a further interest in public affairs," said Whitehouse. "I appreciate the efforts of these young Rhode Islanders to learn more about their government." 
   The students had an opportunity to see Senator Whitehouse questioning Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson at a Budget Committee hearing, and shared their Washington site-seeing itinerary. 
   The NYLC program is sponsored by the Congressional Youth Leadership Council (CYLC), a non-partisan, non-profit educational organization. Since its inception in 1985, more than 200,000 young people have participated in CYLC's programs.
