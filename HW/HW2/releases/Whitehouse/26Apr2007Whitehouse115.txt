SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT PRAISES SENATE PASSAGE OF IRAQ BILL SETTING GOAL FOR REDEPLOYMENT
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today released the following statement:  
   "Today, once again, the Senate has demonstrated our commitment to a new direction in Iraq - and once again, America is waiting to see whether this President will heed the calls of the people he serves to change course and bring our troops home. 
   "I was proud to vote today for a measure that not only ensures our troops have the resources they need, but also requires President Bush to take action to begin a redeployment and sets a goal for when that redeployment will be complete. 
   "I urge the President to listen to the Congress and the American people, and to sign this bill into law. If he does not, he will once again have failed our soldiers, our nation, and our future."
