ON EARTH DAY, SEN. WHITEHOUSE CALLS FOR ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE
  Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works (EPW) Committee, today released the following statement:  
   "For the first time in many years, on this Earth Day our leaders in the United States Senate understand the dangers we face from unchecked climate change. The long-term effects of global warming, including the prospect of a dramatic increase in sea levels, could be devastating to our state. 
   "I support legislation that would push for an 80 percent reduction in carbon emissions by 2050, the most aggressive measure now before the Senate, and will continue to push hard for urgent action to reverse the threat of climate change and reduce America's reliance on foreign oil. That's just the beginning, because our environmental problems are legion, but it is an important beginning." 
   This evening at 5 p.m., Whitehouse will host his second community dinner at the Cranston Senior Center, on 1070 Cranston Street in Cranston, to hear from local residents and share news about the Senate's work to combat the threat of global warming.
