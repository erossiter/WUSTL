SEN. WHITEHOUSE ISSUES STATEMENT IN MEMORY OF REP. CROWLEY
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today issued this statement on the news that Representative Paul Crowley, of Newport, passed away this morning: 
   "Paul Crowley put Rhode Island's children first - and built a legacy of achievement for our schools that will endure for generations. Newport, the city he loved, and the Ocean State, whose people he served unselfishly and with great integrity, are less today because he is no longer with us. Sandra and I offer our deepest condolences to Diana, to Paul's family, and to so many friends and colleagues who knew and cared about this extraordinary Rhode Islander."
