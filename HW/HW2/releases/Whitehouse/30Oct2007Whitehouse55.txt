SEN. WHITEHOUSE ADDRESSES LATINO YOUTH SUMMIT
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) addressed the first-ever Latino Youth Summit, a two-day event that brought together Hispanic students from around the country to discuss issues important to them and their families.  
   "As I look out at a very intelligent, energetic and motivated group of young people, I hope that, before too long, some of you are sitting where I am today," Whitehouse said. 
   Whitehouse, a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Hispanic Task Force, spoke to the group October 17 about civil rights issues, including combating hate crimes and protecting the right to vote. Other policy issues discussed included civic engagement, education, immigration, and juvenile justice.
   Whitehouse also met with Ana Rodriguez, 22, a Providence native and Rhode Island College student, who came to Washington as a participant in the program.
