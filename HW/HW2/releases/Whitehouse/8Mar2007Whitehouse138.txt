SEN. WHITEHOUSE COSPONSORS DEMOCRATIC JOINT RESOLUTION TO BRING TROOPS HOME FROM IRAQ
  In a major step toward a change of course in Iraq, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) today joined Senate Democratic leaders in announcing a new consensus measure that would aim to redeploy combat forces from Iraq by March 31, 2008. The proposed joint resolution, which Whitehouse cosponsored, calls for President Bush to transition the mission for U.S. forces in Iraq, beginning their phased redeployment no later than 120 days after the resolution's enactment.  
   "Over and over, we have sent this President the strong message that the American people want a new direction in Iraq - and over and over, he has refused to listen," Whitehouse said. "This measure keeps strong pressure on this administration and says very clearly that it's time for Iraqis to take responsibility for the security and governance of their country, and for our troops to come home. This is a strong step forward, and I'm proud to be a cosponsor with Jack Reed of this important measure." 
   Last month, Whitehouse and a majority of the Senate voted against the President's escalation of troop levels in Iraq. Whitehouse has been a strong advocate for laying out a new strategy for Iraq and for redeploying our troops.
