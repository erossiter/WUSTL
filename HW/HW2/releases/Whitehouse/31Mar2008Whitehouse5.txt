SEN. WHITEHOUSE SAYS AMERICA NEEDS NEW HUD SECRETARY WHO WILL PUT HOMEOWNERS FIRST
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) issued the following statement in response to the resignation today of Alphonso Jackson, Secretary of the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD): 
   "Secretary Jackson's resignation amidst allegations of corruption shows once again the culture of the Bush Administration putting cronyism and partisanship before responsible governance. From 'Heckuva Job, Brownie' to former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to Jackson, we've seen far too many Bush officials whose defining characteristic was loyalty to the President and his political supporters, rather than competence in their jobs.
   "As millions of hard-working Americans struggle with the worsening economy, they deserve a government that looks out for them, not the special interests. President Bush has already done too little to assist families who face foreclosure of their homes. I urge the President to quickly nominate a successor who will focus his or her full attention on helping American homeowners - not enriching cronies and political allies at taxpayer expense."
