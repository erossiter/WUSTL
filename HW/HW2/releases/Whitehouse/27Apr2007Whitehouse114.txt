SEN. WHITEHOUSE MEETS CUMBERLAND STUDENT RECOGNIZED AT NATIONAL SCIENCE COMPETITION
  U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.) met this week with Providence College student Joshua Malouin of Cumberland, R.I., whose project on cellular biology could have implications for cancer research. Malouin, a sophomore biology student, was one of 80 students selected by the Council on Undergraduate Research (CUR) to participate in a poster session on Capitol Hill.  
   "I want to applaud Joshua for his outstanding achievement," Whitehouse said. "I believe investment in education and science research should be a national priority." 
   More than 400 students from around the country submitted entries to the competition, which culminated with the poster display in the Rayburn House Office Building. CUR is a professional society that promotes the participation of undergraduate college students in scientific and engineering research. The organization was founded in 1978 by chemists from private liberal arts colleges to provide information about research being conducted in academia. Today there are nearly 3,000 members and 492 participating colleges and universities. 
   This year's competition coincides with the Senate's passage of the bipartisan America COMPETES (Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science) Act that encourages science innovators throughout the federal government to promote education and science research. Whitehouse voted to support the measure. A member of the Senate Budget Committee, Whitehouse has also supported significant increases in funding for education and the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
