SENATE GIVES FINAL APPROVAL TO SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate gave its final approval today for a Supplemental Appropriations Bill that includes $30.4 million to rebuild and restore California levees, $227.5 million for advance procurement of C-17s, and hundreds of millions to reimburse the State for emergency work on California's federal roads and highways, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced.  
   Rebuilding and Restoring California Levees 
   * $30.4 million, including: 
   - $7.1 million - for South Sacramento Streams 
   - $23.3 million - for Sacramento River Bank Protection 
   "This funding is a critical piece of the puzzle to restoring our levees," Senator Feinstein said. "The Army Corps of Engineers has indicated that this money could be spent immediately on critical projects. If we do not act, the risks are clear - to lives, to property, and to drinking water supplies. We've got to learn the lessons of Katrina. We've got to restore our levees. And this funding is a significant down payment to fulfilling the federal commitment." 
   C-17 Advance Procurement 
   * $227.5 million - for advance procurement to keep line Open Beyond 2008 
   "The C-17 has proved itself time and time again - both in military or humanitarian missions," Senator Feinstein said. "This demonstrates that support for the C-17 in Congress is strong, and we will do our part to keep the line open through 2008 and beyond." 
   "I think the 6,500 Californians who build the C-17 can breathe a sigh of relief. The fight is not over, but this is a step in the right direction." 
   Transportation Reimbursement 
   * $309.1 million - to reimburse the State of California for emergency work on California's federal roads and highways (without affecting Katrina-related relief) including: 
   * $245 million - for storms in Santa Barbara, Orange, San Diego, Los Angeles, Ventura, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Kern Counties (December 2004); 
   * $9.3 million - for Flash Flood in Death Valley National Park and Inyo County ( August 15, 2004); 
   * $3.6 million - for San Simeon Earthquake Damage in San Luis Obispo County ( December 23, 2003); and 
   * $51.2 million - for storms in Del Norte, Mendocino, Trinity, Humboldt, Contra Costa, Marin, Alameda, Solano, Napa, San Mateo, and Santa Cruz Counties (December 2002). 
   "This ensures that California gets reimbursed for emergency transportation funding," Senator Feinstein said. "In a time of tight State budgets, this funding is welcome. It will go to reimburse CalTrans for emergency work performed on federal roads and highways."
   The bill now goes to the President for his signature.
