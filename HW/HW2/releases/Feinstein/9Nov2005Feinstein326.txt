SENATOR FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON RESULTS OF CALIFORNIA'S SPECIAL ELECTION
  Statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein on the Results of
  California's Special Election 
   "I cannot remember a California election where virtually every measure on the ballot went down. This is the most significant 'no vote' in modern political California history, and it ought to cause serious reflection by the Governor. 
   California voters strongly rejected every single item on the ballot. I cannot determine fully whether this was due to a careful analysis and rejection of each proposition, or whether it was a significant 'no vote' for calling a special election. 
   The election results should send a strong message that the voters are tired of having issues that should be solved by their elected representatives placed before them on the ballot. I hope Sacramento heeds that message."
