SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SELECTION OF REP. LEWIS AS HOUSE APPROPRIATIONS CHAIR
  "The House Republican Steering Committee made a wise choice when it selected Jerry Lewis as Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee.  
   Jerry Lewis brings to this position a deep understanding of the policymaking process and an ability to work with members from both sides of the aisle. I believe that all Californians will be well represented by the new Chairman of the Appropriations Committee. 
   Representative Lewis and I have worked together for years on issues important to California - including the removal of hazardous fuels from our State's forest and expanding the National Training Center at Fort Irwin while preserving the California desert. I look forward to continuing to work with him on important California priorities."
