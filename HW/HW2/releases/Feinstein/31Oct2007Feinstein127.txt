SEN. FEINSTEIN INTRODUCES NEW MEASURE TO AUTHORIZE THREE WATER SUPPLY PROJECTS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today introduced a measure to authorize three new water supply projects for the greater Los Angeles region. The projects are part of a regional plan developed collectively by water districts in Orange, San Bernardino, and Riverside Counties.  
   In total, the three projects authorized in this bill would increase the region's water supply by 31,000 acre-feet per year, or the water needs for 64,000 households in the region, in an environmentally sustainable manner. 
   "Meeting the growing water needs for Southern California is an important priority for federal, state, and local leaders," Senator Feinstein said. "I believe the plan proposed by the regional agencies on the ground is a step in the right direction. The plan solves many water supply problems, reduces energy consumption, restores habitat, and provides significant jobs and economic benefits to one of the nation's most densely populated areas."
  Specifically, the bill will authorize three regional water supply and watershed projects in Southern California:
   * Authorize $10 million for the design, planning and construction of a natural treatment systems and wetlands for the Santa Ana River.
   * Authorize $26 million for the design, planning and construction of the Lower Chino Dairy Area desalination demonstration and reclamation project.
   * Authorize $12 million for the creation of the Center for Technological Advancement of Membrane Technology and Education. 
   The bill sets the limit for the Federal share of the cost of the projects at 25 percent of the total cost of the project.
   Companion legislation has been introduced in the House by Representative Gary Miller (R-Calif.)
