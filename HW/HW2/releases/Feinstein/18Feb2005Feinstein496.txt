SEN. FEINSTEIN EXPRESSES CONCERNS ABOUT EPA'S PERCHLORATE GUIDELINES
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today expressed concern about the Environmental Protection Agency's establishment of an official reference dose for perchlorate intake from food and water.  
   Senator Feinstein said she was "extremely concerned and disappointed" about the impact of the reference dose of perchlorate on babies and pregnant women. She shared her concerns in a letter to Acting EPA Administrator, Stephen L. Johnson. The letter follows: 
   February 18, 2005 
   Stephen L. Johnson
  Acting Administrator
  Environmental Protection Agency
  Ariel Rios Building
  1200 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW
  Washington, DC 20460 
   Dear Administrator Johnson: 
   I read with great interest the press release issued by your Agency today. While I thank the EPA for establishing a reference dose, I am extremely concerned and disappointed in the statement that "EPA's new RfD [reference dose] translates to a Drinking Water Equivalent Level (DWEL) of 24.5 ppb." 
   While water containing perchlorate at a level of 24.5 ppb may be safe enough for a healthy 170-pound adult, it is not safe enough for babies and pregnant women to drink. I think we can all agree that drinking water should be clean enough for the most vulnerable populations. 
   I hope that your press release did not accurately state EPA's policy and that the EPA will issue a drinking water standard that will protect pregnant women and babies. 
   Efforts by my staff to reach officials at the EPA willing to provide more details about this announcement have been unsuccessful. 
   I look forward to your early reply. 
   Sincerely, 
   Dianne Feinstein
  United States Senator
