SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON IRAQ TROOP WITHDRAWL
  "The New York Times disclosed this weekend that General Casey, the American commander in Iraq, has drafted a plan that projects sharp reductions in the United States military presence there by the end of 2007, with the first cuts coming this September.  
   It is ironic that General Casey's apparent plan to withdraw U.S. forces was disclosed only days after the Bush White House and the Republican leadership in Congress blasted a Democratic call for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own security and government, so that the phased redeployment of U.S. forces from Iraq can begin by year's end.
   This just shows the fallacious rationale of the Republicans. General Casey is doing just what we wanted to ask him to do.
   More than 2,500 lives men and women in our Armed Forces have been killed in Iraq and more than 18,000 have been wounded. And, according to a new report in Sunday's Los Angeles Times, evidence now suggests at least 50,000 Iraqis have been killed since 2003.
   We have now been in Iraq for 3 years and 3 months. The time has come for a phased redeployment to finally begin. In my view, an open-ended commitment is no longer sustainable in Iraq. 
   It is time for the White House and the Republican leadership in Congress to stop the sloganeering and political posturing that marked the debate last week and listen to General Casey and Iraqi leaders like National Security Advisor Mowaffak al-Rubaie who are hoping to see a redeployment of our troops in Iraq."
