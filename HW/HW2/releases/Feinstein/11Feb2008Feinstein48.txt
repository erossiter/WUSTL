SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON PASSING OF REP. LANTOS
  "Tom Lantos was an amazing person. He was a Holocaust survivor, a diligent and effective protector of human rights, and a great member of Congress. He was a personal friend, and a mentor. He stood tall in the most difficult of circumstances. And he represented his district with a dignity and a forcefulness that's unprecedented. It's a great loss. 
   Tom Lantos was one of the strong pillars of the House of Representatives. He will be missed as a leader, and he will be missed as a friend. My heart and thoughts go to his lifelong love, Annette, and to his remarkable family. The Bay Area has lost a great one."
