SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON BURMA JUNTA PUTTING AUNG SAN SUU SKI'S HEALTH, SAFETY AT RISK
  "I condemn the decision by Burma's ruling military junta to restrict Aung San Suu Kyi's access to her doctor and to remove her personal security.  
 Once again, the State Peace and Development Council (SPDC) has shown its utter contempt for the safety and welfare of one of the world's most distinguished Nobel Peace Prize winners and the democratic aspirations of the Burmese people. 
   I urge the President and Secretary of State to weigh in on this issue. The international community must speak with one voice in denouncing these actions and making it clear to the regime that it is responsible for Suu Kyi's life and any harm done to her will not be tolerated. Suu Kyi should be released immediately and unconditionally."
