SEN. FEINSTEIN ANNOUNCES THREE REGIONAL CALIFORNIA AIRPORTS WILL SOON BE ELIGIBLE FOR AIRPORT SCREENERS
  Three California airports will be eligible to receive federal passenger screeners under a measure included in the FY'07 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations conference report, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced today.  
   The DHS Appropriations Conference Report directs the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to provide screeners to airports requesting such service.  Both the House and Senate are expected to take up the legislation before going into a pre-election recess this weekend. 
   Senator Feinstein, a member of the DHS Appropriations Conference Committee, helped ensure that the language would apply to three California airports currently seeking to be federalized - the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport, the Visalia Municipal Airport, and the Palm Springs International Airport. 
   "It is critical that the Transportation Security Administration provide the necessary federal screeners to ensure sufficient safety measures are taken and reliable service is provided at regional airports that are so important to their local communities." Senator Feinstein said. "This legislation will help California airports and passengers receive the service they deserve." 
   To provide commercial service, airports are required to have TSA or TSA -contracted screeners to inspect luggage, screen passengers and conduct other security related measures. Currently, there are about 24 commercial airports and heliports in the United States, including the three California airports, which have requested TSA screening, but continue to operate with temporary screening or none at all.
