SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON SAN PABLO INDIAN CASINO AGREEMENT
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif) today urged the California Legislature to reject a proposed deal between the State of California and the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians that would create a huge casino in the heart of the Bay Area. 
   "I find the proposed casino agreement reached by Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger and the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians totally unacceptable, " Senator Feinstein said. "To compromise a community so the State can get 25 percent of the casino's revenue in unconscionable.
   "If unchecked, this agreement could result in the development of a six-to-eight story casino with 5,000 slot machines - more than any casino in Las Vegas . Such a huge casino will have a serious impact on the entire East Bay community, generating traffic congestion and environmental damage, and potentially increasing crime."
   Senator Feinstein noted that the proposal is but one of about 30 pending Tribal proposals for developing gambling casinos on off-reservation property.
   "At some point, Californians are going to have to come to grips with the impact of the tremendous growth of gambling in the State, without sufficient oversight and regulatory authority," Senator Feinstein said.
   "Casinos of the size contemplated in San Pablo can cause serious problems for the region. I stand in strong opposition to this development. It is also a good lesson that legislative riders struck into appropriations bills in the dark of night can have major unanticipated consequences."
