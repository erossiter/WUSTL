SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON RECESS APPOINTMENT OF JOHN BOLTON AS U.S. AMBASSADOR TO U.N.
  Statement by Sen. Dianne Feinstein:
   "The recess appointment of John Bolton to be the next U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations demonstrates the undue stubbornness of an Administration that seems more concerned with getting its own way than in providing the nation with the best possible representation at the UN.  
   I believe it is a serious mistake to send an ambassador to the UN who has shown an unrestrained contempt for diplomacy and international treaties and whose credibility is seriously weakened because of his failure to be confirmed by the Senate. 
   In a letter to Senator Richard Lugar, Chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee, 102 former American diplomats representing both Democratic and Republican Administrations urged the Committee to reject Mr. Bolton's nomination because of his 'exceptional record of opposition to efforts to enhance U.S. security through arms control.' 
   John Bolton has placed his faith in a unilateral, go-it-alone foreign policy that has stretched our military thin and I believe his inability to be an effective and constructive ambassador could produce dire consequences for American foreign policy."
