SEN. FEINSTEIN TO MANAGE SENATE FLOOR DEBATE ON ETHICS, LOBBYING REFORM BILL
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), in her role as incoming Senate Rules Committee Chairman, will manage floor debate on S. 1, the Senate ethics and lobbying reform bill.
   Also managing the bill will be the Ranking Member of the Rules committee, Senator Bob Bennett (R-Utah), and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Government Affairs Committee, Senators Joe Lieberman (D-CT), and Susan Collins (R-ME). 
   Floor consideration of the legislation is expected to begin Monday, January 8 and last approximately two weeks.
   "In the last election, the message was loud and clear: It's time to change the way business is done in the nation's capitol," Senator Feinstein said. "Passage of this ethics reform package is the straightest, simplest thing we could do to show we have a different Congress in place." 
   Following is a summary of the bill:
   Ethics
   An Overwhelming Majority of Senators Voted Last Year to Stiffen Ethics Rules and Take a First Step Towards Cleaning Up Washington.
