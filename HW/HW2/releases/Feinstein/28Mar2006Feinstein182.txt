SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON DEATH OF BRAYTON WILBUR
  Statement of Senator Feinstein
  On the Death of Brayton Wilbur
   "San Francisco lost one of its most dynamic and determined citizens yesterday. 
   Brayton Wilbur served as President of the San Francisco Symphony when I was Mayor. He was a wonderful President. He reversed the symphony's financial situation and put it on the road to stability. He made sure that the music was always center-stage. And when Brayton took on the job, you knew he would succeed. 
   Brayton was a wonderful man - a great husband, father, grandfather, and an irreplaceable friend. He will certainly be missed."
