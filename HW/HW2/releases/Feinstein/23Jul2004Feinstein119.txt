SENATE APPROVES SENS. FEINSTEIN, KYL RESOLUTION CALLING ON IRAN TO HALT ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM
  The Senate last night approved a resolution calling on Iran to cease its efforts to produce nuclear weapons and come into compliance under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and its other international obligations. The resolution was sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Richard Lugar (R-Ind.) and Joe Biden (D-Del.) in the Senate and Representatives Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) and Tom Lantos (D-Calif.) in the House. 
   The resolution also calls on the member states of the United Nations to join together to prevent Iran from pursuing a nuclear weapons program and asks members of the Security Council to take appropriate action against Iran if the nation does not fulfill its obligations to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).
   "It has become increasingly clear that Tehran is determined to develop nuclear weapons and substantially alter the balance of power in the Middle East. The time has come for the international community to speak with one voice and urge Iran to abandon its attempts to acquire nuclear weapons," Senator Feinstein said. "By approving this resolution, Congress is sending a clear message to the Iranian Government to live up to its commitments and legal obligations."
   Specifically, the resolution calls on the Government of Iran to:
   * Immediately and permanently cease all efforts to acquire sensitive nuclear fuel cycle capabilities, and in particular, all uranium enrichment activities, including related importing and manufacturing activities and the testing of related equipment;
   * Comply with its international commitments and to rescind its decisions to: manufacture and construct centrifuges, produce feed material that could be used in those centrifuges, and construct a heavy water moderated reactor that could be used for plutonium production;
   * Honor its stated commitments and legal obligations to: grant IAEA inspectors prompt, full and unrestricted access, to cooperate fully with the investigation of its nuclear activities, and demonstrate a new openness and honesty about all its nuclear programs.
   "I firmly believe that the Iranian people desire to see their country break its ties with the past and commit itself to a future based on democracy, human rights, and the rule of law," Senator Feinstein said. "If they are to realize that dream, the United States must work closely with our friends and allies in the international community to put pressure on Iran to abandon its nuclear weapons program, cease its support for terror, and become a positive force for change in the Middle East."
   The resolution also expresses the Sense of the Congress that the United States:
   * Condemns the failure of the Government of Iran for nearly two decades to report material, facilities, and activities to the IAEA in contravention of its obligations under its Safeguards Agreement;
   * Condemns Iran's continuing deceptions and falsehoods to the IAEA and the international community about its nuclear programs and activities;
   * Concurs with the conclusion reached in the U.S. Department of State's Annual Noncompliance Report that Iran is pursuing a program to develop nuclear weapons;
   * Urges the President to provide to the IAEA whatever financial, material, or intelligence resources are necessary to enable the IAEA to fully investigate Iran 's nuclear activities;
   * Calls upon all states party to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty to use appropriate means to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons;
   * Urges the IAEA Board of Governors to report to the United Nations Security Council that Iran has been in noncompliance with its agreement with the IAEA; and,
   * Urges the UN Security Council, immediately upon receiving any report of violations from the IAEA, to address the threat to international peace and security posed by Iran's nuclear weapons program and take such action as may be necessary.
