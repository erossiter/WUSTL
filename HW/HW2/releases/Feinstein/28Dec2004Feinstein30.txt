SEN. FEINSTEIN URGES ELIGIBLE SENIORS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF MEDICARE BENEFIT
  With 2004 drawing to a close, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today urged low-income Medicare beneficiaries to take advantage of a benefit available to them for a $600 credit toward prescription drug purchases.  
   "Eligible Medicare beneficiaries should know that they can get a $600 credit on the prescription drug discount card to defray the costs of medications," Senator Feinstein said. "The year is almost over and the deadline to enroll is looming for those who have not already taken advantage of the new Medicare prescription drug benefit." 
   The $600 credit is available for Medicare recipients who earn less than $12,123 ($16,362 for couples) as long as they do not have coverage from a current or former employer or from Medicaid. If they enroll with a Medicare-approved drug discount card by December 31, they can receive a $600 credit for 2004 and another $600 credit for 2005. 
   Low-income Medicare recipients also will not have to pay the estimated $30 to purchase a drug discount card or for more than 10 percent of their drug costs after they've spent more than $600 on medication. 
   There are about 4 million Medicare recipients in California and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) estimates that 643,000 people in California are eligible for the $600 credits.
