SEN. FEINSTEIN APPLAUDS DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING INCREASES TO HELP SECURE CALIFORNIA PORTS
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today applauded the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for announcing more than $30 million in funding to help secure California's bustling ports, an increase of approximately $17 million over FY06 levels. 
   "The Department of Homeland Security today announced that California would receive more than $30 million in port security funding for Fiscal Year 2007. This is an increase of $17 million over FY 2006 levels, or about twice as much funding," Senator Feinstein said. "This represents a significant boost in funding for California's ports. And it means that these ports will be better equipped to meet the real threats they face on a daily basis. Much more needs to be done, but this is a step in the right direction."
   Under the Department's port security grant funding system, a specified amount of funds are set aside for each tier of ports. For FY2007, the Homeland Security Department awarded a total of $202 million, an increase from $168 million in FY 2006.
   Two California ports were eligible for Tier I funding, the nation's eight ports identified as the highest-risk:
   * $14.23 million for the Ports of the Bay Area (Ports of Oakland, Richmond, San Francisco and Stockton). The ports received $1.186 million in FY 07.
   * $15.1 million for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach. The ports received $12 million last year,
   Several other California ports qualified for lower tiers of funding, and also received significant increases in funding:
   * $731,250 for the Port of San Diego, received $139,837 last year. (Tier III)
   * $167,357 for the Port of Crockett, received zero funding last year. (Tier IV)
   * $181,527 for the Port of Redwood City, received zero funding last year. (Tier IV)
