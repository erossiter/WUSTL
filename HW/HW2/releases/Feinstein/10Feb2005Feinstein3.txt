SEN. FEINSTEIN INTRODUCES RESOLUTION HONORING DASHIELL HAMMETT, 75TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE MALTESE FALCON
  In anticipation of the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Maltese Falcon, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today introduced a resolution recognizing the importance of the writings of Dashiell Hammett to American literature and culture. The Maltese Falcon was first published on February 14, 1930.  
   "Let me salute the writings of Dashiell Hammett on the 75th anniversary of the publication of The Maltese Falcon," Senator Feinstein said. "The Maltese Falcon is a classic novel of American literature and is one of the most significant crime novels in history. It turned mystery and crime novels into a widely recognized genre of literature and culture and had a profound influence on my hometown of San Francisco - the home of hard-boiled detective stories. Dashiell Hammett's work exemplifies a unique and original American literary style, and I am pleased to be a part of the effort to honor his work." 
   Specifically, the resolution: 
   * Salutes Dashiell Hammett as one of the most notable authors of hard-boiled crime fiction; 
   * Notes the 75th anniversary of the publication of Dashiell Hammet's The Maltese Falcon; 
   * And Recognizes The Maltese Falcon as a great American crime novel. 
   The Maltese Falcon, which portrayed private investigator Sam Spade in the rough and tumble San Francisco underworld of the 1920's, was the third of the five published Hammett novels. After its 1930 publication, it also appeared as a comic book and was syndicated in newspaper supplements. It became a giveaway for soldiers serving during World War II, and it has been printed in hundreds of editions in 50 countries and in over 30 languages. 
   Within a year of its 1930 publication, it had already been adapted for the screen, followed by a second adaptation in 1936. The final, and most faithful, adaptation is the 1941 film starring Humphrey Bogart and Mary Astor by first time director John Huston. The American Film Institute rated this version as one of the top films of the Twentieth Century, and it can be found on the countless other "Great Films" listings. 
   On February 14 and throughout this year, literary organizations across the country will be celebrating this anniversary.
