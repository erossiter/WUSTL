SEN. FEINSTEIN OFFERS CONGRATULATIONS TO NOBEL PEACE PRIZE WINNER FORMER VICE PRESIDENT AL GORE
  No one on Earth has done more to put climate change and global warming on the front burner of public policy in virtually every country than Al Gore. 
   My husband and I saw him last evening, and he had no idea. So, it must be a wonderful surprise. 
   An Oscar, an Emmy, and a Nobel Peace Prize, is an unprecedented combination in one year. So, congratulations, Al Gore.
