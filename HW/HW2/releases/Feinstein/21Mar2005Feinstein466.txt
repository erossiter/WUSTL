HEARING SCHEDULED ON LYTTON GAMING PLAN
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced that the Indian Affairs Committee, chaired by Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), has agreed to hold a hearing April 5 on her legislation concerning the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians.  
   The bill would require the Lytton Band to undergo the same regulatory oversight process for gaming as any other tribe that acquired land after October 17, 1988 - the date the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted. 
   The following is a statement from Senator Feinstein on the hearing and an announcement by the Lytton Band that it would shelve plans for a Las Vegas-style casino on property in San Pablo : 
   "I am pleased that the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians has announced that they are shelving plans to open a massive urban casino in the Bay Area. I think they saw the writing on the wall and backed down. It is the right thing to do. It is clear to me that when Californians voted to approve Propositions 5 and 1A to allow Indian gaming on Indian lands, it was not to support off-reservation casinos and 'reservation shopping.' 
   I also want to commend members of the California Legislature, and particularly the efforts of Assembly Member Loni Hancock, for their refusal to support a compact that would have been a bad deal for everyone. 
   However, the Lytton Band has not abandoned pursuing a compact that would sidestep the normal federal regulatory process - and their letter to the Governor holds out hope for approval either by the current State Legislature or a future Legislature. 
   I remain strong in my belief that they should have to pursue the regular process for gaming on newly acquired lands like all other tribes. That is why I am pleased that Senator John McCain, chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee has agreed to hold a hearing on the bill on April 5."
