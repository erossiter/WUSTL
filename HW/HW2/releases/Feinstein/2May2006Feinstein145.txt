SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON CALIFORNIA-FEDERAL AGREEMENT ALLOWING EXPEDITED PERMITTING TO FIX CRITICAL LEVEE SITES
  The State of California and the Bush Administration have finalized an agreement that provides an expedited permitting process to allow California to fix critical levee sites before next year's flood season.  
   The following is Senator Feinstein's statement on the agreement: 
   "This agreement sweeps away roadblocks that may have prevented work from being done before next year's flood season. But more needs to be done. 
   We need the funding contained in the Senate emergency supplemental. Once this bill is passed, we will need the President to certify that this funding meets an emergency requirement. And we need presidential leadership to help ensure that what happened in New Orleans doesn't happen in Sacramento or the Delta."
