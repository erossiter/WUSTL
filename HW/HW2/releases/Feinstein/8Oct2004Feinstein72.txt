BREAST CANCER RESEARCH FOUNDATION HONORS SEN. FEINSTEIN
  The Breast Cancer Research Foundation is honoring Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) as a "Funding Hero" for her "long and dedicated support for the advancement of breast cancer research."  
   Evelyn Lauder, Founder and Chairman of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, this week recognized Senator Feinstein and Senator Olympia Snowe (R-Maine) for their commitment in the fight against breast cancer and for their support of breast cancer research in the Senate. 
   "I am grateful to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation for showing their appreciation to me and Senator Snowe for championing breast cancer research and helping to increase cancer research funding," Senator Feinstein said. "The funds we have helped raise for research will bring us closer to the day we have a cure for breast cancer." 
   Ms. Lauder cited several examples of legislation that Senators Feinstein and Snowe have sponsored to further the battle against breast cancer. Some of these initiatives include: 
   * establishing equal access to cancer clinical trials; 
   * requiring minimum hospital stays for women who have undergone mastectomies or lumpectomies; and 
   * creating the Breast Cancer Research Stamp, which has raised $40 million for breast cancer research. 
   About 3 million women in the United States are living with breast cancer, one million of whom have yet to be diagnosed. One out of every 8 women will get breast cancer, just as one out of every 6 men will have prostate cancer. The disease claims another woman's life every 13 minutes in the United States. Though much less common, about 1,300 men in America are diagnosed with breast cancer each year.
