SENATE PASSES SENS. BOXER, FEINSTEIN LEGISLATION TO HONOR REP. MATSUI
  The U.S. Senate has passed legislation sponsored by Sens.  
 Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-CA) to honor the late Rep. Robert T. Matsui by naming a United States Courthouse in Sacramento in his memory. 
   "Bob Matsui was one of the finest public servants I've ever met," said Senator Feinstein. "I will remember him as a trusted colleague and as a good friend. He served the people of Sacramento with distinction and with honor. And I think it is very appropriate to name the federal courthouse in Sacramento after him. It will honor his devotion to justice and to fair play, and it will keep Bob in our hearts and our memories." 
   Congressman Matsui was instrumental in obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the Courthouse. The bill was approved by unanimous consent in the Senate late Thursday.
