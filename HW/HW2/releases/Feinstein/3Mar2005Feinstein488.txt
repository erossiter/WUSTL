SENS. FEINSTEIN, CANTWELL, WYDEN, HARKIN RENEW EFFORT TO PREVENT FRAUD, MANIPULATION OF ENERGY MARKETS
  In light of continuing revelations about pervasive manipulation of the western energy market, Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), Ron Wyden (D-OR), and Tom Harkin (D-IA) today introduced legislation that would improve price transparency and provide adequate regulatory oversight of the wholesale electricity markets.
   "A mountain of evidence has accumulated definitively showing that energy companies deliberately manipulated the market," Senator Feinstein said. "It's been more than four years since the beginning of the energy crisis in the west, and yet Congress has done virtually nothing to protect American consumers. It's time to provide the necessary regulatory oversight and ensure that there is not a repeat of the energy crisis that had such a devastating impact on California and the West."  
   Just last month, the Snohomish Public Utility District released transcripts of tapes revealing that on January 17, 2001, Enron traders concocted false repairs for a Las Vegas power plant - making power unavailable that would have been delivered to California - on the very same day that supplies were so tight that Northern California experienced a Stage 3 power emergency and rolling blackouts hit as many as 2 million consumers. 
   Telephone transcripts between Enron and the Las Vegas plant confirming the effort to falsify repairs read as follows: 
   Bill: Ah, we want you guys to get a little creative.
  Rich: OK.
  Bill: And come up with a reason to go down.
  Rich: OK
  Bill: Anything you want to do over there? Any -
  Rich: Ah-
  Bill: Cleaning, anything like that?
  Rich: Yeah, Yeah. There's some stuff we could be doing.
  Bill: That's good.
  Rich: Right.
  Bill: It's supposed to be, ah, you know, kinda one of those things.
  Rich: OK, so we're comin' down for some maintenance, like a forced outage type thing?
  Bill: Right.
  Rich: And that's cool.
  Bill: Hopefully....
  Bill: So you got a-so you're checkin' a switch on the steam turbine.
  Rich: Yeah, and whatever adjustment he makes today, is probably-tonight, is probably not gonna work, so we're probably gonna have to check it tomorrow afternoon again.
  Bill: I think that's a good plan, Rich.
  Rich: All right.
  Bill: I knew I could count on you. 
   "It has become clear that we cannot depend on any ethical conduct from traders in the energy market," Senator Feinstein said. "The federal government, therefore, needs to step in and give FERC increased authority to punish bad behavior and prevent future abuses."
   Specifically, this legislation would: 
   * Improve price transparency in wholesale electricity markets. It would direct the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to establish an electronic system to provide information about the price and availability of wholesale electricity to buyers and sellers and the public. 
   * Prohibit round trip electricity trades. 
   * Increase penalties for violations of federal power act. It wouldincrease the maximum fine for violations of the Federal Power Act from $5,000 to $1,000,000, increase maximum sentence from 2 to 5 years, and extend penalty authority to other provisions of the Federal Power Act.   
   * Increase penalties for violations of natural gas act. It would increase the maximum fine for violations of the Natural Gas Act from $5,000 to $1,000,000.   
   * Prohibit manipulation in electricity markets and give FERC discretionary authority to revoke market-based rates for violations.   
   * Repeal "Enron exemption," the exemption for large traders in energy derivatives and apply the anti-manipulation and anti-fraud provisions of the Commodity Exchange Act to all over-the-counter trades in energy derivatives. 
   * Provide Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) tools to monitor over-the-counter energy markets. For over-the-counter trades in energy derivatives that perform a "significant price discovery function," and for all energy trades on electronic exchanges, the bill would require large sophisticated traders (defined using current law as "eligible commercial entities" and "eligible contract participants") to keep records and report large trades to the CFTC.
   * Focus reporting and recordkeeping requirementson over-the-counter trades that perform a "Significant Price Discovery Function," consistent with the recommendations of the President's Working Group on Financial Markets. 
   * Limit use of data. It would require CFTC to seek only information necessary to detect and prevent price manipulation in the futures and over-the-counter markets for energy, to keep proprietary trade and business data confidential except when used for law enforcement purposes, and to not require the real-time publication of proprietary data. 
   However, the bill would have no effect on: 
   * The regulation of Futures Markets, Financial Derivatives, or Metals; or 
   * Swaps or Electronic Trading of Non-Energy Commodities.
