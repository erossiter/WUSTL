SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON VIOLENCE IN MIDDLE EAST
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today issued the following statement: 
   "By initiating a campaign to kidnap Israeli soldiers and launch rocket attacks inside Israel , Hamas and Hezbollah, with assistance from Syria and Iran , threaten to destabilize the Middle East and trigger a wider conflict. Like any country, Israel has the right and the obligation to defend its citizens. The latest round of violence only underscores the need for high-level and sustained American diplomacy that has been sorely lacking."
