SENS. BOXER, FEINSTEIN CALL ON ADMINISTRATION TO MAINTAIN FUNDS FOR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE PROTECTION
  Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif) today urged Secretary of Agriculture Ann Veneman to maintain the local match waiver for the $150 million of Emergency Watershed Protection (EWP) funds provided to Southern California agencies for the removal of dead and dying trees that pose a tremendous wildfire threat.  
   "Reinstating the local match requirement makes no sense,"the Senators wrote in a letter to Veneman. "It is imperative that we do all that is possible to address the threat of fire in Southern California. We urge you to maintain the local match waiver for the $150 million of EWP funds provided to Southern California." 
   At Boxer's and Feinstein's urging last May, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to waive the local match requirement for the $150 million. Since then, the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) has been working with local communities to accelerate the removal of dead and dying trees.
