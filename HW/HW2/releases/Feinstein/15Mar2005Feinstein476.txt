SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW EPA REGULATIONS ON MERCURY EMISSIONS
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) issued the following statement in response to today's ruling by the Environmental Protection Agency regarding mercury emissions:  
   "I am extremely disappointed with EPA's rule regulating emissions of mercury from power plants. The rule will create a cap and trade system for mercury, a potent neurotoxin. The problem with this approach is that it will not reduce hotspots of mercury-which are a public health hazard. 
   It is estimated that 630,000 babies each year in the United States are at risk of mercury toxicity and 1 in 12 American women who can become pregnant have heightened risk of mercury toxicity. Mercury is toxic to the developing fetal brain, and exposure in the womb can cause learning deficiencies and can delay mental development in children. 
   The GAO and the EPA's Inspector General both stated that the EPA ignored scientific evidence and agency protocols as it established the mercury rule. This is simply unacceptable. Public health is too important. 
   The bipartisan Clean Power Act, which I've co-sponsored, would do much more to address this danger by requiring power plants to capture 90 percent of their mercury emissions from each smokestack beginning in 2008."
