SENS. BOXER, FEINSTEIN TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO NAME SACRAMENTO COURTHOUSE IN HONOR OF SEN. MATSUI
  Sens. Barbara Boxer, Dianne Feinstein (Both D-CA) today announced plans to introduce legislation that would designate the United States Courthouse in Sacramento as the Robert T. Matsui United States Courthouse.  
   Senator Boxer said, "After his childhood internment, Bob Matsui could have chosen to dwell on the sadness of his early years. Instead, he chose to give his life to public service, working to improve the lives of those in his congressional district and all Americans. He was a true patriot, and naming this Courthouse after him is a very appropriate memorial to his continual efforts toward a just and fair society."
   Senator Feinstein said, "Bob Matsui was a superb public servant and it would be such a great honor to memorialize him by naming the Federal Courthouse in Sacramento after him. Throughout his long and distinguished career, he proved to be a dedicated and well respected public servant and his constituents in the Sacramento area considered themselves lucky to have his representation."
   Congressman Matsui was instrumental in obtaining more than $142 million in federal funding for the Courthouse.
