SEN. FEINSTEIN HONORED FOR BIPARTISAN LEADERSHIP BY PANETTA INSTITUTE
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) will be honored for her bipartisan leadership by the Panetta Institute at its sixth annual Jefferson-Lincoln awards this Saturday evening. The event is being held at the Inn at Spanish Bay. More information about Saturday's dinner is available at (831) 582-4200.  
   "Many years ago I learned that some problems take conservative solutions, and some problems take progressive solutions, and that a decision-maker listens to both sides and then makes a decision and moves on. I also came to believe in diverse cities and states - or nations for that matter - that the center of the political spectrum can be the best place to govern from. I found this very true in my nine years as Mayor of San Francisco - perhaps one of the America's most diverse cities. And I find this true today." 
   "Let me thank Leon and Sylvia Panetta, and the Panetta institute for this recognition. I am honored by it, and I will continue to work to find bipartisan solutions for the challenges facing California and this nation." 
   Senator Feinstein has a proven track record of reaching across the aisle to find bipartisan solutions to difficult problems. Among her bipartisan successes include: 
   * Calfed Legislation - Authorizing $395 million for a balanced program to increase California's water supply, reliability and quality and help restore sensitive water ecosystems. 
   * Healthy ForestsLegislation - Reducing the risk of catastrophic fire in our forests by expediting the thinning of hazardous fuels and providing the first legal protection for old-growth forests in our nation's history. 
   * Lake Tahoe Restoration Act- Preserving and restoring this treasured natural resource by authorizing $300 million in federal funds over 10 years to match investments by the States of California and Nevada and local authorities. 
   * Border Security and Visa Entry Reform - Helping prevent terrorists from entering the United States through loopholes in our immigration system. 
   * Crime Victims Rights - Giving victims of violent crime a core set of procedural rights under federal law and ensuring that they have standing to assert their rights before a court.
