SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON WITHDRAWAL OF POMBO MINING PROVISION
  Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein
  On the Withdrawal of the Pombo Mining Provision
   "This mining provision was the worst type of public policy. It could have led to the sell-off of tens of thousands of acres of national forests, parks, and wilderness areas. I'm thrilled that this language was withdrawn. It is a win for those of us who treasure our public lands."
