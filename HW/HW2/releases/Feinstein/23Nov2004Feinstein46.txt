CONGRESS APPROVES $388 BILLION OMNIBUS APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Congress has approved an omnibus appropriations bill, which provides $388 billion to fund 13 government departments. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), who voted in favor of the bill, today provided details about the millions of dollars in funding for California projects. 
   "I voted for this omnibus appropriations bill because it eliminates funding for a new generation of nuclear weapons and provides significant funding for important California priorities," Senator Feinstein said. "Nevertheless, I have serious concerns with a number of the provisions included in the bill and also with the way the bill was put together.  
   "First of all, the bill contains an egregious provision that would have provided the House and Senate Chairmen of the Appropriations Committees with access to all Americans' tax returns. Second, the bill contains a provision which could seriously undermine a woman's right to choose. And finally, I believe the appropriations process is broken. Members and their staffs do not have enough time to consider the bill before they are asked to vote on it. I hope that in the future we will consider individual bills, rather than an enormous omnibus that we do not have adequate time to review. 
   "But ultimately, agreements were reached to strip the provision on tax returns and to provide an up or down vote on the provision relating to reproductive health services. So given these agreements, I decided to support the bill because it funds important California projects, eliminates funding for research and development of new nuclear weapons, provides $100 million in funding for interoperable communications for first responders, and protects California from possible cuts to federal education funding. 
   "It's not a perfect bill. There's no question about that. But on balance, I think it provides vital funding in important areas." 
   Following is a discussion of a number of critical issues contained in the bill and a partial list of many of the projects important to California residents and communities. 
   CRITICAL ISSUES 
   New Nuclear Weapons
   The FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Conference Report provides the following funding for the next generation of nuclear weapons: 
   * Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator (100 Kiloton) $0 
   * Advanced Concepts Initiative (5 Kiloton or less) $0 
   * Time-to-test Readiness at Nevada Test Site $0 
   * Modern Pit Facility (Cannot be used for site selection) $7 million 
   "This is a consequential victory for those of us who believe the United States sends the wrong signal to the rest of the world by reopening the nuclear door and beginning the testing and development of a new generation of nuclear weapons," Senator Feinstein said. "I'd like to especially commend Representative David Hobson (R-Ohio), Chairman of the House Energy Appropriations Subcommittee, for his steadfast leadership in removing this funding. This is not winning the war by a long shot. But it is a consequential step and should send a very loud message to the Administration." 
   Federal Refusal Clause
   The bill includes language which would allow any health care entity - a doctor, a hospital, an HMO, or insurance company - to refuse to provide access to abortion services and to refuse to provide patients with information or referrals about those services. This would hold true even if the organization or facility receives federal funding or if the organization or facility was required by state or local law to provide these services because, under this provision, doing so would be deemed "discriminatory." 
   Senator Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) secured an agreement from Senators Bill Frist (R-TN) and Harry Reid (D-NV) that there would be an up or down vote on this provision by April 30, 2005. 
   "This provision would open the door to a wholesale restriction of access and information about reproductive health care services across America," Senator Feinstein said. "It especially would have a major impact on low-income women and women in rural areas. Additionally, it encourages opponents of a woman's right to choose to redouble their efforts to intimidate physicians with violence or the threat of violence. In my view, this provision represents a major step backwards, and I hope the Senate overturns it when it comes up for a vote next year." 
   SCAAP - State Criminal Alien Assistance Program
   The bill contains $305 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). This is an increase of $5 million from FY 2004. California typically receives 40 percent of SCAAP funding.
   "SCAAP is critical to California, because it reimburses the State and local governments for costs associated with incarcerating illegal criminal aliens," Senator Feinstein said. "While this is more funding than last year, it only covers a fraction of what is needed. This perpetual underfunding is a serious concern, because it puts added strain on State and local governments, who are already suffering from record deficits. Control of immigration is a federal responsibility, and local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill for it." 
   Title I - Federal Education Funding for Disadvantaged Students
   The bill does not include language which would have set aside $71 million in supplemental federal funds for 11 states (not including California) who will lose Title I funds because of most recent Census numbers which show a decrease in the number of low-income children. Title I in FY '05 is expected to be funded at $12.8 billion, and California typically receives approximately 10 percent of all Title I funding. 
   "I believe that Title I education funds should go where our nation's poor children are, but there was language in the Appropriations Committee-approved bill that would have set aside funds for states which have lost low-income students," Senator Feinstein said. "If this language had been included in the final bill, supplemental federal funds would have gone to states that have a decreasing numbers of disadvantaged students, not to states like California, where the number of poor children continues to grow. It is imperative that funds be targeted to states with high concentrations of poor children." 
   Perchlorate
   The bill contains a total of $2.775 in funding to research the scope of perchlorate contamination and to cleanup wells that have been contaminated. Perchlorate, which is used in munitions and jet fuels, has contaminated drinking water supplies or the environment in 34 states. 
   "Perchlorate contamination poses a major threat to the health of Californians and all Americans," Senator Feinstein said. "I am pleased that Congress has approved this funding to aid perchlorate clean-up and remediation efforts. It is imperative that we reduce the perchlorate in our drinking water and protect Californians, especially pregnant women, the unborn, infants, and young children, from this threat to their health. There is much more work to do to determine the scope and the severity of the contamination across the country, but this is a step in the right direction." 
   Pierce's Disease
   The bill includes $25.278 million to combat Pierce's Disease, which poses a grave threat to California's wine and table grape industry. 
   "Pierce's disease - caused by the glassy-winged sharpshooter - is the greatest single threat facing the wine and table grape industries in California," Senator Feinstein said. "This funding is critical and will go for research to find a way to control the glassy-winged sharpshooter once and for all."
   PROJECTS 
   ENERGY AND WATER APPROPRIATIONS (PARTIAL LIST) 
   CALFED
   The bill contains $8.5 million for CALFED-related water projects and storage feasibility studies.
   "I am disappointed that the bill only includes $8.5 million for CALFED-related projects," Senator Feinstein said. "However, I remain hopeful that given the $395 million authorization which Congress approved earlier this year, that CALFED's share of federal funding will significantly increase next year. This would allow California to improve its water infrastructure and environment in a balanced manner so that we can prevent a water crisis in the State far worse than the energy crisis we experienced three years ago."
