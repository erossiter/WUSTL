SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NEW STEM CELL RESEARCH ANNOUNCED IN SOUTH KOREA
  Scientists in South Korea today announced in the journal Science that they have used nuclear transplantation research to produce 11 human stem cells lines that are genetic matches of 11 patients ranging in age from 2 to 56.  
 The following is a statement by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.):
   "Stem Cell research is the bright new frontier of medicine. It offers enormous promise to provide a methodology to conquer devastating and catastrophic disease such as diabetes, spinal cord injuries, Alzheimer's, and cancer. But federal inaction has created a void that has been only partially filled by states and by private entities, and it has allowed other countries to move ahead of the United States in this important area of cutting-edge medical research.
   The achievements made by scientists in South Korea prove that it is possible to derive patient-specific embryonic stem cell lines using the Somatic Cell Nuclear Transplantation technique. This is a major achievement for the future of regenerative medicine. We are one big step closer to eventually developing treatments for deadly conditions like spinal cord injury and juvenile diabetes.
   There is no question that this country needs an effective stem cell policy - both to provide federal funding for additional embryonic stem cell lines and to provide federal ethical guidelines. Passing the legislation I have sponsored with Senators Hatch, Kennedy, Specter and Harkin would go a long way to filling the void."
