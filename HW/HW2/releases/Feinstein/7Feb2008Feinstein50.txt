SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON SENATE PASSAGE OF THE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  "The good news is that we were able to break through the gridlock and pass a stimulus package with bipartisan support. The American people should know that help is on the way. It includes: 
   Rebate checks - $600 for individuals and $1,200 for couples, including seniors on fixed incomes and disabled vets.
   Increased limits on government-backed home loans, so more Californians can buy homes or refinance at lower rates.
   Tax incentives for small business.
   Regretfully, the package doesn't include extended unemployment benefits. Or energy efficiency tax incentives.
   But the point is, this thing is through the Senate. Now we need to get it to the American people as soon as possible."
