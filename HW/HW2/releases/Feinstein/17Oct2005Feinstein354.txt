SEN. FEINSTEIN TO INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO RESTORE SAN FRANCISCO'S NATIONAL PARK FACILITIES
  Sen. Feinstein today introduced legislation to enable both the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and San FranciscoMaritimeNationalHistoricPark to retain the revenue necessary for needed maintenance and restoration.  
 The bill, which serves as a companion to legislation introduced in the House of Representatives by Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), would also provide for a modest boundary adjustment between the two adjacent parks. 
   "As a San Francisco native and a former mayor, I know these parks are extremely popular tourist sites," Senator Feinstein said. "Under current law, the revenue collected by these parks must be spent in the same fiscal year in which it is collected. Otherwise, any revenue that is not spent is deposited in the National Treasury. This policy makes it difficult for these two parks to pursue long term, major restoration projects. I believe this bill will allow the National Park Service to make the necessary changes to undertake needed substantive restoration in order to continue to attract visitors from around the world to these historic sites of California." 
   Specifically, the bill would: 
   * Allow these two national parks to hold the revenue indefinitely, which allows for long term restoration projects not possible under the current system. 
   * Call for a modest boundary adjustment between the two adjacent parks to coincide with the current administration of the San Francisco Municipal Pier. 
   Background: 
   The Golden Gate National Recreation Area is one of the largest urban national parks in the world--home to such renowned sites as the Presidio of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island. Additionally, the San Francisco Maritime National Historic Park, located at the west end of San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf, includes a fleet of landmark vessels and a maritime museum.
