SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY
  Statement by Senator Dianne Feinstein
  on Los Alamos National Laboratory 
   "This is a big win for the University of California and it recognizes the academic prowess of the nation's premier public research institution. I was overjoyed to hear the news. 
   The UC-Bechtel partnership, which included BWXT Technologies and Washington Group International, was reviewed by an independent panel that determined their proposal was technically more proficient and more economical for American taxpayers than the competing proposal. 
   This is a partnership with extensive experience in nuclear operations, security and business management and I believe it will provide a world-class management team for the Los Alamos National Laboratory. With the great challenges facing our nation, it is imperative that this laboratory be at the forefront in protecting our national security. The fact that the University of California will continue to play a leading role in this effort is good news for California and good news for the nation."
