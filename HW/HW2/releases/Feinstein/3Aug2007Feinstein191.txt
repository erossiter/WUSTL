SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON SENATE'S VOTE ON FOREIGN INTELLIGENCE SURVEILLANCE ACT
  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) voted tonight for legislation passed by the Senate to make interim changes to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to close gaps in the nation's intelligence-gathering capability. 
   The following is Senator Feinstein's statement:
   "I spoke with Admiral Mike McConnell, the Director of National Intelligence, at length this evening. He believes the United States is vulnerable, and that we need to move quickly to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.
   The intelligence community is deeply concerned that chatter among suspected terrorist networks is up. I am concerned as well. We are living in a period of heightened vulnerability, and must give the intelligence community the tools they need to protect America.
   This legislation is a temporary fix. It is not permanent and it expires in six months. It immediately addresses critical gaps in our intelligence-collection efforts - while preserving a role for FISA court review.
   I voted for both bills because one needed 60 votes to pass. It is vital that we act now. We cannot leave the nation unprotected in this post-9/11 period."
