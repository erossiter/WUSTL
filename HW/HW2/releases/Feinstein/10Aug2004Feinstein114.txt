SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF REP. GOSS AS NEW CIA DIRECTOR
  "I view the naming of a new CIA Director as an important, though interim, step in reforming our nation's intelligence program.
   As we review this new nomination, we need to look closely at both his record and his support for the reforms proposed by the 9/11 Commission, including the establishment of a Director of National Intelligence with adequate budgetary and personnel authority to lead the 15 intelligence agencies.
   It is my hope that this nomination will not be an impediment to this reform effort and I will vote accordingly once the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence has had an opportunity to complete its review."
