SEN. FEINSTEIN WELCOMES RELEASE OF IRANIAN-AMERICAN SCHOLAR ESFANDIARI
  The Iranian government today announced that it had released Iranian-American scholar Dr. Haleh Esfandiari from prison. Dr. Esfandiari, who had been imprisoned since May, is one of four Iranian-Americans that have been detained in Iran in recent months.  
   The following is a brief statement from U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.): 
   "I am delighted that the Government of Iran has released Dr. Esfandiari from prison. I thank the Iranian Government for today's action. 
   The next step is to allow her to leave the country and to release the three remaining Iranian-Americans that are being falsely detained. 
   I hope that both the Iranian and the U.S. Government will use diplomacy to resolve this matter and other important policy disputes."
