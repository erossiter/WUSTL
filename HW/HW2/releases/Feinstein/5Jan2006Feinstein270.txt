SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA INFRASTRUCTURE
  "I have been briefed on the Governor's proposed infrastructure investment plan and am very pleased to see that it sets up a 10-year investment program particularly in the areas of flood protection/water infrastructure and transportation - two of California 's major needs.  
   In the next 20 years, California could grow to nearly 50 million people with a water and transportation infrastructure sufficient for half the population. This is clearly untenable and this 10-year program is a major step in remedying the situation. I will do all I can to work with the Governor and the State Legislature to see that this infrastructure plan is carried out. And when a federal match is required, I will fight for the federal dollars involved."
