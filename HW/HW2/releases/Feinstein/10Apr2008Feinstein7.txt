SENATE APPROVES MEASURE TO PRESERVE HISTORIC PIEDRAS BLANCAS LIGHT STATION
  U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today praised Senate passage of a bill to preserve the historic Piedras Blancas Light Station, which is located along the Pacific Coast in San Luis Obispo County. The measure was included in the comprehensive public lands package approved by the Senate. 
   "The Piedras Blancas Light Station is a California landmark. And the bill approved by the Senate today takes us one step closer to ensuring lasting protection for this striking piece of California history," Senator Feinstein said. "This is an important part of helping to ensure the lasting protection of the Big Sur Coastline."
   Specifically, the bill will establish the Light Station as an Outstanding Natural Area, and place it under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Land Management's National Landscape Conservation System. This designation will help ensure the preservation and restoration of the Light Station's historic facilities.
   The legislation, sponsored by Representative Lois Capps (D-Calif.), was approved by the House in March 2007.
   The comprehensive public lands measure approved today by the Senate will require approval by the House before it can go to the President for his signature. It is expected that the House will pass the legislation soon.
