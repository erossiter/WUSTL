SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON NEW GAO REPORT DETAILING TSUNAMI DANGER TO COASTAL AREAS
  The Government Accounting Office today issued a report indicating that our nation is unprepared to deal with a major tsunami. The report was requested by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.). The following is her statement:  
   "It's been more than a year and a half since our eyes were opened to the danger posed by tsunamis. 
   Yet, as this GAO report indicates, California and other states are at risk of a catastrophic tsunami, and we are ill-equipped to deal with the threat. 
   We need a warning system to protect the most vulnerable communities. We don't have that now. So I will work to fund critical aspects of such a program, including: 
   * Software to determine where a tsunami is most likely to hit and do the most damage; 
   * Testing of warning systems in all at-risk states; and 
   * Preparedness training in the communities most at risk. 
   We've seen the danger. Now is the time to respond."
