SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RITE AID'S DECISION TO MOVE PSEUDOEPHEDRINE PRODUCTS BEHIND PHARMACY COUNTER
  Rite Aid announced today that it will move all single ingredient pseudoephedrine products behind the pharmacy counter in the next week and all solid combination pseudoephedrine products behind the pharmacy counter no later than August 1.  
 Rite Aid operates 3,400 stores in 28 states and the District of Columbia. 
   Following is the statement of U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) on Rite Aid's announcement: 
   "Today Rite Aid joined Target, Longs Drugs, Albertson's, and Wal-Mart in announcing its plans to place pseudoephedrine products behind the pharmacy counter. This is another major step forward in the fight against methamphetamine production. 
   By making it more difficult to purchase large quantities of cold medicine blister packs, a major source of the precursor chemicals needed to produce meth, it will be far tougher for meth cooks to make this devastating drug. I urge more pharmacies to follow the example of these companies and help out in the fight against meth. 
   But we still need a national standard and I am hopefuly that the Senate will soon take up legislation I have sponsored with Senator Jim Talent to require that products containing pseudoephedrine be sold behind the pharmacy counter."
