SENATE PANEL APPROVES AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL THAT INCLUDES MILLIONS FOR CALIFORNIA
  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved a FY 2007 agriculture appropriations spending bill, which provides over $100 billion for agriculture, nutrition, and food safety, and includes millions of dollars in funding for many significant California agricultural priorities including $10 million for the Specialty Crop Block Grant Program, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced today. 
   Specialty crops are defined as fruits and vegetables, tree nuts, dried fruits, and nursery crops. These agricultural products, produced in all 50 states, constitute at least half of U.S. gross agriculture receipts, contribute nearly $60 billion to the U.S. economy, and provide 60 percent of America 's daily nutritional requirements.  
   "This funding will help make American specialty crops more competitive in the global marketplace," Senator Feinstein said. "Specialty crops are a vital part of our nation's agricultural production. They are produced in all 50 states. They constitute at least half of U.S. gross agriculture receipts. They contribute nearly $60 billion to the U.S. economy. And they provide 60 percent of America's daily nutritional requirements."
   The Senate Appropriations Committee also agreed to an amendment to simplify travel to Cuba for agricultural sales, a Sense of the Senate amendment on the Japanese embargo on U.S. beef, and a $3.9 billion agriculture disaster assistance amendment. This includes over $1 billion for livestock assistance, $1 billion in crop loss assistance and $99.5 million specifically for specialty crop producers.

"These reports will help give a clearer view of how much perchlorate is seeping into our food supply, and will help the Environmental Protection Agency establish a safe drinking water standard."
