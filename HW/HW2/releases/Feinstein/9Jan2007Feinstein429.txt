SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON EXTRADITION OF JORGE ARROYO GARCIA, FUGITIVE WANTED FOR MURDER OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY SHERIFF DEPUTY MARCH
  Today, Jorge Arroyo Garcia, who is wanted for the murder of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy David March, has been extradited from Mexico to the United States. 
   This extradition will help bring this wanted fugitive to justice. Law enforcement officials have worked many long and hard hours over the nearly five years it has taken to bring Garcia to trial. 
   I hope that today's news will help bring peace to Teri March and the entire March Family. They have waited for too long to see this terrible case brought to a close.
