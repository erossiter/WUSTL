SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON BUSH ADMINISTRATION'S DECISION TO DENY CALIFORNIA CLEAN AIR ACT WAIVER TO REGULATE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS
  Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein On the Bush Administration's Decision to Deny California a Clean Air Act Waiver to Regulate Tailpipe Emissions
   "Candidly I find this disgraceful. The passage of the Energy Bill does not give the EPA a green light to shirk its responsibility to protect the health and safety of the American people from air pollution."
