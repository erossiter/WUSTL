SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS IN RESPONSE TO STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) this evening released the following statement in response to the President's State of the Union Address: 
   "This is a President who has lost a lot of credibility. The speech was about one-half foreign policy - namely Iraq - and the other half on domestic issues. 
   On the foreign policy side of it, his speech lacked any sense of a new direction. It was same old, same old, stay the course. And in that respect, despite the hyperbole and the call to patriotism, it was very disappointing.
   On the domestic side, with health care, he presented a plan that largely depends on tax deductions. Now, if you are unable to pay for insurance, tax deductions don't do you much good. So I have a hard time understanding how those tax deductions get poor people health care coverage. 
   With respect to energy, he did for the first time mention global warming - and I think that is a start. However, the problem with the President's proposal on is that it doesn't go nearly far enough. The fuel economy bill we have just proposed would save 19 billion gallons by 2019; the President's would only save 8.5 billion gallons by 2017. So our bill saves more than double. The President has had the ability to make real changes to fuel efficiency with regard to light trucks for 6 years - and he hasn't made substantial increases. Why should we trust him now?
   The only way to secure substantial increases in fuel economy is to pass major legislation. The bill we have introduced is a bipartisan bill. It can be accomplished with existing technology. And it could make a major difference with regard to reducing our dependence on oil and curbing greenhouse gases
   Bottom line: I found that this was a very limited speech and that perhaps for the first time, that maybe this President is becoming a lame duck President. I found it very disappointing."
