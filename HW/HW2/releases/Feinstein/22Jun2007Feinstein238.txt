SENATE COMMITTEE APPROVES FISCAL 2008 LABOR-HEALTH, HUMAN SERVICES-EDUCATION APPROPRIATIONS BILL
  The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Fiscal Year 2008 Labor-Health and Human Services-Education Appropriations bill, which would substantially expand federally funded stem cell research by opening more existing stem cell lines for research.
   The Appropriations Committee bill also provides a $1.1 billion increase for Title I grants for schools across America serving low-income children - as well as significant funding increases for programs vital to California. Programs in California to receive funding boosts include grants to schools serving low-income children, special education grants, and Pell Grant funding, which helps more than 623,000 low- and middle-income students in California attend college. 
   It also includes funding added to the legislation by Senator Feinstein for California programs, including: $900,000 for the City of Santa Ana's Work Experience and Literacy Program; $700,000 for HIV/AIDS outpatient services in San Francisco; $500,000 for renovation of San Diego County's Edgemoor Hospital; $500,000 for Riverside County Regional Medical Center renovations; $500,000 for the Oakland School of the Arts to purchase educational equipment; and $400,000 for the City of San Jose for job training for the homeless.
   "The Appropriations Committee's action should send a signal to the President that the Senate - like the majority of the American people - recognizes the importance of federal funding of stem cell research. The President's failed policy on stem cells has tied the hands of our nation's scientists, forcing many of our most talented researchers to move to labs in other countries. Support for expanding this research is overwhelming. The Appropriations Committee did the right thing by voting for expanded stem cell research in legislation that includes strict ethical guidelines," Senator Feinstein said.
   The legislation makes existing stem cell lines derived before June 15, 2007 eligible for research. President Bush has limited the number of eligible lines to those derived before August 9, 2001, severely restricting scientific research. The Appropriations Committee action Thursday came one day after the President vetoed bipartisan legislation to increase federal funding for stem cell research.
   "The bill approved by the Appropriations Committee also includes millions of dollars for programs that will benefit California, and the nation, from programs that tutor inner-city kids, to substance abuse counseling, to museums that memorialize California's rich cultural history," Senator Feinstein said.
   "In addition, I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee restored $100 million in funding of the Head Start program, which President Bush sought to cut in his budget proposal. And we have succeeded in increasing funding for other important programs. It is vital that Congress recognize that these programs are an investment in the nation's future. With this action, the Appropriations Committee took an important step in making sure that investment continues in next year's budget."
