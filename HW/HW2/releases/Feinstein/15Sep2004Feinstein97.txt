SENATE ENERGY, NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE APPROVES LEGISLATION TO RESTORE CALIFORNIA MISSIONS
  The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee today approved legislation to help restore and repair California's historic missions and also to preserve the missions' artworks and artifacts. Sens.  
 Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-Calif.) co-sponsored the bill. 
   "Built over 225 years ago, the California Missions and their artifacts represent the rich cultural and architectural history of our State," said Senator Feinstein. "The Missions are state treasures and yet, they are on the verge of being lost to us forever. Many of the missions are in states of serious disrepair experiencing termite infestation, structural deterioration and water damage. Some of their artifacts are cracked, broken or lacking their original luster. I am pleased that the committee passed this bill to help restore the Missions to their original greatness." 
   The California Missions Preservation Act will provide $10 million ($2 million per year for five years) in matching grants to the California Missions Foundation to restore the 21 missions that are scattered along Highway 101 from Sonoma to San Diego. The California Missions Foundation plans to raise $50 million to fully restore the missions. 
   "The California missions are the most visited historic attractions in the State, drawing more than 5 million tourists a year. They serve an important role in educating children and adults alike about the history and the early settlement in California," Senator Feinstein said. 
   The House version of the bill, which was passed by a voice vote last October, was sponsored by Rep. Sam Farr (D-Calif.) and was co-sponsored by most of the California delegation.
