SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES FISCAL 2005 VA/HUD FUNDING BILL
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced today that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved legislation to fund vital projects in California to clean up perchlorate contamination.  
   "Perchlorate contamination poses a major threat to the health of Californians and all Americans," Senator Feinstein said. "I am pleased that the Appropriations Committee has approved $2 million to aid perchlorate clean-up and remediation efforts in California . It is imperative that we reduce the perchlorate in our drinking water and protect Californians, especially pregnant women, the unborn, infants, and young children, from this threat to their health." 
   Perchlorate, which is used in munitions and jet fuels, has contaminated drinking water supplies or the environment in 34 states. If ingested, perchlorate can interfere with thyroid function, and scientific evidence suggests that this effect can impair the normal development of the brain in fetuses, newborns and infants, permanently damaging cognitive abilities and brain function in affected children. 
   Specifically, the committee on Tuesday approved the following as part of the FY2005 Veterans Affairs/Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill: 
   * $700,000 for the City of Rialto's pilot demonstration for an integrated approach for perchlorate remediation and treatment; 
   * $300,000 for the treatment of perchlorate contaminated wells in the Inland Empire; 
   * $200,000 for the City of Ontario's wellhead treatment for perchlorate and nitrate; 
   * $500,000 for the City of Pasadena's pilot project for perchlorate removal using biological treatment; and 
   * $300,000 for perchlorate cleanup in the Santa Clara Water District. 
   Additionally, the Committee approved the following California projects as part of the appropriations bill: 
   * $1 million for the Inglewood Senior Center; 
   * $350,000 for the Davis Senior Center; 
   * $400,000 for East and West Reservoir Upgrades in Santa Ana;
