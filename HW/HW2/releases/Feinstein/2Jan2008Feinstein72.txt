SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON RETIREMENT ANNOUNCEMENT BY REP. LANTOS
  Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein on the Retirement Announcement by Representative Tom Lantos 
   "I have been very proud to be a supporter and colleague of Tom Lantos. He is one of the most distinguished Americans I know. He survived the Holocaust, which was the ultimate human rights struggle. He has been in the forefront of virtually every human rights battle over nearly three decades in Congress. He is a wonderful man and has a beautiful family, and I wish him well as he fights this disease. He has a heart and a will that will stand him in good stead. I look forward to continuing to work with him."
