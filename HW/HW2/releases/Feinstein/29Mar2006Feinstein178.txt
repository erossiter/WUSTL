SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON NEW FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS FOR LIGHT TRUCKS, SUVS
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today called the Bush Administration's efforts to increase fuel economy standards for SUVs and light trucks a "first step," but indicated that more action is needed. 
   Senator Feinstein has authored legislation cosponsored by Senator Olympia Snowe (R-ME) that would close the SUV loophole and equalize fuel economy standards of SUVs and light trucks with those of passenger cars. 
   The following is Senator Feinstein's statement:
   "The new policy is a first step in increasing fuel economy standards for SUVs and light trucks. Unfortunately, it doesn't close the SUV loophole, so I want to encourage the Administration to do more. 
   The bottom line is that this new policy continues to allow SUVs and light trucks to achieve less stringent fuel economy standards than passenger cars. 
   If we were to truly close the SUV loophole, we would save 1 million barrels of oil per day by 2015, reduce oil imports by 10 percent, and prevent 240 million tons of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere. Closing the SUV loophole would also benefit consumers--saving them almost $5 billion at the pump. 
   The technology exists, but not the will. We have missed an opportunity to break our nation's addiction to oil, reduce our greenhouse gases, and decrease the price of gas at the pump."
