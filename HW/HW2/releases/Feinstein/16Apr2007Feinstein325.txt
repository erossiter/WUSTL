SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MASS SHOOTING AT VIRGINIA TECH
  Statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein On the Mass Shooting at Virginia Tech: 
   "My heart nearly stopped when I heard that more than 30 people had been killed at Virginia Tech today. 
   In an instant, the hopes and dreams of students were destroyed by a cowardly and terrible act of insane violence. My deepest condolences go to all those touched by this violence.
   This mass shooting will be seared into our memories, alongside Columbine, 101 California, the University of Texas Clock Tower, and the shooting at a McDonald's in San Ysidro, California. 
   It is my deep belief that shootings like these are enabled by the unparalleled ease with which people procure weapons in this country. And I believe this will reignite the dormant effort to pass common-sense gun regulations in this nation."
   Senator Feinstein is the author of the 1994 federal Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the manufacture and importation of 19-types of military-style assault weapons and dozens of others by physical characteristic.
   The ban lapsed on September 13, 2004, despite the fact that a clear majority in the Senate voted for extension of the ban in February 2004.
