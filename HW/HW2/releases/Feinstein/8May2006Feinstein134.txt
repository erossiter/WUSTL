SEN. FEINSTEIN URGES CALIFORNIANS TO BE AWARE THAT GENERIC DRUG PRICES VARY GREATLY FROM PHARMACY TO PHARMACY
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is urging consumers to be aware that different pharmacies charge dramatically different prices for the same generic drugs. The Senator is urging Californians to take this fact into account when making decisions on where to buy when budgeting for their medication costs.  
   "I sent my staff out to compare generic drug prices in pharmacies all across California over the past few weeks, and the differences in the prices pharmacies are charging for the same drugs astounds me," Senator Feinstein said. "At a time when so many people are struggling to stay afloat amid soaring healthcare costs, doing a little price comparison research on local pharmacies is an easy way for consumers to cut down on the amount of money they spend on medications." 
   After seeing media reports about the great disparity in drug prices, Senator Feinstein recently sent her California staff out to investigate prices at pharmacies in regions across the state including San Francisco, Oakland, San Jose, Sacramento, Redding, Los Angeles, Riverside, and San Diego. 
   The survey found that the price of commonly used generic prescription drugs, such as Albuterol, which is prescribed for asthma, can vary as much as $36 from pharmacy to pharmacy. The Senator's staff visited a wide variety of pharmacies, from family owned drug stores to large discount retailers, to collect their data. The survey was conducted April 17-28, 2006, and drug prices are subject to change. Following is a chart detailing the pricing patterns among the pharmacies Senator Feinstein's staff visited:
