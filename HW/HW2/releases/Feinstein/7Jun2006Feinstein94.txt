SUPPLEMENTAL APPROPRIATIONS BILL ADDS $227.5 MILLION FOR ADVANCE PROCUREMENT OF C-17S
  The FY 06 Supplemental Appropriations bill approved by a Senate-House Conference Committee provides $227.5 million for advance procurement of C-17s, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) announced today. Final votes on the bill by the House and Senate could be as early as this week.  
   "The C-17 is a critical part of our nation's ability to move troops and equipment around the globe," Senator Feinstein said. "This fundingsends a clear message to the Pentagon and the Administration that Congress believes that closing the line would be a serious mistake." 
   "This is good news for Long Beach and the 6,500 Californians who build the C-17," Senator Feinstein said. "This funding would allow the production line to remain open beyond 2008 and ensure that if more C-17s are requested and funded, there will be no disruption in the production process." 
   "Let me thank Senators Stevens and Inouye for their continued support and leadership on this issue." 
   The Air Force has put the production of an additional 7 C-17s at the top of its FY 07 Unfunded Priorities List. Another $1.6 billion would be needed to fund the manufacturing of these aircraft. In a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee earlier this year, Air Force Chief of Staff, General T. Michael Moseley, said that the C-17 was "worth its weight in gold." 
   Advance procurement is generally used to purchase parts for aircraft and weapons systems that have long lead times so that they will be ready for installation at the appropriate time, or for which there are cost-savings in pre-ordering.
