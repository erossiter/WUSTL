SENATE APPROVES SENS. FEINSTEIN-BOXER RESOLUTION CONGRATULATING ANAHEIM DUCKS FOR WINNING 2007 STANLEY CUP CHAMPIONSHIP
  The Senate has unanimously approved a resolution offered by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-Calif.), congratulating the Anaheim Ducks for winning their first-ever Stanley Cup championship in June. This is the first time a California franchise has won the Stanley Cup.
   "The players, coaches, management, and owners of the Stanley Cup Champion Anaheim Ducks have made their community and their fans proud," Senator Feinstein said. "The Ducks have proven that hockey is alive and well in California. The entire Ducks organization is to be commended and congratulated for their magnificent achievement." 
   Senator Boxer said: "I am pleased to introduce this resolution today with Senator Dianne Feinstein to honor the Anaheim Ducks for bringing the Stanley Cup home to California. Californians are extremely proud of the team for achieving their first championship, and we hope to see many more in the years ahead!"
   The road to victory for the Ducks began with their defeat of the Minnesota Wild and Vancouver Canucks in the first two rounds of the playoffs. The Ducks then won a grueling series against the Detroit Red Wings, and then progressed to the final round where they defeated the Ottawa Senators 4 games to 1.
