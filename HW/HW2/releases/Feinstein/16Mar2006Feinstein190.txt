SENATE APPROVES SENS. FEINSTEIN, MIKULSK, COLLINS AMENDMENT TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL $390 MILLION IN FY 2007 BUDGET FOR CANCER RESEARCH
  The Senate today approved a budget amendment sponsored by Sens. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.), and Susan Collins (R-Maine) to provide an increase of $390 million for cancer research and prevention programs in the FY'07 budget.  
   Under the amendment, the budget for cancer research and prevention at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will receive a $244.6 million increase, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will receive an increase of $120.48 million, and the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) will receive an increase of $25 million. The amendment is fully offset. The amendment was cosponsored by Senators Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Robert Menendez (D-N.J.), and Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.). 
   "The Senate today reaffirmed our commitment to funding cancer research and prevention," Senator Feinstein said. "The increase to the cancer budget will help keep us on the path of eliminating cancer death and suffering by 2015. Dollar for dollar, our investments in cancer research have already made a real difference in the lives of more than ten million cancer survivors and their families across the country. The President's FY'07 budget cut $39 million in funding needed to maintain our nation's progress in cancer research and prevention. So this is an important step in the battle against cancer." 
   Last September, 92 Senators wrote President Bush in support of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) goal to eliminate cancer death and suffering by 2015. Yet, the budget calls for nearly $40 million in cuts to the NCI, the first such cut in more than a decade. The measure will ensure that the National Cancer Institute (NCI) is funded at the level needed to maintain its current operations.
