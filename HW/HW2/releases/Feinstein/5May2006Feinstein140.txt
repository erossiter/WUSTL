SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF GOSS AS CIA DIRECTOR
  Statement of Senator Dianne Feinstein
  On the Resignation of Porter Goss as Director of the CIA 
   "I am very worried about America's Intelligence Community, particularly the CIA. The Agency has experienced enormous turmoil at top levels during Porter Goss's tenure. What was hoped to be an appointment of reform turned out to be one of missed opportunities. 
   The management of the Agency and the oversight of its activities are critical. The agency is increasing in size rapidly - and that brings with it many problems that need to be addressed. Whomever the President selects must be able to gain the respect of intelligence professionals and manage them in this era of asymmetric threat. 
   This individual must be able to present unvarnished, carefully evaluated assessments to both the White House and Congress. Regretfully, that has not always been the case. 
   So as the President considers choices to be the new nominee, I hope he will name an experienced and knowledgeable intelligence professional - someone who is a skilled manager in very difficult circumstances."
