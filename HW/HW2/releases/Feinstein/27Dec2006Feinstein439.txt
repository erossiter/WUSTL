SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  "On Tuesday evening, our nation lost a man of distinction, honor, and decency. My deepest condolences go to Betty and the entire Ford family. 
   Gerald Ford did not seek the Presidency, but it was thrust upon him. And as he said, he did not 'shirk' those responsibilities. He helped heal the nation and close the wounds of the past. 
   President Ford will be remembered for putting the good of the nation above his own personal, political fortunes. It is this type of public service that should be a model for all who follow."
