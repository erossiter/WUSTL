SENATE APPROVES SENS. DODD-FEINSTEIN AMENDMENT INCREASING PEACE CORPS FUNDING BY $10 MILLION
  The U.S. Senate today approved an amendment sponsored by Senators Christopher Dodd (D-CT) and Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) that would increase funding the for the Peace Corps by $10 million, bringing the total funding appropriated to $333.5 million in FY 2008. 
   "The Peace Corps is one of the most successful programs the United States has and it is essential we continue to adequately fund it," said Dodd. "As a former Peace Corps volunteer, I know first hand the impact this program has, not only on the people in developing countries but also on the volunteers as well. This funding will allow the Peace Corps to continue sending selfless, dedicated Americans around the world to represent the very best of America." 
   "The Peace Corps is one of the most effective and successful foreign aid programs," Senator Feinstein said. "Since 1961, over 190,000 Americans, including 25,000 from California, have served as Peace Corps volunteers. I am a big fan of the Peace Corps. They are diplomats, and they build confidence in our country. At a time when US prestige is at an all time low, Peace Corps volunteers provide a different face of America - one of compassion and one of understanding."
   The funding increase was approved as an amendment to the FY 2008 Foreign operations bill. It matches the President's Budget Request and the funding level in the House State and Foreign Operations bill.
