SEN. FEINSTEIN ON PRESIDENT BUSH'S STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  "I found the speech disappointing. It was narrow and lacked vision. 
   I believe the American people have pretty much moved beyond this Administration. They've moved on to the Presidential campaign - wondering who's going to be the next President, and what does the future hold? 
   In a sense, this was a wrap-up speech. It was the beginning of the end to eight very tough years."
