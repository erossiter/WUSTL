SENATE APPROVES SENS. FEINSTEIN, BOXER MEASURE TO INCREASE SUPPLY OF NON-DRINKING WATER FOR CALIFORNIA'S BAY AREA
  The Senate today approved legislation sponsored by U.S. Senators Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer (both D-Calif.) to increase the supply of non-drinking water for California's Bay Area. The legislation was included in the comprehensive public lands bill approved by the Senate today. 
   The legislation would authorize federal assistance to seven Bay Area water recycling projects. When completed, these seven projects are estimated to make available 12,205 acre-feet of water annually in the short term, and 37,600 acre-feet annually in the long term - all while reducing demand on the Sacramento River Delta and on existing water infrastructure.
   "Water is a critical and scarce resource in California. We need to fund innovate ways to increase water supplies, including water recycling projects. Senator Feinstein said. "So, I am pleased that Congress is one step closer to helping make these Bay Area water recycling projects a reality. These initiatives are an important part of efforts to help the State meet a growing demand for water."
   Senator Boxer said, "As the population in the Bay Area and California continues to grow, we need to be more resourceful about our water usage and conservation. Through innovative water recycling, these bills will help our communities meet their water needs while relieving some strain on the Bay-Delta, which is California's lifeblood and the source of two-thirds of its water supply."
   Specifically, the bill would help seven Bay Area communities increase their municipal water supplies through innovative and much-needed water recycling projects. These seven projects are estimated to make 12,205 acre-feet of non-drinking water available annually in the short term, and 37,600 acre-feet annually in the long term, all while reducing demand on the Delta and on existing water infrastructure.
   The following projects are included in the bill:
   * Antioch Recycled Water Project (Delta Diablo Sanitation District, City of Antioch);
   * North Coast County Water District Recycled Water Project (North Coast County Water District);
   * Mountain View/Moffett Area Water Reuse Project (City of Palo Alto, City of Mountain View);
   * Pittsburg Recycled Water Project (Delta Diablo Sanitation District, City of Pittsburg);
   * Redwood City Recycled Water Project (City of Redwood);
   * South Santa Clara County Recycled Water Project (Santa Clara Valley Water District, South County Regional Wastewater Authority); and
   * South Bay Advanced Recycled Water Treatment Facility (Santa Clara Valley Water District, City of San Jose).
   Companion legislation sponsored by Representatives George Miller (D-Calif.), Anna Eshoo (D-Calif.), Mike Honda (D-Calif.), Tom Lantos (D-Calif.), Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Jerry McNerney (D-Calif.), Pete Stark (D-Calif.), and Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif.) was approved by the House in July 2007.
   The comprehensive public lands measure approved today by the Senate will require approval by the House before it can go to the President for his signature. It is expected that the House will pass the legislation soon.
