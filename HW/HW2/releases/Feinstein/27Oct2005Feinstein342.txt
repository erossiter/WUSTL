SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON HARRIET MIERS
  Statement of Senator Feinstein on Harriet Miers
   "The White House today announced the withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet Miers to the Supreme Court.  
 While I had not taken a position on this nomination and maintained an open mind, there were serious questions especially concerning her independence from the White House. History shows that no President has ever nominated one of his staff members to the Supreme Court. 
   I call on the President to name a nominee in the mainstream of American jurisprudence, who can help bring this nation together and demonstrate a scrupulous knowledge of the law and a judicial temperament that enables support by both sides of the political aisle. 
   I would urge the President to take his time in naming a new nominee. Justice Sandra Day O'Connor has agreed to continue to serve and much more important is the quality of the nominee rather than the immediacy of the appointment."
