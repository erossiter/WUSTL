SEN. FEINSTEIN URGES FARMERS TO SEEK ASSISTANCE FOR LOSSES
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced that producers who suffered damage to their crops because of the 2003 Southern California wildfires and other severe weather losses may now be eligible to file a claim with the Crop Disaster Program of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency.  
   "I am glad that those hurt by the 2003 wildfires in Southern California will be able to seek assistance for their losses from the Farm Service Agency," Senator Feinstein said. "I encourage those who suffered damage from these wildfires and other severe weather to apply for whatever assistance they may be eligible for under the Crop Disaster Program." 
   The Crop Disaster Program (CDP) reimburses producers for qualifying losses to agricultural crops due to damaging weather such as drought, freeze, winds or related conditions such as the 2003 Southern California wildfires. 
   Eligible producers may sign-up for the Crop Disaster Program at their local USDA Service Center. The CDP authorizes crop loss assistance for producers who suffered 2003 or 2004 and certain 2005 crop losses from damaging weather.
