SEN. FEINSTEIN INTRODUCES BILL TO RESTORE OVERSIGHT PROCESS FOR SAN PABLO CASINO PROJECT
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today introduced a bill to require the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians to undergo the same regulatory oversight process for building a casino as any other tribe that acquired land after October 17, 1988 - the date the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act was enacted.  
   "I have serious concerns about the expansion of Nevada-style gaming - with its slot machines and in-house banking - into urban areas," Senator Feinstein said. "This legislation is designed to prevent the Lytton Band of Pomo Indians from short-circuiting the process laid out in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act for gaming on newly acquired lands." 
   Last year, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger entered into a compact with the Lytton Tribe that authorized 5,000 slot machines in a 6-8 story casino in the city of San Pablo . The proposed facility would have been the largest casino outside of Connecticut , including those in Las Vegas . Alarmed by the size of the proposed project, the Legislature refused to take up and approve the compact, even after the Governor scaled back the proposal to include only 2,500 slot machines. 
   Senator Feinstein's bill would strike a provision in the 2000 Indian Omnibus Advancement Act - inserted by Congressman George Miller (D-Calif.) - which allows the Lytton Tribe to sidestep gaming requirements in the Indian Gaming Regulatory Act. The provision required the Secretary of Interior to backdate the acquisition of a card club property in San Pablo to October 17, 1988. 
   If the legislation is approved, the Lytton tribe would be required to go through a two-part determination process that requires both the Secretary of Interior and a State's Governor to sign off on plans to build a gaming facility. This process also provides for consultation with local communities and nearby tribes prior to its completion.
