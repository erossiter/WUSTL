SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  "It is my hope that the Attorney General's resignation will signal the beginning of a real change in the Department of Justice.  
   This is an important step, and I hope the President moves rapidly to fill this position, since so many of the top-level people at the Department have in fact resigned. 
   I spoke with the White House this morning, and suggested a couple of nominees who I believe would easily gain confirmation. 
   With the right person in place, a very distressing chapter in the Justice Department's history can be closed and the process of restoring its credibility as a strong and independent department can begin."
