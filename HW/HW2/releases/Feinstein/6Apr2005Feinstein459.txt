SEN. FEINSTEIN WELCOMES PLANS TO MOVE MOAB WASTE AWAY FROM WATER SUPPLY
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today welcomed a decision by the Energy Department in favor of moving millions of tons of radioactive uranium processing waste off the banks of the Colorado River, which is a major source of drinking water for Southern Californians as well as residents of Utah, Nevada and Arizona.  
   However, Senator Feinstein noted that the decision is not yet final. She urged the Department to chose this preferred alternative and provide funding for it. The following is a comment from Senator Feinstein: 
   "I am delighted that the Department of Energy has announced that off-site disposal is the preferred option for remediation of the uranium mill tailings pile in Moab, Utah. This is the right action. 
   Off-site disposal of the tailings pile and other contaminated materials is the only option that offers long-term protection to the citizens of Moab and the 25 million Americans who use the Colorado River Water downstream. 
   This is an important step forward, but the final decision is yet to be made. When the environmental review process is complete, I urge the Department of Energy to commit to off-site disposal of these dangerous toxic wastes."
