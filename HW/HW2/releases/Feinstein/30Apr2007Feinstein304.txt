SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON ANNOUNCEMENT THAT U.S. TRUCKS WILL HAVE EQUAL ACCESS TO MEXICO
  The U.S. Department of Transportation announced today that a pilot program will grant American truckers full access to Mexican highways at the same time that Mexican truckers gain access to American highways.  
   Earlier this year, Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) co-sponsored legislation to ensure that American truckers had equal access to Mexico. This legislation was included in the Emergency Supplemental Spending Bill, which has been approved by Congress and is in front of the President for his signature or veto. The following is Senator Feinstein's statement:
   "This is good news," Senator Feinstein said. "The cornerstones of this pilot program are equality and reciprocity. And this change will help balance the scales.
   I was disturbed to learn earlier this year that Mexican truckers would have started the program a full six months before American truckers would have gained access to Mexico. That would have simply been unfair.
   I want to thank Transportation Secretary Mary Peters for her efforts, through talks with the Mexican government and members of Congress, to restore fairness to this important program."
