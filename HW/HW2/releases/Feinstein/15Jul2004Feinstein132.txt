SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE APPROVES $10 BILLION SPENDING BILL TO FUND MILITARY CONSTRUCTION, HOUSING, REMEDIATION PROJECTS
  The U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a $10.003 billion spending package to fund construction, housing, and remediation projects at U.S. military bases across the nation and around the world. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX) is Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, and Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) is Ranking Member of the subcommittee. 
   "At a time when retention of military personnel is critical, this bill helps fund critical infrastructure and family housing projects across the nation and overseas," Senator Feinstein said. "It is a balanced bill that helps meet the needs of our military forces. Let me thank my chairman, Senator Hutchison, for her work in bringing this bill to Committee. I also want to t hank Senator Stevens and Senator Byrd for their leadership and support in helping to develop this package, and I look forward to working with them to take this bill to the floor."
   The package contains:
   * $5.3 billion for military construction projects B used for the construction of barracks, child development centers, hospitals and medical facilities, security investments, and funding for guard and reserve units.
   * $4.2 billion of Family Housing Projects - used for the construction of new family housing as well as improvements and maintenance of existing housing units.
   * $246 million for Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) environmental cleanup projects (in addition to $114 million in estimated Navy land sale revenues), providing $321 million in environmental cleanup and $40 million for operations and maintenance.
   * $166 million for NATO Security Investment program.
   The legislation also includes a provision to give the Forest Service the first right to acquire Fort Hunter-Liggett in Big Sur, if the installation is closed in the future.
   "I also wish to thank Senator Hutchison for her support of an effort that is very important to me. Fort Hunter-Liggett, an Army Reserve training base, occupies 165,000 acres in an extraordinary location, in the heart of California's Big Sur region adjacent to the Los Padres National Forest. The property is truly unique, and the Forest Service would like to incorporate it into a new national forest if it becomes excess to military needs. Although we are aware of no plans to close the base at this time, given the ongoing Base Realignment and Closure process, and the unique attributes of Fort Hunter Liggett, Senator Hutchison has supported me by including bill language that would give the Forest Service the first right to acquire the property should the installation be closed in the future."
