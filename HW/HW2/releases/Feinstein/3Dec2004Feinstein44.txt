SEN. FEINSTEIN'S STATEMENT URGING PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO REFORM INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY
  "More than three years have passed since the 9/11 attacks tragically illustrated that there are fundamental flaws in the structure and operation of our nation's Intelligence Community.  
 After lengthy investigations by the Intelligence Committees in Congress and the 9/11 Commission, we have learned the crucial importance of having a Director of National Intelligence with budgetary, statutory and personnel authority to oversee the 15 fragmented agencies that make up our Intelligence Community. 
   President Bush, Vice President Cheney, the 9/11 Commission, families of 9/11 victims, and now even Gen. Richard B. Myers, the chairman of the Joints Chiefs of Staff, all support legislation that would establish this Director of National Intelligence and create a new Counter-Terrorism Center. It is a good law that is desperately needed and would make America safer. 
   If Speaker Dennis Hastert continues to refuse to allow a vote on this legislation because a few members of the Republican House leadership put partisan issues over the nation's security, it would be a terrible mistake. Every day we wait makes it more likely that poor intelligence will leave our nation vulnerable to another attack. Congress must pass this vital law."
