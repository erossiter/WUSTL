SEN. FEINSTEIN URGES SUPPORT FOR INTERNATIONAL DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO ENGAGE IRAN IN NUCLEAR TALKS
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today voted to table an amendment offered by Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.) that would strengthen sanctions against Iran . Sen. Feinstein said she believes that unilateral action by the United States now on sanctions could undermine coordinated international diplomatic efforts currently underway to engage Iran in nuclear talks. The following is her statement on tabling the amendment:  
   "While I am a co-sponsor of Senator Santorum's 'Iran Freedom and Support Act of 2005,' I do not believe we should vote on an amendment to strengthen sanctions on Iran at this time. 
   Simply put, we should give diplomacy a chance to succeed. A unilateral move by the United States to tighten sanctions on Iran may undermine the united front presented by the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council and Germany. 
   The United States, Russia, China, France, the United Kingdom, and Germany have presented a package of incentives to Iran to compel Tehran to suspend its uranium enrichment activities and return to the negotiating table on its nuclear program. 
   President Bush has stated that the United States will take part in those talks if Iran accepts. This is an important step forward. 
   With diplomacy at the forefront of this issue, we should support the Administration's efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the Iran's nuclear program and put off a vote on Senator Santorum's amendment. We can always revisit this issue at another time."
