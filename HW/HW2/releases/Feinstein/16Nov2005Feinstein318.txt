FINAL SCIENCE-STATE-JUSTICE-COMMERCE APPROPRIATIONS BILL INCLUDES MILLIONS FOR CALIFORNIA
  The Senate today approved a final Science State Justice Commerce appropriations conference report to fund vital projects in California to improve communications among first responders, enhance public safety, combat methamphetamines and gangs, invest in coastal and science research, and restore criminal justice costs associated with incarcerating undocumented immigrants. 
   "California faces serious public safety challenges - including escalating gang violence, the scourge of methamphetamine, and the cost of incarcerating criminal aliens," Senator Feinstein said. "This bill provides a federal hand of assistance for law enforcement agencies confronting these challenges. More funding needs to be provided, but these funds will allow us to continue the fight."  
   The bill funds the Departments of State, Justice, and Commerce, as well as the National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA), National Science Foundation, and the Small Business Administration. The bill has passed both chambers of Congress and now goes to the President for his signature. 
   Following is a partial list of programs and projects included in the bill important to California: 
   * $405 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP), which assists states to bear the cost of incarcerating undocumented immigrants. 
   * $30 million for the Southwest Border Prosecutors Initiative, which reimburses states and localities for work on federally declined cases. Since 2002 California has received almost $50 million for border prosecution cases, more than any other state involved in the program. 
   Methamphetamine Enforcement 
   * $20 million for DEA to assist State and local law enforcement with proper removal and disposal of hazardous materials at clandestine meth labs and to initiate a container program 
   * $1.5 million for Attorney General Bill Lockyer's California Methamphetamine Strategy 
   * $100,000 for the Fresno County District Attorney's Methamphetamine Initiative 
   * $100,000 for City of Woodland Methamphetamine Enforcement 
   "This nation needs to come to grips with the meth epidemic," Senator Feinstein said. "This means passing a tough bill limiting access to pseudoephedrine. It means increasing interdiction efforts at the border. It means doing more research into prevention and treatments. And it means fully funding our nation's law enforcement agencies. 
   There is no question that more funding is needed. The epidemic has moved from rural areas in California to a nationwide epidemic. That's why I've worked on a bipartisan basis to pass the combat meth act and to support additional funding. Only if we work together will we ever be able to bring this problem under control. 
   I am disappointed that we have not yet been able to come to an agreement on a bill limiting access to meth, but I am still hopeful that we can work out a bill by the end of the session. 
   Additionally, I am disappointed that additional funding was not provided for the nation's Drug Courts, which have proven to be an effective and important tool in fighting drug abuse."
