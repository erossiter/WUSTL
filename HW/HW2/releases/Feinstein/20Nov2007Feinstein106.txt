SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT IN RESPONSE TO SUPREME COURT DECISION TO REVIEW DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA'S HANDGUN BAN
  Statement of Senator Feinstein in Response to the Supreme Court Decision to Review the District of Columbia's Handgun Ban 
   "This will be the most important gun decision since the Miller case in 1939. (U.S. v. Miller) 
   In Miller, the Supreme Court spoke loud and clear, and held unanimously that prosecuting someone for transporting a sawed-off shotgun did not violate the Second Amendment. For more than 60 years, the Miller case has been settled law, and it has meant that states could enact reasonable restrictions on firearms. 
   A decision by the Roberts Court to overturn this settled precedent would be a major change in the law and in sharp contrast to professed notions of judicial restraint."
