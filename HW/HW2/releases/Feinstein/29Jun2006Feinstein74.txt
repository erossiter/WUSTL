SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON SUPREME COURT RULING IN HAMDAN CASE
  "The decision today is a major statement by the Supreme Court that clearly limits this President's attempt to assert that the Executive Branch's plenary power trumps constitutional rights and privileges.  
   Today, in this decision the Supreme Court made it clear that the President was wrong when trying to assert that he could detain certain noncitizens without providing them due process. 
   The Court declared that the military commission at issue 'lacks the power to proceed because its structure and procedures violate both the Uniform Code of Military Justice and the four Geneva Conventions signed in 1949.' 
   This is a major defeat for the Administration's expansive views of Executive authority and I hope it will not be the last."
