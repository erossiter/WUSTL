CONGRESS APPROVES $6.5 MILLION FOR CALIFORNIA SALMON RECOVERY
  Congress approved $6.5 million for California salmon recovery efforts today as part of the 2006 spending bill for the Department of Commerce. Rep.  
 Mike Thompson ( D-North Coast) worked with California Sen. Dianne Feinstein to secure California's portion of the Pacific Salmon Recovery Fund. 
   The Pacific Salmon Recovery Fund is a program run through the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which provides funding for salmon habitat restoration and recovery efforts throughout the Pacific Northwest. 
   "This year's drastically reduced salmon season is yet another tell tale sign of our dwindling wild salmon population," Thompson said. "This salmon recovery funding will aid in the effort to restore our salmon habitat. The federal share for California salmon recovery is especially important this year, in light of Governor Schwarzenegger's recent veto of a state bill that would have provided additional salmon habitat." 
   "Salmon are important to many Californians, whether they be outdoor enthusiasts, sport fisherman, or commercial fisherman," Senator Feinstein said. "We have an obligation to improve salmon habitat and to sustain healthy populations. While I am disappointed that there is less funding this year than in previous years, I think PacificCoast Salmon Recovery Fund is important and will help in the effort to save California salmon." 
   The House of Representatives passed the Science, Commerce, Justice and State Appropriations bill Wednesday. After the Senate passes the bill today it will be sent to the President for his signature.
