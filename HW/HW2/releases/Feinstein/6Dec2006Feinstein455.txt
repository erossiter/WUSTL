SEN. FEINSTEIN PRAISING SENATE PASSAGE OF THREE-YEAR COMPROMISE MEASURE TO RENEW RYAN WHITE CARE ACT
"I am very pleased this three-year compromise has passed the Senate by unanimous consent. It is my hope that it will now speed its way through the House. The Ryan White CARE Act is extraordinarily important to California, and this bill will result in a formula funding increase of approximately $5.5 million in our state next year."
