SEN. FEINSTEIN COMMENTS ON TESTING OF MISSILES BY NORTH KOREA
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today issued the following statement regarding the recent testing of missiles by North Korea:  
   "North Korean's decision to test fire seven missiles, including an intercontinental missile that failed after it was launched, is another sign of desperation and defiance by that country. It is a provocative step that deserves worldwide condemnation. However, it has always been my view that if the North Koreans want to talk to the United States directly, we should not turn that opportunity down. The six party talks are fine, but it makes no sense to me that we ratchet up the isolation, which only moves Pyongyang closer to overt hostility."
