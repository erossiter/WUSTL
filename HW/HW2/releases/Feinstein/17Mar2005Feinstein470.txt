SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE APPROVES HIGHER LEVEL OF REIMBURSEMENT FOR INCARCERATING CRIMINAL ALIENS
  The U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee today approved a bill by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) to reauthorize the program to reimburse states and localities for the costs of incarcerating criminal undocumented immigrants and increase the funds they receive. 
   In a related action, the full Senate approved an amendment by Sen. Feinstein proclaiming that $750 million should be budgeted in Fiscal Year 2006 for that purpose and that the program should be reauthorized long term. The nonbinding amendment expressed the sense of the Senate that the budget resolution should accommodate an appropriation of $750 million for the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) for fiscal year 2006 and reauthorize the program long-term. 
   It was cosponsored by Senators Jon Kyl (R-Ariz.), Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Jeff Bingaman (D-NM), John Cornyn (R-TX), Daniel Akaka (D-HI), Hilary Clinton (D-NY), Chuck Schumer (D-NY) and Russ Feingold (D-WI).
   Earlier in the day, the Judiciary Committee approved the SCAAP reauthorization bill by Senator Feinstein, which was cosponsored by Senators Kyl, Hutchison, Bingaman, Schumer, Cornyn, Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), Maria Cantwell (D-WA), John McCain (R-Ariz.) Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ) and others. 
   "Control of illegal immigration is a Federal responsibility. When our Federal agencies fall short in this responsibility, State and local taxpayers should not have to foot the bill," Senator Feinstein said. "This legislation is intended to remind the Federal government to fulfill its duties and to help State and local governments deal with the burden that illegal criminal aliens have placed on their justice systems." 
   "SCAAP properly vests the financial burden of incarcerating undocumented criminal aliens with the Federal government, when these aliens commit serious crimes in the United States," Senator Feinstein said. "Increasingly, States, counties and local governments from all across the United States have made use of these funds over the years. Unfortunately, for the past four years, the President has zeroed out, or proposed eliminating, SCAAP."
   Enacted as part of the Crime Act of 1994, SCAAP provided states between $500 million and $585 million in reimbursement funding annually from 1996 to 2002. Since 2003, however, the Bush Administration has proposed no funding for SCAAP and Congress has only provided a fraction of the amount requested by states. 
   In the past three years, Congress has approved the following amounts for SCAAP: 
   * $250 million for 2003, 
  * $296.8 million for 2004, and 
  * $305 million for 2005. 
   It is estimated that states incur approximately $13 billion in criminal justice costs each year for housing illegal criminal aliens. The SCAAP authorization expired in October 2004. Under the bipartisan legislation, the program would be restored and funding would be authorized at the following levels: 
   * $750 million in Fiscal Year 2006 
  * $850 million in Fiscal Year 2007 
  * $950 million in Fiscal Years 2008 through 2011.
