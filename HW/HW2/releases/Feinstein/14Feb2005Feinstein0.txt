SEN. FEINSTEIN ISSUES STATEMENT ON MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM FAILURE
  "The latest test failure of the missile defense system - the second since December 15th - demonstrates once again that we are rushing to deploy a system that is unproven, too costly, and inadequate for our national security needs in the post-September 11th world.  
   While the President's FY 2006 budget request cuts approximately $1 billion in funding for the missile defense program, it remains the most expensive defense program in the Pentagon's budget. 
   Yet, there is no indication that the system will actually work while our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq lack body armor and other equipment essential for their missions. No missile defense can stop a terrorist from smuggling a nuclear bomb into this country on a container ship or through another soft port of entry. 
   Clearly, we need to take a step back and make better decisions on how to spend our resources to face a growing number of national security challenges, including providing for non-proliferation activities, deterrence, homeland security, and counter-proliferation."
