SEN. FEINSTEIN SUPPORTS MOVING CALIFORNIA'S PRESIDENTIAL PRIMARY TO FEBRUARY
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced her support for bipartisan measures in the state Legislature that would move California's presidential primary to February, up from June. 
   "California is the largest state in the nation and has 55 electoral votes - far more than any other state. But California is little more than an afterthought in presidential politics. Because of the front-loaded presidential primaries, by the time Californians go to the polls in June, the decision has already been made," Senator Feinstein said.
   "California is the most ethnically diverse, culturally rich state in the nation and a leader in many industries. If it were an independent nation, it would have the sixth-largest economy in the world."
   "California deserves to have a strong voice in selecting presidential nominees. For this reason, I support moving the primary to February." 
   California has historically held its primary elections in June. In 1996 it switched to March in a bid to give voters a larger voice in selecting presidential nominees, but other states moved their primaries ahead of California's.
   Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, who signed legislation in 2004 moving the primary back to June, has voiced support for moving the primary to February.
