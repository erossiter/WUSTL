SENS. BOXER, FEINSTEIN INTRODUCE LEGISLATION TO ENSURE ALL TRUCKS OPERATING WITHIN U.S. BORDERS MEET EPA'S EMISSIONS STANDARDS
  Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein (both D-Calif.) today introduced legislation to ensure that all heavy-duty diesel trucks operating within U.S. borders meet EPA's emissions standards. 
   Pursuant to NAFTA and a recent Supreme Court decision, the U.S. will begin allowing foreign heavy-duty diesel trucks to operate within the U.S. by January 2005. But, under current law, those trucks will not be required to meet the federal or state air quality standards.
   The Boxer-Feinstein bill would amend the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Act (FMCSA) to require that all heavy-duty diesel trucks operating in the United States meet the national clean air requirements. The bill would also require that the FMCSA collect information on the travel routes and fuel consumption of heavy-duty diesel trucks to enable EPA to estimate emissions associated with such transportation.
   "Heavy-duty diesel trucks cause 40 percent of all nitrogen oxide emissions in California," said Senator Boxer. "We already know the health risks associated with diesel exhaust- cancer, asthma, respiratory and cardiovascular disease. It is time to take reasonable steps to protect our communities, as millions of foreign trucks are added to our highways."
   "If heavy-duty diesel trucks that do not meet EPA emission standards continue to cross the border and travel unfettered throughout California, it will be harder and harder to meet our State's clean air standards," said Senator Feinstein. This legislation is necessary to ensure that California's efforts to improve air quality remain on track."
