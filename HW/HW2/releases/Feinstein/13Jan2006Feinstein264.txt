SEN. FEINSTEIN ANNOUNCES $8.7 MILLION IN FEMA PRE-DISASTER MITIGATION COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR FOUR CALIFORNIA CITIES
  Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) today announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has awarded approximately $8.7 million in Pre-Disaster Mitigation Competitive Grant (PDM-C) funds to four California cities: San Francisco, Santa Clara, Burbank, and San Diego.  
   "I am very pleased by this news," Senator Feinstein said. "The Federal Government has an important responsibility to help local municipalities safeguard their critical infrastructure before disaster strikes. These funds will ensure that vital federal resources are available to protect our communities."
   FEMA's PDM -C grant program provides a consistent source of funding to state, tribal, and local governments for pre-disaster mitigation planning and projects. Funding these plans and projects reduces overall risks to the population and structures, while also reducing reliance on funding from actual disaster declarations. 
   The approximately $8.7 million of FEMA pre-disaster mitigation grant funds will be distributed to important critical infrastructure projects in four California cities: 
   * City of San Francisco: FEMA has awarded San Francisco's Public Utilities Commission $2,999,109 for the Hayward Fault Mitigation Project. These pipelines are an essential link in the Commission's water transmission system for delivering water to San Francisco and 29 neighboring cities. The Commission's share of this $13,856,109 project is $10,857,000. 
   * City of San Diego: FEMA has awarded $2,999,999 in funds to the San Diego Water Department for a seismic upgrade for critical water transmission pipes at specific locations with very high probabilities for failure in earthquakes at fault crossings, liquefaction and landslide zones. The seismic upgrade includes additional valves and bypass manifolds in the high hazard area to allow rapid restoration of service via temporary pipe. The city of San Diego's share of the $3,999,999 total project cost is $1,000,000. 
   * County of Santa Clara: FEMA has awarded $1,338,665 to the County of Santa Clara Roads and Airports Department for the Old Santa Cruz Highway Project over Aldercroft Creek. The highway currently runs on top of a box culvert to cross the creek. This culvert and the embankment are susceptible to recurring storm damage creating deterioration and closure of the roadway. A water supply line under the roadway is also endangered due to roadway collapse. The county's share of the $2,195,000 project is $856,345. 
   * City of Burbank: FEMA has awarded $1,439,791 to the City of Burbank for a seismic strengthening of five municipal buildings: the Field Services Administration building, Police Pistol Range, Water Reclamation Plant, Starlight Amphitheater, and the Public Works Refuse Locker Room. The retrofit includes the installation of masonry wall anchors and the strengthening of diaphragms and sheer walls. The city's share of the $1,919,722 project is $479,930.
