     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                    Chairman Smith Announces Working Group To Combat Retirement Income Gap For Women Aging Committee hearing focuses on financial security for retiring women         March 15th  2006   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Gordon Smith  Chairman of the Special Committee on Aging  today held a hearing titled Bridging the Gender Gap  Eliminating Retirement Income Disparity for Women  The hearings goal was to highlight the challenges faced by women in planning for retirement and to find ways to increase womens savings rates   Because women earn only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men and tend to spend longer periods of time outside the workforce  their earning power and ability to save is greatly diluted  According to the U S  Census Bureau  in 2004 the average annual income of men over age 65 was  32  420 whereas women earned only  17 124    Bridging the gender gap is a serious challenge that must be met if we are to ensure women are financially secure in their retirement years  said Smith  We must encourage Americans to save more now so future generations of retirees are not solely dependent on Social Security to meet their needs later in life   The gender gap is exacerbated due to women living longer than men  thus needing a longer stream of income in retirement  As a result  of the 3 5 million Americans over age 65 living in poverty in 2004  nearly 70 percent were women   At the hearing  Chairman Smith announced the formation of a working group to develop bipartisan legislation specifically aimed at narrowing the income gap between retired men and women  The group will be comprised of a broad coalition of advocacy groups  financial services experts and employer organizations  with legislation expected to be introduced in the coming months   Because women face these unique obstacles in preparing for retirement  our government must do more to level the playing field  said Smith  We must work to allow every American an equal opportunity to be comfortable and secure in their golden years                                                                                                                      current Press Release
