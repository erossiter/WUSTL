     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                    Smith Introduces Legislation to Protect Low Income Taxpayers from Unscrupulous Loan Providers          April 21st  2005   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  has introduced the Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act  S  832  with a bipartisan group of leading Finance Committee members to improve oversight of businesses that issue Refund Anticipation Loans      RALs can be helpful for families in tight financial situations     said Smith     But these costs are outrageous and take advantage of people desperate for money   We need to make sure people understand what they  re getting into       Refund Anticipation Loans  RALs  are high interest  high cost short term loans secured by a taxpayer  s expected tax refund   Over 10 million RALs are taken each year by consumers seeking quick cash in exchange for their tax refunds   In 2003 alone  consumers paid an estimated  1 billion in RAL fees  plus an additional  389 million in administrative or application fees   RAL providers do business  mainly with low income Americans  over half of whom receive the Earned Income Tax Credit   According to the Internal Revenue Service  79  of RAL borrowers have incomes of  35 000 or less  and it is estimated that most have an average income of  17 800   Despite the prevalence of RALs  consumers have little understanding of their true nature   A nationwide survey indicated that two thirds did not know that a RAL is a loan  yet effective annualized interest rates for RALs often exceed 100         The Taxpayer Protection and Assistance Act of 2005  TPAA  requires the annual registration of refund anticipation loan  RAL  facilitators with the Secretary of the Treasury   The TPAA permits the Treasury Secretary to impose monetary penalties on RAL facilitators who fail to meet the registration or disclosure requirements   In addition  the bill requires the Secretary to conduct a public awareness campaign to educate the public on the costs associated with refund anticipation loans   The bill also requires that RAL facilitators disclose the following information to taxpayers        that taxpayers have the right to file an electronic tax return without applying for a RAL  and the cost of filing such an electronic return compared to the cost of the RAL       all fees and interest charges associated with the loan  and provide a comparison with fees and interest charges associated with other types of consumer credit        the expected time within which tax refunds are typically paid based on different filing options  the risk that the full amount of the refund may not be paid or received within the expected time  and additional costs the taxpayer may incur in connection with the RAL if the tax refund is delayed or not paid        whether the RAL agreement includes a debt collection offset arrangement    Debt collection offsets are arrangements between RAL facilitators and a taxpayer  s creditor to offset the expected refund against an outstanding debt      I think that  given the facts  many people will demand better deals for RALs     said Smith     And with better oversight  we  ll be able to stop unscrupulous lenders from preying on taxpayers                                                                         current Press Release
