     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Phone             Smith Works for County Payment Extension                                    January 24th  2007   Mr  SMITH  I thank my colleague  Mr  President    I join Senator Wyden in saying this is my No  1 priority as well  It is an emergency  It is not a natural disaster  but it is related to natural resources  It is a disaster that has been in the making through the course of a decade and more of Congresses  courts  and  obviously  the effort of the Clinton administration to reduce timber harvest on public lands in the Pacific Northwest  That has created a circumstance in the Pacific Northwest that Senator Wyden and I seek to address  We do so because it is such an emergency  We have to look for every opportunity  every train that is leaving the station  to bring this to the attention of Congress and to get it to President Bush  who has said he will sign an extension    For the benefit of the record  let me indicate some of the history of this issue  All of this was done with the best of intentions as it relates to natural resources and the management of public lands  It was done to benefit the spotted owl  threatened species under the Endangered Species Act  I should add that after 15 years of negligible harvest on public lands  the owl is still not recovering and its habitat is being incinerated by catastrophic wildfire      Whether tacit or intentional  those management decisions have caused severe costs that are borne on the backs of those who can least afford it  These people and communities need relief as much as those burdened by other disasters  such as hurricanes or tidal waves      The timber war has had many casualties  It has been a catastrophe for rural communities  County governments  colleagues  receive a share of timber receipts from Federal lands  25 percent from the Forest Service and 50 percent from BLM  The State Senator Wyden and I represent is more than 50 percent owned by the Federal Government  What you have  therefore  is timber locked communities      For generations  these timber receipts have provided funds to offset the fact that local communities cannot tax the Federal Government  It makes up the vast majority of their funds to operate their counties  their schools  public safety  When timber harvest evaporated  so did county budgets      In 1999  my colleague from Oregon  Senator Craig from Idaho  myself  and others came to this floor to describe what was happening to rural Oregon  Schools went to 4 days a week  They dropped sports and extracurricular activities and curtailed other programs  Communities were forced to make heartbreaking decisions over whether to cut social service programs or school funding or to sharply reduce sheriffs  patrols and close jails      Fortunately  Congress created a safety net in the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act of 2000  This provided funding to counties based on historic rather than current timber harvest levels  and it kept them afloat until the Federal timber program stabilized  a stabilization for which we are still awaiting     I realize other States may think Oregon receives too much assistance under this program  however  I would ask  what other Federal disaster assistance is not allocated based on the intensity and location of the disaster  You go where the problem exists  Between 1987 and 2002  Federal timber harvest in Oregon dropped 96 percent  That is an annual shortfall of enough wood to build over 235 000 homes      Without a county payment safety net  here is an example of what my county commissioners are facing  Curry County  located on the southern Oregon coast  has an annual general fund of  7 7 million  The safety net accounts for over  4 million of that  7 million  The county is not legally able to raise property taxes  but it is constitutionally bound to fund administrative and law enforcement functions  Curry County has 11 000 homes  To replace the safety net funding with new property taxes  it would need over 35 000 new homes valued at  345 000 each  That is not going to happen  With only 22 000 residents and 1 43 percent of its land available for development  this is simply an impossibility      But the safety net is not just about Oregon counties  In the life of the legislation  California received  308 million  Idaho   102 million  Montana   63 4 million   That program expired on our watch 4 months ago  Now rural counties across the Nation are dangling on an economic tightrope without a safety net to catch them  My colleague from Oregon and I have left no stone unturned to find money for an extension  Those efforts have been unsuccessful  We stand here with our timber dependent counties at the mercy  once more  of the Federal Government  If we do not extend the safety net  many counties in my State stand to lose nearly 70 percent of their general and road funds    Preparations are already underway to close public libraries  pink slips to thousands of county employees will soon be in the mail  vital search and rescue operations will be curtailed  The Nation has seen these search and rescue operations go tragically in several cases recently on national TV     Oregon has lived with devastating Federal mandates on our forests  but we cannot live with an instant evisceration of our public services  That cannot be the rural legacy of this Congress     My colleague from Oregon and I have filed this amendment to the minimum wage bill to provide a 1 year extension of the safety net  It is only fitting that as we consider raising wages for workers in the private sector  we address the very future of jobs and services in the public sector     We are also introducing legislation for a full reauthorization  and we will make every attempt at every opportunity in this Congress to turn back the tide that is quickly approaching rural communities and counties across the Nation  We can prevent this natural disaster  a natural disaster that has a human component  I join with my colleague to express our determination and thank him for his leadership  his authorship of this in the first instance  and of our mutual determination for the sake of our State to right this wrong                                                                                                                 current Press Release
