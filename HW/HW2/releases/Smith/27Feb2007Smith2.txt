     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Kimberly CollinsPhone  202 224 5364           Raise the Federal Tobacco Tax to Cover More Kids  Smith Says               February 27th  2007   Washington  DC   Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR  announced today that he will support a raise in the federal tobacco tax to fund health care coverage for more children and pregnant women under the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   SCHIP must be reauthorized by the end of 2007  Senator Smith has said he would use the increased revenue to expand the program to cover all children and pregnant women up to 300 percent of the poverty line   41 070 for a family of two     I will support an increase in the federal tobacco tax and dedicate the additional revenue to covering more children  said Senator Smith  It is rare that I even consider a proposal that raises taxes  However  as I have done before  both in Oregon in 1993 for the Oregon Health Plan and in Washington D C   I have and will vote to support an increase in the tobacco tax if I believe the cause is just  The reauthorization and expansion of SCHIP is just such a case  The goal is laudable and I believe warrants the change    This year  funding expires and we have a challenge on our hands to come up with the needed funds to continue the program in its current form and expand coverage so more children receive help  An increase in the tobacco tax brings us closer to achieving this goal  When it comes to the health of our children  we cannot be penny wise  pound foolish  The health of our children is worth our investment   Senator Smiths priorities for the SCHIP reauthorization are as follows   Ensure all those who are enrolled in the program continue to receive coverage   Cover those currently eligible  but not enrolled   Expand coverage to all pregnant women and children up to 200 percent of the federal poverty level   27  380 for a family of two    With new revenue from an increased tobacco tax  expand coverage for pregnant women and children up to 300 percent of the federal poverty level   41 070 for a family of two   and  Cover parents if additional funding is available                                                                                  current Press Release
