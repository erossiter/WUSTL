25th  2006   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Ron Wyden and Gordon Smith today announced that the U S  Senate Appropriations Committee has approved millions of dollars in funding for defense related projects in Oregon  including significant funding for a number of Oregon nanotechnology projects through the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute  ONAMI    Oregon businesses are producing technologies that will help protect our soldiers and fortify our security at home  Smith said  Many of the projects have applications beyond the battlefield  The investments we are making today will pay off in other areas tomorrow such as using wave energy to create electricity  This investment also sustains jobs ensuring Oregons economy continues to grow   Funding for Oregon s new nanotechnology research center  as well as numerous other nanotech projects  demonstrates that our state is truly a national leader in this growing field  Wyden said  The targeted investments we re making in basic research and innovative projects will provide a significant boost to Oregons economy and further develop technologies that have important applications in saving lives  for our national defense  and for civilian use   The projects that would receive funding are as follows   ONAMI would receive  2 076 million for the Center for Nanotechnology for Thermal Management and Portable Power
