     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Phone             Safety Top Concern in Review of Port Deal  Smith Says                    Roughly 3 percent of the ships in American ports bear American flags     February 28th  2006   WASHINGTON  DC    During a hearing of the Senate Commerce Committee Tuesday on port safety U S  Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR  emphasized the safety of America  s ports is far more important then the nationality of the owners of Dubai Ports World  DP World  which has purchased the P Port division of P Group  a British company         I don  t believe we would be having this hearing if the company in question was still owned by the British     Smith said     We need friends in the Middle East  we certainly need them in the war on terror and the UAE has been a friend   I want to make sure the security of the American people is provided for without regard to the ethnicity to the owners of this company      During the hearing Smith also noted the tight economic connections that exist today in global trade      I think the American people would be shocked to find just how internationalized shipping is  that roughly only 3 percent of the ships in our ports bear American flags   Soon a South Korean company and a Taiwanese company will be delivering goods into Portland   And if you travel to Oakland  Los Angeles  Seattle  you ll find their port terminals are also operated by many different nationalities   Smith urged his colleagues to stick to the facts and keep safety in mind when reviewing the port deal      I think my question is simply was the law followed   Was security adequately provided for   And do we need to change the law                                                             current Press Release
