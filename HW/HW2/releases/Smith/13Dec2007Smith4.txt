guardianship system                December 13th  2007   Washington  DC   In response to increasing accounts of elder abuse in America by a legal guardian  Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR  released findings in a report on the condition of federal oversight in the guardianship system  The report  Guardianship for the Elderly  Protecting the Rights and Welfare of Seniors with Reduced Capacity  highlights difficulties as well as emphasizes the need for systematic improvements to the guardianship system at the federal level  Senator Herb Kohl  D WI  is a co signer of the report    We are all aging  but unfortunately  I cannot say with confidence that if any one of us becomes incapacitated that a robust system is in place to protect our person and our financial assets  said Senator Smith  Americas guardianship system remains largely unregulated and unsupervised  I drafted this report so we can offer proposals for action at the federal level to ensure we are properly looking after the welfare of those who cant protect themselves   Court monitoring of guardians is crucial to guarantee the welfare of incapacitated persons  said John Rother  AARPs Policy Director  Judicial monitoring in many areas remains spotty  and AARP is releasing a report today with recommended practices that will provide a road map for better oversight   Senator Smith held a hearing as Chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging in 2006 focusing on guardianship abuse of the elderly  The hearing worked to highlight the system deficiencies and the needs of Americas seniors who likely will be served by guardians in years to come    Following the hearing  Senator Smith released a call for papers from the guardianship community and individuals impacted by elder abuse seeking suggestions for systematic improvement  The submissions helped Senator Smith produce a report focusing on both the challenges to and recommendations for change to Americas guardianship system  The report was released today in conjunction with an AARP American Bar Association  ABA  guardianship report focusing on state needs related to the guardianship community      Issues discussed in the report for possible legislative action include  National Federal Quality Standards and Education Training  Evidence suggests there is a need for a uniform set of federal standards and best practices relating to guardianship  Current standards exist through organizations such as the National Guardianship Association  but no federal entity has undertaken such an effort nor is there any enforcement mechanism     Federal Guardianship Office  Another suggestion that is repeated by the majority of shareholders is the need for a guardianship office at the national level  possibly administered through the Department of Justice  which would serve as a centralized hub to promote best practices  training standards  data collection and oversight for guardians   Intergovernmental Coordination  Efforts to enhance coordination between government agencies are necessary  Issues related to guardianship fall under many different government agency jurisdictions  including the Social Security Administration  Department of Justice  Department of Health and Human Services  among others  Increased coordination would ensure that agencies are working together to ensure overlaps and gaps are minimal   Increased Government Assistance and Involvement  Parallel with the call for overall systematic improvement is the need for added government involvement and funding  The government should provide funding streams to those tasked with improving guardianship throughout the country  Data Collection and Research  With many variable situations often handled on a case by case basis  proper record keeping is difficult and often neglected  Problems exist related to data collection and many recommendations were received emphasizing the need for improved reporting requirements  Currently  comprehensive national guardianship statistics do not exist  Improved Procedures and Oversight  There is a suggested need for improved regulation of private and professional guardianship entities  Areas of work include examining the possible channels of increased oversight of for profit guardianship entities  and the possibility of increased standards for for profit guardianship companies and individuals  Other suggestions include mediation during disputes between family members  improved court monitoring practices and limits on powers of emergency guardians   Rights and Safety of the Elderly Guaranteeing the safety and due process rights of incapacitated seniors under guardianship should be our greatest concern  Possible areas for improvement include ensuring the right to counsel  independent medical and physical examinations  and the right to petition the court for guardianship termination   A full copy of the report is available at  or by calling 202 228 5862
