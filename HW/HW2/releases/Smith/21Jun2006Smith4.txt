     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Phone             Smith Honors Pfc  Tucker on Senate Floor 63 Oregonians and 2 808 Americans Have Died For Freedoms Sake                                   June 21st  2006   WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senator Gordon H  Smith  R OR  made the following speech today from the floor of the U S  Senate honoring Pfc  Thomas Tucker who was recently killed in Iraq    Mr  Smith  Mr  President  since the conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq  2 808 American men and women have paid the ultimate sacrifice  Of that number  63 are Oregonians or have Oregon ties  They are 63 patriots among that total  I rise today to honor  but also feel compelled to come here this afternoon to pay particular honor to Tom Tucker  who recently lost his life and to do what I can through my words to assuage in some possible way  if possible  the grief of his parents  Wes and Meg Tucker of Madras  Oregon    Mr  President  Army Private Thomas Tucker was born in Prineville  Oregon  in Central Oregon  in the beautiful rim rock country of that part of our state  He grew up in Madras and graduated from Madras high school in 1999  He worked in a variety of jobs before feeling the call to serve his country and he enlisted in the United States Army in July of 2005  He was attached to the first battalion of the 502nd infantry regiment of the 2nd brigade  101st airborne division  He s been in Iraq since February of 2006    When word came through that he had been taken hostage by al Qaeda fighters in Iraq  I called his father  Wes  And I wasn t very far into the conversation when it was clear to me that I was talking to a dad who was also a patriot  was proud of his son  and fearful for the consequences that might befall him  The worst of all news came out when the whole country  and particularly my state  learned not only that Thomas had given his life but that he had been tortured  that his body had been defiled and that it had been booby trapped to take the lives of other American soldiers  I have no words sufficient to tell the Tucker family how truly sorry I am for the extent of their loss  And yet I stand in awe and amazement that this morning on the NBC Today program there came Wes Tucker s face and he said  our son  as far as we re concerned  he has died for the freedom of everyone in the United States  I could not agree with him more    Wes and Meg tucker are made of sterner stuff  They didn t blame the president  They didn t blame the military  They simply acknowledged that their son was in the service of his country  knowing the risks and willing to sacrifice it all  I salute them and I will never forget them or their son  And I am told by news accounts that Madras  Oregon  a town of 6 000 people  has now become a family of 6 000 people  Gathering around the Tucker family to offer the consolation that they can and the support that is required  to let the Tucker family know that their son is an American hero now and forever    Mr  President  many wonder  well  what did Tom die for  I believe  as his father  that he died for his country that he died for freedom s sake  And the cause of freedom is one that comes with a very high price  It has hit home with a very high price  It has hit home hard in Oregon today  Al Qaeda is a serpent with many heads  It found Tom and in finding him revealed the ugliness  the barbarity  the brutality of the enemy that we face  Understand al Qaedas words in this war  their purposes  their intentions  their objectives are to create    these are not George Bush s words  these are their words    a new caliphate in the Middle East such as existed for several centuries  ranging from Spain as far as Pakistan  To establish Sharia law  You want to know what Sharia law is  Look at the governance of the Taliban and the brutality that attended their government  It is for the extermination of the state of Israel and it is  fourth  for the holding hostage of western civilization  I believe Tom Tucker died in opposition to these hideous aims of our enemy on earth today  Anyone who believes that America does not have a stake in this is deeply mistaken themselves    My first term in the U S  senate I served on the Foreign Relations committee  I wasn t on that committee long until I was simply amazed and overwhelmed in terms of my schedule by the number of foreign leaders who sought out an audience in my office seeking trade  aid  and military alliance with the United States  And I used to wonder  why do they come to us  why must we solve their problems  And it was evident because they knew America had values for which it was willing to pay a high price  And so I have to say  why us  And history s answer is  why not us  In the 20th century  the United States of America and a number of our stalwart friends    the British coming quickly to mind   have filled the void to stop tyranny when our defense first  our interests  our values and our allies require our help  It is no different now in the 21st century    We all want our kids to come home  I pray for that daily and I am thankful that their numbers are declining and that they are coming home  What this debate is about and the difference we share with our friends on the other side of the aisle is simply the wisdom of announcing a date for withdrawal  As I have studied history  I have never found an instance whereby victory is won by announcing retreat  Wisdom counsels  I believe  that we hold our cards closer to our vest  Al Qaeda is counting on us to go home  just as they cite in their web sites our retreat from Beirut  our inaction in the face of enumerable  outrageous terrorist attacks during the 1990 s  and they took it all for weakness  I want our kids to come home but I want us to see the ugly face of al Qaeda and understand the deadliness and earnestness of their purposes    and how antithetical they are to the future of this nation and the future of our children and the civilization that we enjoy in such abundance in this blessed land  Al Qaeda is counting on us to set a date  It is for that reason I will vote against any amendment that sets a date  I want to express to my colleagues on the other side  the rhetoric on this is too heated  When I hear things like Bush lied  kids died or even on our side that retreat and    whatever the mantra is    my soul cries out for something more dignified  I don t believe their dissent is unpatriotic  I simply believe it to be unwise  It is a tactical mistake of monumental proportions  I don t know how long the war on terror will go but I do know that we have an interest in it  We learned that interest on 9 11  We learned that death    that interest with the death of every soldier    Mr  President  I yield the floor with a plea that we keep our tactics to ourselves and that we understand that America will not be defeated  but we can defeat ourselves  I urge opposition to the Levin amendment                                                                                                                 current Press Release
