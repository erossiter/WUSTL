                         Contact  Gordon Smith Press OfficePhone  202 224 3753           Senators Send Letter Requesting Meeting on LIHEAP Funding          December 11th  2007   Washington  D C    Citing the high cost of home heating oil  U S  Senators Olympia J  Snowe  Norm Coleman  Susan Collins  Judd Gregg  Gordon Smith  John Sununu and Ted Stevens today requested the Director of the U S  Office of Management and Budget regarding the funding for LIHEAP in Fiscal Year 2008  In light of the significant rise in energy prices  the letter urges the Administration to reevaluate its spending priorities with regard to LIHEAP    With thousands of Mainers struggling to provide basic heating for their families  we must work together to ensure that indispensable assistance is provided as we head into the heart of winter  Senator Snowe said  I remain committed to providing additional resources for the Maine LIHEAP program and I am working with my colleagues  the Administration  and Congressional Leadership to ensure its inclusion in any final federal budget   As winter takes hold of Minnesota  many low income families rely on the LIHEAP program to keep the heat on  said Senator Coleman  With heating oil and natural gas prices going through the roof this winter  I urge the Administration to consider additional LIHEAP assistance so that no family should ever have to make the impossible decision between basic necessities and heat    So many families in my home state of Maine are already struggling to heat their homes  and the official start of winter is still weeks away  said Senator Collins  It is estimated that heating oil costs will rise by an onerous  495 per household this winter  We must work together to help low income families and the elderly meet their energy needs and ensure that they stay safe and warm this winter   Senator Judd Gregg stated  With home heating costs at a record high  LIHEAP is an important program which provides federal heating assistance to those in need  Congress must act responsibly and take action so that low income families and seniors can afford to heat their homes this winter  I look forward to working with the Administration and my colleagues in Congress to review our spending priorities and find fiscally responsibly ways to increase LIHEAP funding  Congress must not only help those in need stay warm this winter  but also pay for such assistance without saddling future generations with the bill and leaving them out in the cold   With winter upon us  we must help Oregonians keep their families warm  Senator Smith said  Rising heating costs are a burden on any family budget  especially for those whoare already struggling to make ends meet  Financial assistance helps keep the heat on when costs spike during the colder months    Senator Sununu  who has supported LIHEAP since he was first elected to Congress in 1996  said Higher energy prices and freezing temperatures have gripped New Hampshire and other states across the nation  serving as a reminder that those in need deserve access to adequate funding to help them to stay warm this winter  An increase in funding for LIHEAP is a step in that direction and will help ensure all households are prepared to handle the colder weather   As energy costs continue to rise  we must ensure that Alaskans have assistance to pay their heating bills  said Senator Stevens  Families with high energy expenses are forced to make difficult financial choices far too often  Many Alaskans go without necessities  such as medical care and prescriptions  in order to pay their energy bills  By adequately funding LIHEAP  the federal government and the State of Alaska can work together to curb this alarming trend    A copy of the letter follows    December 10th  2007  The Honorable Jim Nussle  Director  Office of Management and Budget  Old Executive Office Building  Washington  DC 20503  Dear Director Nussle   We want to again  sincerely thank you for your release of  131 million in Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  emergency funds on September 26th of this year  The release of funds allowed Americans to purchase heating oil prior to the recent acute rise in prices  and thus stretching the effectiveness of federal dollars    On December 5th  the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries  OPEC  announced that the supply of crude oil will remain at current levels through January  2008  effectively ensuring that prices will remain near historic levels during the peak winter demand season  For the low income families and the elderly on fixed incomes  these prices are simply untenable    With the Continuing Resolution  P L  110 116  set to expire on December 14th  Congress and the Administration are discussing financial priorities for the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 budget  Accordingly  we respectfully request that the Administration support an increase in funding for the LIHEAP program  We recognize that on February 5th  2007  the President proposed  1 782 billion for the LIHEAP program within budget for FY08  Since that time  crude oil prices have risen from  58 per barrel to  88 per barrel  As a result  we believe that it is prudent to reevaluate budget priorities with regard to the LIHEAP program  To that end  we hereby request a meeting to discuss this timely matter  Your staff may contact Patrick Woodcock in Senator Snowes office at  202  224 4227 or Tony Eberhard in Senator Colemans office at  202  224 5641 regarding the logistics of the meeting    Thank you for your consideration    Sincerely   OLYMPIA J  SNOWE NORM COLEMAN   United States Senator United States Senator                                                                                                                                                         current Press Release
