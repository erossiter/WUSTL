     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Phone             Senator Smith Discusses Iraq on Senate Floor                December 7th  2006   WASHINGTON  DC   Mr  SMITH  Mr  President  I know it is probably appropriate to speak of our colleagues  and I will do that on the record  I rise tonight  however  to speak about a subject heavy on my mind  It is the subject of the war in Iraq    I have never worn the uniform of my country  I am not a soldier or a veteran  I regret that fact  It is one of the regrets of my life  But I am a student of history  particularly military history  and it is that perspective which I brought to the Senate 10 years ago as a newly elected Member of this Chamber    When we came to the vote on Iraq  it was an issue of great moment for me  No issue is more difficult to vote on than war and peace  because it involves the lives of our soldiers  our young men and women  It involves the expenditure of our treasure  putting on the line the prestige of our country  It is not a vote taken lightly  I have tried to be a good soldier in this Chamber  I have tried to support our President  believing at the time of the vote on the war in Iraq that we had been given good intelligence and knowing that Saddam Hussein was a menace to the world  a brutal dictator  a tyrant by any standard  and one who threatened our country in many different ways  through the financing and fomenting of terrorism  For those reasons and believing that we would find weapons of mass destruction  I voted aye    I have been rather silent on this question ever since  I have been rather quiet because  when I was visiting Oregon troops in Kirkuk in the Kurdish area  the soldiers said to me  Senator  don t tell me you support the troops and not our mission  That gave me pause  But since that time  there have been 2 899 American casualties  There have been over 22 000 American men and women wounded  There has been an expenditure of  290 billion a figure that approaches the expenditure we have every year on an issue as important as Medicare  We have paid a price in blood and treasure that is beyond calculation by my estimation    Now  as I witness the slow undoing of our efforts there  I rise to speak from my heart  I was greatly disturbed recently to read a comment by a man I admire in history  one Winston Churchill  who after the British mandate extended to the peoples of Iraq for 5 years  wrote to David Lloyd George  Prime Minister of England    At present we are paying 8 millions a year for the privilege of living on an ungrateful volcano    When I read that  I thought  not much has changed  We have to learn the lessons of history and sometimes they are painful because we have made mistakes    Even though I have not worn the uniform of my country  I  with other colleagues here  love this Nation  I came into politics because I believed in some things  I am unusually proud of the fact of our recent history  the history of our Nation since my own birth  At the end of the Second World War  there were 15 nations on earth that could be counted as democracies that you and I would recognize  Today there are 150 nations on earth that are democratic and free  That would not have happened had the United States been insular and returned to our isolationist roots  had we laid down the mantle of world leadership  had we not seen the importance of propounding and encouraging the spread of democracy  the rule of law  human rights  and the values of our Bill of Rights  It is a better world because of the United States of America  and the price we have paid is one of blood and treasure    Now we come to a great crossroads  A commission has just done some  I suppose  good work  I am still evaluating it  I welcome any ideas now because where we are leaves me feeling much like Churchill  that we are paying the price to sit on a mountain that is little more than a volcano of ingratitude    Yet as I feel that  I remember the pride I felt when the statue of Saddam Hussein came down  I remember the thrill I felt when three times Iraqis risked their own lives to vote democratically in a way that was internationally verifiable as well as legitimate and important  Now all of those memories seem much like ashes to me    The Iraq Study Group has given us some ideas  I don t know if they are good or not  It does seem to me that it is a recipe for retreat  It is not cut and run  but it is cut and walk  I don t know that that is any more honorable than cutting and running  because cutting and walking involves greater expenditure of our treasure  greater loss of American lives   Many things have been attributed to George Bush  I have heard him on this floor blamed for every ill  even the weather  But I do not believe him to be a liar  I do not believe him to be a traitor  nor do I believe all the bravado and the statements and the accusations made against him  I believe him to be a very idealistic man  I believe him to have a stubborn backbone  He is not guilty of perfidy  but I do believe he is guilty of believing bad intelligence and giving us the same    I can t tell you how devastated I was to learn that in fact we were not going to find weapons of mass destruction  But remembering the words of the soldier  don t tell me you support the troops but you don t support my mission  I felt the duty to continue my support  Yet I believe the President is guilty of trying to win a short war and not understanding fully the nature of the ancient hatreds of the Middle East  Iraq is a European creation  At the Treaty of Versailles  the victorious powers put together Kurdish  Sunni  and Shia tribes that had been killing each other for time immemorial  I would like to think there is an Iraqi identity  I would like to remember the purple fingers raised high  But we can not want democracy for Iraq more than they want it for themselves  And what I find now is that our tactics there have failed    Again  I am not a soldier  but I do know something about military history  And what that tells me is when you are engaged in a war of insurgency  you can t clear and leave  With few exceptions  throughout Iraq that is what we have done  To fight an insurgency often takes a decade or more  It takes more troops than we have committed  It takes clearing  holding  and building so that the people there see the value of what we are doing  They become the source of intelligence  and they weed out the insurgents  But we have not cleared and held and built  We have cleared and left  and the insurgents have come back    I  for one  am at the end of my rope when it comes to supporting a policy that has our soldiers patrolling the same streets in the same way  being blown up by the same bombs day after day  That is absurd  It may even be criminal  I cannot support that anymore  I believe we need to figure out how to fight the war on terror and to do it right  So either we clear and hold and build  or let s go home    There are no good options  as the Iraq Study Group has mentioned in their report  I am not sure cutting and walking is any better  I have little confidence that the Syrians and the Iranians are going to be serious about helping us to build a stable and democratic Iraq  I am at a crossroads as well  I want my constituents to know what is in my heart  what has guided my votes    What will continue to guide the way I vote is simply this  I do not believe we can retreat from the greater war on terror  Iraq is a battlefield in that larger war  But I do believe we need a presence there on the near horizon at least that allows us to provide intelligence  interdiction  logistics  but mostly a presence to say to the murderers that come across the border  We are here  and we will deal with you  But we have no business being a policeman in someone else s civil war    I welcome the Iraq Study Group s report  but if we are ultimately going to retreat  I would rather do it sooner than later  I am looking for answers  but the current course is unacceptable to this Senator  I suppose if the President is guilty of one other thing  I find it also in the words of Winston Churchill  He said    After the First World War  let us learn our lessons  Never  never believe that any war will be smooth and easy or that anyone who embarks on this strange voyage can measure the tides and the hurricanes  The statesman who yields to war fever must realize that once the signal is given  he is no longer the master of policy but the slave of unforeseeable and uncontrollable events    That is a lesson we are learning again  I am afraid  rather than leveling with the American people and saying this was going to be a decade long conflict because of the angst and hatred that exists in that part of the world  that we tried to win it with too few troops in too fast a time  Lest anyone thinks I believe we have failed militarily  please understand I believe when President Bush stood in front of   mission accomplished   on an aircraft carrier that  in purely military terms  the mission was accomplished in the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq  But winning a battle  winning a war  is different than winning a peace    We were not prepared to win the peace by clearing  holding  and building  You don t do that fast and you don t do it with too few troops  I believe now that we must either determine to do that  or we must redeploy in a way that allows us to continue to prosecute the larger war on terror  It will not be pretty  We will pay a price in world opinion  But I  for one  am tired of paying the price of 10 or more of our troops dying a day  So let s cut and run  or cut and walk  or let us fight the war on terror more intelligently than we have  because we have fought this war in a very lamentable way    Those are my feelings  I regret them  I would have never voted for this conflict had I reason to believe that the intelligence we had was not accurate  It was not accurate  but that is history  Now we must find a way to make the best of a terrible situation  at a minimum of loss of life for our brave fighting men and women  So I will be looking for every opportunity to clear  build  hold  and win or how to bring our troops home    I yield the floor                                                                                                           current Press Release
