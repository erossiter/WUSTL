     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                    Aging Committee to Examine Drug Importation Surgeon General Carmona to formally present task force report         January 21st  2005   Washington  DC    Today  Senator Gordon Smith  chairman of the Senate Special Committee on Aging  announced that he has scheduled a committee hearing on Wednesday January 26th with U S  Surgeon General Richard Carmona to examine issues surrounding the American re importation of prescription drugs         There is a definite consensus that steps must be taken to make prescription drugs more affordable for those in need     said Smith     It  s proven difficult  however to create a system where we can safely meet the overwhelming need for affordable prescription drugs while maintaining the incentive to develop life saving drugs       Surgeon General Carmona will formally present the findings of an HHS task force that was charged with evaluating American prescription drug importation as a means of lowering consumer costs   Current law provides that individuals may import prescription drugs from other countries only when and if the U S  Secretary of Health Human Services  HHS  certifies that such imports are safe   No HHS Secretary in the Bush or Clinton Administrations has made such a determination       This Committee has a unique ability to shed light on some of the toughest issues facing our seniors   community  and it is no coincidence that we  ve chosen to focus on the affordability of prescription drugs as the first item of business     said Smith     I  ll be very interested in the discussion of the task force  s assessment  but increased affordability through re importation is something that needs to be thoroughly considered      While chairing the Special Committee on Aging  Smith plans to pursue an aggressive agenda focused on providing seniors safe  affordable prescription drugs                                                                                                                                     current Press Release
