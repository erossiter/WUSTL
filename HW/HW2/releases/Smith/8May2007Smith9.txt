     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                         Contact  Kimberly CollinsPhone  202 224 5364           Smith and Kerry Work to Secure Mental Health Parity for Children          May 8th  2007   Washington  DC   Senators Gordon H  Smith  R OR  and John Kerry  D MA  introduced legislation today aimed at achieving mental health parity for children enrolled in the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  SCHIP   which provides health care coverage to low income children  The measure  the Childrens Mental Health Parity Act  is co sponsored by Senators Pete Domenici  R NM  and Edward Kennedy  D MA     With millions of Americans living with a mental illness  it is astounding that our health care system continues to treat mental health care as a subordinate category of medicine  said Senator Smith  It is time for Congress to require that states step up their efforts by working to identify and treat those in need rather than limiting their access to care  We need mental health parity on all levels  but certainly the government should be setting the standard in federal programs such as SCHIP   America s kids who are covered through SCHIP should be guaranteed that the mental health benefits they receive are just as comprehensive as those for medical and surgical care  Senator Kerry said  As Congress works this year to see that the State Children s Health Insurance Program fulfills its promise to America s low income children  we must ensure that the mental health benefits for our children on the program give them the type of coverage they need  It s no less important to care for our kids  mental health  and this unfair and unwise disparity should no longer be acceptable   According to the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS   mental health problems affect one in every five young people at any given time  HHS also estimates that two thirds of all young people with mental health problems are not getting the help they need  Moreover  a report published by the Urban Institute entitled  Access to Children s Mental Health Services under Medicaid and SCHIP notes that the highest prevalence of mental health problems among all children age 6 17 is observed among Medicaid SCHIP children  at a rate significantly higher than for other insured children or uninsured children   The Childrens Mental Health Parity Act would prohibit discriminatory limits on mental health care in SCHIP plans by directing that any financial requirements or treatment limitations that apply to mental health or substance abuse services must be no more restrictive than the financial requirements or treatment limits that apply to other medical services  The bill also would eliminate a harmful provision in current law that authorizes states to lower the amount of mental health coverage they provide to children in SCHIP down to 75 percent of allowable benchmark plans                                                                                                                                                                       current Press Release
