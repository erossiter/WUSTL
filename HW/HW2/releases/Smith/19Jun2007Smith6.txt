     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                    Smith Fights To Help Iragi Refugee Crisis          June 19th  2007   Washington  DC   Because of the war in Iraq  more than two million Iraqis have been internally displaced in their own country  and two million other Iraqis are in neighboring countries throughout the region  primarily Jordan and Syria  The United States has allowed less than 500 Iraqi refugees into the country since the conflict began  only 63 have been admitted this year  The Judiciary Committee highlighted the urgency of this issue in January  Assistant Secretary Sauerbrey has said the U S  Will accept 25 000 Iraqi refugees this year  but our current system of refugee processing is not working well enough or fast enough   Today  on the eve of World Refugee Day  Senators Kennedy  Smith  Biden  Hagel  Leahy  Levin and Lieberman  introduced a plan to develop a comprehensive and effective approach to meet the rapidly growing needs of Iraqs refugees and internationally displaced persons  especially those who are associated with the United States  The bill would create a special category of applicants for refugee status for those who have helped the United States and expand the current special immigrant program for translators and interpreters to include others who have supported the American effort in Iraq  The bill would also allow Iraqis denied asylum after March 2003 based on changed conditions to file a new petition with an immigration judge to reopen their cases      America has a special obligation to keep faith with the Iraqis who now have a bulls eye on their back because of their association with our government  Senator Kennedy said  At our hearing in January  chilling testimony was presented about the dangers Iraqis face because of their association with America  Clearly  we cannot resettle all of Iraqs refugees in the United States  but we have a fundamental responsibility to help the vast number of Iraqis displaced in Iraq and throughout the region by the war and the associated chaos  especially those who have supported Americas efforts in Iraq    America has a fundamental responsibility to aid the courageous Iraqis who risked their lives to help our efforts in Iraq  Senator Smith said  It is only right that we work to find a way to meet the needs of the countless individuals whose assistance to our nation has left them in great peril within their own country  This legislation is a step in that direction   The Iraqi refugee situation is dire  and we owe it to our Iraqi friends  many of whom have risked their lives to help us  to help them  said Senator Joe Biden  Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee  This legislation does just that  but the only long term solution to Iraqs refugee problem will occur when people feel safe enough to return to their homes  That requires a comprehensive and sustainable political settlement in Iraq  I urge the Bush Administration to lead a concerted international effort to produce such a settlement based on Iraq s communities exercising control over the fabric of their daily lives at the local level  The longer the Bush Administration waits to lead such an effort  the worse the refugee crisis will become   America has always led the world in helping refugees find a new life  Our legislation will help the Administration resettle thousands of Iraqis who are the most in need  and have risked their lives to help the United States  Hagel said  We have a responsibility to help Iraqi refugees who have put their lives in danger helping the United States  said Levin  I am hopeful that this comprehensive reform plan will help to ensure that they are not punished for the bureaucratic backlogs of our immigration judicial system      I am pleased to join this effort to provide some hope to those who have risked their lives assisting the United States in Iraq  Senator Leahy said  Showing loyalty to those who have been loyal to us is the honorable thing to do  and its the right thing to do   The United States has a profound moral responsibility not to abandon the people of Iraq  Senator Lieberman said  Just as our brave soldiers are fighting in Baghdad today to ensure that all Iraqis have a country safe from terrorist barbarism  the rest of our government must mobilize to help the Iraqis who have been displaced by the violence   The Democrats sponsoring this bill are chairs of the Foreign Relations  Armed Services  Judiciary  and Homeland Security  Senator Kennedy is the Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration  Border Security and Refugees
