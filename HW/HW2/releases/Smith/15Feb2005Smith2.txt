     United States Senator   Gordon Smith                                                                                                                                                                                                    Lawmakers Introduce Retirement Security for Life Act Legislation Aims to Give Retirees a Guaranteed  Paycheck for Life          February 15th  2005   Washington  DC     A bipartisan group of House and Senate lawmakers introduced legislation today that is designed to help Americans secure their retirement with a guaranteed  paycheck for life  through investment in life annuities   Sponsors of the bill include Senators Gordon Smith  R OR  and Kent Conrad  D ND  and U S  Representatives Nancy Johnson  R CT  and John Tanner  D TN      The Retirement Security for Life Act provides a tax incentive  available to all retirees  that encourages an investment in life annuities  The bill would waive federal taxes on half of the income generated by the annuity  up to a maximum of  20 000 annually   For the typical retiree  it would provide a tax break of up to  5 000  The bill is designed to help Americans who have savings maintain their pre retirement standard of living     The sponsors of the Act said that there is a great need to provide retirees the tools necessary to manage their assets in retirement  Annuities  which guarantee a monthly payment for the life of the investor  are one such tool       We  re going to have big challenges in the coming years as more Americans retire     said Smith     We need to be looking at ways to help people plan for their futures   Providing tax incentives for annuities is one of the easiest and most effective things we can do          One of the biggest challenges facing aging Americans is how to manage their savings to ensure a secure  stable retirement  Unprecedented numbers of Americans now live into their 90s     said Senator Kent Conrad  D ND     In my home state of North Dakota there is an acute need for retirement vehicles that will provide a secure retirement  We have many farmers  for example  that need to make the proceeds from the sale of their farm last the rest of their lives         America s retirees deserve the security and peace of mind of knowing that they will not outlive their savings   said U S  Rep  Nancy Johnson  the bill s lead House sponsor   We must give Americans the tools to secure a stream of income during their retirement and maintain their quality of life  This bipartisan legislation will give Americans greater incentive to secure for themselves and their family a  paycheck for life       Research indicates that many future retirees  including an estimated 77 million Baby Boomers  will have difficulty maintaining an adequate standard of living   By providing incentives  the Retirement Security for Life Act will encourage Americans to invest in their own retirement  The income from a life annuity would guarantee income throughout retirement as a complement to Social Security and pension benefits       This is a basic   kitchen table   issue     said David Senter  legislative director for the American Corn Growers Association    Social Security covers less and less of people  s income needs in retirement  On top of that  thousands of American farmers and their families don  t participate in pension plans or have other means of guaranteeing retirement income  As a result  it is critical that Congress help arm Americans with the tools they need to better manage their individual retirement savings      A life annuity provides beneficiaries with life long monthly payments in exchange for a single premium   Under the legislation  after tax income or the proceeds from the sale of a house or small business can be used to purchase the annuity  Income from employer sponsored plans like IRAs or 401 k s cannot be used      We need to help Americans not only plan for financial security but also help people manage their savings for a lifetime   said U S  Rep  John Tanner  D TN    That peace of mind can help families look forward to comfortable quality of life throughout their retirement years                                                                                   current Press Release
