       Senator Smith speaks from the Mansfield Room in the U S  Capitol shortly after introducing the Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Prevention Act of 2007   Senator Ted Kennedy looks on       September 26th  2007   Washington  DC   Oregon Senator Gordon H  Smith made the following remarks today on the floor of the U S  Senate in support of The Matthew Shepard Hate Crimes Act  legislation that will protect all Americans against violence motivated by hate   Mr  Smith  I rise today to once again discuss the need to enact hate crimes legislation  For the fifth consecutive Congress  I have introduced the legislation with my colleague from Massachusetts  Senator Kennedy  The Senate knows well the substance of what we ve debated  We ve done it in every Congress of my tenure  The majority of Senators have repeatedly supported this legislation  Just two years ago  under a Republican controlled Senate  we overwhelmingly passed hate crimes legislation on the National Defense Authorization Act by a vote of 65 33  In 2000  the Senate voted 57 42 in favor of the bill  In 2002  we had 54 votes   Hate crimes legislation  Mr  President  in my view  is the most important civil rights issue before this Congress  The House has already passed this legislation  They ve done so  and we will do so  I hope  because America needs it  America is one of the most diverse societies on the planet  and I can think of no other country in world history that has achieved the same degree of diversity as the United States of America  Diversity is part of our Nation s heritage  It is part of our political and social fabric  It is a source of our strength and it should be protected from those that try to systematically victimize whole classes of individuals based on their beliefs  their practices or their race    The bedrock of our Civil Rights laws is founded on the collective belief that minorities should be protected from discrimination  But the Civil Rights struggle is far from over  Every election brings a new chapter in our efforts to make it better  As we fight the war on terrorism abroad  we must not forget that we continue to have injustices here on our home shores  Americans continue to be harassed  victimized and denied equal opportunities simply because of their race  religion  color  disabilities or sexual orientation  As a nation that serves as a beacon of freedom and liberty throughout the world  we simply cannot tolerate violence against our own citizens simply because of their differences  We cannot fight terror abroad and accept terror at home    For the last seven years I have entered a hate crime almost every day into the Senate Record  I ve entered hundreds upon hundreds of individual hate crimes into this record to demonstrate the need for this legislation  Many of these crimes are extremely brutal  Some even result in the death of the victim  I do this to raise awareness  I do it to demonstrate the severity of these attacks and to show the frequency of these violent crimes  I also do it to remember these often nameless victims and to give a human face to these senseless acts of violence    And let me tell you for a moment about the horror of the attacks  Opponents of this measure will say that every crime should be treated equally  But those that perpetrate crimes out of bias against sexual orientation are unusually and especially savage  You rarely  if ever  read about a hate crime resulting from a single bullet or errant punch  Hate crime victims will be beaten dozens of times with an iron crowbar  They ll be stabbed over and over or they ll be stomped to death  These prolonged vicious beatings are more akin to punishment and torture and manifest themselves in ways that are most evil    This year Senator Kennedy and I have decided to rename our legislation The Matthew Shepard Act  We do so with the permission of his mother  We do so to put a human face on this issue of hate crimes legislation  In addition  we did it in remembrance of a young hate crime victim that has left an indelible mark upon our nation s conscience  His name is Matthew Shepard  Judy Shepard  Matthews mother  is a dear friend of mine  Judy experienced a parent s single worst tragedy  the loss of her child  But instead of retreating into her own pain for solace  Judy has brought to national attention the need for hate crimes legislation  She is our nation s strongest advocate for this issue    For those of you who do not know Matthew Shepards story  it is truly heartbreaking  Matthew was a 21 year old college student at the University of Wyoming when he was attacked  Shortly after midnight  on October 7  1998  Matthew was kidnapped  beaten  pistol whipped  lashed to a lonely stretch of fence and left to die alone  Almost 18 hours later  Matthew was found alive but unconscious  His injuries were deemed too severe for surgery and Matthew died October 12    He was murdered by two men simply for who he was  because he was gay  To think that such virulent hatred of another person s sexual orientation drove another to commit such a heinous act is truly unthinkable  Sadly  this case is not isolated    You may ask why Senator Kennedy and I have offered this legislation again on the Defense Authorization Bill  As I have said in the past  the military is not immune to the scourge of hate crimes in our country    In 1992  Navy Seaman Allen Schindler was brutally murdered by his shipmate Terry Helvey in Okinawa  Japan  Schindler was beaten and stomped to death simply because he was gay  His attack was so vicious that I his own mother could not identify him but for the remains of a tattoo on his arm    In other tragic cases  PFC Barry Winchell was beaten by another Army private with a baseball bat  He was beaten with such force and his injuries were so severe that he died shortly thereafter  He was only 21  the same age as Matthew Shepard    To those who say that we don t need a federal hate crimes bill  I say they are wrong  This is a national problem that deserves national attention  Our hate crimes legislation would strengthen the ability of the federal  state  and local governments to investigate and prosecute hate crimes based on race  ethnic background  religion  gender  sexual orientation  disability  and gender identity  Furthermore  it would strengthen state and local efforts by enabling justice to assist them in the investigation and prosecution of hate crimes and assist in funding of these prosecutions    The legislation would also allow the federal government to step in  if needed  but only after the department has certified that a federal prosecution is necessary  If this can be done locally or at the state level  it should be  but hate crimes should be prosecuted  Current law does not provide any authority for federal involvement in these types of hate crimes  even when state or local law enforcement is inadequate because relevant law is nonexistent or resources are insufficient  Without this legislation  the tools for battling hate crimes at the federal level will remain limited    I have also heard it argued that we shouldn t punish a hate crime and differently than any other crime  I believe that is flat wrong  Hate crimes tear at the very fabric of our nation  They seek to intimidate entire groups of Americans  And as such  divide our people  Hate crimes do more than just harm one victim  They terrorize an entire society  They send an ominous message of hate and intolerance to all Americans  Those crimes must be punished proportionately    As to the constitutionality of hate crime statutes  that is questioned by some  It shouldn t be  The Supreme Court has already responded to their legitimacy  Motive has always been a factor in determining whether a crime has  in fact  occurred  Mr  President  when you and I went to law school  took a class in crime  one of the first things you have to do to establish the commission of a crime is intent and motive  Speech is one of those legitimate areas of inquiry    This was made very clear by chief Justice William Rehnquist    not exactly a liberal  Mr  President    who wrote the majority opinion in Wisconsin v  Mitchell  a unanimously    and they unanimously upheld the constitutionality of a Wisconsin hate crime statute which provided for an enhanced sentence where the defendant is intentionally selected because of his race  his religion  color  disability  sexual orientation  national or origin of ancestry  These things do not violate the First Amendment  the Court found  Wrote Rehnquist in Mitchell  The first amendment does not prohibit the evidentiary of speech to establish evidence of a crime or to prove motive or intent  In fact  you can t have a crime unless you prove motive or intent and speech is one of the legitimate areas of inquiry    Lastly  Mr  President  I have heard concerns from my religious brothers and sisters that fear that the passage of hate crimes legislation will have a chilling effect on our nation s churches and pulpits  This is unfounded  I find it disconcerting that many ministers of religion  for whom I have the utmost respect  would preach such messages from the radio  from television and from sacred church pulpits    A hate crime does not criminalize thoughts  moral views or religious beliefs  What it does say is that we cannot go out and do violence to our fellow Americans simply because we find in another s mere existence offends our beliefs  You have to act  Mr  President  Thought and speech are insufficient to prove a hate crime  And it is disingenuous and fallacious to say otherwise    I accuse no one  but what I find as great comfort  in a story from the New Testament  and  Mr  President  I would say as an aside  if I believed what they charge  I would not be here in support of this amendment in Congress after congress  But I do know the law  and I do know what is being said about this amendment is simply wrong  What I find very comforting on this issue    and I think it is applicable    is a story from the Book of John  And Ill share It with you  Mr  President  because I think it teaches us all how we should behave towards one another  sinners all  in the public square    It reads as follows  from Chapter 8  And early in the morning  he came again into the Temple and all the people came unto him and he sat down and taught them  and the scribes and Pharisees had taken a woman in adultery and they said in his midst  master  this woman was taken in adultery  in the very act  Now Moses in the law commanded that such should be stoned  But what sayest thou  This they said tempting him  that they might have to accuse Him  but Jesus stooped down and with his finger wrote on the ground as though he heard them not  So when they continued asking him  he lifted himself and said unto them  he that is without sin among you  let him first cast a stone at her  And again he stooped down and wrote on the ground  and they which heard it being convicted by their own conscience  went out one by one  beginning at the eldest  even unto the last  And Jesus was left alone  and the woman standing in the midst  And Jesus had lifted himself up and saw none but the woman  He said unto her  Woman  where are thine accusers  Hath no man condemned they  she said  No man  Lord  And Jesus said unto her  neither do I condemn thee  Go and sin no more  that occurred in the public square  Mr  President    Jesus risked his life to save her life  He didn t excuse it  but nor did he condemn her  He saved her life and risked his own  I don t believe federal law should do any less than that  and I believe it is high time for us to do what many states  most of the states in America have done  and that is add the category of sexual orientation to our federal statutes  No church  no preacher  no adherent of religious faith need fear this  But they ought to follow that  And understand that what were not trying to do here is to somehow inhibit the free exercise of religion  We re trying to protect people  American people from the most brutal kinds of terrorist acts on our own shores    Finally  Mr  President  there s a memorial in Casper  Wyoming  sculpted by Chris Navarro  dedicated to the memory of Matthew Shepard  It is named the Ring of Peace  The circular design of the ring symbolizes both the individual and the ideals of social unity  The bell  supported by a ring  stands for liberty and the ring for the promise of tomorrow  White doves flying out of the bell are a symbol of peace  They re flying as a unified group and their wings symbolize hope and freedom  At the base of the sculpture  there is a simple poem that reads  If you believe in hope and the need for peace  step up and ring the bell  for it will sing for a promise tomorrow    With that  Mr  President  I urge my colleagues  as many have done so in the past  to vote in favor of this amendment  We cannot be complacent or tolerate such acts of hatred  We all need to step up and vote for legislation that promises all Americans a better tomorrow  I yield the floor                                                                                             current Press Release
