Smith advocated for Senate action on his legislation to bring more displaced Iraqis to the United States at a recent press conference    September 19th  2007   Washington  DC   Good afternoon  ladies and gentlemen  Thank you for inviting me to this meeting of the U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  Im honored to testify before you today on the plight of refugees in Iraq   Since the invasion of Iraq in March 2003  violence has grown to an appalling level  The looting of Baghdad immediately after its liberation was a harbinger of the lawlessness which today grips much of the country   In spite of this chaos  our men and women in uniform have done a superb job in Iraq  They have suffered many casualties  and have born their burden with admirable courage   But if Americans have suffered  Iraqis have also had their share of tragedy  Iraqi civilians have born the brunt of incredibly brutal violence  Al Qaeda in Iraq has committed a pantheon of atrocities  from murdering children to the recent atrocity against the Yazidi community   In addition to Al Qaeda  faceless sectarian death squads hunt the country  Americans may have grown numb to the daily reports of bodies dumped by the side of the road  or in rivers  or in alleys  but Iraqis havent  For them  the nightmare is reality   To escape this violence  millions of Iraqis have left their homes  The UN estimates that more than two million Iraqis have fled the country  and 2 2 million are internally displaced  Over half of those two and a quarter million have recently left since the Samarra mosque bombing in February 2006   These refugees come from all walks of life  but especially from Iraqs most vulnerable groups  Human rights organizations estimate that Christians  who constitute less than 3 percent of Iraqs population  make up at least 20 percent of the refugees  Sabaeans  a tiny sect within Iraq  make up 5 percent of refugees  These minorities are often targeted by Islamic extremists for murder  rape  or forced conversion  Unsurprisingly  many choose to leave   The refugees do not only come from minority populations  Estimates indicate about 45 percent are Sunni  and 25 percent are Shia  Iraqis of every stripe are fearful for their lives  Tragically  the UN states that two to two and a half hundred thousand of these Iraqis are school age children   These children and their families have left home for different reasons  but their reasons have a common thread  In a survey by the United Nations  sixty three percent of Iraqis said they had left their neighborhoods because of direct threats to their lives  Twenty five percent left because they had been forcibly removed from their homes  These threats are often based on religion   Sectarian violence is today the leading cause of refugee displacement  The effect has been to segregate Shia Iraqis and Sunni Iraqis  both nationally and locally  In Baghdad  some Sunni neighborhoods are walled off to protect them from the attacks of their countrymen  In the south of Iraq  threats from Shia militias have forced Sunnis to move to the north and west  The Shias from these areas have likewise fled Sunni death squads and Al Qaeda   In a front page article this past Monday  The New York Times described how the sectarian violence and ever present fear of death have fundamentally changed Iraqis and their society  Mixed marriages have become rare  Many Iraqis leave  and those who stay behind in a mixed neighborhood live constantly on the edge of a knife    Hatreds lasting a thousand years are difficult to reconcile  Our country  which is a mere 231 years old  has difficulty enough with our old disagreements  We have solved some and continue to wrestle with others   Nobody  however  has helped us reconcile these conflicts  Americans resolve American problems  and today  Iraqis need to resolve Iraqi problems  US soldiers cannot solve sectarian hatreds   By some reports  our current strategy  the troop surge  is making things worse  The Iraqi Red Crescent estimates that as many as 100 000 Iraqis have been leaving their homes since February  at the beginning of the surge  This is not the fault of our soldiers  but rather a natural fear of more violence   Nevertheless  it seems like folly to me to use American troops to police Sunni and Shia Iraqis who hate each other  The refugees we see today  in a large part  are due to the Iraqis inability to resolve this hatred  The mission US troops are on today seems misguided  We certainly need to fight al Qaeda and train the Iraqi army  We do not need to be trying to force a political compromise that isnt there   One of the tasks the United States needs to embrace more fully is the responsibility for the suffering of ordinary Iraqis  While we cannot necessarily treat the disease  we can help treat the symptoms   America owes a debt to those Iraqis who have been affected by the war  We also owe a special debt to those Iraqis who have worked with American forces  To this end  I cosponsored S 1104  a Senate bill to increase the number of Iraqis and Afghans who could be admitted to the United States  That is one step   A bigger step would be moving to alleviate the overall refugee issue  I have been working with Senator Kennedy to pass S 1651  a bill which would enable Iraqi refugees of special attention  like religious minorities  to be admitted to the United States  It would increase the visas we make available to Iraqis  as well as allow refugees to be directly processed in Iraq   In a diplomatic cable dated September 7th  U S  Ambassador to Iraq Ryan Crocker complained to the State Department about bottlenecks in the refugee process  Among other problems  the ambassador noted that refugees often faced up to a two year delay to enter the US  an unnecessarily long wait  He urged action  I heartily agree    I know better than many Americans how difficult it is for religious minorities to thrive in this world  It is difficult in the United States  It is far harder in the Middle East  The condition of these minorities in Iraq is thus of special interest to me  If we owe a debt to Iraqis  I hope that this legislation plays a small part in repaying that debt   Though America may bear overall responsibility  these refugees are not only a concern of the United States  Other countries  willing or not  are involved as well  Iraqs neighbors have perhaps the most pressing concerns about the refugee issues  because these nations often wind paying the bill  Jordan  Syria  Lebanon  and Egypt have so far borne the brunt of the refugee crisis   Jordan  which has a population of 6 1 million  hosts up to 750 000 Iraqi refugees  Lebanon  with a population of 3 9 million  hosts between 40 000 and 200 000 Iraqis  Syria  with a population of 19 3 million  supports an estimated 1 2 million refugees  Egypt carries a lesser but still significant burden   Each of these countries faces significant structural pressures as a result of their decision to support these Iraqis  Jordan  for example  has an estimated 1 8 million Palestinian refugees in addition to the Iraqis  Jordan thus now has the largest refugee per capita ratio on earth   Because of Ammans delicate political situation we must make every effort to ensure that the financial and social strain does not stress Jordanian society  and make similar efforts with the other states   The final status of externally displaced Iraqis must also be resolved within a reasonable time frame  These refugees suffering must not be prolonged as a political weapon by their host countries with which to attack enemies  America has a national moral commitment to resolving the Iraqi refugee issue as quickly as possible   Unfortunately  unconscionable delays have often prevented Iraqis from reaching safety   The current refugee process requires potential refugees to leave Iraq before registering with United Nations refugee authorities  This journey is long  and especially hazardous   Once Iraqis reach these authorities in Jordan  Syria  and elsewhere  a fresh purgatory awaits them  They must wait up to 6 8 months to be registered as refugees  and another 6 8 months to be designated as ready for resettlement  They are afterwards referred to the US and other final destination nations  These countries then have their own refugee processing systems  with their own delays   Meanwhile  Iraqis usually lack access to basic social services  Given the large amount of children  the lack takes on an extra urgency  The NGO Human Rights First noted that Americas funding for grossly inadequate  The United States gave  10 million to Jordan in the War on Terror Supplemental for Fiscal Year 2008   In comparison  the United States gave Jordan  700 million in 2003 to offset the cost of the Iraq war  The United States is also spending  9 billion per month overall on the Iraq war overall   Surely there is some additional funding available for the men  women  and children who are most affected by the violence in Iraq  It is Americas moral duty   We still have many questions to answer about solutions to the refugee crisis  Should we give economic aid to all countries which harbor refugees  such as Syria  or condition that aid on the treatment Iraqis receive  How can we expedite the relocation of Iraqi refugees  How can we prevent so many Iraqis from having to travel to other countries before they reach sanctuary in the United States and elsewhere  Should we focus our effort within international organizations  such as the UN High Commissioner for Refugees and UNICEF  or should we repay our debt bilaterally   America historically has an honorable record in alleviating the plight of refugees from its wars  After the collapse of South Vietnam  for example  the United States absorbed an estimated 135 000 South Vietnamese refugees  In comparison  between 2003 and mid 2007  fewer than 800 Iraqis were admitted to the United States  Whether our effort is by ourselves  with allies  or with international organizations  more clearly needs to be done   The plight of religious minorities is nowhere easy  It is most difficult in a war zone  in a region where they are already persecuted  The situation in Iraqis thus a humanitarian hazard of the first concern  particularly for those who bear overall responsibility   Thank you for your time today  It has been an honor to testify before you
