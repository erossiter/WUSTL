SEN. WYDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) released the following statement this evening following the President's nomination of U.S. Circuit Judge John Roberts, Jr. to be an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "The only appropriate way to proceed is on the merits of Judge Roberts' record and judicial temperament - and any pronouncements tonight would be prejudgments. I look forward to learning about Judge Roberts as the Judiciary Committee conducts a thorough and careful evaluation in the coming weeks. I hope his confirmation process will be marked by a true sense of bipartisanship and cooperation."
