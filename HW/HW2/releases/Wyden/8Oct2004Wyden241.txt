SENS. WYDEN, SMITH ANNOUNCE GRANT FOR OREGON HEALTH CLINIC
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that La Clinica del Carino Family Health Center will receive a $200,000 federal grant from the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
 The funds are being provided through the HHS Community Program to Improve Minority Health to support outreach services and access for minorities in high-risk, low-income communities.
   "It is critical to support health centers like La Clinica del Carino because they are frequently the only good option for those without health insurance," said Wyden. "Oregonians need quality access to health care and it's good to see federal funds going to provide medical services to children and families who need it."
   "Far too many Oregonians have no health insurance or not enough health insurance," said Smith. "Community health centers like La Clinica del Carino help bridge the health care gap by providing vital, quality health care to those who would otherwise go without care."
   La Clinica del Carino provides women's health care services, obstetrics, health screenings, dental care and health promotion and education.
