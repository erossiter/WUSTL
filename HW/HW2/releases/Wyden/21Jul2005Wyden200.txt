SENS. WYDEN, SMITH WIN FUNDS FOR OREGON MILITARY FACILITIES
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that Oregon could soon receive more than $7 million for military facility construction projects.  
 The funding was included in the FY 2006 Veterans' Administration and Military Construction Appropriations bill approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee. The VA/MilCon Appropriations bill must now be approved by the full Senate.
   "It is important that we recognize Oregon's role in defending our nation," said Wyden. "These funds will help make much-needed improvements to the military facilities throughout our state."
   "The Federal government has an obligation to maintain and support Oregon's military facilities," said Smith. "Oregon has a role to play in keeping America safe, and this bill provides valuable funds to our state's military community."
   Oregon projects included in the Senate's VA/MilCon Appropriations bill are as follows:
   * $6,132,000 for the construction of a new Navy Reserve Center in Eugene; 
   * $941,000 for planning and design of an expansion of the Oregon Military Department's Joint Forces Headquarters in Salem.
