UMPQUA COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER TO RECEIVE NEARLY $600,000
  Sens. Gordon Smith (R-OR) and Ron Wyden (D-OR) announced today that the Umpqua Community Health Center will receive $588,667 for continuation of comprehensive primary care services.  
 The grant is issued by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
   "Far too many Oregonians have no health insurance or not enough health insurance," said Smith. "The Umpqua Center serves Douglas County by providing vital, quality health care to those who would otherwise suffer without." 
   "Community health centers are often the only way for folks without adequate health insurance to get the health care they need for themselves and their families," said Wyden. "I'm pleased to see these funds going to support this critical need in Douglas County."
   The Umpqua Community Health Center provides services to low-income, uninsured, and underinsured Oregonians. Last year the Clinic served nearly 2,000 patients, 45 percent of which were uninsured.
