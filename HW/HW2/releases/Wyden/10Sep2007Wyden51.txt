SEN. WYDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON GEN. PETRAEUS'S REPORT
  U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) issued the following statement today in response to General David Petraeus's testimony before the U.S. House Armed Service Committee: 
   "General Petraeus's focus on selective military successes in Iraq obscures the larger problem: military tactics are not bringing about political reconciliation. 
   "For four and a half years, the Bush administration has been telling the American people that if we stay the course in Iraq conditions will change. Conditions have changed. They have gotten worse, forcing our courageous men and women in uniform into refereeing a dangerous civil war. It is the Iraqis - not the American Armed Forces - who must make the tough decisions that will bring about political reconciliation in their country. Therefore we must make it clear that American troops will not serve as their crutch forever.
   "I continue to fight for a time-table for withdrawal from Iraq. Our troops have served their country bravely and honorably. It is time to bring them home."
