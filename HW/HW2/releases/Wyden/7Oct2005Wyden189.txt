SENATE APPROVES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR OREGON NANOTECHNOLOGY, DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that the U.S. Senate has approved at least $109 million in funding for defense-related projects in Oregon, including significant funding for a number of Oregon nanotechnology projects. These funds are included in the FY2006 Defense spending bill, which now moves to a conference committee to work out differences between it and the House version of the bill.  
   "Oregon's cutting-edge technologies and nanotechnology research continually support American defense efforts, and they'll receive a big boost with these funds," said Wyden. "Our state makes many important contributions to America's security, and these funds will keep those contributions coming, while improving Oregon's economy as a whole." 
   "Oregon businesses play an important role in our nation's security," Smith said. "Their cutting edge research and advances help make our military more effective while keeping our technology sector vibrant."
   The projects that would receive funding are as follows:
   * The Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) would receive $5 million for the Nanoelectronics and Nanometrology Initiative.
   * ONAMI would also receive $3.5 million for the safer nanomaterials and nanomanufacturing program.
   * ONAMI would also receive $3 million for the development of miniature tactical energy systems.
   * Oregon Health and Science University would receive $3 million for its Nanotechnology and Health Care center to boost nanotech research efforts across a variety of disciplines.
   * Freightliner, based in Portland, would share in $12 million to continue its program of replacing M915 linehaul tractors. 
   * AVI BioPharma in Portland and Corvallis would receive $6 million for the development of technology to test for and find therapeutic agents for the Dengue Virus. The company would also receive $6 million for the development of technology to test for and find therapeutic agents for the Ebola Virus, $6 million for the development of technology to test for and find therapeutic agents for the Marburg Virus, as well as $4 million for the development of technology to test for and find therapeutic agents for the Anthrax and Ricin toxins.
   * Advanced Navigation and Positioning Corporation of Hood River would receive $7.5 million for Transportable Transponder Landing Systems to improve the safety, accuracy and reliability of Air Force and Navy operations. 
   * The Metals Affordability Initiative Consortium would receive $7 million for research, testing and development of technologies to improve military war fighting capabilities through advanced metallurgy, while increasing the cost-effectiveness of such technologies. 
   * HemCon of Tigard would receive $5 million for the further development of the chitosan hemorrhage control dressing. 
   * The American Blimp Advanced Airship Flying Laboratory would receive $5 million for continued research and development projects.
   * Oregon Iron Works would receive $5 million for the continued development of the Unmanned Force Augmentation System program.
   * Blacktoe Corporation would receive $4 million for the research and development of a portable, finger-mounted ultrasound probe that uses Doppler and imaging technology to be used by Army medical personnel in the field. 
   * FLIR Systems, based in Portland, would also receive $12 million to improve the thermal imaging systems on its UH-60 MEDEVAC aircraft. The improved imaging capabilities will permit aircrews to more effectively detect and identify targets and areas of interest, significantly improve flight safety and provide critical intelligence for aircrew and civil support personnel. FLIR Systems would also receive $4 million to upgrade the navigation thermal imaging systems in the Marine Corps' fleet of UH-1N "Huey" helicopters.
   * Oregon Aero would receive $2.5 million for BLSS Kit retrofit systems, which enhance helmet ballistic protection, comfort, buoyancy, stability and inter-operability with other systems and equipment.
   * InSport would receive $2 million for the development of cold weather clothing and equipment for Marine Corps expeditionary forces personnel.
   * The University of Oregon's Brain, Biology and Machine Science Initiative would receive $2 million for interdisciplinary research related to cognitive neuroscience, genetics research, and informatics.
   * The Rockwell Collins facility in Portland would receive $2 million to install the Global Air Traffic Management system in Air Force KC-135s.
   * Armor Systems International would receive $1.5 million for the design and development of a Rocket Propelled Grenade Vehicle Protection system.
   * Digimarc of Beaverton would receive $1 million for the research and development of a real-time geospatial video sensor, allowing the information collected to be directly available for instant retrieval on the battlefield.
