SEN. WYDEN TO ADDRESS CITY CLUB OF CENTRAL OREGON ON HEALTH CARE
  "Now Is the Time to Fix Health Care" is the topic for Senator Ron Wyden's address to the City Club of Central Oregon on Monday, February 18, 2008.  
   Wyden is the author of the Healthy Americans Act, which has gained bipartisan support and is being co-sponsored by Sen. Bob Bennett (R) of Utah. HAA would get employers out of the business of providing health care for their workers, require Americans to buy a basic health insurance policy for themselves, reduce health care costs, slash health care paperwork and create bold incentives for more preventive care.
   The address to the City Club of Central Oregon is the first stop on Wyden's week-long, statewide tour to talk to Oregonians about their health care needs and experiences.
