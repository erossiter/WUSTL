SENS. WYDEN, SMITH ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY FACILITY IN ONTARIO
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that $473,000 has been included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Military Construction appropriations bill for the construction of a new National Guard Armory in Ontario.  
 The new National Guard Armory will be used to house a unit of the Third Battalion, 116th Cavalry of the Oregon National Guard.
   "With increased numbers of Oregon's National Guard serving overseas, the Federal government needs to ensure that our troops have proper facilities, equipment and training," said Wyden. "Service members perform a valuable role in our nation and I am pleased that these funds will go to support them."
   "The Oregon National Guard has served above and beyond the call of duty for our country," said Smith. "They have given their best in service and they deserve the best from us."
   The new Armory facility will replace an aging and smaller facility that was originally constructed in 1950. The facility will be constructed in a partnership venture with Treasure Valley Community College.
   The military construction bill was approved this week by the Senate Appropriations Committee and will be voted upon by the full Senate in the coming weeks.
