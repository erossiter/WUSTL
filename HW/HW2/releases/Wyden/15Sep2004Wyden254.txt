SENS. WYDEN, SMITH WIN SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS FOR OREGON AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that Oregon should receive substantial funds and share in millions of additional dollars for agricultural projects under the Senate's agriculture appropriations legislation. Much of the funding will support research at Oregon State University, known as a regional leader in the study of agriculture. The Senate Appropriations Committee approved the bill this week; it now moves to the full Senate for consideration.  
   "These funds will support both the hard work of farmers and key research to help Oregon's agricultural industry grow," said Wyden. "Oregonians depend on a successful agricultural industry for economic growth in both rural and urban areas, and for the preservation of our environment."
   "The continuation of research efforts is necessary for Oregon to maintain its position as one of the world's leading producers of agricultural products," said Smith. "The projects funded by this bill will help keep our farm economy on the cutting edge of agricultural innovation and production."
   The Appropriations Committee endorsed several key rural development projects in Oregon, including the Union and Wallowa Counties rail line, the Tillamook County log waste and pellet mill, Santiam County economic development, the Gilliam County Wheat Quality Initiative and the Rural Utility Corridor.
   As a result of Wyden and Smith's efforts, the Committee also ensured continued funding for the shellfish, viticulture, hops research, and small fruits research programs at OSU, as well as research on western grazing lands in Burns, Oregon and the IR-4 Minor Use Pesticides program.
   The committee allocated additional funding for the following projects: 
   * The Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research will receive $400,000 to be shared among Oregon, Idaho and Washington for basic research. 
   * Oregon, Idaho and Washington will share $407,000 for research to identify improved grass seed crop management and conservation practices. 
   * Oregon State University in Corvallis will receive $355,000 for multi-commodity agricultural marketing research. 
   * OSU will also receive $351,000 for research at the National Laboratory for Molluscan Broodstock in Newport.
   * OSU will share in a $6.5 million multi-state appropriation for wood utilization research. 
   * OSU's Solutions to Environmental and Economic Problems (STEEP) III project will receive $625,000. 
   * OSU's meadowfoam research project, an effort to increase the supply of renewable industrial oils, will receive $262,000.
