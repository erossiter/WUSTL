SENS. WYDEN, SMITH ANNOUNCE NEW FEDERAL FUNDING TO BOOST HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN OREGON COMMUNITIES
  Sens. Ron Wyden and Gordon Smith today announced that they have obtained significant federal funding for various Oregon projects as part of the FY2008 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education appropriations bill. The legislation approved Thursday by the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee includes funding for health care, education and workforce development projects; the bill must now be approved by the full Senate.
   "Federal funds can often provide the spark to jump start great community efforts," Wyden said. "These targeted Federal investments in health care, education and workforce development will provide a meaningful boost to Oregon communities." 
   "The funding advances health care and research projects throughout Oregon," Senator Smith said. "Many of these programs will lead to the next generation of medical cures. Just as important, the funding addresses many of today's health care needs." 
   Oregon projects included in the appropriations committee's bill are as follows:
   * $400,000 for Portland State University's Science Research and Teaching Center, which will focus on innovative ways to improve science education at the university level, at community colleges, and in K-12 schools. The Center will provide research and teaching space for biology, chemistry, environmental science, physics, and for the Masters degree in the teaching of science. 
   * $350,000 to create an Integrated Health Care Facility in Cascade Locks, which currently has no medical, dental or pharmaceutical facilities or providers of health care.
   * $300,000 to establish a University Center in Hermiston to provide access to higher education and workforce training programs for rural communities and disadvantaged populations in west Umatilla and north Morrow counties, the most rapidly growing area in eastern Oregon. The Center will accommodate approx. 600 students, providing courses in business, technology, science, nursing and other allied health professions, education, and the liberal arts.
   * $250,000 to equip a nursing simulation laboratory at Western Oregon University in support of a joint Oregon Health and Sciences University/Western Oregon University Bachelor of Science degree program in nursing.
   * $200,000 to the Cascade AIDS Project in Portland to provide support services for men, women and children living with HIV/AIDS and to conduct HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention programs. More than 6,000 families in the Portland area have a loved one living with HIV. 
   * $150,000 to the Working for Independence Program in Clackamas County, which assists people managing mental illness and related conditions with training and finding and keeping productive jobs in the community.

   * $100,000 to support small business workforce development needs through Portland Community College's Center for Business and Industry (CBI). CBI will use the funding to increase workforce training services to small businesses, which comprise 90% of the total businesses in the Portland metropolitan area.
   * $100,000 to the Providence Multiple Sclerosis Center in Portland to implement the Oregon Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Network and Registry Project.
