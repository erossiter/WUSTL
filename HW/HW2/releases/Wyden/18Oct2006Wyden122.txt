SENS. BRADLEY, WYDEN CALL FOR NEW TAX REFORM PUSH ON EVE OF ELECTION
  Twenty years after the last major tax reform act was signed into law, former Sen. Bill Bradley (D-NJ) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) have scheduled a news conference this Monday, October 23, to urge President Bush to join Congress in once again enacting real tax reform for the American people. 
   Bradley and Wyden's call for a tax debate comes two weeks before the decisive mid-term elections.
   Bradley, the original Senate sponsor of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, remains one of the nation's leading advocates for a fairer and simpler tax code. Wyden is the author of the Fair Flat Tax Act of 2005, a tax reform package which calls for a simplified tax code to benefit middle-income Americans.
   The Tax Reform Act of 1986 was a bipartisan effort. Originated by Democrats in a divided Congress, the landmark legislation gained traction only after winning the support of Republican President Ronald Reagan. Wyden's Fair Flat Tax Act has many parallels to the 1986 legislation, including provisions to lower tax rates, broaden the overall tax base and treat work and wealth equally.
   The press conference will be held Monday, October 23, 2006, at 11:30 a.m. in the Choate Room of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, 1779 Massachusetts Ave., NW.
