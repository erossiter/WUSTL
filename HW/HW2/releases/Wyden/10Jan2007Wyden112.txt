SEN. WYDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON PRESIDENT'S SURGE FORCE PLAN FOR IRAQ
  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), a senior member of the U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released the following statement in response to President Bush's remarks on the war in Iraq:  
   "I am not convinced that overstretching our military further is going to produce success in Iraq, and I oppose the President's plan. 
   "When it comes to ending the violence in Iraq, only the Iraqis can make the tough choices necessary to stop the civil war. The Iraqis won't make these tough choices until they see that U.S. troops won't hold their hands forever. It's time to start bringing our men and women in uniform home so that the Iraqis will do what it takes to promote stability and lasting peace."
