OREGON MILITARY FACILITIES SLATED FOR FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-OR) and Gordon Smith (R-OR) today announced that more than $15 million has been included in the Fiscal Year 2008 Military Construction appropriations bill for various construction projects in the state of Oregon. The committee also announced its support for the construction of a long term care facility at the Walla Walla VA Medical Center.  
   "From creating classroom space to giving prime land back to the cities, these projects are excellent examples of National Guard and Reserves projects benefiting the communities they serve," said Senator Wyden. "It will also give Oregon Guard and Reserve troops adequate space to train for their critical natural disaster response and homeland security duties."
   "Our Guard and Reserves serve all over the world and we need to ensure they are prepared when called into harm's way," Senator Smith said. "The funding will help make sure they have the facilities in Oregon to prepare for their mission." 
   The bill provides:
   * $1.452 million for the design of an Armed Forces Reserve Center in Klamath Falls. The center would serve as an administrative and training facility for the 1-82 Cavalry Troop C 1 Squadron Dismounted Scout. The 173d Security Force Squadron would also have access to the facility's classroom and administrative space.
   * $960,000 for the design of a Readiness Center located in The Dalles. That facility would be capable of supporting all the administrative and training functions necessary for an Oregon National Guard Company, including space for homeland security, antiterrorism, and force protection training and operations.
   * $11 million provision for the Ontario Readiness Center, which will replace the aging Ontario Armory. The facility will provide local residents with a community center as well as additional classroom space for the Community College.
   * $1.9 million to fund the relocation of two navy reserve units from their current location at the Navy and Marine Corps Reserve Center in Portland to the Portland Air National Guard Base.
