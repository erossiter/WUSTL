SEN. WYDEN APPLAUDS U.S. TRADE REPRESENTATIVE'S DECISION TO CHALLENGE CHINESE SUBSIDIES HURTING US HARDWOOD PLYWOOD INDUSTRY
  Noting that approximately 70 percent of North America's hardwood plywood is manufactured by companies headquartered in Oregon, Sen. Ron Wyden on Friday, Feb. 2, applauded the decision by U.S. Trade Rep. Susan Schwab to file a WTO case against China over prohibited subsidies that adversely affect the US hardwood plywood industry. 
   Nearly 2,000 Oregonians work in the hardwood plywood industry.
   In separate letters in November 2006 to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Trade Representative and the U.S. Department of Commerce, Wyden urged the agencies to actively investigate alleged practices ranging from Chinese subsidies of its wood products industry to fraudulent labeling of Chinese hardwood plywood.
   "I am very appreciative that our trade representative has been willing to listen to our concerns and take action," Wyden said. "The hardwood plywood industry in Oregon generates good, family-wage jobs in the state and across the country. We cannot afford to allow illegal trade activity to take away what American businesses and workers have worked so hard to build."
   Wyden added, "I will continue to work with USTR as well as Commerce and Customs to ensure unfair Chinese practices that jeopardize the well-being of so many Oregonians are adequately addressed."
