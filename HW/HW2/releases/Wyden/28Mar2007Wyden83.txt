  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR) issued the following statement on Wednesday, March 28, 2007, after the U.S. Senate voted in favor of his multi-year proposal to restore funding for the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self Determination Act. The Sens. Ron Wyden - Harry Reid - Max Baucus - Jeff Bingaman Amendment, which is now included in the 2007 Emergency Supplement Appropriations bill, passed the Senate by a vote of 75 to 22. 
   "Thanks to the wise action of the U.S. Senate today, rural communities across the country can rest a little easier tonight. 
   "After two years of Federal inaction, the U.S. Senate today took the first important step toward honoring its 100-year obligation to rural counties and schools. I urge the House of Representatives to work with us in conference to ensure that these rural counties are not turned into national sacrifice zones. 
   "I thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their tremendous work and support in getting it done."
