SENS. SMITH, WYDEN ANNOUNCE FUNDS FOR OREGON ENERGY AND WATER PROJECTS
  Today, Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) announced Federal funding for Oregon's critical infrastructure and environmental projects as part of the Fiscal 2006 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. The projects are pending final Senate passage on Monday November 14.  
   "Clean water and reliable energy sources are vital to Oregon's economy," said Wyden. "The projects that will now receive funding throughout the state will not only improve water availability and quality as a whole, but will also protect Oregon jobs and boost our high-tech sector at the same time.
   "Protecting our environment and effectively managing our natural resources are vital to growing our economy and preserving Oregon's pristine beauty," said Smith. "These projects will help create jobs in many of our rural areas while helping to better manage our energy and infrastructure needs."
   The funding bill includes $15 million in funding to continue the Columbia River Channel Deepening Project, and provides $17 million for jetty repairs at the mouth of the Columbia. The Klamath Project is slated to receive $21.054 million; and $1.5 million is included for the removal of Savage Rapids Dam.
