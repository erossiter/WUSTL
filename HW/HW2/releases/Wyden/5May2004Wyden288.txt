PORTLAND TO RECEIVE $8 MILLION FOR HOMELAND SECURITY
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that the Oregon Department of State Police will receive $8,112,992 for homeland security preparedness in the Portland area.  
 Funds are being awarded to help Portland prevent, deter, respond to, and recover from threats and incidents of terrorism. This grant is being awarded by the Urban Area Security Initiative Grant Program through the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Domestic Preparedness.
   "These funds are an investment in the safety and security of Oregonians," said Wyden. "More resources at the local level will let Portland's first responders address the many security and preparedness challenges they must tackle in the near term."
   "The Oregon State Police put their heart and soul into serving and protecting Oregonians from threat and danger," said Smith. "With the continuation of the War on Terror, it is important to ensure that they have every resource available to them to carry on their good work." 
   Grant funds for various cities are determined through a formula by looking at a number of factors including threat estimates, population density, and transit system ridership.
