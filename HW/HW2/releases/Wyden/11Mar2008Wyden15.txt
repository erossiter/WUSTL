SEN. WYDEN TO HOST RURAL HEALTH CARE TOWN HALL ON MARCH 17 IN PENDLETON
  On Monday, March 17, 2008, Oregon Senator Ron Wyden will be in Pendleton to host a community conversation on rural health care. Wyden, co-sponsor of the bipartisan Healthy Americans Act, is inviting Eastern Oregon residents to attend and share their personal experiences and perspective in dealing with the health care system. 
   "Health care consistently ranks at the top of the list of issues that concern all Americans," Wyden said. "Hearing the personal experiences of those who deal with today's health care system, particularly those in rural areas, is vital to understanding what needs to be done in the future."
   The Rural Health Care Town Hall is part of Wyden's on-going tour of the state to talk to and with Oregonians about their health care needs and what should be done to fix the health care system.
