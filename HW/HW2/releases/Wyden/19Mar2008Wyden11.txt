SEN. WYDEN TO DISCUSS NEW CREDIT CARD RATING LEGISLATION AT SOU ON MARCH 20
  Southern Oregon University students and administrators will join Oregon Senator Ron Wyden on Thursday, March 20, 2008, for a roundtable discussion and news conference on legislation that will give consumers, particularly college students, a valuable new tool to determine the difference between good and bad credit cards. 
   Wyden introduced The Credit Card Safety Star Act of 2007 (S. 2411) along with co-sponsored Illinois Senator Barack Obama.
   At the news conference, students and administrators will be available to discuss their experiences with credit card solicitations and debt in a time of rising tuition costs. College students are being deluged with complex solicitations from credit card companies. According to administrators, some debt-ridden students are forced to choose between mounting debt and dropping out of school.
   Under Senator Wyden's bill, credit card agreements would receive a low of one star to a high of five stars based on how easy the terms are to understand. The stars would appear on the cards themselves as well as on the applications.
