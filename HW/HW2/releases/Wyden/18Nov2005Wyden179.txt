OREGON MILITARY FACILITIES TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that Oregon military installations will soon receive Federal funding for various construction projects.  
 More than $9 million in funding was included in the FY 2006 Veterans Administration and Military Construction conference report; the legislation will soon move to the White House for signature into law. 
   "Day and night, Oregonians depend on our military for their security here at home and abroad," said Wyden. "The funding for these projects will make sure that our military personnel have the facilities they need to continue securing the Northwest, and to support the disaster relief efforts they engage in around the world." 
   "While providing disaster relief and security at home and abroad, our service men and women are the pride of Oregon's communities," said Smith. "We need to equip them with the resources and the facilities they need to carry out the missions that keep us all safe."
   Under the final VA/MilCon appropriations legislation, $6,132,000 would be provided for the construction of a new Navy Reserve Center in Lane County. In addition, $2,735,000 would be provided for construction of a Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team facility in Marion County.
   The legislation also includes $1.5 billion to pay for closures of military installations nationwide, including the planned closure of the Umatilla Chemical Depot.
