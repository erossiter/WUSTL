SEN. WYDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CHALLENGE TO OREGON'S PHYSICIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE LAW
  "I am extremely disappointed that Attorney General Ashcroft has chosen to continue ignoring the will of the voters of Oregon.  
 The people of our state have spoken twice on the matter, and so have the Federal courts. I certainly plan to look into how many taxpayer dollars Mr. Ashcroft has wasted in his attempt to disenfranchise Oregon voters."
