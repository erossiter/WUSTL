SEN. WYDEN, FELLOW SENATORS CALL FOR IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION OF JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ACTION IN TOBACCO CASE
  At a press conference on Wednesday, June 8, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) sharply criticized the U.S. Justice Department for inexplicably reducing its demands in a Federal racketeering case against tobacco companies to $120 billion less than the companies could be asked to pay for anti-smoking programs. Wyden has joined Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.), Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.) and others in requesting an Inspector General investigation of the Justice Department's sudden and inappropriate action in the tobacco case.
