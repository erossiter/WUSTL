SEN. WYDEN CO-SPONSORS 'NO PERMANENT BASES' RESOLUTION FOR IRAQ
  Sen. Ron Wyden today signed on as a co-sponsor of an amendment to "express the sense of Congress that the United States should not establish permanent military bases in Iraq or exercise control over the natural resources of Iraq." The provision will be offered as an amendment to the emergency supplemental appropriations bill currently being debated in the U.S. Senate. 
   "We need to send a message to the Iraqi people and the rest of the world that the United States is not in Iraq for oil or for strategically-placed military installations," Wyden said. 
   In March, Wyden called on the President to "unequivocally agree to never establishing a permanent military base in Iraq;" the Administration has not responded, so Wyden joined with fellow Senators in this next step. Click here for the full text of Wyden's March statement.
   Earlier this month Wyden went to the Senate floor to call for a Congressional vote on the President's plan and budget for American's continued involvement in Iraq. Wyden, a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, cited the need for Congress to have a role as a "co-equal branch of government" in the future of the war-ravaged nation.
