SENS. WYDEN, SMITH SECURE FUNDS FOR OREGON, OSU AGRICULTURE PROJECTS
  Today, Sens. Ron Wyden and Gordon Smith announced the U.S. Senate has passed legislation providing agricultural projects in Oregon with millions of dollars in federal funds. The Senate Agriculture Appropriations Bill now enters into conference with the House of Representatives. 
   "Farm operations are the backbone of rural Oregon and research fuels their long-term prosperity," said Smith. "Oregon has a rich tradition of agricultural production, but it's a changing industry and we need to fund the lab coats as well as the overalls."
   "Oregon's agriculture industry is a nationwide leader in scientific research and farming advances, and it's also a bedrock of our state's economy," said Wyden. "The Federal funds in this bill will keep our economy growing by boosting research efforts and benefiting ranchers and farmers throughout the state."
   Oregon State University will receive funding for numerous projects, including:
   * $443,000 for the Northwest Center for Small Fruits Research, to be shared among Oregon, Idaho and Washington. In addition, the Center will receive $3.98 million for a genetics research initiative;
   * $200,000 for invasive species research;
   * $365,000 at the National Laboratory for Molluscan Broodstock in Newport;
