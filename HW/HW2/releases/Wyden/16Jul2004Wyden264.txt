SENS. WYDEN, SMITH ANNOUNCE $1.6 MILLION FOR PORT SECURITY
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that the Regional Maritime Security Coalition (RMSC) of Portland would receive $1.62 million for the research and development of port security enhancements in the Northwest.  
 These federal funds are being provided by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) for the development of a model multi-jurisdictional, multi-agency Cargo Information Action Center (CIAC) for 22 ports in the Columbia-Snake River System, stretching from the Pacific Ocean at Astoria, Ore., to Lewiston, Idaho. This grant will improve communications and coordination throughout the tri-state region, employing the Regional Alliance for Infrastructure and Security Network (RAINS-NET).
   "Maintaining security at Oregon's ports is critical for the safety of the surrounding communities and to continue the efficient flow of commerce that supports so many family-wage jobs in our region," said Wyden. "I'm pleased to see federal funds going to support a win-win effort that will protect our ports from the threat of terrorism while improving regional communication and coordination of cargo shipments."
   "Ports are an essential part of Oregon's economy," said Smith. "Their security needs to be ensured in order to protect the flow of commerce that Oregon's businesses and farmers depend on for their livelihood."
   In 2002, Wyden and Smith heard from port security officials at a hearing of the Senate Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine in Portland. Representatives from the Coast Guard, Customs Service, Army Corps of Engineers, Oregon's major ports, the longshoremen's union and retailers testified about the need for increased federal funding for port security.
