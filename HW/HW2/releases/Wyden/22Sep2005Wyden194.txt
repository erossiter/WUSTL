SENATE APPROVES FUNDING FOR OREGON MILITARY FACILITIES
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that the Senate has approved more than $7 million in funding for Oregon military facility construction projects.  
 The funding was included in the FY 2006 Veterans Administration and Military Construction appropriations bill; the legislation now moves to a conference committee to work out differences between it and the House version of the bill.
   "Oregon's military personnel play an important role in securing the Northwest and all of the U.S.," said Wyden. "The Federal government should ensure that military facilities get the improvements they need to support our armed forces, and the funds in this bill are a major step toward that goal."
   "Our armed services are providing disaster relief and security at home and abroad," said Smith. "They're the pride of Oregon's communities and our military should have the up-to-date facilities they need to successfully carry out today's missions."
   Under the VA/MilCon appropriations funding legislation approved today, $6,132,000 would be provided for the construction of a new Navy Reserve Center in Eugene. In addition, $941,000 would be provided for the planning and design of an expansion of the Oregon Military Department's Joint Forces headquarters in Salem.
   The legislation also includes $1.5 billion to pay for closures of military installations nationwide, including the planned closure of the Umatilla Chemical Depot.
