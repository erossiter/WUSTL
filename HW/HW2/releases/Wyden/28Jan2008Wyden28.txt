SEN. WYDEN ISSUES STATEMENT ON STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS
  U.S. Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) issued the following statement in response to President George W. Bush's State of the Union address: 
   "I agree with the President when he says that Democrats and Republicans have a responsibility to work together for the American people. While I agree with his sentiment, I disagree with his approach. When it comes to the economy, Americans need more than tax cuts for the most fortunate few and one-time rebates - they need a long-term economic policy that creates jobs and puts money back in the hands of working families. When it comes to health care, Americans need more than a band-aid approach - they need comprehensive reform that will address the spiraling costs of insurance, while guaranteeing that every American has quality, affordable health care. Americans need an education policy that really will leave no child behind. They need an energy policy that doesn't hold them hostage to the price and availability of foreign oil and they need a foreign policy that doesn't require U.S. troops to referee a civil war, but will rather restore the reputation of Americans around the world. I look forward to working with my colleagues on these priorities."
