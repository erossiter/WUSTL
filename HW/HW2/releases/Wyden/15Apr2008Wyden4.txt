SEN. WYDEN TO HOLD TOWN HALL MEETINGS IN CLACKAMAS, MULTNOMAH COUNTIES
  U.S. Senator Ron Wyden will host town hall meetings on April 20, 2008, at West Linn City Hall and Jefferson High School. Clackamas and Multnomah county residents are invited to attend the open forums to ask questions and voice their concerns. 
   During his 1996 U.S. Senate campaign, Wyden promised to hold town hall meetings in every Oregon county each year. The events in West Linn and Portland mark the 11th year of these meetings, which now total over 475.
   Also, during the Multnomah County town hall, Wyden will honor the Jefferson High School boys and girls basketball teams, winners of the 2008 5A state championships. Members of the two teams will attend the Sunday event at the high school.
