OREGON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that a number of transportation and community development projects throughout Oregon will soon receive Federal funding. More than $53 million in funds were included as part of the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development (TTJHUD) conference report, which will be signed into law soon. 
   "Oregon families and businesses alike throughout the entire state will benefit from the improvement projects funded in this bill," said Wyden. "Making investments today in our transportation infrastructure, our communities and in education programs helps puts Oregon on a road toward economic vitality for years to come."
   "Economic development is a constant process and it is vital to the well-being of Oregonians," Smith said. "While private initiative will always be its most important component, public funds can fuel projects that improve the business climate, bolster community initiatives, and improve our standard of living."
