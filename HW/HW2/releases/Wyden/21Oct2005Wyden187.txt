SENATE APPROVES FUNDS FOR OREGON COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT, TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sens. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Gordon Smith (R-Ore.) today announced that the Senate has approved more than $38 million for various transportation and community development projects throughout Oregon. The funds were included as part of the FY 2006 Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development (TTJHUD) Appropriations bill, which now goes to a conference committee to work out differences between it and the House version of the legislation. 
   "The funds in this bill will support the improvement of Oregonians' lives through transportation projects, community development efforts and education programs," said Wyden. "Oregon families and businesses benefit when the Federal government invests in our communities."
   "Successful economic development projects improve the business climate, bolster community initiatives, and add to the standard of living," said Smith. "The projects included in this bill are positive local investments for Oregon."
