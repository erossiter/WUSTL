SEN. WYDEN SECURES FUNDING APPROVAL FOR COMMUNITY GROUPS, DRUG PREVENTION PROGRAMS
  Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) announced today that Oregon could receive nearly $7 million for drug prevention and rehabilitation programs, as well as funding for fishery-related programs.  
 The funding was included in the Senate FY 2005 Commerce/Justice/State (CJS) funding bill approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee this week; it will next be considered by the full Senate.
   "These federal funds will help give Oregon law enforcement the tools to fight crime and wage the war on dangerous drugs like meth," said Wyden. "Through the programs receiving funds, communities will be able to address local concerns and improve the safety and security of our neighborhoods." 
   The Senate FY 2005 CJS Appropriations bill includes funding for the following programs:
   * The Clackamas County Methamphetamine Initiative would receive $400,000 to support community prosecution efforts
   * The Marion County Forensic Laboratory would receive $400,000 for lab enhancements 
   * The Marion County Children of Incarcerated Parents program would receive $350,00 
   * The Methamphetamine Reduction Program in Coos and Curry Counties would receive $60,000
   In addition, Wyden secured funding approval for two fish habitat programs. Under the legislation approved this week, the Northwest Fisheries Science Center would receive $5 million for the West Coast Observer Program. The Center would also receive $500,000 for the West Coast Cooperative Research program.
   The Appropriations Committee also recommended continued funding for several key projects in Oregon, including the Tillamook County Digester Rail Transportation, the Mill Creek Industrial Employment Center, Benton County North Riverfront Access, Electronic Permitting, Mobile Workforce Development Lab, Newport Childcare Center, Riveria Activity Center, and the Southern Oregon University Center for Excellence in Regional Development.
