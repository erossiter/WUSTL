                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Floor Speech on the Iraq War          United States Senate     Tuesday  July 17  2007      As Prepared For Delivery   Mr  President  I rise tonight to play my small part in this pointless political play put on by the Senate Majority Leader  It is an insult to the brave men and women in our Armed Forces and to the American taxpayers that we are here tonight for no other reason than for a publicity stunt  Instead of following the script written by Move On like my colleagues on the other side of the aisle  I want to be honest and frank with the American people  I hear Democrats every day talking about public opinion polls on Iraq and on the Presidents approval rating  To some extent they are right  The American people are not satisfied with the war in Iraq  And the President is at an all time low in his approval rating   But I rarely hear my friends on the other side of the aisle talk about public opinion of Congress  And its obvious why  President Bush has a higher approval rating than the current Democrat led Congress  I have never been accused of being a political strategist  But I have been around this town long enough    over twenty years    to know that the American people resent their leaders for so often taking the politically expedient path instead of doing what they think is right   The American people see right through this charade going on tonight  It is just more political theater  Phony images of cots  toothpaste  and sleepy politicians meant to convince people that what goes on here at three in the morning may actually do some good   But it doesnt do any good  In fact  it does a lot of bad  Because this debate is more about political show and placating the Move On folks than it is about talking about the real issues at hand   It is appalling that we are using a bill that provides vital funding for our nations military as a political smokescreen for Democrats to gain points in the polls  The safety and security of the brave men and women in our Armed Forces is not a game to me  Our troops should never be used as a basis to stage a cheap publicity stunt   If the Senate truly supported our troops  we would be here debating the nuts and bolts of the Department of Defense Authorization bill  Instead we find ourselves back debating whether to cut and run from Iraq as we have done countless times before tonight  Democrats would like for you to believe that Republicans will not vote on the Reed Levin amendment  Give me a break  Im happy to vote on this amendment right now  I plan to oppose it just as I opposed a similar version Senator Levin offered just two months ago   It is a bad amendment  It calls for a premature withdrawal of American troops from Iraq before we have even had a chance to see the results of the surge   I want to know how some of my colleagues know that the surge has already failed when it has only been in place for a month  I want to know how they know the situation in Iraq better than our commanders on the ground   The ink isnt even dry on the Presidents plan and Democrats are already declaring it a failure  This type of defeatist strategy is irrational and unfair   It is important to remember the dangerous effect our debate here in Washington can have on the message we are sending to our enemies  Make no mistake our enemies are watching us   They are watching us and using our debate on the war on Iraq to strengthen themselves  Just this morning the new National Intelligence Estimate declared that the United States is at an elevated threat level   It said that our biggest threat is al Qaeda    specifically al Qaeda in Iraq  The group is working to mobilize other extremist terrorist organizations in the region to mount a new attack against the United States  The report also found the al Qaeda will continue to acquire chemical  biological or nuclear material for attacks and will not hesitate to use them   While al Qaeda is working to plan this attack  U S  forces are working hand in hand with Iraqi Security Forces to break up this organization and root out its terrorist networks   This work is vital to our national security  We cannot forget the important lessons we learned from the tragedies of 9 11  There are still those out there who wish to do us harm  Wake up America  If we withdraw from Iraq  the terrorists will likely follow us home  Democrats would like for us to believe that we can responsibly leave Iraq and the conflict will end  This is delusional  Make no mistake if we leave Iraq prematurely there will be widespread chaos in the Middle East  Iran will work with Syria to dominate the region while Sunni states scramble to oppose them  They will use any means possible to acquire the resources to bolster their nuclear weapons program in an effort to combat the United States  The Kurds in Iraq will form their own country possibly with the Kurds in Turkey  Syria and Iran  This could then lead to an armed conflict between the Kurds and the Turkish government   There will be widespread attacks to wipeout Israel and topple the Democratic government of Lebanon  These pillars of Democracy in the Middle East that once stood as an example for freedom within the region will crumble   The government in Iraq will fail and there will be civil war within the country  This will result in mass civilian casualties and displacement  Most importantly  our national security will suffer   Just this afternoon we passed by a large majority Senator Cornyns amendment that said that we should not leave a failed state in Iraq  It also said that we should not pass any legislation that will undermine our militarys ability to prevent a failed state in Iraq   I ask my colleagues what are we doing right now  We are debating Senator Levins amendment that will without a doubt result in a failed Iraq  Let me be clear to my colleagues that believe they can support both amendments  A strategy of cut and run will lead to a failed Iraq and will undermine our militarys mission   But Democrats have already decided the surge has failed before it has had a chance to work  These are the same people who voted to overwhelmingly confirm General Petraeus and are now refusing to wait to hear his report in September   This is the exact type of message our enemies want to hear  Well  I for one am working hard to send our enemies a message  the United States will not back down from this fight  I stand behind our troops and General Petraeus   I promised General Petraeus that I would wait to hear his report this fall  And I intend to keep my promise  I urge my colleagues to do the same   The safety and security of all Americans depend on it   Thank you Mr  President and I yield the floor                                                       July 2007 News Releases                                                                                                   United States
