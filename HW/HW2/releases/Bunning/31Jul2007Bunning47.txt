                                      Bunning Offers Amendment To SCHIP           United States Senate     Tuesday  July 31  2007        Mr  President  I would like to offer an amendment to the SCHIP bill  This is the same amendment I offered during the Finance Committees consideration of this legislation   Ive heard a lot of talk about how the Baucus bill puts the focus for SCHIP back on low income children   So much talk  in fact  that you would hardly know that the Baucus bill allows certain states to provide families making up to  70 000 or  80 000 a year in income with government run healthcare   Lets start from the beginning   The way the SCHIP and Medicaid programs work is that states get federal matching dollars to help fund their programs   The SCHIP match from the federal government is higher than a states Medicaid match   This means that for my state  the federal government match for Medicaid is about 70  while the state pays for the remaining 30    For SCHIP  the federal match is 80   while the state makes up the remaining 20    SCHIP was intended to help states provide healthcare coverage to children in families whose incomes were below 200  of the federal poverty level  These families were likely working  but making too much money to qualify for Medicaid and couldnt afford private health insurance   Id like to note that 200  of the federal poverty level is about  41 000 a year in income for a family of four   The Baucus bill allows states to expand their SCHIP programs and receive the higher SCHIP matching rate for families with incomes up to 300  of the poverty level  or almost  62 000 for a family of four   Personally  I think that that  in and of its self  is too high  especially when the national median income in this country was about  46 000 in 2005  In the Baucus bill  states that choose to go above 300  of poverty would receive their Medicaid matching rate for those families  which remember is the lower reimbursement rate   However  the Baucus bill thinks that families in New Jersey and New York deserve special treatment under SCHIP  The bill provides an exemption for states that have already gone above or are currently trying to go above 300  of poverty level for SCHIP coverage   New Jersey already provides coverage for families up to 350  of poverty  New York is working to get approval to extend coverage up to 400  of poverty   I want to make sure everyone understands    400  of the poverty level is  82 600 a year for a family of four    350  of the poverty level is  72 275    Are we really going to be providing government health care for families making seventy to eighty thousand dollars a year  My amendment is fairly simple  It strikes the exemption the Baucus bill has given to just New York and New Jersey so they have to play by the same rules as every other state   If these two states want to provide health care coverage to families above 300  of the poverty level  they can do so  they just cannot get the higher SCHIP matching rate  They would get their Medicaid matching rate   That  at least  levels the playing field   There will obviously be some small savings from this  My amendment would take this savings and provide additional money to the outreach and enrollment grants   Some people will try to say that its more expensive to live in these two states than in other states  and that is probably true in certain areas   However  SCHIP is a federal program  and all states should play by the same rules  Also  these two states can still cover these higher income families if they choose  They just have to get the lower Medicaid matching rate to do so   If New York and New Jersey feel so strongly about letting families making  70 000 or  80 000 a year have government healthcare  then the state should be willing to pay a little more from their own tax revenue   The last time I checked  money doesnt grow on trees around here   The Baucus bill is requiring people in other states like Kentucky  New Mexico  Florida and Maine to pay more so New York and New Jersey can cover families at these high incomes  To me  thats grossly unfair  Some people may also try to argue that New York is only thinking about going to 400  of the poverty level and they would have to get a waiver or plan approved by the Department of Health and Human Services for this increase  Okay  so then why give them this special protection in the Baucus bill  Why create special rules for New York  when they havent even gotten approved yet  To me  it is outrageous that a program designed for lower income kids is being expanded to include families at 350  or 400  of the poverty level  Thats too high  and its unfair to ask people in other states to pay for these types of expenses   So with my amendment  you have two options    More money for outreach and enrollment efforts and requiring all states to play by the same rules  or  Or covering kids in families that most of us probably dont consider low income  those making up to  72 000 or  82 000 a year for a family of four    Thank you  and I reserve the balance of my time                                                       July 2007 News
