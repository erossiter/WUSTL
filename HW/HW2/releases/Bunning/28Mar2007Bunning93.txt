                                      Floor Speech On The Emergency Supplemental Bill          United States Senate     Wednesday  March 28  2007  Mr  President  I rise today to voice my strong opposition to the Emergency Supplemental Bill   The supplemental bill on the floor today is irresponsible  Since coming to Congress 20 years ago  I have pushed for accountability and fiscal responsibility  When the Democrats took a page from the Republican playbook and said they would be responsible with the taxpayers money  I wanted to believe them   I can see now that all of the Democrats promises to the American people last fall were only empty words  This bill is an insult to our men and women in uniform and every single American taxpayer   To me  this is not a political game  I came to the floor last year to oppose additional spending in the Emergency Supplemental Bill  It had non defense spending like  20 million for oyster fishermen in New England and  4 million for erosion control projects in California and Michigan  And that draft was put together by a Republican Congress   The extra funds I opposed last year pale in comparison to what the Democrats have done this year   Unfortunately  it has become routine to see emergency spending bills on the floor  I understand the pressing need for this legislation to defend America from terrorism and support our ongoing efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan   The purpose of the Presidents request is to protect and pay the men and women serving in the Armed Forces   It also provides the funding needed to restore damaged military equipment and purchase new  state of the art technology  This emergency supplemental is important to provide our American Armed Forces the additional funding they need now   However  this legislation goes far beyond necessary emergency defense spending  The majority is using budget gimmicks to pay for political hand outs and entitlements on the backs of our fighting men and women   Mixed in with the defense spending is a complicated list of earmarks  legislative language  and program expansions  Let me walk you through parts of the bill   The hurricanes of 2005 were truly devastating and I have supported the governments rebuilding effort in the region  But the bill before us today includes  1 45 billion in unrequested and unnecessary funding for the Corps of Engineers  It also eliminates a 10 percent local matching requirement for FEMA funds and eliminates the prohibition on forgiving community disaster loans   These are two provisions Congress has supported in the past to ensure responsible spending  These provisions are not only inappropriate for a wartime supplemental  but also bad policy   Another area of extra spending relates to agriculture  I have been a strong supporter of American farms  but the programs in this bill are routinely funded through the regular process  I can not justify supporting  3 million for a Hawaiian sugar cane co op or  20 million for insect damage in Nevada on a wartime supplemental bill  This bill is about our troops  not our farmers   There are even more glaring examples in this bill  There is  3 5 million for the Capitol Guide Service to provide services in tourists in this building  It adds  100 million for dairy production losses   13 million for a lamb replacement and retention program   40 million for the tree assistance program   6 million for flooded crop land in North Dakota   25 million for asbestos abatement at the Capitol power plant   23 million for geothermal energy research   The list goes on and on  I can not support requests like these on the backs of our fighting men and women  I will support every effort to strip all the non defense funding out of this bill  It is time to show fiscal restraint and use emergency wartime spending legislation for precisely that purpose  to pay for the war   Finally  I want to address the single most important issue in this supplemental  the shortsighted and political call for troop withdrawal   This bill includes similar language which was rejected by the Senate two weeks ago  It calls for the withdrawal of troops starting 120 days after passage of the bill and sets an arbitrary goal of full withdrawal from Iraq by March 31  2008   I voted against this language two weeks ago  I voted against it yesterday  and I will continue to vote against it  As I have stated repeatedly  I do not support micromanaging the war  It is counter productive and sends a detrimental message to our troops and emboldens our enemies  I want my colleagues to understand that without the United States military  Iraq would become a vacuum that would threaten the stability of the entire Middle East  I share the desire to have the Iraqis defend themselves  and our military is providing them with important training   But that can not happen based on an arbitrary deadline  I want to warn the other side of the aisle  if you try to force the American military out of Iraq  you will be responsible for the chaos that will ensue   Without the United States  Iraq would emerge as a training ground for al Qaeda and terrorist organizations  I believe the power vacuum would lead to genocide and murders far worse than the terror attacks in Iraq now   Without the United States  there would be a greater threat to Israel and Iran would become the dominant country in the Middle East   I want my colleagues to think about the path this troop withdrawal language takes us  I want to stand with the men and women serving in Iraq by supporting their mission  But  this bill does the opposite and undermines the military s ability to act  We need to listen to the commanders on the ground instead of pulling the rug out from underneath them  This supplemental is not a strategy for success  it is a recipe for defeat   And now is precisely the wrong time to send this message  I believe we may be turning a corner in Iraq   We are already seeing some successes based on recent reports from General Petraeus  Sectarian killings have been lower in Baghdad over the past several weeks and many Iraqi families are returning to their homes   Some of my colleagues would rather ignore these small signs and the opportunity to succeed in Iraq by pursuing a partisan  political agenda  This bill should be a commitment to General Petraeus and our soldiers  It should be a mandate for them to secure democracy in Iraq and protect America from terrorism  I rise to ask that my colleagues join me in opposing this bill  This may be the most important legislation we address all year  It is an opportunity to tell General Petraeus and our men and women in uniform that you support them  It is an opportunity to tell the people of Iraq that we will not cut and run and will not give in to political pressure  It is an opportunity to defend America from terrorism   This bill is a mistake that we can not afford and I urge my colleagues to vote against it  Thank you Mr  President                                                      March 2007 News Releases
