                                      Jim s Fall Newsletter           Fort Wright  KY   Thursday  November 29  2007  By  Jim Bunning   As the 1st session of the 110th Congress comes to a close  I want to give you a snapshot of what the Senate has been up to for the past year   As a United States Senator for nearly nine years  I have never seen anything like the current mismanagement of the legislative process by the Democrats  It is no wonder Congress has a record low approval rating  Only one of the twelve spending bills has been signed into law by the President  The last time this occurred was in 1987 when the Democrats controlled the House and Senate while Ronald Reagan was President  History has repeated itself  I believe in fiscal responsibility that does not bloat the budget with needless pork  Recently  a conservative taxpayer group gave me one of its highest ratings on supporting anti pork measures  Not all earmarks are bad  Some are vital projects that help the American people  The Democrats have included over 12 000 earmarks in the 2008 spending bills  An example of needless pork that Democrats were trying to push through was a  1 million earmark for the Woodstock Museum in upstate New York  We dont need to spend one million of your hard earned dollars to celebrate the groovy era of America  And we certainly dont need to borrow money from our grandchildren to celebrate Woodstock  Thankfully  under Republican pressure the earmark was voted out of the Labor Health and Human Services spending bill  While this Congress has been working on 12 000 earmarks for pet projects  the price of a barrel of oil is closely inching towards the century mark  In early October  I delivered a speech at the Kentucky Energy Summit  hosted by the Center of Applied Energy Research at the University of Kentucky  Like having a personal diversified stock portfolio  America needs diversified energy sources  In Lexington  I stressed that America needs to cure its addiction to foreign oil and invest in coal to liquid fuel  CTL   For the last two years I have been working with both Democrats and Republicans to push this important technology   Earlier this year  the United States Air Force successfully tested CTL fuel in a B 52 bomber  The CTL fuel performed better than conventional aviation fuel and can burn cleaner than other biofuels  This technology works  and if mass produced  will reduce our dependancy on foreign oil   Another important issue that Congress has failed to act on this year is immigration  Our nations immigration policy has daily consequences for our businesses  schools  communities  and our national security  It is an issue I hear about often from Kentuckians  and one I am glad people are watching closely   In October  I supported Senator Lindsey Grahams amendment to the Defense spending bill that would have appropriated  3 billion for border security  The amendment passed 95 1 in the Senate  but under Democrat pressure  the amendment was stripped out of the final bill that the President signed into law  I was shocked Democrats took out this important measure which was sorely needed to protect our southern border  not only from illegal immigrants but terrorists as well  When the Senate speaks nearly unanimously on an amendment related to our homeland  it should be adopted into law and not thrown into the trash  I am also closely monitoring the developments of our brave Americans fighting overseas  The current situation in Iraq has steadily improved under the stewardship of General David Petraeus  Overall Iraqi civilian and coalition troop deaths are on the decline  The surge that was outlined in February and fully implemented this summer is working  During the Muslim holy month of Ramadan  when an increase of violence usually occurs  casualties by terrorist activity were down 77 percent in Baghdad  That is great news  but it does not mean we are out of danger  We must keep at it  and let the Generals on the ground dictate troop movements  not politicians in Washington beholden to special interests   Democrats have pushed a total of sixty votes in both chambers of Congress to politicize the war in Iraq  It is a sad state of affairs to watch this overall assault both on the troops and the commanders on the ground by the likes of liberal groups such as Move On  If these groups are successful in swaying leaders in Washington  the outcome of the War on Terrorism would be disastrous and will make our homeland less safe  As we head into the holiday season  I want to remind Kentuckians of a couple of important dates that will help those men and women in uniform  December 4th is the deadline to send packages addressed to individual solders to both Iraq and Afghanistan  December 19th is the deadline to send packages to military personnel not in the war zone  These brave young men and women have fought valiantly to protect our freedoms here at home  If you can send a package  I am sure it will put a smile on a service members face  Our military families will also have a hard time with the coming holiday season  A seat at the table will be vacant  As a community  we must come together and help those families who are the backbone of our fighting men and women overseas   Finally  I wish all Kentuckians a Merry Christmas and hope you all have a great holiday season and a Happy New Year  God Bless                                                          November 2007 News Releases
