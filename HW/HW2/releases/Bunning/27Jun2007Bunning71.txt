                                      Bunning Immigration Senate Floor Speech           United States Senate     Wednesday  June 27  2007                  As Prepared For Delivery     Thank you  Mr  President     Here we go again  Three weeks ago a significant majority of the Senate rejected this flawed immigration bill and the flawed process that lead to it  But now it is back  It just wont go away     One of the key reasons the bill failed the first time around was the flawed process  or the lack of process  that led to the bill  In the Senate  an idea normally takes months if not years to become a bill and pass  But instead of letting the bill develop through a deliberative process  a few Senators wrote the bill in secret  They held no committee hearings  There was no committee report  In fact  Senators did not even see the actual bill until several days into the debate     When those of us who were not part of the secret negotiations finally saw the bill  we found all kinds of problems  But we were told the bill had to be finished by a certain date  We were not even allowed an open debate on the floor  The Senate prides itself on the rights of the individual Senator  but for this bill Senators were not even allowed to offer and get votes on amendments     And so  with a few days looming before the July 4th recess  the few negotiators got back together and blessed another list of amendments to get votes  Apparently they believe that twenty or so more votes equals a full debate  What a joke     As if that were not bad enough  the Majority Leader is taking an unprecedented step to shut off the rights of Senators to debate and amend a bill  That is not the Senate     Now  Mr  President  the process isnt the only thing thats flawed around here  The bill itself is flawed     In 1986  Congress passed an amnesty bill that was promised to be the last  And here we are 20 years later and the problem is worse  much worse     Instead of punishing illegal immigrants and employers who ignored the law  this bill is a get out of jail free pass  It gives those who broke the law their own V I P  line to green cards and citizenship     For this bill to work as promised  the government will have to process at least 12 million illegal immigrants in a matter of months  In this short timeframe  the government will have to conduct background checks  issue identification cards  and build a system to check every employee in America to make sure they are legal  The government will also have to implement new guest worker programs  eliminate the green card backlog  overhaul the green card system  and start issuing new visitor visas     But I do not believe it will work and the American people certainly do not believe it will work  I am not talking about the far left or the far right  I am talking about middle America  I am talking about the people that are stuck in lines outside passport offices waiting on the government so they can go on summer vacation  Are we supposed to believe that the same government that can not even get passports into their hands is going to complete background checks on 12 to 20 million illegal immigrants  give them secure I D  cards  check every employee in the United States to verify their work status  and secure the border  I dont think so     Unfortunately  this bill does not even secure the border  The 4 4 billion dollars included in the bill does not add any new border security  It only funds the trigger requirements of the bill  which does not even require implementation of existing law such as building 700 miles of border fence and 43 thousand detention spaces     There are other problems too  The bill does not require background checks to be completed on the illegal immigrants getting amnesty before they get their visas  The bill gives Social Security credits to illegal aliens for work they did illegally  Illegal aliens with terrorist connections can get amnesty  And  they do not have to pay all their back taxes or learn any English for at least 10 years  What a deal     The bottom line  Mr  President  is that this bill will not work  It is much worse than the status quo  Any chance of fixing it is being erased by the handful of negotiators and the Majority Leader  Instead of trying to fix the bill  the Majority Leader is using unprecedented tactics to ensure only a few blessed amendments get considered  We all have amendments  like the Senator from Texas  none of them will be considered  Mr  President  I will not support amnesty  I will not repeat the mistakes that were made 20 years ago  I will not be responsible for tens of millions more illegal immigrants coming to this country waiting for the next amnesty  I will not support this process or this bill     Thank you  Mr  President  and I thank the Senator from Alabama for yielding the time                                                      June 2007 News Releases
