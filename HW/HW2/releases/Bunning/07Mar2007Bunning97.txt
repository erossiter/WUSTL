                                      U S  Senators Jim Bunning and Debbie Stabenow Introduce Fair Currency Act Legislation aims to curb unfair practice of currency manipulation by foreign governments             Wednesday  March 7  2007  U S  Senators Jim Bunning  R KY  and Debbie Stabenow  D MI  today introduced legislation to stop the unfair trade practice known as currency manipulation that is currently taking place in countries like China  The Fair Currency Act of 2007  would provide U S  manufacturers with the legal means to fight back against those companies whose governments manipulate their currency  Co sponsors of the bill include Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Carl Levin  D MI   and Robert Casey  D PA    The United States Fair Currency Practices Act of 2007 removes subjectivity from determinations on currency valuation  injecting transparency and objectivity into this important process  Currently  there is no objective method for protecting American companies from countries such as China who cheat by devaluing their currency in an effort to artificially lower the cost of their exports  This practice creates an unfair trade advantage that makes it nearly impossible for American manufacturers to compete in the free market  The Fair Currency Act of 2007 would provide injured U S  companies that suffer due to the impact of undervalued currency with the ability to seek countervailing duties  a key enforcement tool to fight back against companies whose governments seek to create an artificial advantage   Senator Bunning  For too long American workers have suffered as a direct result of the unfair trade practices of countries like China and its time we act to protect the American businesses and the jobs of working families  said Bunning  I have worked hard in both the Banking and Finance Committees to analyze and address the unfair trade practice of currency manipulation and I believe this bill offers a viable solution to the problem by putting in place the tools and policies needed to level the playing field with our trading partners   Senator Stabenow  American manufacturers and workers can compete with anyone in the world when the playing field is level  said Stabenow  Its time for our government to hold countries like China accountable for currency manipulation and stop making our companies compete with one arm tired behind their backs  We need to make sure we have the tools we need to fight back when we are being cheated  and this bill will do just that   Senator Bayh  Lately  theres been too much talk and too little action on currency manipulation  especially on behalf of our workers and businesses who bear the brunt of the problem  said Bayh  Our legislation takes the politics out of the decision making process and ensures that this unfair trade practice is accurately identified and effectively addressed  Its time that the governments reaction to currency manipulation reflects the reality our workers and businesses face every day   Senator Snowe  From the mills of Maine to the hearths of the Heartland  the silence of our government on Chinas currency manipulation has become silence in our factories  This bill  with its myriad supporters in all fields of industry  is the collective voice of American business proclaiming that such inaction ends now  said Snowe  This legislation not only provides the government with the mandate to challenge Chinas trade distorting currency practices  but also provides the tools for U S  industry to ensure that the job is seen through   Senator Levin  Currency manipulation by foreign governments like China and Japan costs Americans jobs and hurts our economy  It is nothing short of a government subsidy that makes foreign exports artificially cheap and U S  products more expensive  said Sen  Levin  The Fair Currency Act of 2007 would give American companies and manufacturers the tools to fight back against unfair currency manipulation  It recognizes that American companies are not just competing against foreign companies but against entire foreign countries  and it puts our government squarely on their side   Senator Casey  Pennsylvanias manufacturing and steel workers need protection from those countries who receive an unfair trading advantage by manipulating their currency  said Casey  I am proud to be a cosponsor of this bipartisan bill which will give those manufacturing companies in Pennsylvania and around the country the legal means to fight back                                                      March 2007 News Releases
