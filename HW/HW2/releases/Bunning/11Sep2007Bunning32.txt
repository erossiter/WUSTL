                                      Watch Bunning Defend General Petraeus On The Floor Of The U S  Senate              Tuesday  September 11  2007        Senator Bunning greets General David Petraeus commander of our forces in Iraq      Senator Bunning greets General David Petraeus commander of our forces in Iraq   As Prepared For Delivery   Mr  President  I rise today to condemn the comments made by Democrats concerning our Commander in Iraq  General Petraeus  The vendetta against our military must stop   It sickens me to hear the comments some Democrats are making against General Petraeus   By attacking his character and reputation  these Democrats are attacking all of our men and women in the military   On behalf of all these proud men and women that sacrifice their lives every day for our nation  I am here to say that these actions and accusations have no place in the public discourse   Americans dont attack the character of those that risk their lives to protect us  The lies  deceit  and disinformation that Democrat propaganda machines are feeding to the American public must end   To suggest that our troops and General Petraeus are motivated by politics  rather than patriotism and love of country is wrong   It diminishes the sacrifice that each of them and their families have made in Iraq  Afghanistan and in other places around the world   These attacks are made by the some of the same people that voted on January 26th to unanimously confirm General Petraues   At this time I would like to submit for the Congressional Record Roll Call vote number 33   You will notice in this vote that not one Senator  not one  voted against him   During the debate on his confirmation no one questioned his integrity or ability to complete his mission  a mission the Senate gave him by confirming him  And now nearly nine months later  how do we greet him when hes come back to deliver a progress report on Iraq that was requested by the Democrat Congress   Instead of thanking him for his sacrifices and listening to him deliver his report  many Democrats that voted to confirm him are either attacking his personal character or not defending him from a personal smear campaign by their allies at Move On   And I cannot believe that this slanderous campaign started before they even heard one word of General Petraeus report   I read a quote from an anonymous Democrat Senator in the Politico newspaper this morning  I want to share it with this body today   This Democrat that did not want to give his or her name made the following statement   No one wants to call  Petraeus  a liar on national TV  The expectation is that the outside groups will do this for us  I dont even know where to begin in describing my disgust with that one  It shows that the attack on General Petraeus is a coordinated attack by Move On and its allies   Here is just some of what my Democratic colleagues have been saying   I dont think General Petraeus has an independent view   At the end of the day  these are not totally independent free agents  They are an appendage of the administration   The fact that there are questions about General Petraeus  report is not surprisingby the general s admission  the so called surge has not achieved its goal  I cant believe these false statements have been made on the floor   It is outrageous to condemn a unanimously confirmed General and question his patriotism for this country simply for politics sake   I know many of my friends on the other side of the aisle are good  decent people  But I have to say I am amazed that more of them have not denounced this smear campaign   The folks from Move On accuse General Petraeus of cooking the books  Is this because his counterinsurgency operations and the surge in Iraq are seeing positive results   Democrats are talking out of both sides of their mouths and its time for them to stop talking and start listening  Instead of taking political advice from left wing activist groups  Democrats should actually take the time to listen to General Petraeus report   I cannot tell you how disgusted I was to see the full page ad in yesterdays New York Times questioning the character of a four star general that only nine months ago had the support of this entire Senate   These tactics are insulting and should be condemned   In my book  the people that resort to this type of below the belt mudslinging are no patriots   I know General Petraeus  He is a friend of mine and a good friend of the Commonwealth of Kentucky from his days as Commander of the 101st Airborne Division   He is a brave patriot of the highest moral character and has made immeasurable sacrifices for our country   He has spent the past four years deployed from home  from his family and loved ones  overseas serving his country   Three of these years he has spent in Iraq where he has worked tirelessly to help build security and stability throughout the country   And his efforts are seeing positive results  To suggest that he is driven more by politics rather than by his love for our country may possibly be the lowest political attack I have seen in my time in Congress   In the four years that I have known him  not once did personal politics come up  I have no idea whether he is a Republican or a Democrat   In all of our discussions  including the hour I spent with him alone in my office before he left for Iraq to implement the surge  I do not believe the word Democrat or Republican was ever used   What I do know is that he is a great patriot   He does not deserve to come home to be greeted by personal political attacks   Especially by the very Democrats that asked him to come give us his report nine months ago   Let me be clear to my Democratic colleagues  using left wing attack groups like Move On to discredit General Petraeus is the worst of the worst   Any politicians willingness to sacrifice the long term security of the United States in an attempt to salvage a short term political career is beyond deplorable   I will not stand for it  Our military will not stand for it  And the American public will not stand for it   Just yesterday a poll in the New York Times reported that 68  of Americans trust military commanders more than the Democrat Congress when it comes to Iraq policy  The American public supports our military  its time for Congress to echo this support   Yesterday in my office I had the opportunity to sit down one on one with a brave young Kentuckian that had just returned from a long deployment in one of Iraqs hotspots   At the end of our visit he turned to me and made one request   He asked for Congress to support the troops  How can we expect General Petraeus and our troops to successfully complete their mission when we keep attacking them and threatening to cut off their funding   I promised this young man my support and will continue to do all that I can to support our troops   As we find our selves six years from the tragic events of the terrorist events that occurred on September 11th 2001  we must not forget that there are those out there that still wish us harm  The freedoms we enjoy today are protected by the brave men and women that serve in our Armed Forces  including General Petraeus and the young man I visited with in my office yesterday   To all of those who suggest that General Petraeus should be called General Betray Us I have a message for you   You are the ones betraying our troops and the American people  You are giving aid and comfort to our enemy  We used to try people that did this as traitors   Just five months ago the Senate Democratic Majority Leader was quoted as saying  no one wants us to succeed in Iraq more than Democrats   Well I say to my friend the Majority Leader  stand by your words  Lets focus on succeeding in Iraq and for once show a united support our troops   Every night my wife  Mary  and I take a minute of silence to pray for our troops and to pray for the safety and security of our nation   Maybe Democrats should take a moment of silence and stop criticizing our commanders and troops   Thank you Mr  President and I yield the floor                                                              September 2007 News Releases
