                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bunning Speech To The American Energy Security Summit          Alexandria  Virginia   Tuesday  April 17  2007  Thank you Governor Manchin and Executive Director Mathews  And Congressman Rahall  thank you for helping to lead the charge in the House of Representatives with Congressman Geoff Davis  I appreciate the invitation to be here today as we work to promote alternative energy technologies like coal to liquid fuel  The Southern States Energy Board has a bold plan for Americas energy future  Many of the ideas you have worked on were the foundation for the legislation I wrote  the Coal to Liquid Fuel Promotion Act  and introduced with Senator Barrack Obama during the last Congress   I think everyone in this room recognizes the benefits of alternative fuels  but we have been frustrated by the slow progress of commercializing these fuels  The challenge for America is to leverage the private investment required for these large  expensive plants   U S  investors remember the last time synthetic fuels were promoted in the 1970s  and remember the losses they took as oil prices collapsed in the 1980s  The scale of investment  uncertainty of oil prices  and complicated environmental permitting process have prevented the industry from taking root in the United States  Many of you are already familiar with my legislation but let me quickly go through the three main issues it addresses   First  this bill helps to pull together the investors and the billions of dollars needed to build a C T L  plant  It expands and enhances the Department of Energy loan guarantee program included in the Energy Policy Act we passed in 2005  It also provides a new program of matching loans to address funding shortages for front end engineering and design  The loans are capped at  20 million and must be matched dollar for dollar by non Federal money  Second  this legislation will fundamentally alter the economics of building C T L  plants It will expand the investment tax credit and expensing provisions enacted in the Energy Policy Act of 2005  providing a 20  tax credit valued at up to  200 million for each of the first 10 C T L  plants   It also extends the fuel excise tax credit that was passed in the last Highway Bill from 2009 to 2020  The current provision will expire long before the first plant is even operational   This extension will provide a meaningful timeframe for coal to liquid plants to benefit from the same tax incentives we offer renewable fuel and hydrogen fuel   Third  this bill provides the Department of Defense the funding to purchase  test  and integrate these fuels into the military  It also authorizes a study on coal to liquid fuel storage and inclusion in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve   As we work to pass these incentives  there are several pressing issues that we will have to address first  The most challenging of these is carbon emissions  I am proud to come from a coal state that has helped power the American economy for over a hundred years  Half of our nations electricity comes from coal  Without cheap energy from coal  Americans would pay much higher electric bills and our country would lose more manufacturing jobs and investment to foreign countries   But the coal industry recognizes not only their importance to the economy  but also their obligations to the environment  That is why we all agree the coal of the future will be clean coal  New technologies are under development that will reduce emissions and clean up the coal power process   I believe carbon capture and sequestration will be an important part of developing a domestic coal to liquid industry  Part of the attraction of a coal to liquid plant is that it is easier to capture carbon emissions compared to conventional coal plants   Just yesterday  the Energy Committee held a hearing on two pieces of legislation that I have cosponsored  one that would authorize a U S G S  mapping initiative of potential sequestration sites and the other would expand a D O E  regional demonstration program  Together  these bills will help prove the long term viability of sequestration   While I believe capture and sequestration should be part of the coal to liquid dialogue  I do not believe government mandates are the right course of action   It would be irresponsible for Congress to call for demonstration programs and mapping projects while at the same time asking for the government to mandate this technology  There are many issues we must address  such as long term monitoring and liability  before going down that road  I believe this technology has a bright future and I am happy to see it addressed during this conference   The other issue is how to pay for these tax incentives and planning loans  It is important to realize the budgetary realities of Washington this year  But I think we should all consider the cost of not acting  This year alone we will send  250 billion to foreign countries  mostly in the Middle East  just to buy oil  Imagine what we could have done here at home with the trillions of dollars we have spent on oil in the last few decades  We may be forced to make difficult choices in this years budget  but I will fight for the incentives needed for coal to liquid fuel   There is no room for politics in energy security  In the 110th Congress  Senator Obama and I will work hard with all of our colleagues to pass this important legislation  I know that Congressman Rahall and Congressman Davis will work to pass the companion bill in the House as well   Thank you very much for the invitation to be here today  Together  I believe we can ensure that clean  domestic coal to liquid fuel will become an important part of Americas plan for energy security
