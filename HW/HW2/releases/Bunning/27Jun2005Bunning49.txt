                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Senator Jim Bunning  s Senate Floor Statement On Guantanamo Bay             Monday  June 27  2005                  Mr  President  I rise to speak about our operations at Guantanamo Bay  There is so much information out there that is untrue  and it must be corrected      Yesterday  I went to Guantanamo with my colleagues   Senator Crapo and Senator Isakson  We went to see for ourselves what all the so called   fuss   is about down there  And we want to help set the record straight       While we were there  we also saw Senator Wyden and Senator Ben Nelson  I am sure they will tell you that they saw the same things we saw       Our soldiers assigned in Cuba are on an island within an island  The base is isolated from the rest of Cuba  And it is isolated from the rest of military   Our troops do not just drive off post to go watch a movie or go to the mall  All they have is on post   from shopping to entertainment to food   Many serving at Guantanamo leave their families behind  Some are national guard troops far away from home       It is a tough life  and they have a job that is mentally and physically challenging   As we toured the detention camps  our troops patrolled the buildings and open areas in full uniforms   In the afternoon  the temperatures reached the high 80s  And the humidity could not have gotten much worse       But those brave young men and women  stood guard over the detainees to keep them in line and protect them from other detainees   The weather and the sun are the last thing our troops are probably worrying about   The people they are guarding are terrorists  They are the worst of the worst  They are all dangerous        Many directly fought Americans on the battlefield   killing and wounding our soldiers  Yet our young men and women watch over these terrorists and provide for them   They do this despite the terrorists having taken up arms against fellow American service members  And the danger the terrorists pose to our military in Guantanamo is still real and enduring       While we were inspecting one of the detention facilities  the halls were filled with sounds of detainees beating on the metal doors of their cells and yelling at anyone who could hear   Weapons have been found in the detainees   cells and are often made from ordinary items they are provided       Our troops on the ground in Guantanamo are putting their lives on the line to protect and provide for terrorists   Yet some of my colleagues and other commentators suggest that these brave young men and women are the criminals   And when they make such outrageous statements  there are many in the media willing to repeat the accusations without bothering to check the facts for themselves       For example  almost any pictures seen of detainees at Guantanamo are from Camp Xray  Everyone is familiar with those pictures   They are the ones with men in orange suits living in open air cells made of chain link fencing      Well  Mr  President  I went to Camp Xray  Do you know what I saw   I saw weeds several feet high and plants growing all over the fencing   Do you know what I did not see  People  Camp Xray has been closed since 2002  It is no longer used   at all      But those images are the ones that continue to appear in print and on the news  It is no secret that Camp Xray is closed  But showing pictures of the new and improved facilities are not shown     I   want to talk about those new facilities  They have come a long way from concrete slabs surrounded by chain link fencing   I can not say I feel bad for any terrorist who had to spend a night in Camp Xray  But the new camps are significantly better  They offer the terrorists more privacy  space  and protection from the weather  They offer the terrorists areas for recreation  Some even have air conditioning and semi private showers       The newest facility is modeled after state of the art prisons in the United States and are fully air conditioned   New furniture is on the way  And an even newer facility is about to be built       But  Mr  President  I have not seen any of those camps I just described on the news  And I am hopeful that those in the media will help clear up this issue   But the real issue that goes to the heart of this debate is   are we serious about fighting terrorism or not       If we are  then the new detention facilities at Guantanamo will remain open until no more terrorists are plotting to harm innocent Americans   What goes on there is critical to our fight against terrorists and the war on terrorism       First and simplest  if the terrorists are locked up in Cuba  then they cannot kill Americans in Iraq or New York or Afghanistan or Kentucky   Those being held at Guantanamo are the worst of the worst of the terrorists we have captured   The military has decided that they are so dangerous that they must be moved half way around the world to keep them away from the battlefield   That is reason enough to keep Guantanamo open       There are bomb makers who are no longer making bombs because they are in Cuba   Terrorist training camp instructors are no longer teaching classes because they are being held next to a Caribbean beach  Others at Guantanamo were caught with heavy weapons  explosives  or anti aircraft missiles   But they will not get to use those weapons to kill Americans because we are holding them in the detention facilities       One person being held may very well be the intended 20th hijacker for September 11  But because he is locked in a cell in Cuba  he will not be able to fly a plane into a building anytime soon   I could describe many individuals held at Guantanamo and give reasons why they need to remain in our custody  But I will only mention a few more    12 to be exact       That is the number of those we know who have been released from Guantanamo and returned to the fight against coalition troops   Some have been killed  And some have been recaptured   But we must not miss the lesson that we are dealing with dangerous people who will stop at nothing to kill innocent Americans  But there is more to Guantanamo than just locking up terrorists       As important as keeping the terrorists from carrying out their evil plans  we are gaining valuable information from the detainees   Those terrorists are one of our greatest sources of information into terrorist operations  financing  and personnel       Some of them were very close to Osama Bin Laden at one time  Others were active in planning terrorist attacks   Still others worked on finance and personnel recruitment for terrorist groups  Just think of the wealth of information they have       The detainees can identify people involved in terrorist groups   They have helped us better understand the structure of the terrorist organizations   They know locations and transportation routes   They can validate information gathered on the battlefield   And to this day they continue to provide us with critical information in our fight against terrorism   And we are not gathering information from them in any inhumane way       I saw several interrogations  None of the terrorists were being beaten  There was no torture and they were not being starved   Throughout the entire detention camp  terrorists were given clothes and bedding   They are given Muslim prayer rugs and korans  There are arrows everywhere pointing them to Mecca   We even witnessed a prayer call announcing to the terrorists that it was time for them to turn to Mecca and pray       That  Mr  President  is a far cry from the repressive regimes that critics of Guantanamo have compared our military to   Did the Nazi  s respect the Jewish faith  Did Stalin and Pol Pot practice religious tolerance  Absolutely not   The detainees are being fed well  In fact  their meals often cost more than the meals served to our troops because of their cultural dietary restrictions       When Hitler imprisoned jews  he did not go to lengths to prepare them kosher meals that followed their faith   The military has constructed a hospital just for the detainees  While we were there  we saw a detainee being transported to the hospital for an examination   When needed  the terrorists have access to other doctors and medical facilities       If a specialist is needed  then one is brought in  In other words  we give terrorists the same medical care our troops get   Many get dental care and glasses for the first time in their lives  Others have been diagnosed with diseases or other medical issues and have received treatment       We have even given amputees new mechanical limbs  Again  I ask my colleagues  did Hitler and Pol Pot provide dental care to his prisoners before he killed them   And the terrorists are not being held without a review process       Each person brought to Guantanamo is reviewed to make sure they really are an enemy combatant   They are also periodically reviewed to make sure they still need to be held at Guantanamo  or if they should be moved elsewhere or even released       The detainees are even given a chance to explain their side of the story   International law does not require these combatants be given a review board   Our military is going out of its way to give these terrorists rights above and beyond the evil regimes the war  s critics have cited       After all  there were not review boards in the Gulags or the concentration camps   The Nazis did not care if their prisoners had taken up arms against Germany  they locked them up into slavery anyway       Anyone who compares our operations at Guantanamo to those ruthless killers is lying to the public and insulting our troops   No detainees at Guantanamo have died due to their treatment by our troops  None   Hitler murdered six million jews and caused the death of tens of millions more on the battlefield   Stalin had tens of millions killed  Pol Pot was responsible for the death of about one million in his   killing fields          Of course the detainees are not living in luxury   But these are dangerous killers we are talking about  They are terrorists   But we treat them with respect    which is much more than they have ever treated us   Conditions improve every day at Guantanamo  But as long as they are a danger to Americans  we must continue to hold them and gather information       We have a determined enemy that wants to do nothing but harm us  The only way to beat them is to stand stronger  fight longer  and not back down  What we are doing at Guantanamo is a key part of our fight   Those terrorists can not hurt us as long as they are locked up   They will continue to provide us with valuable intelligence  And we will continue to treat them with the dignity that they refuse to show us       Finally  Mr  President  I want to say thank you to all the brave men and women working for our freedom at Guantanamo and throughout the world   I am always impressed with the fine young americans in our military  and seeing them yesterday was no exception   I had the privilege of meeting a few soldiers from Kentucky while at Guantanamo   I cannot say their names due to security reasons and to ensure their future safety   They and others are all serving our country with honor  And I thank them and their families for their sacrifices       I yield the floor  Mr  President                                                      June 2005 News Releases
