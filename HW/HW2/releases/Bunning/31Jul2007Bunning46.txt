                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bunning Floor Speech on SCHIP          United States Senate     Tuesday  July 31  2007        As Prepared For Delivery  Mr  President  I would like to talk about the state childrens health insurance program  also known as SCHIP  A few weeks ago  the Finance Committee passed the Baucus bill to reauthorize this program   I did not support this bill in committee and will not be supporting it on the floor  Today  Id like to take a few minutes to explain my concerns with the Baucus bill  Id also like to talk about the SCHIP reauthorization bill I will be supporting this week and have helped craft over the past couple of months  the Kids First Act   This bill is a good piece of legislation that reauthorizes this important program in a fiscally sound way and keeps the focus of the program on low income children   I have significant concerns with the budget gimmicks used  the SCHIP provisions  and the tax increases in the Baucus bill  The budget gimmick used to fund the Baucus bill is irresponsible  jeopardizes coverage under the program  and basically guarantees another tax increase five years from now   Under the bill  SCHIP spending in 2012 reaches  16 billion   However the very next year  spending drops to  3 5 billion   While this strategy helps the drafters hide an additional  40 billion in spending  does any member of the Senate really think that SCHIP spending in 2013 will be  3 5 billion  Thats below the current spending level of  5 billion a year  Does any member really think well kick millions of kids off this program in 2013 to accommodate this lowered spending  Of course  the answer is no   That means Congress will have to come up with a significant amount of money to pay for the increased spending  which will likely mean reaching into the wallets of hard working Americans again   I also believe that SCHIP should be a program for low income children   When congress created the program in 1997  it was intended for children without health insurance who lived in families making less than 200  of the federal poverty limit   For 2007  200 percent of poverty is about  41 000 in income for a family of four   Not many people realize adults are covered under SCHIP   Most people rightly think this is a program only for children  since it is the State Childrens Health Insurance Program   Over the years  the Department of Health and Human Services has approved expansions to the program to allow states to cover these adults  These expansions shouldnt have been approved in the first place  and it is Congress responsibility in the reauthorization to reign in these abuses   While the Baucus bill at least ends coverage for childless adults currently on SCHIP  it still allows other adults  specifically parents  to stay on the program in certain states  And  any state that currently covers parents can keep adding new parents to their programs   The Kids First Act that I am supporting responsibly reauthorizes the SCHIP program and keeps the focus on low income children   This bill reauthorizes the program for five years at a cost of about  39 billion  This would still be a significant  but responsible  increase over spending in the first 10 years of the program   The bill would require states that want to cover children and pregnant women above 200  of the poverty level  or  41 000 for a family of four  to pay more from their state coffers to do so   The bill also takes steps to limit the number of adults on the SCHIP program   While we wouldnt require states to remove any adult currently on the program from their rolls  we would reimburse states at a lower amount for the childless adults and parents they currently have on their programs   Also  states couldnt add any new childless adults or parents to their SCHIP rolls   If they want to cover these individuals  then they need to do so under their state Medicaid programs   The Kids First Act also stops the Department of Health and Human Services from approving any more waivers or demonstration projects for states that want to cover parents or childless adults   The Kids First Act is a good proposal that I hope will get full consideration on the Senate floor   It keeps SCHIP focused on low income children  curtails states ability to add any new parents or childless adults to the program  and makes sense from a financial standpoint  Unfortunately  the Baucus bill falls short on these key points  Also  the tobacco tax in the Baucus bill is fundamentally unfair to my state and the surrounding states  The chart I have here illustrates the problem   It is compiled from data drawn from a CDC database on tobacco consumption and projections by Families USA concerning SCHIP spending  As you can see  the states in red will pay more in tobacco tax over five years than they are expected to receive in SCHIP grants  In my state  Kentuckians will pay  602 million more in tobacco tax than the state will receive in SCHIP money  Virginians will pay  576 million more  and citizens of Florida will pay  703 million more over five years   California  on the other hand  will benefit with  2 5 billion over the same period    net of any tobacco tax  This is simply unfair  The problem with the tax is that the money is coming from low income smokers in my state and all of the red states on this chart  and is going to pay for an extravagant expansion of SCHIP in California  New York  and Texas    the states depicted in green  This bill will also     without any doubt     add an enormous boost to black market tobacco smuggling and counterfeiting   The plan would be a tremendous gift to organized crime and the black market king pins who will profit handsomely from it in future years   There is plenty of past evidence of this  In 2002  for example  New York City increased its tobacco tax from 8 cents to  1 50 per pack   The citys revenue estimators predicted an additional  107 million in revenue  Instead  the tax brought in just  43 million   What is more  the tax increase on cigarettes cost the state over  600 million in tax revenue due to lower sales at convenience stores throughout New York State  An economist found that most of the reduction was due to smuggling  cross border sales  internet sales  and sales on Indian reservations   Even supporters of this bill acknowledge that the higher tax will have an impact on demand  It will reduce legal consumption of cigarettes   It is not likely to reduce total consumption     as the supporters of this bill say it will     because it will also increase smuggling   But legal consumption is what matters to us  because thats the only part that is taxed   The revenue estimate provided by the joint committee on taxation shows this   Revenue is projected to decline by about  700 million per year by the last year of the estimating window   Thats right  Revenue is expected to go down over time as the number of legal sales of tobacco products declines   Whatever its other problems  the tobacco tax is a poor foundation for SCHIP  We are matching a declining source of revenue with a growing federal program  This does not make fiscal sense  If we were honest  and truly wanted to fully fund SCHIP spending with a tobacco tax  the federal government would have to encourage people to smoke   Thats what this chart shows  The federal government would need an additional 22 4 million smokers by the year 2017   Of course  I dont support any such effort  but this highlights the budget gap that this bill is sure to create  The revenue for this program is going to have to come from more tax increases down the road  And we all say we oppose regressive taxes  But what are we considering today  A highly regressive tax  In fact  this tax is among the most regressive types of taxes we could consider   In my state  the impact on low income taxpayers will be compounded  It will hit low income Kentuckians  Kentucky tobacco farmers  and every citizen of the Commonwealth of Kentucky  Although there has been a dramatic decrease in the amount of tobacco farmers in my state due to the tobacco buyout  tobacco continues to play an important role in Kentuckys agricultural landscape   Tobacco barns and small plots of tobacco still dot the Kentucky landscape  Cash receipts for tobacco are projected to contribute between  300   350 million to Kentuckys economy this year   An increase in the excise tax on tobacco will drive down the demand for consumption  This will result in less tobacco being purchased from Kentucky tobacco farmers by manufacturers  both cigarette and non cigarette   It will most likely force the specialty growers in my state   Kentucky burley leaf and Kentucky Wisconsin leaf  out of business  These are small family farms in rural Kentucky that rely on the revenue for their crops   The money they get from tobacco pays their mortgage  puts their kids through school or allows them to keep farming  The CBO has estimated that the SCHIP proposal will result in a 5 6  reduction in demand for tobacco during its first year   This will most likely cause a  5 4 million reduction in payments to rural farmers in my state next year under the master settlement agreement  Some people will say theres nothing wrong with all this  because it will force some people to quit smoking and were using the money to help poor children   But  who gets credit for this supposed act of charity  This plan would take money from one group of poor people and give it to another   I urge my colleagues to oppose the Baucus SCHIP bill and support the Kids First Act  Thank you                                                       July 2007 News Releases
