                                      Statement By U S  Senator Jim Bunning On The Nomination Of Dr  Ben Bernanke To Be Chairman Of The Board Of Governors Of The Federal Reserve             Tuesday  January 31  2006                  Mr  President  I rise today in opposition to the nomination of Dr  Ben Bernanke to be Chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve   I  m not one who relishes opposing President Bush  s nominees or his policies   I have been supportive of the overwhelming majority of them   But I have opposed a nominee or two on a few occasions   And this is one of those rare occurrences      Dr  Bernanke has an impressive resume and career   He received a Bachelor of Arts in economics in 1975 from Harvard University   And from there he headed off to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology where he received a Ph D  in economics in 1979   He was assistant professor of economics in the graduate school of business at Stanford university from 1979 to 1983   He then became associate professor of economics at Stanford  s graduate school of business from 1983 to 1985     Dr  Bernanke then popped over to Princeton University where he became professor of economics and public affairs from 1985 to 1994   From 1994 to 1996 Dr  Bernanke was the Howard Harrison and Gabrielle Snyder Beck professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton   He then became chair of the economics department at Princeton until he was appointed to serve as a member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System by President Bush in 2002     Dr  Bernanke is currently Chairman of the President s Council of Economic Advisers  He has held this post since June of 2005   And of course along with this academic and employment resume   Dr  Bernanke has received many honors and fellowships along the way       He has also published many articles on a wide variety of economic issues   Articles relating to monetary policy  Inflation targeting  Macroeconomics  The central banking system   And a slew of other issues relating to economic and monetary topics and theories   This all sounds very impressive  And it is   It is an economics elitist  s resume dream  For some it can be a nightmare     I hope he does not hold too many of the ivory tower theories of academia for real world wisdom   I voted for Dr  Bernanke  s nomination to the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve in the Senate Banking Committee and on the Senate floor in 2002   I supported Dr  Bernanke to the Board of Governors at the Federal Reserve because of a private meeting we had      Over the years I have had some concerns about the Federal Reserve and the way it operates   One of my biggest concerns is that the Federal Open Market Committee   the F O M C    suffers from   group think      It seems to me that no one ever challenges the chairman  I rarely   if ever   witnessed or heard any of the Fed  s Governors publicly challenge or disagree with Chairman Alan Greenspan     Chairman Greenspan has done an admirable job during his tenure at the Federal Reserve  He had a very difficult task  Part of his job was to predict the future   However  I believe Chairman Greenspan has always erred on the side of raising rates   I am not alone with this opinion  History has shown that he has made mistakes in raising rates for too long   My problem is   that when he did that  the Governors did not raise their voices      Instead  they either bit their tongue out of fear that they would be castigated as not being a   team player      Or perhaps   what might be worse   is that they all agreed with each other and simply reinforced bad ideas   Diversity of thought and dissension is needed within the Federal Reserve     After all   the Chairman of the Federal Reserve and the Board of Governors essentially have the greatest power over shaping our economy   And the economy affects every American   I understand the argument that to have a F O M C  rife with dissension might not be the best for the markets   I hear the argument that it would affect the market  s stability and send Wall Street into a tizzy      Yes  overall it is important that the F O M C  speak with one voice  However  the pendulum can swing to far away from dissension   My fear is that the F O M C under Chairman Greenspan  has arguably suffered from   group think      And that the F O M C  has unintentionally become a rubber stamp for Chairman Greenspan s monetary policy recommendations   We need a F O M C  that is truly independent      It must be independent from the Congress and the Executive Branch   We cannot have a Fed that is influenced by the President   And we certainly know that the Fed doesn  t pay much attention to Congress   For the F O M C  to function properly   its members must challenge the Chairman   No Chairman should be able to dominate      There must be intellectual sparring so all committee members are heard and the F O M C  can come up with the best decision for our country   The F O M C  needs independent voices   Dr  Bernanke promised me he would be an independent voice as a member of the F O M C   He promised me he would stand up to the Chairman if he thought he was being rolled   Sadly  I have not seen very much evidence of that      I have not seen him ever vote against the Chairman  I have not seen him challenge the Chairman   As far as I can tell  they never had a major disagreement   As important as I think it is for a member of the F O M C  to be independent   it is more important that the Chairman be independent   A Fed Chairman must not give in to pressure from the executive branch      Monetary policy decisions must be made for the good of the country   and not for political considerations   When Dr  Bernanke was a Fed Governor  I did not witness him showing independence from the Chairman   During his tenure as a Fed Governor  there were 23 F O M C  votes taken   Not once did Dr  Bernanke vote against Chairman Greenspan   That is not independence  That is   group think        If he did not show independence as a Fed Governor  how can we be sure he will be independent as Chairman of the Federal Reserve   The pressure to go along for a quick political fix will be even greater   Will he stand up to the President   Will he stand up to the New York Times  The Washington Post  Wall Street   And the business and economy pundits in broadcast media   Or anyone else when they call for rate increases or decreases   I am not convinced he will  The past is prologue   I hope I am wrong      It is mainly for this reason that in 2005 I opposed his latest confirmation as Chairman of the President s Council of Economic Advisors   But I hope Dr  Bernanke proves to be a fine Chairman of the Federal Reserve   I hope he uses his vast knowledge of our economy to make the correct monetary policy decisions   I hope he gains the trust of Wall Street   much like the last two Chairmen      Dr  Bernanke has talked about bringing more transparency to the Fed  I hope he does this  And I hope he continues to be plainspoken   One other reason I oppose Dr  Bernanke is because he says that he will continue the policies of Chairman Greenspan   That does not sit well with me  I hope this is not completely true   I hope Dr  Bernanke refrains from talking about things that are outside of the purview of the Federal Reserve      One of my biggest problems with Chairman Greenspan was that he talked about everything under the sun   Tax policy  Trade deficits  Budgets  Fiscal policy  The nation  s oil patch   The Fed  s jurisdiction is monetary policy   But if you asked Chairman Greenspan about monetary policy   he would talk for five minutes without ever answering the question   But if you asked him something that had nothing to do with monetary policy   he was more than happy to give you a clear and coherent answer      Hopefully  Dr  Bernanke will be a different kind of Chairman in that respect   Hopefully he will talk only about monetary policy and not interfere with tax and fiscal policy   Those matters should be left to the legislative branch and other areas of the executive branch     Also  Chairman Greenspan  s problems were not just the fact that he talked outside the monetary policy arena   Yes   Chairman Greenspan  s tenure held relatively low inflation with a growing economy   However  his record on the economy came about from the creation of a record market bubble that ultimately popped   Then there was a housing bubble that led to an unbalanced economic recovery fueled by cash raised from soaring home prices   That resulted in record household debt and negative consumer savings rates      We also witnessed the endless bailouts of Chairman Greenspan   There was the 1997 Fed bailout of the Asian crisis   There was the long term capital management bailout in 1998   We had a financial crisis that the Fed got involved with in Mexico   And all this mixes in with a huge trade deficit and federal budget deficit   And then it is further affected by record energy prices which raise the cost of goods and services     After almost twenty years  Chairman Greenspan is now acknowledging some bad consequences of his decisions   He says that inflation may be creeping in   But Chairman Greenspan leaves with the knowledge that cleaning up the mess will fall to his apprentice   Dr  Bernanke      Yes  Dr  Bernanke has an impressive resume   But the question is whether or not he knows what is waiting for him around each economic corner   It is indeed ironic that Dr  Bernanke finds it vital to promote a continuation of the Greenspan policies   I hope this is not true  This would be disastrous   These policies have not been the best for our economy   I hope that Dr  Bernanke does not follow too closely in the footsteps of Chairman Greenspan in his approaches     But regardless  he just might inherit a mess from Chairman Greenspan that I hope he can clean up   I hope there is no damaging recession or financial crisis looming   And if there is  I hope Dr  Bernanke does not live up to his nickname of   Helicopter Ben    and throw the U S  mint  s printing presses into overdrive      I have no personal qualms with Dr  Bernanke   We simply differ on opinions   Mr  President  I do not relish opposing President Bush  s nominees   But regretfully  I must oppose the nomination of Dr  Ben Bernanke to be the Chairman of the Federal Reserve                                                      January 2006 News Releases
