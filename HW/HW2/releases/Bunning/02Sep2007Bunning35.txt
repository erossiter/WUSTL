                                       Rigged  Currency Skews Playing Field          Fort Wright  Kentucky    Sunday  September 2  2007  By  Senator Jim Bunning The    United States is among the key architects of the world trade regime that has enhanced our prosperity and brought new riches to the far corners of the globe  We can be proud of the role we have played as a nation  During the past 50 years  world trade has grown more than 14 times  it accounts for more than 26 percent of gross world product  and the    United States is the worlds largest exporter  The institutions we helped to form  principally the World Trade Organization  WTO   have singled out most hidden trade barriers  eliminating them or converting them into tariffs that are later reduced in successive rounds of trade negotiations   The problem  increasingly  is in the word most  While hidden trade barriers are supposed to be illegal under the WTO  there are significant exceptions   A number of our trading partners have found loopholes in the world trade regime that allow them to keep their markets closed to our goods and services  while we leave ours open  This may explain why the United States today has the largest current account deficit we have ever experienced  both in absolute terms  and as a percentage of our GDP  It was  760 billion in 2006   One apparent loophole that has generated a lot of attention in Congress recently is the currency loophole  By tightly controlling the use of foreign exchange in its economy  a country can maintain a fixed rate of exchange with a target export market  If it values its currency at less than fair market value  it can create both a strong subsidy for exporters and an effective non tariff barrier to trade  The architects of the world trade regime recognized that countries could manipulate currency to spur exports and protect its markets  but the only effective remedy for currency manipulation  under existing law  is diplomatic negotiation  We need to change that   Nearly everyone  except the government of China and those dependent on Chinas favor  will acknowledge that    China s currency the Yuan does not float freely against the dollar  According to experts at the Peterson Institute for International Economics     China has maintained a fixed rate of exchange that is about 40 percent below market rates  This can make it difficult for U S  companies to compete in other foreign markets where the    China price is the starting point for negotiations   This imbalance is making the ports of Shanghai  Shenzhen  and    Hong Kong the busiest in the world with the overwhelming global demand for Chinese goods  It is fueling hyperactive growth in the export focused regions of China and employing hundreds of millions of people  most of them in China but many here in the    United States as well  Slowly  consumers are beginning to recognize the hidden costs that come along with the low prices  but  in many cases  consumers dont know where their goods are coming from   As the Senate reconvenes this week  I am determined to keep pressure on Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson to address the currency problem  consistent with his past promises  It is not unreasonable to demand that our trading partners refrain from exploiting loopholes in our trade agreements  In fact  the world trade system will be stronger and more durable if treaty negotiators can depend on the fact that hard won  negotiated low tariffs will not be undermined  later  by currency manipulation   Addressing the trade imbalance is likely to improve bilateral relations  because trade is the greatest source of friction  This will enhance Chinas reputation here and curtail harmful speculation within China that the United States is trying to stifle    China s economic growth  It may also deter China from acting on irresponsible threats by some in    China to dump the  1 3 trillion in currency reserves that are the byproduct of its currency control efforts   If the Treasury Department does not take effective action to address currency manipulation in the fall  however  I have no doubt that Congress will act to limit Treasurys discretion and create an effective trade remedy for currency manipulation                                                               September 2007 News Releases
