                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bunning  s National Security Speech On The Senate Floor             Thursday  September 7  2006                  Mr  President  I rise today as we continue to discuss the issue of national security       Safety and security of the American people must be our government  s top priority and we must not lose sight of the threat that faces our nation       As we approach the anniversary of the attacks of September 11  2001  I want to remind all Americans that these were acts of war against the United States       Since then the United States and our Coalition partners have fought back   And despite what some might say  we have seen many successes       We have dismantled Al Qaeda  s terrorist networks in Afghanistan and helped a democratic government rise in its place   We are working with our allies to secure a united  stable and democratic Iraq   We have led an international campaign against terrorist financing    freezing over  1 5 billion in terrorist assets in the United States alone   Since September 11th there have been no terrorist acts on American soil   Our intelligence system has prevented 15 major terrorist plots that we know of and likely man other that are undisclosed   We have convicted over 261 defendants in terrorism related cases and charges more than 180 others       While we are continually working to make America safer  we still face serious threats from our enemies both at home and abroad       To win the war against the Islamic fascists we need an effective intelligence system that is lawful but also provides us with the necessary information to prevent attacks before they occur       Only last month we were once again reminded that there are people out there that want to kill us and what we stand for  Fortunately with the help of our British allies we were able to prevent the terrorists from killing innocent civilians       These threats are real   This War is real   And its outcome will determine the future of this country      This war is unlike any war that we have ever fought   It is both a battle of arms and a battle of ideas       This war of ideology is not an easy one and requires the advancement of freedom   I know that is often difficult to turn on the news and hear reports from Iraq and Afghanistan and question what type of effective democracy we have in place   Have we so quickly forgotten the image months ago of Iraqis waving their blue fingers in the air after they voted in the first free elections in their nation  s history   Have we forgotten the images of women and children sitting in classrooms in Afghanistan free to learn without the fear of persecution and execution       These are images that I will never forget   They are images of democracy at work       Just this morning we saw democracy at work when Coalition forces in Iraq handed over control of Iraq  s armed forces to the government of Iraq       Effective democracies do take time and hard work       They cannot be created overnight but in the end they combat the ideology of the Islamic fascists       These terrorists recognize this and because of it are willing to kill innocent people to stop the spread of freedom      I urge my colleague not to let them succeed in their efforts and to join me in maintaining a united front against the Islamic fascists as we press ahead with important national security legislation in the coming weeks       While we may disagree about different policies in our war against these terrorists  we must not lose sight of what is at stake for our country       We owe it to our future generations because the cost of failure is too great       I for one will not back down from this challenge and look forward to working with my colleagues on this matter       Thank you Mr  President and I yield the floor                                                      September 2006 News Releases
