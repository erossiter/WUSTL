                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Statement By U S  Senator Jim Bunning On The Nomination Of Judge Samuel Alito To Be Associate Justice To The United States Supreme Court          Floor of the United States Senate   Wednesday  January 25  2006                  Mr  President  I rise in support of Samuel Alito  s nomination to the U S  Supreme Court   Judge Alito is supremely qualified   He has a record of fairness and judicial restraint  He will do a fine job on the Supreme Court   And I will vote for his nomination and any procedural measures necessary to confirm him on the Senate floor       Confirmation of a Supreme Court Justice is one of the most important jobs we have as Senators  This will be the second Supreme Court nominee I will have considered since coming to the senate   I take this responsibility very seriously      I have spent time with Judge Alito  And I have studied his background and record   I closely followed his confirmation hearings in the Judiciary Committee  I can say without question that he should be confirmed     I don  t find myself agreeing with The Washington Post or The Louisville Courier Journal newspapers very often   But even those papers agree that Judge Alito should be confirmed   I first met Judge Alito this past fall   I did not know much about him when his nomination was announced by President Bush      I reserved judgment about his nomination until I had a chance to meet with him   From that meeting it became clear that I could support his nomination   And his performance at his confirmation hearing further solidified my support for his nomination      We are all familiar with the basics of Judge Alito  s background   He has been on the Third Circuit Court of Appeals for 15 years   He has participated in several thousand cases and written several hundred opinions   He attended top schools for both college and law school    Princeton and Yale     I gather all of my colleagues would agree that those things are important and impressive   but they do not alone qualify him for the job   Mr  President  there is a lot more to being qualified for the Supreme Court than pedigree and judicial experience   Judicial philosophy and one  s approach to judging and the law are most important      All these factors and more must be looked at and weighed before deciding if a nominee is qualified   I have done so and it is clear to me that Judge Alito should be confirmed   A good place to begin is with Judge Alito  s record on the Third Circuit      He has participated in over 3 000 cases and written over 300 opinions   His record in those cases shows that he is fair and impartial  And that he understands the law and the judicial process   His opinions are written clearly and provide clear guidance to the lower courts      Clarity is something we certainly need on the Supreme Court   The clarity and fairness of Judge Alito  s opinions speak well to his qualifications  But what speaks volumes is that his critics have been unable to find a single case he participated in to show that he is unqualified as a judge     That is not to say that his critics have not tried  But to use any case against him   critics have had to distort the record or confuse the issue  Judge Alito  s opponents are trying to stop his nomination   They are concerned he will be a vote for the rule of law and constitution  And not a judicial activist to their liking on the Supreme Court     The framers of the Constitution created a system of government where the peoples   voices are to be expressed through their elected representatives   All Senators and Representatives stand for election and are responsible to the people of their states or districts   The President is accountable to the entire nation and must face the people in every state  The Justices of the Supreme Court do not ever have to face voters     That is why the framers gave the legislative powers to the Congress  And that is why they gave the administrative powers to the President  We   who make policy decisions   are accountable to the voters   The Justices of the Supreme Court are not      At its simplest   that is what is meant by the rule of law  We are a nation of laws   starting with the most basic law  the Constitution   The Constitution spells out the roles of the branches of government   It sets out the role to the courts    which is to settle legal disputes between parties  and not to set national policy      The Supreme Court is also to be a last check on the legislative and executive branches when they clearly violate the Constitution   but not to override policy decisions when the Constitution is silent     Judge Alito has a demonstrate his record of respecting the rule of law and the will of the people through their elected representatives   That disturbs some who belong to this body   It bothers them to know that if Judge Alito and others like him are on the Supreme Court   then the steady advance of courts acting as a policy making branch of government will be halted      Judge Alito has shown respect for the rule of law throughout his career on the bench   and even before that when serving in the Reagan Administration   He understands that each branch of government has a unique role to play     And he understands that only two are accountable to the people   I take great comfort in Judge Alito  s understanding that there is a place in our system of government for policy making   and that the place is not the courts      Many of Judge Alito  s opponents view the courts as just another policy making branch of government   In other countries that may be true  But in the United States it is not   Our judges are insulated from public pressure and accountability   It is this way so that they can make impartial and fair judgments on cases   no matter how popular or unpopular the result      They are also insulated from the political process to prevent undue influence from Congress or the President  Does anyone here actually believe the framers of our Constitution insulated judges so they could enact policies without any political consequence      In fact  the framers rejected proposals to give the courts any policy making powers   But that is not good enough for some who oppose Judge Alito   They want judges who will make broad policy decrees from the bench   They want liberal judges who will rule by dictating policies that fail at the ballot box   They want activists judges  And Judge Alito is not an activist      Judge Alito will stand up to the activists on the Supreme Court and help make sure the court follows its proper and vital role   The confidence of the citizens in the courts is harmed when the courts overstep their bounds     Like Chief Justice Roberts  I am confident Judge Alito will only act within the Supreme Court  s proper role   And I am confident he will help restore the American peoples   faith in our court system     I press upon my colleagues to support this nomination  I will vote for Judge Alito and whatever measures and procedures necessary to ensure he gets a final vote  I am proud to support him      Mr  President  I yield the floor                                                      January 2006 News Releases
