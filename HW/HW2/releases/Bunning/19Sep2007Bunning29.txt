                                      Bunning Floor Statement Against The Webb Amendment           United States Senate     Wednesday  September 19  2007  By  Senator Jim Bunning        Mr  President  I rise today to voice my strong objection to the Webb amendment  I voted against this amendment when it was offered two months ago and I will vote against it again today   I will not support this slow bleed strategy from Iraq  It ties the hands of commanders  I cannot remember a time in history when the Congress of the United States has dictated to our Commanders on the ground how to conduct their mission to this extent   This is an extremely dangerous amendment   The junior senator from Virginia  would like for you to believe that it helps our troops and a vote in support of this amendment is a vote to support our troops   Wrong  Nothing can be further from the truth   This amendment would be a nightmare to execute  It says that a soldier must spend one day at home for every day the soldier is deployed  That may sound reasonable on its face  but anybody that knows how the military plans its missions knows it will be a logistical roadblock for our military planners   The problem is that when a unit returns from a deployment its personnel are often reassigned to other units and other assignments  Divisions  brigades  battalions  and units dont stay together forever  In a military of millions of people  there are a lot of people reassigned each day   This amendment would essentially require the Army and Marine Corps staffs to keep track of how long every servicemenber has spent in Iraq or Afghanistan  how long they have been at home  and how long their unit was deployed and how long it was home  This is absurd   This would mean pulling soldiers out of units scheduled to deploy if the service members did not have enough dwell time  This breaks up leadership and soldier teams  the formation of which is the purpose of the Army and Marine training system   Requiring the President to issue a certification to Congress to waive this requirement for every individual service member who might be affected by this is even more absurd  This amendment takes tools and flexibility away from our commanders on the ground like General Petraeus  That is why it is being offered today   Commanders make estimates about the forces they need based on assumptions about current and future threats  If a commander in Iraq or Afghanistan concluded that some event might require the deployment of additional forces to his theater  this amendment would restrict the units and personnel that could be sent   The junior senator from Virginia claims to be concerned for the welfare of our troops  Not one member of this body is opposed to troops getting rest after a long deployment  But we need to be equally concerned about the dangers our soldiers face when they do not have the necessary resources and reinforcements available to do their mission   This is the true purpose of this amendment  It cripples the ability of Secretary Gates  General Petraeus and our other commanders on the ground to accomplish their mission and forces a drawdown of our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan   I will not support this strategy out of Iraq  It puts troops in harms way restricting the resources and reserves they need to successfully accomplish their mission   This is not supporting our troops  It is wrong to cloak a troop pullout amendment in language that relates to troop rest  But that is exactly what this amendment does   This week I visited with two brave Kentuckians that recently served in Iraq  They came to see me to ask me to vote against the Webb amendment  These Kentuckians know the sacrifices that their fellow soldiers and their families make  They know and understand the importance of rest back home  They know the strain of war  They have experienced the heat of Iraq and the tragedy of knowing some of their fellow soldiers never made it home   But these two Kentuckians also know the intent of this amendment  They know why it was offered  And they dont want to tie the hands of the military so that we are forced to leave Iraq and Afghanistan before the mission is complete  Thats why they came from Lawrenceburg and Hebron Kentucky to ask me to oppose the Webb Amendment   It is not Congress role to mandate individual soldier or unit deployments  I know the Democrats like to try to micromanage war  but I am not the Commander in Chief and neither are any of my colleagues across the aisle  I want to remind everybody of this   If you want to truly support our troops then vote against this amendment  It was defeated two months ago on the Senate floor and I can only hope it will be defeated again today   Thank you Mr  President and I yield the floor                                                           September 2007 News Releases
