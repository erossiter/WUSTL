                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bunning Talks About SCHIP          United States Senate     Thursday  September 27  2007      As Prepared For Delivery   Mr  President  I would like to talk about the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  also known as SCHIP   Several weeks ago  the Senate debated a bill that would reauthorize this program  We are now debating a bill that looks very much like that last bill  I did not support the Senate passed bill and I cannot support this version presently on the floor   The tobacco tax funding mechanism is an irresponsible way to pay for childrens healthcare  The increased tax is fundamentally unfair to my state and the surrounding states   It takes a government program intended for low income kids     one that I support     and     by raising taxes     the bill expands it to cover middle income adults and illegal immigrants in other states  It redistributes income from low income smokers to states with the highest per capita incomes  It could be called Robin Hood in reverse  The chart I have here illustrates what this bill really does  It is compiled from data drawn from a CDC database on tobacco consumption and projections by Families USA concerning SCHIP spending  As you can see  the states in red will pay more in tobacco tax over five years than they will receive in SCHIP  In my state  Kentuckians will pay  602 million more in tobacco tax than they will receive in SCHIP money  Virginians will pay  576 million more  and citizens of Florida will pay  703 million more   California  on the other hand  will receive a net of benefit  2 5 billion  How is this fair  New taxes paid by low income smokers in my state will go to pay for an extravagant expansion of SCHIP in California  New York  and Texas    the states depicted in green  Many people predict that the new federal tobacco tax needed to pay for the expansion of SCHIP is likely to cause states to increase their own cigarette taxes  to avoid state revenue shortfalls  This will lead to artificially high cigarette prices that are an irresistible target for foreign cigarette counterfeiters and bootleggers here in the United States  There is new evidence of the absolute folly of this plan to increase tobacco taxes by over 150   We wont see the revenue projected  but you can be sure organized crime will profit from this situation  In August of this year  the New York Police Department and federal authorities found 600 thousand cartons of counterfeit cigarettes     made in China     in a warehouse in Queens  In the same raid  the N Y P D  found 125 thousand phony revenue stamps   The counterfeiters planned to use these phony stamps to evade taxes in Virginia  New York  and Kentucky  passing them off as real stamps so that the cigarettes can be sold in ordinary convenience stores   And  this was not an isolated incident  There are many other similar instances of fake cigarettes in the United States from countries such as China and Russia  If you are concerned about lead in toys made in China  you should also be concerned about this SCHIP bill  because it will almost certainly expose smokers  including some children  to the toxic substances in counterfeit Chinese and Russian cigarettes  According to an article last week in the New York Times  chemical studies of counterfeit cigarettes have shown that they contain high levels of lead  Unlike the lead paint on toys  this lead will almost certainly be consumed by smokers  It is much more dangerous  So much for improving health care   In addition to all its other problems  this new tax is a poor foundation for the proposed expansion of SCHIP  We are matching a declining source of revenue with a growing federal program  This does not make fiscal sense  If we were honest  and truly wanted to fully fund SCHIP spending with a tobacco tax  the federal government would have to encourage people to smoke   As a matter of fact  the federal government would possibly need an additional 22 4 million smokers by the year 2017 to pay for this bill   Expanding SCHIP to cover adults as well as kids will lead to even more tax increases in future years  because  no one will pay these tobacco taxes if smuggled cigarettes and cigarettes from internet websites are freely available  I also dont believe that this bill focuses on those that need health insurance the most  When richer families are made eligible for SCHIP  kids move from private coverage to government health care  In fact  the Congressional Budget Office tells us that this bill will result in 2 million children moving off of private coverage   It is absurd to me that children above the 300  poverty level will be added to this program  New York still has the possibility of covering families who make over  82 000 a year  These are families who pay AMT taxes  a tax which is supposed to only affect the wealthy  This expansion of the bill is a push for government funded national healthcare which is not the original intent of SCHIP   The way the bill is funded also should raise great concern in anyone that says they care about fiscal responsibility  The budget gimmick used to fund it is irresponsible  jeopardizes coverage under the program  and basically guarantees another tax increase five years from now   Under the bill  SCHIP spending from 2008 to 2012 totals over  27 billion  However  for 2013  spending drops to  2 3 billion and falls to negative amounts in each year after until 2017  representing projected cuts to the SCHIP program  So  what we have here is a ten year tax for a five year program  Does anyone really think well kick millions of kids off this program in 2013 to accommodate this lowered spending  Of course we wont  However  well have to find a new way to pay for it  If a private company ran its books like this  the CEO would be fired  if not end up in jail   Another stunning example of how this bill undermines the original purpose of SCHIP is that it makes it easier for illegal aliens to get health care intended for poor children  This bill guts existing protections put in place to stop illegal immigrants from getting taxpayer funded SCHIP and Medicaid benefits  Earlier this year we spent nearly a month debating immigration reform  Well this bill is a step backwards  and it sends the wrong message  More importantly  it takes money that is supposed to go to our poor children and gives it to immigrants who have come to this country illegally   Let me make it clear that I want to see the SCHIP program continue and I want to see it reauthorized  However  I want to see it done responsibly  This bill does not do that so I must oppose it and urge my colleagues to do the same
