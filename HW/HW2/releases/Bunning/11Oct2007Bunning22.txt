                                      Bunning Speaks On CTL At The University Of Kentucky           Lexington  Kentucky   Thursday  October 11  2007   As prepared for delivery   Good morning  Im very pleased to be with you all today at this important celebration   The Center for Applied Energy Research at the University of Kentucky has a long history of innovation and success  Researchers here have pioneered clean coal and coal to liquid technology and are the center of energy research in Kentucky   I am also happy to see so many important speakers here today  As youve already heard from Rocky Adkins  the commonwealth has engaged in this energy issue and is taking the steps necessary to help companies invest and hopefully put steel in the ground in Kentucky  I also see that Ken Nemeth of the Southern States Energy Board will share his pioneering vision for American energy independence   And you will get a firsthand account of the coal to liquid operations at the South African company SASOL   You have all heard me discuss the promise of coal to liquid technology before  so I will instead give you the latest update from Congress  As part of the Energy Policy Act of 2005  I helped pass the alternative fuel tax credit which provides a 51 cent a gallon tax credit for biomass  coal  and hydrogen fuels   The provision will expire in 2009   Last week  the Senate Finance Committee released the tax title of the upcoming farm bill   While it was full of incentives for renewable fuels  and many non farm technologies it had no mention of coal   The Finance Committee planned to extend the renewable fuel portion of the alternative fuel tax credit until 2010  but let the coal to liquid part expire in 2009  I found this unacceptable  Working with my colleagues  I was able to develop a compromise to extend the provision with the rest of the alternative fuel tax credit until December 2010   The issue with getting this extension was the environmental standard required for the tax incentive   I think that using Kentucky coal to create transportation fuel  and anything else that helps America ease its dependence on middle eastern oil  is a good thing to pursue  The only standard we need is that the fuel should be cleaner than existing fuels   Other people in Washington  however  oppose using more coal and hide behind their calls for more rigorous environmental standards  I have tried to convince my colleagues that coal technologies can and will be clean   To do so  I agreed to the requirement that coal to liquid plants capture 50  of their carbon emissions and capture 75  on the day the tax credit expires   While this standard may pose a technological challenge  it tells wall street that the federal government is serious about supporting coal to liquid technology  And as Wall Street begins to finance these plants  they are going to look to our domestic research leaders to address the environmental challenges of coal   I know that the men and women at the University of Kentucky will be ready to help them   The research you do here will help address these new challenges and also dispel the inaccurate information that is used by coal opponents  Many people unfamiliar with the industry believe the political attack ads from environmental groups and MoveOn org saying that coal to liquids will produce twice as much carbon emissions as conventional gasoline   This is not the case  While those ads reference theoretical plants that do not consider the environment at all  there is not an investor in the country that would build a  6 billion facility without an environmental plan   In fact  many of the companies designing plants in America today will co fire with biomass or use carbon capture technology to significantly reduce emissions   Looking at the possibilities of coal to liquid fuel  the cutting edge research here at the University of Kentucky  the needs of the military for secure  domestic fuels  and the actions in the Senate last week  I believe the time is now for coal to liquids   And with your help  Kentucky will be a pioneer of this technology  Thank you for having me here and enjoy the rest of the days conference   This is a very important issue for the future of the United States of America and your participation today shows your commitment to strengthening our nation   I also would like thank the Center for Applied Energy Research here at the University of Kentucky for all its hard work the past thirty years   Thank you
