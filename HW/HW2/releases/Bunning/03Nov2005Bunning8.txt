                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               BUNNING STATEMENT ON THE DEFICIT REDUCTION BILL          WASHINGTON  D C    Thursday  November 3  2005                  U S  Senator Jim Bunning today issued the following statement regarding S 1932 the Deficit Reduction Bill which passed the Senate by a vote of 52 47  Key provisions included in the bill will open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for energy exploration and increase funding in education for low income students        In passing this bill we have taken a great step forward in meeting some of the fiscal challenges facing our nation right now     said Bunning     This is a fiscally responsible bill that will rein in federal spending while recognizing important priorities like fully funding the President  s defense and homeland security requests and spending federal dollars wisely on hurricane relief           I am glad the Senate today kept the ANWR provision in the final bill   Once developed  ANWR will provide the United States with nearly 1 million barrels a day or 4 5 percent of today  s consumption for the next thirty years   This alone matches the oil that is imported by Saudi Arabia each and every day  It is estimated that ANWR could fuel the oil needs of Kentucky for the next 80 years        And by increasing the amount of federal student loan limits  Pell Grant aid  and grant aid to low income students this bill will help students receive an education   Education is key to America  s future and the provisions in this bill will help our low income students meet their educational goals by providing more than  13 billion in funding        I am also glad that this bill includes my provision that provides a new  one time screening benefit for abdominal aortic aneurysms under Medicare for eligible beneficiaries at risk of these aneurysms   These aneurysms occur when the aortic walls weaken and rupture   The survival rate is less than 15 percent  and approximately 15 000 people die from ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms annually   However  when detected before rupturing  AAAs are treatable and curable in 95 percent of cases                                                         November 2005 News Releases                                                                                     WASHINGTON  D C                  WASHINGTON  D C                  WASHINGTON  D C                     WASHINGTON  D C
