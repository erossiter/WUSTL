                                      Statement By Senator Jim Bunning On Immigration Reform             Thursday  April 6  2006                  Mr  President   I rise today to talk about immigration reform   Over the past week I have heard many of my colleagues describe the important contributions immigrants have made to American society and culture       Like my colleagues  I agree that the United States has a long and proud tradition of immigration   Immigrants have contributed in many ways to our nation since its birth   Many Americans are descendants of immigrants who came to America seeking a better life   Unfortunately  today we have a huge illegal immigration problem that threatens our national security and our economic security       I was recently contacted about this issue by a constituent of mine   She is a young Irish American woman whose parents emigrated from the Republic of Ireland to the Commonwealth of Kentucky over twenty years ago   When talking about her experience of immigrating to the United States  this young woman stressed to me what privilege immigration to our country truly is   She is right   Immigration is a privilege and not an entitlement       This distinct privilege of immigration is one that is unique to our great nation and one that is currently being threatened by the flow of illegal immigrants into our society   Like so many of my colleagues I would like to see this country  s tradition of immigration preserved   But it must be done in a way that does not reward those who broke the law and came to this country illegally       In looking at immigration reform  I believe that we must start with securing our borders to stop those who illegally try to enter the United States   Border security is the foundation upon which we must build our immigration reform   It is essential to our national security and we must make it our number one priority   We need to keep a close eye on who the people are that are entering this country and the purpose they have for coming here   And the only way to do that is to make sure that our border patrol agents and other law enforcement officials responsible for stopping illegal immigrants have the resources they need to protect our borders     Right now our border patrol agents do not have enough funds to secure our borders effectively   Often people have the ability to just walk across the border unguarded and without questions  We need to provide the border patrol agents with the best resources  the most up to date technology  and  most importantly  the manpower they need to successfully do their jobs       Just this past week the   F B I     busted a smuggling ring organized by the terrorist group Hezbollah   They had some of their members cross the Mexican border to carry out possible terrorist attacks inside the United States   Securing our borders is no longer an option   It is a necessity       It is essential to securing our nation  s safety  the safety of our citizens  and the safety of future American citizens  And we must also find a common sense solution to dealing with those individuals who are already here illegally   While there currently are several options on the table  I believe amnesty in any form is not an option   I was disappointed to see this in the Specter Amendment       We must find a solution that meets the needs of employers while also protecting American jobs   I think this could be done through some kind of program that would require illegal immigrants to return home to their country of origin after a set period of time       Once home  these workers could then apply to get on the path to come back here as a temporary resident and maybe even apply for citizenship   But in no way should amnesty for illegal immigrants be an option   And if these folks want to become citizens they need to go back to their countries and get in line behind the millions who have already been following the law and waiting patiently to enter the United States legally      No one should be allowed to   cut in line        As many of you know  Kentucky has a very proud and rich history in agriculture   From our tobacco farms  to our dairy farms  Kentucky  s economy relies on its agricultural industries   As someone who is from an agricultural state  I understand the need for temporary workers   Any guest worker program needs to be simple to use for both the employer and the employee   Employers must be provided with the proper tools to verify the immigration status of their employees       These tools need to be easy for our nation  s employers to access and to use   This is essential to any type of immigration reform and to our national security  We need to know who is being employed  where they came from  and how long they are allowed to stay   Congress must act on immigration reform   I hope that partisan politics do not prevent action on an issue that is so important to our nation      I would like to once again reflect back on the words of my Irish American constituent and urge my colleagues this week to help keep immigration a privilege of our great nation   I urge my colleagues to help put integrity back in the immigration process   While our country does have a rich tradition of immigration  we do not have a rich tradition of rewarding those who break our laws       I call on my colleagues this week to remember the principles that our great nation was founded on   While we always have been and still are a land of opportunity  we are also a nation of laws       Thank you Mr  President                                                      April 2006 News Releases
