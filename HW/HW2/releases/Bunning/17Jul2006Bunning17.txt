                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Statement On Stem Cell Research             Monday  July 17  2006                  Mr  President  I come to the floor today to speak on the three bills related to stem cell research     I believe that one of these bills is wrong  but I feel that the other two are worthy pieces of legislation   Stem cell research is a controversial issue in the medical  scientific  and religious communities  as well as here in congress       I am not opposed to stem cell research   However  I am 100 percent opposed to embryonic stem cell research   This is why I oppose H R  810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005   This bill would remove all current protections against the destructive use of embryos for harvesting stem cells       I firmly believe that it is wrong to take these sources of life and destroy them  even if it is for a benign purpose such as medical research   Current federal policy on stem cell research developed out of a compromise between proponents of research and those who endeavor to protect life at its earliest stages brokered by President Bush       This is the first administration to allow federal funding for embryonic stem cell research   Today  s policy allows federal funds to be used for embryonic stem cell lines that were already in existence prior to August 9  2001     As an opponent of the destruction of human embryos  I felt that the Bush Administration  s decision to allow some embryonic stem cell research was misguided       H R  810 goes even further than the current policy   It cancels the protection of the 2001 cut off for research by allowing research of all embryonic stem cells created from in vitro fertility treatments   This legislation would move us in the wrong direction on this issue     Some have said that these   excess    embryos that would be used for research would be destroyed anyway   However  I don  t think that this makes ethical sense   Just because these budding lives will not survive does not mean that we should ghoulishly conduct experiments on them       I believe that there is a disconnect between what many Americans believe about this issue and what the facts are   For one  we are debating the use of federal funds for embryonic stem cell research   We are not debating the legality of embryonic stem cell research   Any company or organization who wants to conduct or fund embryonic stem cell research may do so   I just don  t think that taxpayers should be forced to pay for it     Also  there are different kinds of stem cells   Adult stem cells  such as those derived from cord blood tissue  do not require the destruction of a human embryo   Why walk down such a dangerous ethical path when there is no need to do so     These adult stem cells have proven very effective in combating several serious conditions  such as diabetes and spinal cord injury  among others   This leads me to another point   We have seen the benefits that come from adult stem cell research   However  we have yet to see any tangible benefit from embryonic stem cell research       Many scientists agree that these kinds of stem cells might be able to help fight disease someday  but it has yet to happen   We are talking about ending human life when no lives have been saved yet   Who knows how many human embryos we  ll have to destroy before any tangible progress is made     That being said  I am pleased to see that the Senate is considering S  2754  the Alternative Pluripotent Stem Cell Therapies Enhancement Act   This bill could very well remove the most contentious issues of this debate       Embryonic stem cells are pluripotent  meaning that they could potentially have a wide variety of uses   It is this quality that drives the supporters of embryonic stem cell research to their position   However  great strides have been made in deriving pluripotent stem cells from sources that don  t destroy an embryo       S  2754 would authorize federal funds to conduct research on the creation of non embryonic pluri potent stem cells   If successful  we would be able to end this debate by finding a morally acceptable replacement for research involving human embryo destruction   I urge the Senate to adopt this measure     The final bill that the Senate is debating on this subject is S  3504  the Fetus Farming Prohibition Act   I fully support passage of this legislation   This bill would ban research from   fetal farms    where human embryos are implanted in a non human uterus   It would also ban embryos from human pregnancies created specifically for research     Most people would find these requirements to be self evident   However  some groups have said that this is unnecessary  because researchers already follow ethical guidelines that forbid this   That may be the case  but I believe we should take these ethical guidelines and give them the force of law to prevent the possibility of such gruesome methods from ever being used by researchers   I urge my colleagues to pass this bill     I do not like to see people with medical conditions suffer   However  I believe that many advocates of embryonic stem cell research are playing on the hopes and grief of many people whose lives are touched by illness       We are at an ethical crossroads with this issue  We must stay true to our values of respecting life   It seems foolish to stubbornly barrel ahead with federal funding for embryonic stem cell research when with a small bit of patience we can put aside the moral and ethical concerns and proceed down a path that we all agree on     In closing  I firmly believe that we cannot create life and then destroy it in order to save life       I urge my colleagues to vote against the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and to support S  2754 and S  3504                                                      July 2006 News Releases
