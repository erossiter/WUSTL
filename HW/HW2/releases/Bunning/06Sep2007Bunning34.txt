                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Bunning Fights For Taxpayer Money           United States Senate     Thursday  September 6  2007  By  Senator Jim Bunning As Prepared For Delivery   I rise to express my strong opposition to the Coleman Amendment   Number 2687  The amendment requires the use of emergency federal funds paid by taxpayers for security at the 2008 presidential political party conventions in Minneapolis and Denver   If the amendment passes  both the Republican and Democrat political party conventions will each receive  50 million in federal taxpayer dollars for state and local law enforcement costs associated with hosting the conventions  And the  50 million for the Minneapolis political convention is on top of the  12 5 million in federal funding that the state also will receive in the current version of the CJS Appropriations Bill   Spending  100 million in taxpayer funds for political conventions in Minneapolis and Denver is pretty outrageous to me   States that bid to host political conventions know that winning the bid also means a high cost for security comes with it   Sure the cost of security after September 11 has gone up  But the states that bid on the 2008 conventions knew that burden at the get go  Plus  the states will receive an enormous benefit from hosting the conventions  I have not heard one person say that the states or cities hosting these conventions will go bankrupt from them   One estimate shows that Minneapolis will receive more than  150 million from hosting the convention   Denver will likely receive a similar financial benefit  The millions of dollars in benefits is the main reason cities bid to host conventions in the first place  That is why every four years many cities bid to host each of the conventions   This windfall comes from the thousands of people staying at the hotels  eating at the restaurants  and shopping in the stores in Denver and Minneapolis  That will result in a lot of sales tax revenue and hotel tax revenue that will stay in each of those states   Paying for security definitely should not put the states in the red  So if the states are receiving this huge benefit why are taxpayers footing  100 million in federal funding for the political party conventions  And how did we determine that the figure of  50 million was needed for each state   Was thorough research done on what exactly will be needed for security in Minneapolis   What will be needed in Denver  Why has no member of this body made this case     At the 2004 convention  New York spent about  58 million in security  Will Minneapolis and Denver  which are not as big as New York  and not major port cities  need the same amount of funding   It seems like we are just throwing taxpayer money needlessly around without seriously looking at the situation  The legislation before us today provides over  109 billion for veterans and for military construction projects   This legislation is supposed to help support our troops who are risking their lives overseas and to help the veteran men and women who so bravely fought for our country  With this in mind  I ask why are we funding political conventions in this VA   Military Construction Appropriations Bill  What do political conventions have to do with the military   This is a combination of oil and water the Coleman Amendment is trying to put together that definitely does not mix  I also have extreme concerns with using emergency federal spending to pay for political party conventions   This to me is just a budget gimmick to get around the need to offset the funding  I feel like I keep saying this over and over but emergency spending should be only for just that  emergencies  Usually emergency funding goes to things like the Iraq War or victims of Katrina or other disasters   I think it should not go toward non emergency funding like the conventions  Come on  Everyone knew once the winning convention state bids were announced that security would have to be somehow funded   Holding conventions takes advanced planning from states and the political parties   All this does not add up to an emergency situation requiring federal emergency funds   The fiscal year 2008 Budget Resolution allows for a point of order against amendments like this that are not true emergency spending   It sets criteria for emergency spending which I do not think this amendment meets  Emergency spending must be only be used for essential  sudden and urgent matters that are unforeseen and not permanent    By my calculation this amendment only meets the temporary requirement and meets none of the other four requirements   But because I think an overwhelming majority of the Senate will vote for this amendment I will not raise the point of order against it  I have been to every Republican Convention since 1980  I want to make it clear that I think security is important for the Republican and Democrat Conventions   But my objection to this amendment concerns who should foot the bill for the security   And I believe those hosting the committees should provide that funding   That means those planning the conventions  and those benefitting from the conventions  in Denver and Minneapolis should pick up the security tab   Not federal taxpayers across the country   For all these reasons I oppose the Coleman amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same  This amendment will pass  but we need to reevaluate how we finance political conventions in the future   When cities make bids to host these conventions  they should also make preparations to pay for security  And include this information in the bid   This emergency funding method using federal taxpayer dollars for political conventions is not the best way to proceed and thats why I will oppose this amendment  Thank you Mr  President                                                       September 2007 News Releases
