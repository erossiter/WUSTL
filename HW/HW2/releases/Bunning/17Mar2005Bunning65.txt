                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Statement By U S  Senator Jim Bunning House Government Reform Hearing On Steroids And Major League Baseball             Thursday  March 17  2005                  Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I appreciate the opportunity to come here today and testify on this very important issue     As a member of the Hall of Fame  as someone who helped found the Players Association  and as a lifelong fan  protecting the integrity of our national pastime is a matter that is near and dear to my heart     Since the beginning of this scandal  I  ve said that baseball should get the chance to clean up its own mess and government should stay out of the way     With the new steroid testing policy  it looks like baseball has taken the first baby steps toward restoring honesty to the game   But if they backslide or don  t follow through  then the owners and players need to know that we can and will act     Mr  Chairman  thank goodness that I don  t have any personal experience with steroids   They weren  t around during my 17 years in the Major Leagues     But when players broke the rules or cheated      for sharpening spikes or corking a bat  or something worse      they were suspended     Since 1991 it has been illegal under federal law to possess or sell anabolic steroids without a prescription      Many steroidal dietary supplements  like Andro  were regulated as controlled substances by legislation that Congress passed last year     These substances have no place in baseball   And players who use them illegally are cheaters     Like I said before  I think the new policy that suspends players for steroid use is a baby step forward     Personally  I think the penalties are pretty puny   I  d like to see much stronger ones      one month suspension for a first offense  a year for the second and then three strikes and you  re out      Football has stronger penalties and  everyone agrees its program has worked     Players who break the law and cheat should be severely punished and their records and stats from when they used steroids should be wiped out     If baseball fails to fix this scandal  there are a lot of things we can do to get their attention      by amending the labor laws  repealing the outdated antitrust exemption that baseball alone enjoys  and shining the spotlight of public scrutiny     The last thing I want is for the national pastime to be the subject of a witch hunt   All of the players should be considered innocent until proven guilty     But we can  t let anything get swept under the rug either   It  s important we hear from the players themselves about the steroids in the game     We need to hear the truth   And I think hearings like the one your committee is holding today can be helpful in bringing the truth forward     The players and Major League Baseball must be held accountable for the integrity of the game   After all  it  s not their game   It  s ours   They  re just enjoying the privilege of playing it for a short time     What I think a many of today  s players don  t understand is that many others came before them  and even more will come after     And all of us have an obligation to protect the integrity of the greatest game ever invented     Now the game of baseball has been tarnished because some players didn  t follow the rules and thought they were bigger than the game     It  s disturbing to see that trend continuing today   Baseball has to follow the rules just like everyone else     If a player thinks they are above the law of the land and can defy a Congressional subpoena  they are sadly mistaken     They are not bigger than the game and they are not bigger than the law     The same goes for the owners   For over a decade  they turned their heads when it came to steroids   They helped put the game at risk     Not only did they turn a blind eye  they built smaller parks making it easier to hit home runs   The balls started flying farther   We have to ask why all of these things happened     Some in the press have talked about this hearing like it  s a lark   It isn  t   Congress is dead serious     We have every right to be concerned that the national pastime and all that it represents has been threatened by the selfish actions of a few     Baseball is part of our culture  our history   And it  s a multi billion dollar business that affects our economy and most of our largest communities     There  s no doubt that Congress has a direct and important interest in what happens in baseball     Finally  players can  t forget that like it or not they are role models   By using steroids  they  ve sent the wrong message to kids and the public     A 2003 CDC survey estimated that half a million high school kids had tried steroids     40 percent of 12th graders in a recent University of Michigan study said that steroids were   easy    to get     So it  s important that the American public understand just how harmful steroids can be to someone  s health     Side effects of steroid use include things like fatal liver cysts  liver cancer  blood clotting  hypertension  and can even lead to heart attack or stroke     Baseball has helped to open a Pandora  s box   Now it has a chance to fix that damage and educate  the public on the terrible health affects of steroids     Baseball needs to know that we are watching   And even more importantly  the fans are watching     Mr  Chairman  maybe I  m old fashioned   I remember when players didn  t get better as they got older   We all got worse   When I played with Hank Aaron and Willie Mays and Ted Williams  they didn  t put on forty pounds of bulk in their careers  and they didn  t hit more homers in their late thirties than they did in their late twenties     What  s happening now in baseball isn  t natural and it isn  t right   Baseball has to get its act together or else     So let  s see how they do   For now I will follow the proverb that President Reagan always quoted      trust but verify        I  m willing to trust baseball  but players and owners have a special responsibility to protect the game   And they owe it to all of us to prove that they are fixing this terrible problem   If not we will have to do it for them     Thank you again for giving me this opportunity to speak before your committee today     I  ll be happy to answer any questions you may have                                                      March 2005 News Releases
