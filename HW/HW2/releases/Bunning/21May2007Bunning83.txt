                                      Bunning Immigration Senate Floor Speech          U S  Senate Floor   Monday  May 21  2007  As prepared for delivery   Mr  President  I rise today to address some of the concerns I have about last weeks so called immigration compromise and the way it is being shoved through the Senate   Last weeks so called immigration agreement is not a compromise in the traditional sense of the word  The proposal was written in secret by a small group of Senators and the Administration  This bill may not be a compromise  but it is compromising to this countrys economy  national security  and very foundation as a democracy rooted in the rule of law   America is a democracy operating under the rule of law  Since the very beginning of the American experiment  people came from countries with corrupt governments   where the law only applies to some and can be bought by the highest bidder  They came to live where the government respects the individual and where the individual respects the law   In our recent history  we have seen an alarming increase in immigration from people who dont think they have to wait in line or play by our rules  Instead of punishing these people  a few Senators and the Administration have crafted a large scale get out of jail free pass  No matter what you call itX Y  or Z visathis bill will grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants   Me  my wife  our nine kids  and 35 grandkids are all descendants of immigrants  Mary and I have taught our family to be grateful for our nations rich tradition of immigration  but more importantly we have tried to instill in our family a deep respect for the rule of law  Appreciating the contributions that the immigrant brings to our nation does not mean we surrender the right of our nation and its citizens to decide who comes here   Like many people in the Commonwealth of Kentucky and all over this nation  I have serious concerns about an immigration policy that rewards lawbreakers  Is granting amnesty to those who were lucky enough to be born or get to one of our border countries  and enter our country illegally  fair to those potential immigrants who have been waiting in other parts of the world  What message does rewarding those who willfully break the law send to our nations young people  What message does it send to the rest of the world  Doesnt it make everyone who is trying to play by the rules feel foolish  More practically  how many people do you think are going to come over  Are you going to reward 5 million people for breaking the law  or will it be 10  or 20 million  Isnt it a distinct possibility that this bill will grant amnesty to those who came here only to do our nation harm  These are questions that I am willing to get serious about for the American people  but is anyone else   Today we are going to have a vote to move the process forward  Some things are clear  This bill will grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants  It also creates a massive new guest worker program for low skilled workers that does not truly limit costs to the system   What remains unclear is how much this great compromise will cost  The numbers are staggering   In 2004  there were about 4 5 million low skill immigrant households in the U S   about 5  of our population  And  that number has only gone up   Each of these households pays about  10 000 annually in taxes  That is less than almost every other American household  What is more alarming is how much they are receiving  Each of these households receives an average of  30 000 a year in immediate benefits  That means each low skilled amnesty household costs the American taxpayer nearly  20 000 each yeartwice what they are paying in   If we look at a break down in what they are receiving  thats  30 000 a year in Social Security  Medicare  transfer programs  cash  food  housing  social services  medical care  public education  and population based services like police and fire protection   30 000 seems like a pretty hefty welcome basket just for crossing our border   Most American families are tax payers during their working years and tax takers during retirement  Not the low skill amnesty family  The low skill amnesty household takes more from the government than it pays in at every level  Therefore  claims that we can save Social Security and other programs by importing young immigrant workers are simply myths   The most expensive group  of course  is the 65 and older crowd  They cost the American taxpayer  on average almost   32 000 per year  every year  If we consider only the illegals given amnesty  those costs will add up to over two trillion dollars  thats trillion with a T  over their lifetime  There are currently eight million non elderly adult immigrants in low skill households  Can you imagine the strain on Social Security when these people reach retirement age right at the moment that the program will be going into crisis  Add that on to a wildly expanding entitlement spending tab and an upcoming budget that stifles the economy by levying the largest tax increase ever on American businesses and taxpayers  and we ve left our kids and grandkids with quite a bill   These may be hard numbers for people to understand  but I would like to talk for a moment about who will be paying these bills  Look no further than your neighbor  Families that have two mid wage earners now fall into the top 40 percent of our nations wealthy according to the Internal Revenue Code  A recent study by the Tax Foundation found that these working families  the middle class  are carrying the weight of the nations tax burden on their backs  And  lets not forget about our small business owners  43 percent of people in the top 20 percent of the tax bracket have business income  meaning they are creating jobs and wealth in our economy  Can you imagine the effects that continued tax increases  which will be inevitable to fund this kind of amnesty program  will have on our middle class families and our economy  Is anyone willing to get serious about this for the American people   I dont know about my colleagues  but these numbers  over two trillion dollars  are pretty hard for me to comprehend  What is even more unbelievable is that no one is talking about them  In fact  the Senate is being asked to pass this incredibly expensive bill in just one week   How our nation chooses to deal with immigration is one of the most serious questions Congress must address  Our immigration policy directly affects our economy  communities  and the rule of law  It requires a thoughtful  thorough  and serious debate   But here we are  about to vote to proceed to the bill  and we have still not seen the new substitute amendment
