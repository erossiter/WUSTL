                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Statement by U S  Senator Jim Bunning Senate Commerce Committee Hearing On Steroids Legislation September 28  2005             Wednesday  September 28  2005                  First  I want to thank Chairman Stevens and Senator McCain for the opportunity to be a guest member for this hearing   Second  I    and probably most of the other members in congress    do not relish the situation we are in      That situation is being on the brink of possibly passing legislation to clean up something that the sports leagues and players  unions should be able to clean up on their own   But for whatever reason  you just cannot get your act together and get the job done      It is impressive and amazing what you all can do  You can come to agreements on collective bargaining and salaries    and aspects of free agency and trading  And a host of other issues   But for whatever reason  some of you just cannot strike a deal on testing and penalties for illegal drug use  And      I    and millions of fans    think that is pathetic       Since we cannot be in the clubhouse to try and get to the bottom of all this  we thought we would bring you into this committee room   We apologize for not having any showers in here  And Lord knows we all may need one after this hearing to cool down  because it just might get a little uncomfortable in here       My focus is going to be on baseball    not just because I once wore the uniform  but because that is where there seems to be the biggest problem  Baseball  s commissioner has put forward a drug testing and penalties proposal  While I am not 100  in agreement with it    it is a start       While I think the commissioner took too long to put forward his plan  I realize he had to deal with owners and build somewhat of a consensus with them  At times I am sure it was kind of like herding cats for the commissioner       But the baseball players  union has not exactly been timely and pro active in addressing the steroids issue  I know a bit about baseball  s players  union    because I and some of my former baseball colleagues helped start it  Yes  for the record    this conservative republican helped form a union  Back then  it was all about making sure players had fair salaries and fair pensions      These were important issues to help protect active players and retirees  But now   But now    whether it is true or not    the perception is that the baseball players  union is protecting players to use steroids and other illegal performance enhancing drugs       Believe me     that was not something we ever envisioned the players  union to do   And I hope it is not what the union is doing now   I see some of my fellow Hall of Famers here today  And thank goodness I spent part of my career in the American league    and did not have to pitch to Hank Aaron during my full career       I know they are concerned about steroids    and not just from how they affect the integrity of the game and the way they distort statistics and demean records   But we are concerned about the grave health affects of these drugs     and the message they send to our youth who see players as heroes and want to emulate them       Our kids see the smashing home runs  And they feel the pressure to perform   Unfortunately  too many of them are injecting themselves or popping a pill with false hopes and dangerous health effects  And we all have a duty in here to help bring that to an end      Thank you  Mr  Chairman                                                      September 2005 News Releases
