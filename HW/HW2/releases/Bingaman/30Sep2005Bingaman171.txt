SEN. BINGAMAN INTRODUCES MEASURE TO HELP LOW-INCOME ELDERLY NEW MEXICANS PAY MEDICARE PREMIUMS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today introduced a measure to renew a program that helps poor elderly and disabled Americans - including about 1,500 New Mexicans - pay their monthly Medicare premiums.  
   "Low-income seniors already have trouble meeting their basic needs of food and housing. Their difficulties are only compounded by the need for basic health care coverage," Bingaman said. "Congress recognized that these seniors need our help, and have been helping them defray the cost of their health care premiums. We must not abandon them by letting this initiative expire." 
   Bingaman's measure would permanently extend the initiative - called Qualified Individual Program (QI-1) - which helps seniors pay for their monthly premiums. The QI-1 program is set to expire today. 
   QI-1 pays the monthly Part B Medicare premium, which is currently set at $78.20 but will ruse to $88.50 in 2006. Medicare Part B covers outpatient services such as doctor visits, lab work, and preventive care including flu shots and cancer screenings. To qualify for coverage under the program, an individual's monthly income must be between 120 and 135 percent of the federal poverty level. That's $978-$1,097 for single seniors and $1304-$1464 for couples. 
  QI-1 was created as a 5-year initiative in 1997. Congress has since extended the program on a yearly basis. Bingaman's bill would make QI-1 permanent. 
   The QI-1 program currently helps more than 185,000 low-income older and disabled Americans pay their monthly Medicare premiums - though this covers only 20 percent of the eligible population, according to the Medicare Rights Center.
