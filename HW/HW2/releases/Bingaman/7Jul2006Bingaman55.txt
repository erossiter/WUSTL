SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RELEASES FUNDS FOR SECURE SCHOOLS PROGRAM
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the U.S. Department of Justice is releasing nearly $300,000 he secured for the Silver City School District's alternative school. 
   Bingaman visited the school in February and today he said he is glad he could secure funding for this important initiative. 
   "I met some of the students enrolled in this program and believe this is a very good learning environment for them," Bingaman said. 
   Funds will be used to combat juvenile delinquency, dropout prevention, and promote educational achievement. The amount of funds released today is $296,168.
