SEN. BINGAMAN SECURED FUNDS WILL HELP NEW MEXICANS GET TO AND FROM WORK
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is releasing a $2.12 million grant to help provide transportation services to New Mexicans.  
 Bingaman secured the funding in a fiscal year 2005 spending bill.
   The grant will be used to help fund the state's Job Access and Reverse Commuter (JARC) grant program. The Job Access program helps connect low-income persons to jobs by proving transportation services. The program also provides transportation services to suburban employment centers from urban, rural and other suburban locations.
   "Many New Mexicans rely on public transportation to get to and from work. I am pleased that the funding released today will make it possible for communities in our state to continue providing this important service," Bingaman said.
