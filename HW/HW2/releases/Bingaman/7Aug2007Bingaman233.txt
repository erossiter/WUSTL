SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO TO BENEFIT FROM CRIME PREVENTION GRANT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that New Mexico will benefit from a federal grant to help combat and prevent crime.  
   The New Mexico Children, Youth and Families Department (CYFD) has been awarded a $600,000 grant to support state and local delinquency prevention efforts and juvenile justice improvements. 
   "This funding is an investment in New Mexico's youth and I believe these resources will be a great benefit to our state," Bingaman said. 
   Funding can be used to support programs related to delinquency prevention, juvenile justice system improvement, research, evaluation, statistical analysis, and training and technical assistance.
