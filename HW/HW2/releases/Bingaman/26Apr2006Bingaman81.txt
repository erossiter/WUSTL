SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS IN AZTEC
  As Congress prepares to begin the process of writing the 12 appropriations bills that fund government agencies, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today outlined several of his fiscal year 2007 transportation spending priorities for New Mexico.  
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $3.5 million for a relief route to bypass the City of Aztec. Funding would be used for the construction of a two-lane paved road designed to provide an alternative route for large truck traffic. 
   "More than 9,000 vehicles, including heavy industrial traffic, travel through Aztec on a daily basis, creating safety hazards and significantly deteriorating its roads. The construction of a relief route would save commercial vehicles time and make Aztec streets safer," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is also seeking $2.2 million for improvements to Navajo Route 122 in Ramah. Funding would be used to pave the 13.6-mile school bus route that is currently unpaved. 
   "Repairing the wear and tear on school buses traveling on this unpaved road is becoming increasingly expensive and is taking much needed funds out of the classroom. Funding would be used to ensure children get to school safely," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is also seeking funding for the following project:
   * $4.1 million for Statewide Bus and Bus Facilities: Funding would be used for 45 buses and bus-related equipment and facilities to be used at the following: Angel Fire, Belen, Carlsbad, Clovis, Grant County, Hobbs, Pueblo of Laguna, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, NCI, Navajo Nation, Portales, Red River, Roswell, Taos, Zia Therapy, Zuni Zee Transit, Rio Arriba County, South Central COG, Grants/Milan/Cibola Transit, Care-A-Van, Sandoval County, and Tucumcari Housing Authority.
