SEN. BINGAMAN PRAISES JUSTICE O'CONNOR'S SERVICE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today praised Sandra Day O'Connor for her 24 years of service on the Supreme Court.
   "Sandra Day O'Connor made history when she was appointed to the Supreme Court in 1981, and for the last two decades she has served on the court with distinction. I commended her for her service, and I wish her a long and happy retirement. 
   "It is my hope that the White House works with the Senate to find a nominee of the same caliber as Sandra Day O'Connor."
