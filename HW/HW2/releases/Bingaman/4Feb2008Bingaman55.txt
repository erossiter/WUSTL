SEN. BINGAMAN NOMINATES SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO STUDENTS TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMIES
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced his nominees from southern New Mexico for admission to each of the nation's four military service academies.  
   Each year Bingaman selects students for nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy or the U.S. Naval Academy. The United States Service Academies are the country's premier officer training programs. 
   "We are very fortunate that so many outstanding young New Mexicans are willing to serve our country. I am proud to nominate these fine students for admission into our nation's military academies," Bingaman said. 
   The selection of nominees was based on the recommendations of Bingaman's Academy Nomination Review Board, which is made up of New Mexicans from around the state. The Board recommends candidates according to academic achievements, extracurricular activities and leadership potential. Each academy will make the final selection on admission in the coming months. 
   Among the students nominated by Bingaman to the service academies are: 
   UNITED STATES AIR FORCE ACADEMY 
  Thomas Hainline, Alamogordo Alamogordo High School
