SEN. BINGAMAN'S BIPARTISAN AMENDMENT TO RESTORE $15 BILLION TO MEDICAID WINS SENATE APPROVAL
  The Senate today approved (52-48) a provision authored by Sen.  
 Jeff Bingaman and Sen. Gordon Smith (R-OR) that would eliminate billions of dollars in cuts to Medicaid - the federal-state health care program that covers low-income individuals.  
   President Bush last month unveiled his fiscal year 2006 budget proposal that contained a devastating $60 billion cut to Medicaid over the next decade.
   The Senate is debating a FY 2006 budget blueprint that includes eliminating $15 billion in Medicaid funding for next year. The Bingaman-Smith amendment restores the $15 billion. The amendment also sets aside $1.5 million for a bipartisan blue ribbon panel that would give a comprehensive and thorough review of what is and is not working with Medicaid and would provide ideas on how to improve service delivery and quality in the most cost-effective way possible. 
   "Medicaid is the most important program that pays for health care coverage in New Mexico. There are over 400,000 people in our state who depend on this program and I am pleased that the Senate today recognized the importance of ensuring it is accurately funded," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman and Smith have introduced legislation in the Senate that would set up the bipartisan commission, which would have 14 months to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public. The Medicaid Commission would be comprised of 24 members that reflect all the stakeholders and components in the Medicaid program. That measure has been sent to the Senate Finance Committee. Bingaman and Smith are both members of that committee.
