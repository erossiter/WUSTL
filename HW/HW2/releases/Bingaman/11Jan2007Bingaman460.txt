SEN. BINGAMAN: FEMA APPROVES DISASTER AID FOR NAVAJO NATION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today was pleased to announce that the Navajo Nation has been declared eligible for Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) disaster aid for flooding that occurred as a result of sever storms this past summer.  
   The original request to include New Mexico Navajo Nation land in last summer's flood disaster declaration was denied. Bingaman this week wrote to FEMA officials and urged them to reconsider that decision. 
   "The Navajo Nation is in a particularly perilous position. The population is spread out over thousands of miles and communication is difficult if not impossible at times. The damage suffered during the flooding in 2006 had the effect of isolating many members of the Navajo Nation. Roads must be repaired in order to ensure that the population of the Navajo Nation has the ability to travel from their homes to Chapter houses and social and business gathering places," Bingaman wrote. 
   Today's decision means that the Nation is now eligible for "public assistance", federal funding to cover at least 75 percent of the cost to repair, replace, or restore publicly owned facilities and for "personal assistance", funding that can help homeowners and renters affected by the disaster with housing needs and cover necessary expenses. 
   "Heavy rain storms this past summer left many part of our state in dire need of assistance. On the Navajo Nation, damage to roads has left many with the inability to travel out side their communities. FEMA's decision to provide disaster aid to the Navajo Nation will make it possible for them to begin to repair much of the damage," Bingaman said. 
   Finally, under today's decision, the Nation is also now eligible to apply for Hazard Mitigation assistance to prevent or reduce long term risk to life and property from natural hazards.
