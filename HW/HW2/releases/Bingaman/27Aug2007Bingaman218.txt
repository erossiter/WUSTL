SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ALBERTO GONZALES
  "I did not support Alberto Gonzales' nomination because I thought it would be difficult for him to provide the strong, independent voice an Attorney General should, and unfortunately my concerns have been borne out. 
   It is my greatest hope that whoever the President nominates to replace him will restore the American people's confidence in the ability of the office of the Attorney General to provide impartial, non-political administration of justice."
