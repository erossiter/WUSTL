SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT HOUSING EFFORTS IN INDIAN COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that two New Mexico organizations will share a total of $1.6 million in grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, which helps meet the needs of low-income communities.  
   "Quality, affordable housing is out of reach for many people in our state. I am pleased the federal government is making this important investment in these two communities," Bingaman said. 
   Funds were awarded to the following pueblos: 
   * Laguna Housing Development and Management Enterprise $1.5 million 
   * Pueblo of Sandia $186,195 
   The ICDBG program aims to help with the development of viable Native American communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
