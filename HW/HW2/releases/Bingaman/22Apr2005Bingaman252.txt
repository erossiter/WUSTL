SEN. BINGAMAN'S POSITION ON 'NUCLEAR OPTION'
  Bingaman's Position on the "Nuclear Option":
   "The Senate has confirmed 205 out of 215 of President Bush's judicial nominees, and I have supported more than 90 percent of those candidates. We now have the lowest vacancy rate on the federal courts since the Reagan administration. That is not the kind of record that requires the extreme 'nuclear option' Senate Republicans would like to employ, sidestepping more than 200 years of Constitutional history," Bingaman said.
