SEN. BINGAMAN: INDIAN COUNTRY TO RECEIVE NEARLY $2.4 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that three Navajo communities will receive a total of $2.397 million for water and waste water projects.  
 The funding came from a special set aside Sen. Bingaman established for water and wastewater projects in Indian Country.
   Bingaman reported that the Ramah Navajo Chapter will receive $397,458 for water improvements, including a new well to provide drinking water to members of the Chapter. 
   The Smith Lake Chapter will receive $1 million to drill two new wells and to install new pumphouses and water line and power line extensions to support them. 
   And the Torreon/Star Lake Chapter, Ojo Encino will receive $1 million to construct up to three new wells, pumphouses, and to add water and power line extensions.
   "Having safe drinking water is a basic quality of life issue. These grants are important investments in New Mexico communities and they will make a big difference," Bingaman said.
