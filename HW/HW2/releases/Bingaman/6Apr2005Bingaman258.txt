SEN. BINGAMAN OUTLINES SPENDING PRIORITIES FOR HOLLOMAN, WHITE SANDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today outlined his fiscal year 2006 spending priorities for military construction projects at Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $15 million for construction and upgrades to fire stations at Holloman Air Force base. The base currently has only two fire stations and is in need of a third to meet the mandatory response time to aircraft emergencies in the north area of the base. The two exiting fire stations are in need of major repair and/or replacement of utility systems, walls, roofs, ceilings and floors. 
   "New Mexico's military instillations continue to play an important role in our country's national security. Investing in them to ensure that are in top shape continues to be one of my top priority," Bingaman said. "The funding I have requested for 2006 would help ensure that Holloman and White Sands Missile Range are in the best shape possible to carry out their important missions." 
   Bingaman is also requesting $16 million to provide White Sands Missile Range with a new vehicle maintenance/modification building, logistics warehouse, a support building and renovations to the existing Missile Assembly building. Additionally, funding would be used to will construct and make needed repairs to associated roads, tank rails, and staging areas at the base. The existing missile assembly building is currently housing administrative personnel. The building also contains lead and asbestose, which need to be removed. 
   Bingaman is also seeking funding for the following projects: 
   * $22 million for a Hazardous Cargo Pad and Taxiways at Holloman Air Force Base: This project will provide for the construction of a new hazardous cargo pad and new taxiway. Due to the summer temperatures and the altitude of Holloman, there is only one operational runway, which must be shut down during loading and unloading of hazardous materials. FY09.
   * $10.3 million for a Mobility Processing Center at Holloman Air Force Base: The Mobility Processing Center (MPC) will be an 11,700 SM pre-engineered metal building. Facility will provide an indoor area for cargo and passenger processing. The capacity for the troop holding area of the new MPC is 341 troops, over twice the current capacity. 
   * $8.3 million for a physical fitness center at WSMR: The current physical fitness facility at White Sands was constructed in 1956 and is badly in need of replacement. The structure is undersized, poorly ventilated, inadequately heated, and overcrowded during peak hours of operation. Records show an average of 806 military personnel and 3,224 military dependent/civilian visits per month. The physical fitness and morale of personnel assigned to White Sands Missile Range would be greatly improved by a modern fitness center.
