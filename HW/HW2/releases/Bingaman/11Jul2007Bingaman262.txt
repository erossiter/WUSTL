SEN. BINGAMAN THROWS SUPPORT BEHIND EFFORTS TO EXPAND DO?A ANA COUNTY FOREIGN TRADE ZONE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today threw his support behind a plan that would boost economic development in southern New Mexico.  
  Bingaman said he supports a Do?a Ana County proposal to expand the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) in the county. An FTZ is an area created by the federal government to provide expedited customs procedures to U.S.-based manufactures engaged in international trade. 
  The proposed expansion would extend the FTZ to incorporate an intermodal travel hub - a single location with various transportation options - south of its existing boundaries. Additionally, the proposal would situate a new part of the FTZ directly along the U.S.-Mexico border, adjacent to the Santa Teresa Port of Entry. 
  In a letter to the U.S. Department of Commerce, Bingaman expressed support for the plan and said it would be vital to economic growth in the region. 
  "The expansion of the Do?a Ana County FTZ will further cement the role of Santa Teresa, a fast-growing community and commercial center, as a major engine for economic growth in southern New Mexico," Bingaman wrote. "The incorporation of an intermodal travel hub and proximity to the state-of-the-art border crossing in Santa Teresa will encourage more companies to use the Do?a Ana County FTZ."
