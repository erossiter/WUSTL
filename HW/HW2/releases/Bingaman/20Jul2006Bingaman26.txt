SEN. BINGAMAN: SPENDING BILL CONTAINS MILLIONS FOR NEW MEXICO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS CLEARS ANOTHER HURDLE
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a spending bill that contains millions of dollars Sen. Jeff Bingaman requested for New Mexico transportation projects. 
   The fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation contains $1.5 million Bingaman requested for a bus facility in Grant County. Corre Caminos, the county's bus service provider, would use the funding to plan and construct a multi-modal terminal facility. The new facility will house administrative and operational staff and a secured facility to perform repairs and house vehicles. Corre Caminos is operating in its fifth year and also provides some services to Hidalgo and Luna Counties. 
   "Corre Caminos provides valuable bus service to many Grant County residents. I am pleased funding has been included in this bill to help them construct a facility to house their operations," Bingaman said.  
   Bingaman also said he was pleased the bill contained $400,000 he requested to help the City of Roswell replace five 21-passenger public transit buses and one 15-passenger transit van. The existing vehicles are all more than 14 years old. The cost to maintain these vehicles has risen to an unacceptable level. The cost of a bus is about $70,000 and the para-transit van about $50,000. 
   "This funding would help Roswell make an important investment in their public transportation and I hope it is included in the final version of the bill," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman secured funding for the following projects: 
   * $4.79 million for Albuquerque Bus and Bus Facilities: Authorizes the Albuquerque transit system to use the existing funding to acquire 6 articulated buses and for the construction of a Westside park and ride lot for the Coors Blvd. North-South Rapid Ride. * $1.5 million for Statewide Bus and Bus Facilities: Funding would be used for 45 buses and bus-related equipment and facilities to be used at the following: Angel Fire, Belen, Carlsbad, Clovis, Grant County, Hobbs, Pueblo of Laguna, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, NCI, Navajo Nation, Portales, Red River, Roswell, Taos, Zia Therapy, Zuni Zee Transit, Rio Arriba County, South Central COG, Grants/Milan/Cibola Transit, Care-A-Van, Sandoval County, and Tucumcari Housing Authority. 
   * $1 million RailRunner Commuter Rail: Funding will help extend service from Bernalillo to Santa Fe. Bingaman helped secured $500,000 for the project in fiscal year 2006. 
   The bill also includes funding for operations and equipment for the following public transit companies: 
   * $6.7 million - Albuquerque Ride 
   * $1.1 million - Las Cruces Roadrunner * $893,000 - Santa Fe Trails 
   * $514,000 - Farmington Red Apple 
   * $7.1 million - Statewide transit grants for rural areas 
   * $941,000 - State wide transit grants for elderly and disabled 
   In addition to this funding the following transit organization will receive funding Bingaman authorized in the SAFETEA-LU (Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act-Legacy for Users) bill that passed last year. 
   * Albuquerque Ride - $1.5 million 
   * Santa Fe Trails - $500,000 
   * Las Cruces RoadRunner Transit - $250,000 
   $117 million - Essential Air Service (EAS) Program: EAS makes it possible for commercial airlines to provide affordable and reliable service to smaller communities. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico's 5 EAS communities will benefit from the following: 
   * Alamogordo - $717,000 
   * Carlsbad - $599,000 
   * Clovis - $1.3 million 
   * Hobbs - $520,000 
   * Silver City - $1.4 million 
   Also, for the fourth year in a row the subcommittee included language Bingaman wrote that would ensure communities are not required to pay to maintain their commercial air service.
