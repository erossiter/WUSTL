SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the New Mexico Environment Department has been awarded $150,000 to conduct certain oversight of the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) in Carlsbad.
   The grant will help fund a New Mexico Environment Department Carlsbad field office, which would provide oversight of environment and other compliance agreements between the Department of Energy and the state of New Mexico.
   "The New Mexico Environment Department has a responsibility to monitor compliance agreements with WIPP and this funding will help accomplish that goal," Bingaman said.
