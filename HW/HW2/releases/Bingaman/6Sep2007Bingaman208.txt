SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP REPAIR RAINSTORM-DAMAGED ROADS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today confirmed that New Mexico will receive over $4 million in federal funds to help repair roads and highways damaged by heavy rain that caused flash flooding that occurred in July 2006.  
   Funding will be used to reimburse New Mexico for repairs to state and federal highways that were damaged as a result of the two heavy storms that hit parts of the state last summer. 
   "While rain is always welcomed in our state, last year's thunderstorms left many parts of our state with washed-out roads and other damage to New Mexico's transportation infrastructure. The funding released today will help with the repair work needed to get roads back in shape," Bingaman said. 
   Bellow is a list of the counties that will benefit from federal funds.
