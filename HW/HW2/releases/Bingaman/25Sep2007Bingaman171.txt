SEN. BINGAMAN: U.S. ARMY CORP OF ENGINEERS TO PROVIDE $2.77 MILLION FOR DEMING WATER/WASTEWATER PROJECT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will enter into a partnership cooperative agreement with the City of Deming for a water/wastewater project.  
   Under the agreement, the U.S. Army Corp will provide $2.77 million to upgrade the city's water and wastewater system. Increased growth in the area has put increased demand on the current system. 
   "Projects like this one are very costly, and I'm glad the federal government is pitching in to help Deming make the needed improvements to accommodate growth in the region," Bingaman said. 
   The City will install 42,500 linear feet of new 8" thru 15" PVC sanitary utility collection pipe, 98 concrete sanitary utility manholes, one 12' diameter by 18' deep sanitary utility lift station, and 42,500 linear feet of new 12" PVC water distribution pipe with associated fittings and connections. 
   The estimated total project cost is $3.693 million.
