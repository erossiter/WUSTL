SEN. BINGAMAN CONTINUES FIGHT TO KEEP RIO ARRIBA POST OFFICE OPEN
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the U.S. Postal Service (USPS) is looking into concerns he has raised over the closing of a postal facility in Truchas.  
   Bingaman is working to help keep Truchas' contract postal unit (CPU) open and ensure local residents continue to have access to postal services. CPU's are post offices operated by a contractor, typically in a store or other places of business. Because of a change in the payment system for CPUs, the current operator in Truchas is unlikely to renew the contract. 
   Earlier this week, Bingaman wrote to Postmaster General John Potter and urged him to work with the local community to final another facility to house postal services in Truchas. As a result, the USPS is revisiting the issue in Truchas and is looking for a new location. 
   Bingaman is also calling on the USPS to look into the new payment process for CPUs and the negative effects it is having, especially in rural areas. 
   "While I understand the requirement that the USPS operate as a financially self-sufficient entity I am concerned that the payment guidelines implemented by USPS are having a severely detrimental effect on rural postal service. Rural postal stations and CPUs are a vital link in communities throughout New Mexico and the country. I strongly urge you to reconsider the CPU payment process," Bingaman wrote. 
   "The loss of a postal facility can be a great burden for local residents, forcing residents to drive long distances for postal services. I am pleased the U.S. Postal Service is working to help ensure Truchas residents continue to have access to postal services," Bingaman said.
