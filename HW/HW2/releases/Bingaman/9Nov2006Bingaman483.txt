SEN. BINGAMAN HONORS NEW MEXICO VETERANS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman released the following statement in honor of Veterans Day:  
   "While I strongly believe it is very important to set aside this day each year to remember the sacrifices of the men and women in uniform who bravely serve our country, I also believe that we cannot allow ourselves to limit ourselves to thanking our veterans to just one day a year. We must work every day to repay the debt we owe our veterans and honor the commitment we made to them when they joined the military to protect the liberties our country holds most dear. 
   "We can do this by providing them accessible and more affordable healthcare, full payment of benefits, and real opportunities for education and employment success when they return from their noble service. We cannot allow such assistance to diminish in the face of mounting costs. I pledge that I will continue to work in the Senate to see veterans get the benefits they fully deserve."
