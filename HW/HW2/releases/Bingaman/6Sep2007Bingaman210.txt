SEN. BINGAMAN WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR LAB FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said he will continue working with the entire congressional delegation to ensure Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories will have the funding they need to carry out their important missions.  
   LANL officials today said they are closely examining the lab's budget, and taking into consideration possible workforce restructuring for the next fiscal year depending on the level of funding in next year's Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. 
   "We are working hard in the Senate to maintain the president's budget for the labs," Bingaman said. "I will continue working with the rest of the delegation to ensure that the labs receive the highest possible level of funding to support their critical mission needs."
