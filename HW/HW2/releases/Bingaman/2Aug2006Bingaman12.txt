SEN. BINGAMAN: TRIBAL COMMUNITIES AWARDED FUNDS TO HIRE POLICE OFFICERS, PURCHASE EQUIPMENT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that seven Native American police departments in New Mexico will receive $1.116 million in funding from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ).  
   "I am pleased the funding awarded today will help ensure that some of New Mexico's Indian communities have the resources they need to adequately staff and equip their police departments," Bingaman said. 
   The communities that will share the award, and the amounts granted, are as follows: 
   * Isleta Police Department $206,183 
   * Ramah Navajo Chapter $200,000 
   * Pueblo of Laguna $153,450 
   * Pojoaque Tribal Police Department $150,000 
   * Pueblo of Sandia $150,000 
   * Pueblo of Nambe $137,809 
   * Pueblo of Jemez $118,988 
   The grant was awarded through DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) under the Tribal Resources Grant Program (TRGP). Designed to enhance the law enforcement agencies in Native American communities, TRGP funds such items as salaries and benefits for new community policing officers, basic equipment, crime fighting technology systems, and training. 
   The DOJ's COPS program was created by the 1994 federal crime bill, which Bingaman supported.
