SEN. BINGAMAN NOMINATES SANTA ROSA STUDENT TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced his nominees from New Mexico for admission to each of the nation's four military service academies. 
   Among the students nominated by Bingaman to the service academies is Alyssa Flores from Santa Rosa. Flores attends Santa Rosa High School and is being nominated to the United States Air Force Academy. 
   Each year Bingaman selects students for nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy or the U.S. Naval Academy. The United States Military Service Academies are the country's premier officer training schools. 
   "Alyssa has demonstrated her commitment to her community and her education. I am pleased to recommend her for admission to the United States Air Force Academy," Bingaman said. 
   The selection of nominees was based on the recommendations of Bingaman's Academy Nomination Review Board, which is made up of New Mexicans from around the state. The Board recommends candidates according to academic achievements, extracurricular activities and leadership potential. Each academy will make the final selection on admission.
