SEN. BINGAMAN: EPA RELEASES $8.23 MILLION TO NEW MEXICO FOR DRINKING WATER UPGRADES, INCLUDING ARSENIC TREATMENT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said the Environmental Protection Agency is releasing more than $9.23 million for drinking water projects in New Mexico and compliance with drinking water safety standards.  
   Of that amount, $8.23 million will be used to fund low-interest loans for such projects as upgrades to treatment facilities and distribution systems, including treatment to remove arsenic. The state also will receive an additional $1 million to enforce drinking water regulations; the Navajo Nation also will receive $452,000 for that purpose. 
   "This funding will help New Mexico communities absorb the cost of meeting new, higher standards for drinking water," Bingaman said.
