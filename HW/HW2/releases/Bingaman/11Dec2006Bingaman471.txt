SEN. BINGAMAN, BIPARTISAN GROUP OF SENATORS RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT FDA PROCESS FOR APPROVING SALE OF CLONED MILK, MEAT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has joined several other senators in raising concerns about possible Food and Drug Administration (FDA) plans that could lead to the sale of meat and milk from cloned animals. The FDA has pointed to a handful of recent reports indicating that cloned and conventional cows appear to be biochemically identical in signifying a move quickly toward endorsing the marketing of cloned meat and milk.  
 But Bingaman says the FDA should go much more slowly and require more rigorous assessments before taking that action. In a letter to Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Michael Leavitt, Bingaman and other senators said the process for deciding whether to market cloned meat and milk should be much more public and should be subjected to more scientific peer review. FDA is a part of HHS. "Currently, an overwhelming majority of American consumer reject the idea of milk and meat produced from cloned animals. Years of surveying by the Gallup organization and the Pew Initiative on Food and Biochemistry, indicate that consumers oppose animal cloning and would not buy cloned meat and milk even of the government declared them safe. "Consumers deserve to feel confident in the Department's procedures, if it plans to determine the safety of this new food technology. More importantly peer review science is critical to ensure the public has all the facts." The following senators signed the letter: Patrick Leahy (D-VT), Norm Coleman (R-MN), Arlen Specter (R-PA), Herb Kohl (D-WI), Mike Crapo (R-ID), Dianne Feinstein (D-CA.)
