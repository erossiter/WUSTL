SEN. BINGAMAN: ALBUQUERQUE WHEELS MUSEUM TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that funding he requested for the WHEELS Museum of Transportation in Albuquerque is being released. 
   Bingaman strongly supported the $223,673 in the 2004 appropriations bill that funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. Funds will be used for land acquisition and planning.
   "Transportation has played an important role in the development and growth of the Duke City. This museum will house the history of transportation in New Mexico's largest city and I am pleased that the federal government is pitching in to make this possible," Bingaman said.
   The museum will feature a range of exhibits all related to transportation, including wagon, rail, automobiles, and racecars. It will be located in a historic building on the site of the old Santa Fe Railroad Locomotive Shops. The site, on the south side of downtown Albuquerque, is at the crossroads of the historic Camino Real and Route 66-both national scenic byways. 
   Bingaman helped secure $300,000 for the project in 1999.
