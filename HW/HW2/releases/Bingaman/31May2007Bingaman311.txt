SEN. BINGAMAN: GREAT LAKES WILL CONTINUE TO SERVE CLOVIS AND SILVER CITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Clovis and Silver City will be served by Great Lakes Airlines. 
   Great Lakes will provide 12 non-stop roundtrips per week from both cities to Albuquerque with a twin-turboprop, Beechcraft 1900D pressurized 19-passenger airliners. 
   The airline service for each community will be subsidized with $1.18 million per year through the Essential Air Service program administered by the U.S. Department of Transportation. In March, Bingaman called on Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters to withdraw the department's decision to award a new two-year contract that switched Clovis' air service to Denver and Silver City's to Phoenix. The communities would prefer to keep service to Albuquerque. 
   In April, DOT withdrew the contract award and asked for new proposals from airlines interested in provided service to Albuquerque. Bingaman strongly supported the new application submitted by Great Lakes to serve Clovis and Silver City, using Albuquerque as the hub. Peters contacted Bingaman today to say DOT has accepted that application. 
   "This is very good news for Clovis and Silver City. Commercial airline service plays a major role in a community's ability to attract and retain jobs," Bingaman said. "It makes sense to provide airline service from these communities to New Mexico's largest city."
