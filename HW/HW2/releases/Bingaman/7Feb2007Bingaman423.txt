SEN. BINGAMAN CONCERNED ABOUT DOE'S LACK OF COMMITMENT TO BRINGING BIOFUELS TO MARKET
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is disappointed that the Department of Energy has focused too little of its effort and too few resources to helping bring biofuels to consumers.  
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, one of Bingaman's main goals is to make the country more energy independent. One way to do that is to ensure that there is a ready access to biofuels - renewable fuel made from corn, soybeans and the like. 
   The Energy Policy Act of 2005, which Bingaman helped write, contains a program that provides loan guarantees for companies that want to construct plants to make biofuels and other renewable energy sources. A loan guarantee is when the government agrees to pay a lender if the energy project defaults. 
   Bingaman is concerned that the Department of Energy is dragging its feet in setting up the loan guarantee program. At a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing today, Bingaman urged Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman to move quickly to begin offering loan guarantees. 
   "Everyone agrees that we need to take bold steps to reduce our dependence on foreign sources of fuel. But renewable energies like biofuels are just emerging, and getting them to market will require some help. One way we can do that is to provide loan guarantees that will make it easier to get biofuel plants, and other renewable energy plants, built in our country," Bingaman said. 
   "I'm disappointed that the DOE appears to be putting far too little energy into getting the loan guarantee program up and running. I urge Secretary Bodman to make the loan guarantee program a priority for the department," Bingaman said.
