SEN. BINGAMAN: NATION MUST DEVELOP ROADMAP FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE
  At a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing today on Capitol Hill, Sen. Jeff Bingaman said it is crucial to develop a bold plan for reducing our nation's dependence. 
   Bingaman pointed out that nearly 70 percent of oil consumption in the United States used in the transportation sector, which will require us to look at fuel conservation and efficiency.
   "We consume nearly 12 million barrels of oil per day in the transportation sector. There is no way to meaningfully address our dependence on foreign oil unless we reduce the amount of oil needed to fuel our society," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman strongly supported a measure that would have improved transportation efficiency, but there were not enough votes to add that provision to the energy bill enacted last year.
   Bingaman said he hopes today's hearing - which featured R. James Woolsey Vice President Booz Allen Hamilton and Susan M. Cischke Vice President, Environmental and Safety Engineering - will help spur Congress and the Bush administration to come up with a concrete plan for achieving energy independence.
