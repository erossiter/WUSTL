SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICAN REAPPOINTED TO NATIONAL DAIRY BOARD
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announce that Jose L. (Joe) Gonzalez of Mesquite has been appointed to a second term on the National Dairy Promotion and Research Board. He will serve another three-year term from November 1, 2007, through October 31, 2010.  
   The National Dairy Promotion and Research Board is composed of 36 farmers representing 13 regions in the United States. The board administers a coordinated program of promotion, research and nutrition education to increase demand for the U.S.-produced dairy products. 
   "Joe Gonzalez brings New Mexico's unique perspective to the National Daily Board," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that Secretary Johanns has agreed to extend Joe's service on this important board." 
   Bingaman strongly supported Gonzalez for the post and wrote a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns in support of his reappointment. 
   Gonzalez has over 40 years of experience in the dairy industry and is currently the President of Gonzalez Dairy, Inc. and Gonzalez Family Dairy, LLC. He also serves as Vice President of the Dairy Producers of New Mexico and First Vice President of DairyMAX. 
   With more than 7.6 billion pounds of milk produced in 2006, New Mexico was ranked as the 7th largest dairy producing state in the country. With the opening of Southwest Cheese in Clovis it ranks 6th in cheese production.
