SEN. BINGAMAN: ALBUQUERQUE GROUP AWARDED $2.85 MILLION TO AID VICTIMS OF CRIME
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparations Commission $2.856 million to assist victims of crime. 
   The New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission provides grants to organizations throughout the state to enhance, expand, and develop new programs to serve victims of crime. These services include counseling, providing shelter, assistance in filing compensation applications, crisis intervention services, assistance in court proceedings, and assistance in filing elderly abuse petitions or restraint orders.
   "Violent crime can have a devastating effect on the victim and their families. This funding for the state will help provide some of the financial assistance to those who need it," Bingaman said.
   The grant comes from DOJ's Crime Victims Fund, which collects federal fines, penalty assessments, and forfeited appearance bonds and uses them to compensate victims of crime. 
   President Bush's fiscal year 2007 budget request seeks to eliminate the Crime Victims Trust Fund's current balance of $1.3 billion.
