SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS IN CELEBRATING CURRY COUNTY TRANSPORTATION PROJECT RIBBON CUTTING
  Sens. Jeff Bingaman joined in celebrating the ribbon cutting of the NM 467 overpass improvement project. 
   "The completion of this important transportation project will help ensure that people in need of emergency care are able to reach the hospital without being delayed by passing trains and will also create an alternative route for traffic going to and from the cheese plant," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman helped secure $1 million for the overpass at NM 467 Highway over the Burlington Northern and Santa Fe Railroad needed to ensure the health and safety of citizens in the southwest areas of Clovis and Curry County due to the high frequency of trains blocking access to Plains Regional Medical Center.
