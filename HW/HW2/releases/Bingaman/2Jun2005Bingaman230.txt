SEN. BINGAMAN SECURED FUNDS RELEASED TO LA FAMILIA MEDICAL CENTER IN SANTA FE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that La Familia Medical Center in Santa Fe has been awarded a $497,759 grant by the federal government. Sen.  
 Bingaman helped secure the funding in a fiscal year 2005 spending bill. 
   "La Familia Medical Center provides essential primary care services to low-income individuals who lack health insurance. I am pleased the funding being released today will help the center expand its services to help treat more people" Bingaman said.
   Funding will be used to help construct a 5,500 square-foot addition and to renovate the existing structure of the Alto Street Clinic of La Familia Medical Center in Santa Fe. This expansion, including seven new exam rooms and three new dental operatories, is needed to address the 55 percent increase in the number of patients served by La Familia Medical Center since 1999 and to address the needs of a patient population that is nearly 70 percent uninsured. 
   The funding announced today was provided through the Department of Health and Human Services. Bingaman is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees that department.
