SEN. BINGAMAN MEASURE WOULD HELP FIGHT CRIME ASSOCIATED WITH LACK OF BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has introduced an amendment to the immigration bill that would help law enforcement agencies along the border tackle crime associated with the lack of adequate border security. 
   Bingaman's amendment, based on stand-alone legislation he introduced last year, would provide up to $50 million in grant funding to border law enforcement agencies within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border to hire additional personnel, purchase equipment, and/or to cover overtime and transportation costs.
   "Border law enforcement agencies incur significant expenses in dealing with crimes, such as human smuggling, vehicle thefts, drug trafficking, and the destruction of private property, due to their proximity to an international border and the failure of the federal government to adequately secure its borders," Bingaman said. "This grant funding would help them cover those costs." 
   U.S. Senator Pete Domenici is a cosponsor of the Bingaman measure, which could be voted on a soon as Monday. 
   "Because our borders have been essentially porous, local law enforcement in the border region must often deal with illegal activities related to the border. This amendment is a means for establishing a system for compensating these local agencies," said Domenici, who last November introduced a stand-alone border security bill that also created a grant program to provide similar assistance to local law enforcement agencies.
   Bingaman pointed out that the federal government has fallen far short of its responsibility to secure our nation's borders, and as a result local communities are absorbing a variety of costs, from health care to law enforcement. Bingaman said it is wrong to place this burden on local communities that do not have the resources to deal with these costs alone.
