SEN. BINGAMAN STRONGLY SUPPORTS GOVERNOR'S REQUEST FOR EMERGENCY DECLARATION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today asked Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to quickly approve Gov. Bill Richardson's request for a disaster declaration for Alamogordo.  
   In a letter, Bingaman told William Petersen, FEMA's regional director based in Denton, TX, that he saw the devastation firsthand. 
   "I surveyed the damage on July 7th and was struck by the devastation and loss of property that resulted from the deluge. 
   "As I fellow westerner I am sure that you can appreciate the impact that severe summer storms can have in the desert. The 500 year storm that hit Alamogordo overwhelmed arroyos and storm ditches with water and extensive damage was the result. 
   "The FEMA assessment team sent to the area reported that 253 homes were extensively damaged by the storm. In addition, city streets, bridges, and the arroyos were damaged and must now be rebuilt. This rebuilding includes a flood control project begun by the city and the Army Corps of Engineers several years ago. Having seen the destruction to the area I feel strongly that the federal government should step in with assistance for Alamogordo." 
   Richardson made the request on Friday.
