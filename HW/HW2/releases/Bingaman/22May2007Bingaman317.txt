SEN. BINGAMAN: RESOLUTION RECOGNIZING DAY FOR RANCHERS CLEARS SENATE
  A resolution cosponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, which designates July 28, 2007 as a day recognizing the "American Cowboy", has cleared the Senate today. 
   The Senate resolution acknowledges the role of ranchers in the development of the West. The resolution states that ranchers embody our nation's strong work ethic, are good stewards of the environment, and play a major role in our nation's economy. This is the third year that the Senate has designated a special day and this year American Cowboy day is July 28, 2007. 
   Approximately 800,000 ranchers are in business across the country. New Mexico ranchers generated $964 million in sales in 2005, the most recent year for which numbers are available. In terms of agriculture production, only the dairies are a larger industry in New Mexico than ranching. 
   "Ranching continues to be a vital part of New Mexico's economy. Thanks to this resolution, July 28th will be the official day this year to celebrate this important way of life," Bingaman said. 
   The resolution encourages communities across the country to observe July 28, 2007 as the National Day of the American Cowboy, and mark the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
