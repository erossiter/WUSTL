SEN. BINGAMAN: TAOS COUNTY TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Kit Carson Electrical Cooperative will benefit from $550,000 in federal funds provided through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Rural Development program. 
  The co-op will use the funds to construct a Regional Command, Dispatch, and Homeland Security Center. The project will consolidate the various operations into a single state-of-the-art center for the Taos region. The proposed facility will accommodate multiple agencies and entities, will enhance public safety, decrease response time, increase accuracy of dispatch calls, and address and prepare for Homeland Security issues. 
   "Quick response to an emergency situation can mean the difference between life and death. I am pleased that the funds awarded today to the Kit Carson Electrical Co-op will help increase security in Taos County," Bingaman said.
   Separately, the Taos County Search and Rescue was also awarded $54,250 in federal funds through USDA.
  Funds will be used to purchase a new mobile unit response vehicle and to make improvements to house the vehicle properly. The Taos Search and Rescue is dispatched by the New Mexico State Police. These improvements will enable them to provide search and rescue in rural and wilderness areas in Taos County.
