SEN. BINGAMAN CONTINUES PUSH FOR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today joined in calling for language to implement Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) for meat, peanuts and produce in a bill that is working its way through Congress.  
   In 2002, the President signed into law the farm bill which required the U.S. Department of Agriculture to implement country-of-origin labeling for food by September 2004. Later, at the urging of the Bush Administration and large meatpackers, Congress moved to delay implementation of COOL for two years - until September 2006. The FY 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill further extended the deadline an additional two years to 2008. 
   Bingaman, along with a group of 30 bipartisan Senators, urged Senator Tom Harkin, Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee to include COOL language in the reauthorization of the farm bill that is currently being written. 
   "Country of Origin Labeling would help consumers make informed decisions about the food they purchase. Additionally, it would also help promote New Mexico's cattle industry. I hope that after years of pushing back the implementation of this important provision we can finally move forward and get it done," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is also the cosponsor of legislation that would prevent the further delay of instituting COOL.
