SEN. BINGAMAN URGES BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE BARRIER CONSTRUCTION A TOP PRIORITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Bush administration to set aside enough funding by 2007 to complete the construction of approximately 40 miles of vehicle barrier along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Sen.  
 Bingaman to date has secured about $3 million for construction of the barrier, plus another $3 million that is contained in a spending bill that has not yet been finalized.
   In a letter to two top Bush administration officials, U.S. Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Robert Bonner and the White House's top budget adviser Joshua Bolten, Bingaman said the barrier has been effective in hampering human and drug trafficking across previously unprotected parts of the border.
   The New Mexico National Guard has assisted Border Patrol in this effort by providing labor to construct the vehicle barrier. However, due to other responsibilities of the Guard, it is often difficult for them to get enough personnel to work on this project. Therefore, Bingaman is asking Customs and Border Protection to set aside enough funding to purchase materials for the remaining 35 miles of barrier, as well as for the cost of labor needed to assist the National Guard in completing the barrier. 
   The estimated cost of materials for the barrier is approximately $6 million. Bingaman has asked Bonner and Bolten to estimate the cost of labor, and has asked the Bush administration to support funding for materials and labor combined.
   "I strongly believe that prompt completion of the barrier would greatly enhance border security in this region," Bingaman wrote. "I do not believe we should delay this important project anymore - we should ensure that Border Patrol has the resources necessary to complete this effort in 2007."
