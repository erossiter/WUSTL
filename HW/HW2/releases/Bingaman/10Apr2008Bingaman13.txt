SEN. BINGAMAN, REP. UDALL: DOE GIVES 20 DAY EXTENSION OF PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman and Representative Tom Udall today reported that at their request the Department of Energy has decided to give the public an additional 20 days to comment on a proposal that could affect Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
   The DOE has issued a draft Complex Transformation Supplemental Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (SPEIS) that analyzes the impact of a White House proposal that would make changes to the country's nuclear weapons complex. The public comment period for the draft SPEIS was to close today.
   But the New Mexico lawmakers pressed for an extension to give New Mexicans more time to study and comment on the proposal, and today the Energy Secretary Sam Bodman said the public record would remain open until April 30.
   "The Bush administration has proposed making major changes to our nation's nuclear weapons complex, and New Mexicans have a right to weigh in with their thoughts and concerns," said Bingaman, who chairs the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. "Although I had hoped for a 90 day extension, I appreciate Secretary Bodman's willingness to keep the public comment period open until the end of the month." 
   "The NNSA has proposed dynamic changes to its structure, changes that could have an enormous impact on New Mexico," said Udall. "Although it is not the 90-day extension we had originally requested, I appreciate the efforts of the NNSA and Secretary Bodman to accept public comments through April. I will continue to work with the stakeholders in all communities throughout New Mexico and the NNSA to ensure that all voices are being heard in a complete and timely manner."
