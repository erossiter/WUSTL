SEN. BINGAMAN: CITY OF ESPA?OLA TO BENEFIT FROM $200,000 ANTI-DRUG AND VIOLENCE 'WEED & SEED' GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the City of Espa?ola has been awarded a $200,000 for a comprehensive anti-drug and violence "Weed and Seed" program. 
   The funds provided today will be used by law enforcement to support efforts to decrease the presence of drug houses and drug dealers, and to reduce crime related to gangs, drugs and alcohol. Community policing goals include increasing coordination and cooperation among law enforcement, neighborhood associations, business, community members, youth and other entities in the community.
   "The Department of Justice's Weed and Seed Program has been instrumental in helping make neighborhoods safer for residents. This funding will help Espa?ola continue this important program," Bingaman said.
   A multi-agency initiative, Weed and Seed coordinates the delivery of criminal justice and social services to eliminate violent crime, drug trafficking and drug-related crime. The program "weeds" out criminal offenders engaged in drug crimes and violent offenses through targeted law enforcement and criminal justice services. Once a targeted area is stabilized through community policing, service agencies "seed" the neighborhood with housing, employment and revitalization opportunities.
