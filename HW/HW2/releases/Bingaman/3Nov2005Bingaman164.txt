SEN. BINGAMAN: BUDGET BILL SETS OUT WRONG PRIORITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he voted against a budget bill that passed the Senate today because it makes deep cuts in health care while setting aside $1 billion for an unnecessary milk subsidy that benefits farmers in only a few states.  
 The measure passed 52-47. 
   "This bill sets aside $1 billion for an unnecessary subsidy to benefit Northeast and Midwest dairy farmers, while at the same time making deep cuts to essential health care and housing initiatives that benefit New Mexico," Bingaman said. "Our country is in deep financial trouble which requires us to make difficult choices and set priorities. In my view, we have laid out the wrong priorities in this bill."
   Specifically, the bill:
   * Increases burdens on America's seniors, by increasing Medicare premiums. 
   * Cuts health care - both Medicare and Medicaid - by a total of $27 billion. 
   * Cuts support for farmers by $4 billion. 
   * Cuts housing. 
   The bill also contains a provision that opens the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, a move that Bingaman opposes. 
   Bingaman was able to win support for an amendment that restores $66 million in federal support for New Mexico's Medicaid program. A change in the way federal funds awarded to states cut a total of $79 million to the state. 
   "I was very pleased to win support for this amendment because New Mexico needs as much federal funding as it can get to support Medicaid. We will have to fight hard to keep this provision in the final bill," Bingaman said.
   A congressional panel will now meet to iron out the differences between the House- and Senate-passed budget bills.
