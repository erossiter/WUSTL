SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO BUSINESS AWARDED SMALL BUSINESS RESEARCH FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that Vista Photonics, Inc. in Santa Fe has been awarded a total of $1.5 million in grant funding from the Department of Energy (DOE) to continue research and development work on initiatives that benefit the federal government.  
   Vista Photonics will receive funding for two different projects. It has been awarded $750,000 for a project aimed at determining the feasibility of developing an inexpensive, high-performance carbon dioxide sensor required in the field to understand global warming. 
   It will also receive an additional $750,000 for a separate project that seeks to determine the feasibility of developing an inexpensive optical sensor needed to monitor gases in waste storage tanks. 
   "I am pleased the funding awarded today will help this Santa Fe business invest in technology that will benefit the federal government," Bingaman said. 
   The award is being funded through DOE's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program, which offers grants to private sector firms that can help the federal government meet its research needs while encouraging commercial application of federally supported research. Both projects last year were awarded $100,000 each from SBIR to conduct preliminary feasibility studies. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of spinning off government-sponsored research to the private sector, and using high-tech businesses to enhance research and development that benefits our national security.
