SEN. BINGAMAN OUTLINES SPENDING PRIORITIES FOR KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today outlined his fiscal year 2006 spending priorities for military construction projects at Kirtland Air Force Base. 
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $8 million for construction of a National Defense Technology Auditorium at Kirtland Air Force Base. The multiple security level classified conference facility would help different entities, such as the Department of Defense, the Department of Energy, the Department of Homeland Security, and private sector firms to easily communicate and share classified information, research, and technology. 
   "New Mexico's military installations continue to play an important role in out country's national security. Investing in them to ensure that they are in top shape continues to be one of my top priorities," Bingaman said. "My 2006 funding request for the construction of a National Defense Technology Auditorium will provide an opportunity for Kirtland to take on new missions and strength its position during the next round of base closures and realignments." 
   Bingaman is also requesting $11 million for the reconstruction and widening of Wyoming Blvd. Existing traffic lanes on this main through street at Kirtland Air Force Base are below American Association of State Highway and Transportation official standards. The road is currently a four-lane undivided roadway with no protected left turn lanes. The lack of a storm drainage system allows for significant water collection over two lanes of traffic, contributing to unsafe driving conditions during inclement weather. 
   Bingaman is also seeking funding for the following projects at Kirtland Air Force Base: 
   * $16 million for a Security Forces Complex at Kirtland Air Force Base: Currently, security functions and personnel are in seven buildings up to 10 miles apart scattered across Kirtland AFB. Precious manpower is stretched to the limit by staffing and managing multiple locations, unnecessarily jeopardizing the security of several research and development facilities in addition to other base activities.
   * $14.6 million for Space Vehicles Component Development Lab at Kirtland Air Force Base: This project will consolidate science and technology (S&T) work now being performed in 6 inadequate facilities spread over 12 miles on Kirtland AFB into a single state-of-the-art industrial complex, supporting S&T in space power generation to include solar arrays and photo-voltaic cells; space power storage, space vehicle mechanisms; mechanism controls; and rad-hard electronic and environmental sensors
   * $5 million to construct an East Perimeter Fence at Kirtland Air Force Base: The project will consist of the construction of approximately 10 miles of chain link fence and rough graded 4-wheel drive patrol road to secure the east perimeter of Kirtland Air Force Base. Currently there is no fence along the east perimeter of Kirtland AFB, which allows public access to test and training areas, and exposure to potential hazards such as unexploded ordinance.
