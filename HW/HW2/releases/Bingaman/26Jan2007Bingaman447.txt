SEN. BINGAMAN CALLS ON ADMINISTRATION TO BRING BORDER SECURITY INITIATIVE TO NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Bush Administration to bring an important border security program to the New Mexico-Mexico border. 
   The Secure Border Initiative (SBInet) uses a mix of technology, infrastructure, staffing and response platforms to better secure the border. The first phase of the program is currently underway along a 28-mile stretch of the Arizona-Mexico border. That phase is set to be completed by April 2007. 
   In a letter to Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Michael Chertoff, Bingaman requested DHS to deploy the next phase of SBInet along the New Mexico-Mexico border. Bingaman said the New Mexico border area is well-suited to implement the initiative. 
   "I strongly believe that the New Mexico border area is well-suited to implement the Secure Border Initiative. First, the area provides unsurpassed diversity in terms of terrain, which would provide alternative testing ground in assessing the unique challenges related to securing the entire Southwest border. Second, New Mexico now contains the third busiest corridor along the southern border. And third, New Mexico greatly needs additional resources both with regard to technology and manpower. 
   "We have made some very good progress over the last year in enhancing border security, and I believe we now have the opportunity to achieve success in gaining operational control over the New Mexico-Mexico border. Deploying additional resources to New Mexico, as part of SBI, would help make this a reality," Bingaman wrote.
