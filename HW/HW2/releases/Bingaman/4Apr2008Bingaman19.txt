SEN. BINGAMAN: VILLANUEVA WATER ASSOCIATION TO RECEIVE $1.5 MILLION FROM USDA
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Villanueva Mutual Domestic Water Consumers' Association will receive a $961,000 loan and a $539,000 grant from the federal government. 
   Bingaman said the funds will be used to improve and expand the community's water system. The system needs a bigger tank to replace leaking tanks, a new well, pump and well house, and additional fire hydrants, among other things.
   "This federal funding will be used to make significant improvements to the water system, ensuring it can safely meet the needs of the more than 100 families the MDWCA serves," Bingaman said.
   The grant will not be repaid. The loan will be paid back over 40 years at the low interest rate of 4.375 percent.
   The funds come through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development agency.
