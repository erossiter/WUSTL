SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS EFFORTS TO CREATE 'NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN LATINO COMMUNITY'
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today has joined in introducing legislation that takes a first step toward creating a national museum focusing on the history and culture of the Latino community in America.  
   The bill, reintroduced by Senators Salazar (D-CO) and Martinez (R-FL) among others, would create a national commission to study the potential establishment of a "National Museum of the American Latino Community" in Washington, DC. Congressman Xavier Becerra (D-CA) is the sponsor the House companion bill. That bill passed the House today. 
   "America's Hispanic community has made enormous contributions to our country and our culture. This museum is long overdue and it is my hope that the Senate will act on this bill quickly and make this idea a reality," Bingaman said. 
   The National Museum of the American Latino Community Commission Act would create a 23-member commission to lead the effort. The Commission will be charged with: convening within 18 months a national conference to bring stakeholders, experts, policymakers and other interested parties together to discuss the museum's viability; developing a fundraising plan to create an extensive public-private partnership; and submitting to Congress within 24 months of its national conference a detailed report recommending a plan of action for taking the museum from concept to reality. 
   The bill was referred to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which Bingaman chairs.
