SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL CONTAINING FUNDING FOR N.M. PROJECTS CLEARS SENATE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased a bill containing millions he requested for New Mexico projects is on its way to becoming law.
   The Senate today approved the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill, which contains $537,000 Bingaman requested to restore and maintain riparian areas along the Rio Grande and Pecos River where the state is working to treat and kill the noxious salt cedar. 
   The funding would be used to restore native vegetation to riparian areas in order to stabilize soils; to maintain replanted areas; and for management to prevent invasive species from returning to treated areas. This is the third year Bingaman has secured funding for this project.
   "As the state continues its work to do away with this destructive foreign tree, it's important to restore the affected areas along the river back to their natural habitat. The funding included in this bill will help in this important effort," Bingaman said.
   The bill also includes $2 million to complete a flood protection project in Truth or Consequences. Four of five phases of the Truth or Consequences/Williamsburg Arroyos project have already been completed, at a cost of $11 million.
   "I am pleased the funding included in this bill will help make an important investment in the community of Truth or Consequences and will be of great benefit to its residents," Bingaman said.
   The spending bill contains the following:
   * $25 million to continue a Bingaman-created grant program that supports community development projects in Native American communities. Many Indian communities lack basic drinking water and wastewater facilities; tribal colleges are often housed in rundown, decrepit or even condemned buildings; and capital to start and expand job-creating small businesses is in short supply. This funding aims to help deal with those needs.
   * $6.6 million to continue research on rangeland management and cotton and chile production at the USDA's labs in Do?a Ana County.
   * $2.35 million for New Mexico State University's Agricultural Products Food Safety Lab: This funding would be used to continue operation of the Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory for the FDA's food safety program. The lab is developing and evaluating rapid-screening methods to detect contamination in food products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Bingaman secured $2.15 million to operate the lab in 2005.
   * $1 million for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Management. The institute conducts research on agricultural, range management, animal husbandry, education and extension programs. The institute is a joint effort of NMSU, Texas A&M and Montana State.
   * $25 million for water and wastewater projects in colonias along the U.S.-Mexico border. New Mexico is expected to get about $7.9 million of this funding.
   * $547,000 for Sandia Labs to continue work on an Internet-based system for early detection and reporting of outbreaks of infectious diseases in food animals. The system is known as the Rapid Syndrome Validation Program for Animals. Sandia is working with NMSU, Kansas State University and the New Mexico Department of Agriculture on this project.
   * $850,000 for USDA to contract with the Albuquerque-based National Tribal Environmental Council to continue a Native American circuit rider program to provide technical assistance for rural water systems.
   Bingaman said he was disappointed in the inclusion of language to further delay the implementation of Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) until 2008.
   In 2002, the President signed into law the farm bill which required U.S. Department of Agriculture to implement country-of-origin labeling for food (meat, fish and produce) by September 2004. Later, at the urging of the Bush Administration and the large meatpackers, Congress moved to delay implementation of COOL for two years - until September 2006. The language included in the bill extends it an additional two years.
