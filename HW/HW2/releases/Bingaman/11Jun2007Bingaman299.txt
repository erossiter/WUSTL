SEN. BINGAMAN BILL BOLSTERS COMMERCIAL AIR SERVICE IN NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has joined with Sen. Olympia Snowe (R-ME) to introduce bipartisan legislation to improve a program that helps several New Mexico communities retain commercial air service. 
   The Rural Aviation Improvement Act would work to preserve and improve the Essential Air Service Program (EAS), which provides commercial air service to over 100 communities in 35 states. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all.
   "For many New Mexico communities commercial air service provides a critical link to the national and international transportation system. These small communities face ever-increasing hurdles to promoting their economic growth and development. I believe Congress must help ensure that affordable, reliable, and safe air service remains available in rural America," Bingaman said.
   The bill makes a number of important improvements to the EAS program, including the following:
   * Permanently repeals a provision put in place by the 2002 FAA Reauthorization Act requiring a community to pay a portion of the cost (up to 10%) to keep its limited commercial air service;
   * Modifies an existing provision that caps the EAS subsidy at $200 per passenger for communities within 210 miles of a medium or large hub airport. The cap was set in 2000 and has never been adjusted for inflation or increases in airline costs. The bill includes an annual increase in the cost cap to reflect inflation;
   * Establishes a procedure for a community that has lost its commercial air service because the $200/passenger cap had been exceeded to apply to re-enter the program if it can demonstrate the cost of the service no longer exceeds the cap;
   * Include incentives for airlines to participate and stay in the EAS program by requiring subsidy payments to be adjusted to reflect changes in operating cost, such as the cost of fuel;
   * Requires FAA to include passenger boardings on charter flights departing from EAS communities to be included in total the passenger boardings used to calculate an airport's annual apportionment for the Airport Improvement Program, which is currently delineated by a 10,000 enplanement threshold. If a community is below that threshold, it is eligible for $150,000 and $1 million if above the threshold.
   Additionally, the bill extends the Department of Transportation's authority to provide grants to cities under the Small Community Air Service Development program through 2011. It was first established in 2000.
   The Small Community program helps rural communities establish new air service or to promote and improve their existing air service. Since it was first enacted a number of New Mexico communities have won grants, including most recently Gallup in 2006. 
   Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before deregulation continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico's five EAS communities and their annually subsidies are as follows: Alamogordo ($717,000), Carlsbad ($304,000), Clovis ($1.2 million), Hobbs ($304,000) and Silver City ($1.2 million). Roswell's air service to Albuquerque will soon be subsidized through EAS.
