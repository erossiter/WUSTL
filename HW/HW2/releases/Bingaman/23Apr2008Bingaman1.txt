SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS EFFORTS TO PREVENT SUICIDE AMONG ACTIVE DUTY SOLDIERS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman this week joined in cosponsoring legislation to help prevent suicide among active duty members of the military. 
   The Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act would direct the Department of Defense (DoD) to create a comprehensive suicide prevention program within all branches of the military, including National Guard and Reserves. The program includes annual training for soldiers, improved instruction for field medics and post deployment assistance.
   "We need to recognize and address the enormous amount of psychological stress and trauma that our military troops experience when serving in combat situations. This bill will help ensure soldiers have the support and resources they need to help prevent suicides," Bingaman said.
   The Department of Defense has reported an increase in suicide rates among active duty troops. In December the Army reported that 85 soldiers committee suicide last year, including 27 in Iraq and four in Afghanistan - the highest rates of suicide in 26 years. The DoD Task Force on Mental Health estimated 38 percent of active duty soldiers and 50 percent of National Guard who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan report mental health issues, and that neither the Veterans Administration nor the Department of Defense is ready to deal with the increase in mental health needs of Iraq and Afghanistan service personnel.
   Specifically, the Armed Forces Suicide Prevention Act will:
   * Conduct a national mental health campaign to reduce the stigma associated with mental health issues, encourage people to seek help when needed, and increase awareness that mental health is essential to overall health and that treatments can promote recovery from mental illness.
   * Involve military leadership in outreach efforts by incorporating suicide prevention training in officer and senior enlisted training courses.
   * Implement annual suicide prevention training of all active duty, Reserve, and National Guard members.
   * Strengthen basic lifesaver training and training for military medics and medical personnel to incorporate recognition of risk factors for suicide, identification of signs and symptoms of mental health issues, and protocols for responding to crisis situations involving soldiers who may be at high risk for suicide.
   * Utilize Critical Incident Stress Management teams within units to prevent and respond to traumatic events. Such teams will consist of key personnel such as medical staff, chaplains, family support staff, and peers.
   * Provide post-deployment follow-up and assistance for family members and peers of members of the Armed Services on mental health problems, substance use, and financial and relationship difficulties, including information on resources to address these issues.
   The bill was referred to the Senate Armed Services Committee.
