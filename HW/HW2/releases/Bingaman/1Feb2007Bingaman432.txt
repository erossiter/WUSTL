SEN. BINGAMAN: EPA FUNDS TO BENEFIT ESPA?OLA
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency will release $1.1 million he secured for an Espa?ola wastewater project.  
   The City of Espa?ola will use this funding to expand and upgrade its wastewater treatment facility. Improvements are needed to reduce the ammonia level that is discharged into the Rio Grande and increase its treatment capacity. 
   "This funding is an important federal investment in Espanola, and will help make needed upgrades to the city's wastewater treatment facility," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman secured the funds through a fiscal year2005 appropriations bill.
