SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO ORGANIZATIONS AWARDED HUD FUNDS TO HELP CREATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that two New Mexico organizations will share a total of $1.1 million in grant funds from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
   The following two organizations were awarded:
   *Albuquerque-based Youth Building Better Lives Inc. $694,883
   * County of Taos $400,000
   Funding will be used to help young adults complete their high school educations and achieve on-the-job training in construction skills. Students will build or renovate affordable single-family homes and multi-family apartments for low-income individuals and families. 
   "I am pleased the funding awarded today will help serve community housing needs while providing educational opportunities to young adults," Bingaman said.
  Funds were awarded through HUD's Youthbuild program, which provides grants on a competitive basis to non-profit organizations.
