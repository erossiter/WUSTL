SEN. BINGAMAN: ALBUQUERQUE HISPANO CHAMBER OF COMMERCE FOUNDATION RECEIVES $1.45 MILLION
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the Albuquerque Hispano Chamber of Commerce Foundation will receive $1.45 million in federal funds to for construct at the Barelas Job Opportunity Center. The funds come from the U.S. Commerce Department's Economic Development Administration.  
   Two years ago, Bingaman secured $250,000 for the Center, which is an excellent resource that provides educational opportunities and workforce development training to individuals seeking employment. Since it was founded in 2001, the Center has served thousands of individuals and directly placed hundreds in good jobs. 
   "The Barelas Job Opportunity Center is a tremendous resource, helping prepare New Mexicans for the workforce," Bingaman said. "I was pleased to secure funding to support the Job Center a few years ago, and I'm very glad the federal government is making another investment in it." 
   Right now the Center is 12,000 square feet and has 16-18 work stations. The funding awarded today will help construct an additional 8,000 sq ft. and equip it with computers to expand the training capacity.
