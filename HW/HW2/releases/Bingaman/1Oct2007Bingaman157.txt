SEN. BINGAMAN: RUIDOSO EDUCATIONAL CENTER TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL GRANT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Regional IX Education Cooperative in Ruidoso has been awarded a $462,981 grant through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program. 
   Funding will be used to deliver distance learning services over a wireless network infrastructure to seven school districts in Southern New Mexico. The program will provide advanced math and science programs to students and will assist teaching staff by providing professional development opportunities to them.
   "This funding will make it possible to offer an advanced math and science curriculum in schools that otherwise would not have access to them," Bingaman said.
