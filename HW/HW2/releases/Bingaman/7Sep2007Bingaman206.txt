SEN. BINGAMAN URGES FEDERAL SUPPORT FOR NEW MEXICO CATTLE INDUSTRY
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today called for increased federal support to help New Mexico continue to manage the state's bovine tuberculosis (TB) outbreak.  
   Earlier this year, a number of dairy cattle in Curry County tested positive for TB. In a letter to U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns, Bingaman urged the agency to provide federal funding to ranchers to cover the estimated $1.5 million cost associated with the necessary monitoring and testing associated with managing the outbreak. 
   "The state's cattle industry continues to be an important part of the local economy. It is vital that everything is done to ensure that the recent bovine TB outbreak is closely monitored. This year New Mexico has received only $200,000 in assistance from USDA for surveillance and testing to deal with this new outbreak, even though the state received $500,000 last year. Unfortunately, it is estimated that the cost this year will be much higher. 
   "Moreover, the New Mexico Livestock Board has already provided $450,000 for the TB effort this year, which has stretched the board's budget beyond its limits. I urge you to ensure that New Mexico has all the financial resources it needs to continue the ongoing TB surveillance and eradication activities," Bingaman wrote. 
   This summer at Bingaman's urging, the U.S. Department of Agriculture made $35 million available to help reimburse the affected diary owner for the cost of destroying the affected herd, which was a required step in order for New Mexico to retain its TB free status. 
   The livestock industry is New Mexico's single most important agricultural commodity with total annual sales of milk and beef cattle totaling almost $2 billion. There are over 1.5 million cattle and calves in New Mexico, including 340,000 dairy cows.
