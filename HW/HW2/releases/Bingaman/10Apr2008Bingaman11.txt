SENS. BINGAMAN, DOMENICI APPLAUD PASSAGE OF LEGISLATION TO CREATE LATINO MUSEUM IN NATION'S CAPITAL
  U.S. Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici today applauded the passage of legislation that takes a first step toward creating a national museum focusing on the history and culture of the Latino community in America. 
   The bill, which the New Mexico Senators cosponsored, creates a 23-member Commission charged with creating a plan for constructing a museum honoring the contributions Hispanics have made to the United States. The bill was introduced by Senators Ken Salazar (D-CO) and Mel Martinez (R-FL.).
   "Washington is home to many museums that honor our country's diversity. A museum recognizing Hispanic culture and history would be an important addition," said Bingaman, chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources.
   "I believe the United States has been made a better country through the contributions and influence of Hispanic Americans. This bill will allow us to determine how best to recognize those contributions and whether a national museum would be appropriate and feasible," said Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
   The Commission will be charged with convening within 18 months a national conference to bring stakeholders, experts, policymakers and other interested parties together to discuss the museum's viability; developing a fundraising plan to create an extensive public-private partnership; and submitting to Congress within 24 months of its national conference a detailed report recommending a plan of action for taking the museum from concept to reality.
   The bill must now be approved by the U.S. House of Representatives and then sent to the White House to be signed into law.
