SEN. BINGAMAN RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT PROPOSED CUTS TO FOREST SERVICES PREPAREDNESS PROGRAM
  At a Capitol Hill hearing today, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was very concerned about the White House's proposal to cut $10 million Forest Service's Fire Preparedness program. 
   "Parts of the West are experiencing some of the driest conditions on record. In the Southwest, we are struggling to prepare for what looks to be a catastrophic fire season with a Fire Preparedness program that was cut by more than 20%--and that was on top of cuts from the year before. This budget proposes yet another cut of $10 million to the national Preparedness program, dramatic cuts in State Fire Assistance, and virtual elimination of the Fire Rehabilitation program," Bingaman said. 
   "The lack of funding for hazardous fuels reduction projects also is a concern. We have tens-of-thousands of acres of projects in the Southwest alone that are ready for immediate implementation but for a lack of funds. The local staff of the Forest Service has worked very hard with our communities to put these projects together. They have done their part. This budget does not do its part to get those projects off of the shelf and on to the ground," he added. 
   Bingaman made his remarks at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on the fiscal year 2007 Forest Service budget. He is the top Democrat on the committee.
   Bingaman is committed to working in a bipartisan way to ensure there is enough funding in this drought year for firefighting and post-fire restoration.
