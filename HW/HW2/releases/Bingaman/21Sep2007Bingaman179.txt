SEN. BINGAMAN: HOUSE AND SENATE PANEL FINALIZES STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM BILL
  A bipartisan Senate-House panel released an initial summary of legislation U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman helped write to ensure that more New Mexicans could have access to health care.  
   The final bill sets aside $35 million in new federal funding over the next five years for the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) - the state/federal health care initiative crafted in 1997 that covers millions of children and others who do not qualify for Medicaid but whose families cannot afford health insurance. 
   "Almost 100,000 New Mexican children lack health insurance," Bingaman said. "It is vital to enact an SCHIP bill that reaches out to more children, giving them access to health care. Unfortunately, the president has threatened to veto this bill. Given its importance to American children, I hope he reconsiders and signs this bill, which has garnered strong bipartisan support." 
   Bingaman, as a member of the Finance Committee, worked extensively on the Senate passed version and had a provision included in the finalized bill that significantly strengthens the ability of children to receive dental services through SCHIP. 
   "Dental health problems can seriously impact a child's overall health. Ensuring that SCHIP includes strong dental services will help make sure millions of American children stay healthy and get a good start in life," Bingaman said. 
   Specific bill language is still being finalized and likely won't be available until Monday. However, initial reports indicate the bill will continue to allow New Mexico to not only cover children, but parents and other low-income adult populations as well.
