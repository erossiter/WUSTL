SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO BENEFIT FROM HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico fire departments have been awarded funds through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   The grant will be used to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   The following fire departments were awarded:
   * City of Santa Fe Fire Department $158,020
   * Espa?ola Fire $90Department,060
   "Proper education and training are key tools in preventing fires or mitigating the damage they can cause. The funding awarded to Santa Fe and Espa?ola will help ensure their fire departments are prepared with the proper training and equipment needed to handle any emergency situation," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
