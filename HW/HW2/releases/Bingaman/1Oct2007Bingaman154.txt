SENATE TO WRAP UP WORK ON DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION BILL
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said the Senate is expected to wrap-up work this week on the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization bill, a key piece of legislation that supports New Mexico's military installations and the state's two national laboratories. 
   The Senate will then begin consideration of the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill and will work to conclude action on the bill before next week's scheduled state work period.
