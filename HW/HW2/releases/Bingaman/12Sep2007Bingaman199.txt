SEN. BINGAMAN: LAS CRUCES POLICE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Las Cruces Police Department has been awarded a $570,303 federal grant from the Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Technology Program.  
   Funding will be used to help the police department acquire technology to help facilitate the sharing of information, either data or voice, across multiple jurisdictions within the region or state. 
   "The funding awarded today will help the Las Cruces Police Department enhance its ability to protect city residents," Bingaman said. 
   The COPS program aims to advance community policing nationwide and supports state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. Bingaman is a strong supporter on the program.
