SEN. BINGAMAN: NATIONAL TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL AWARDED $793,000 FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was pleased to announce a $793,000 grant he helped secure will go to the National Tribal Environmental Council.  
 The Council offers technical assistance and training to managers of tribal drinking water systems. The organization advises 163 tribal communities in New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Wisconsin, Utah and California. 
   "The National Tribal Environmental Council is a resource that tribal water utility managers across the country can tap into. This funding will be used to support the important work the Council does," Bingaman said.
   The grant comes through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development fund. 
   Bingaman is spearheading an effort to secure $850,000 for fiscal year 2006. He also helped secure $750,000 in 2004 for NTEC.
