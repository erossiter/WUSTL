SEN. BINGAMAN: ALAMOGORDO FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT TO BENEFIT FROM $2.8 MILLION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the U.S. Army has awarded a $2.8 million contract to an Albuquerque business to help prevent flooding in Alamogordo. 
   Moore & Cowart Contractors Inc. in Albuquerque will begin Phase 4 of a multi-phase Alamogordo flood control project, which consists of the construction of 23,000 linear feet of concrete-lined channel and a sediment basin in the Abbott Ditch neighborhood that was damaged by rain and flooding last July. 
   "Severe storms last year caused major flooding in Alamogordo and left homes and businesses in bad shape. The funding being awarded today will help prevent this from happening in the future," Bingaman said.
   Last year's floods originated at Marble Canyon, and came through the Abbott Ditch neighborhoods, among others. The project will create a concrete lined ditch from the mouth of Marble Canyon to an existing detention pond that was an earlier phase of this flood plan.
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the project and earlier this year wrote to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and urged them to continue funding it this year.
   Bingaman toured areas affected by flooding last July and pressed for FEMA assistance to help homeowners, businesses and the community recover from the storms.
