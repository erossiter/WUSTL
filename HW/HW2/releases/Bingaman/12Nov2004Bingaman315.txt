SEN. BINGAMAN APPLAUDS GROUNDBREAKING FOR FOUR CORNERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that work is now underway on a visitors center at the Four Corners that will provide basic facilities, such as restrooms and drinking water, for the quarter of a million visitors to the site each year. Sen.  
 Bingaman co-wrote the 1999 legislation that authorized $2 million in federal funding toward the cost of the project.
   "Each year, thousands of visitors come to the Four Corners, but until now they have not had anywhere to rest, or to learn more about the culture and history of the region. I am pleased that after many years we are finally undertaking this important project," Bingaman said.
   A groundbreaking for the center was scheduled for this morning. 
   In 2001, the federal government appropriated $2 million toward the cost of construction. As required by law, each of the Four Corners states - New Mexico, Colorado, Utah and Arizona - also provided funding. 
   The visitor center envisioned in bill, which was written by Senator Orrin Hatch (R-UT), will include an interpretive center that will serve as an educational hub providing cultural, historical, natural, and archaeological information about the region. Services to be provided at the center include restrooms, running water, telephones, electricity, and vending. The federal government also authorized $50,000 per year to operate the facility for up to five years; that funding was also set aside in 2001. 
   "I believe this center will help make visits to the Four Corners more meaningful, and could help attract even more visitors to the region," Bingaman said.
