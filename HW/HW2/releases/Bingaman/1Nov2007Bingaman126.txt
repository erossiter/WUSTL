SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS WILL HELP WITH LAND ACQUISITION
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the National Park Service is releasing a $322,708 grant that will help the state of New Mexico acquire land in southern New Mexico.  
   Funding will help the New Mexico Sate Parks Division acquire approximately 250 acres of the 874 acre Tonuco parcel adjacent to the Rio Grande and north of Leasburg State Park in Do?a Ana County. The property will provide an access point for the Rio Grande Trail initiative, a trail that is being proposed to run from Bernalillo in Sandoval Country to Sundland Park in Do?a County - about 250 miles in length. 
   This funding will go a long way in helping preserve riparian habitats along the Rio Grande. The acquisition of the land will also make it possible for the public to access and enjoy this beautiful part of the state," Bingaman said.
