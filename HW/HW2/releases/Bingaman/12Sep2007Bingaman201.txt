SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL BOOSTS FUNDING FOR INDIAN HEALTH CARE
  The Senate Finance Committee today approved long-overdue legislation that will help improve Indian health care programs. U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman is a member of the panel and a strong advocate for improving health care access to Native Americans.  
   The "Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007" provides $52 million in additional funding for Indian health care services. The legislation improves reimbursement procedures, bolsters outreach programs, and eliminates co-payments for patients of the Indian Health Service who rely on Medicare, Medicaid and CHIP. The bill also streamlines and updates rules and regulations that will enable federal health programs to work more effectively with the Indian Health Service. 
   "Access to quality health care continues to be a challenge for many Americans, but it is especially challenging for the Native American community," Bingaman said. "For too long Indian health care has been under funded. This bill is a first step to fixing this problem." 
   The bill approved today will be incorporated into the larger "Indian Health Care Improvement Act (S. 1200), which is co-sponsored by Bingaman, was approved by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee earlier this year. As a result of today's action by the Finance Committee, the bill is now ready to be considered by the full Senate. 
   The Medicare, Medicaid, and CHIP Indian Health Care Improvement Act of 2007 also does the following: 
   * Clarifies how Medicaid, Medicare, and CHIP pays Indian health providers, 
  * Increases outreach and enrollment of Indians in Medicaid and CHIP, 
  * Clarifies cost-sharing protections for Indians in Medicaid and CHIP, 
  * Protects Indian health providers from discrimination in payment for services, 
  * Requires States and the Secretary to consult with Indian health providers, 
  * Provides a safe harbor for certain Indian health providers, 
  * Ensures Indian health providers are paid appropriately by Medicaid managed care organizations, and 
  * Requires the Secretary to report on Indian enrollment in federal programs and related matters on an annual basis.
