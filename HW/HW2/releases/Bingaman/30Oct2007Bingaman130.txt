SEN. BINGAMAN: SENATE APPROVES LEGISLATION TO BOLSTER AMTRAK
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman reported that the Senate today approved legislation that will help strengthen Amtrak.  
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of New Mexico's two Amtrak lines. The Southwest Chief serves Raton, Las Vegas, Lamy, Albuquerque and Gallup and the Sunset Limited serves Deming and Lordsburg. 
   The Amtrak Reauthorization Bill that passed 70-22 authorizes roughly $10 billion over six years to maintain Amtrak's operations, and improve infrastructure, facilities, and equipment to enhance the marketability of its services. These changes are aimed at helping Amtrak become more efficient through increased revenue and ridership, cost containment, and management improvements. Authorization is needed before funding can be appropriated. 
   "Amtrak helps link New Mexico communities to the rest of the country. It deserves our strong support, and this bill helps provide it," Bingaman said. 
   The bill also creates a new inter-city passenger rail capital grant program to support state passenger rail development, authorizing $1.4 billion in total grant funding to states for passenger rail capital projects. New Mexico could apply for such funding. 
   The House of Representatives has not yet taken up Amtrak legislation. 
   Separately, Bingaman strongly supported $1.4 billion in appropriations in FY 2008 for Amtrak. Bush had asked for $800,000,000, which would have required Amtrak to shut down the two New Mexico lines. The Senate-passed transportation spending bill has $1.37 billion, the House-passed transportation bill has $1.4 billion; the two versions are now being reconciled.
