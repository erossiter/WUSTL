SEN. BINGAMAN: HIGHWAY BILL EXPECTED TO BENEFIT EASTERN NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today hailed the passage of legislation that will help pay for key highway, road and transit projects throughout the state. The measure, which passed the Senate 89-11, contains millions of dollars for communities in eastern New Mexico.  
   "Highway and road improvements are essential for a healthy economy and good standard of living. This legislation makes a significant investment in communities throughout our state," Bingaman said. "I am particularly pleased that the bill contains millions of dollars for road projects in several eastern New Mexico counties." 
   The funding is contained in the SAFE-TEA (Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act), a five-year bill that funds transportation projects nationwide. The bill contains $1.77 billion over the next five years for New Mexico; the last highway bill that passed in 1998 contained about $1.63 billion over six years.
   "Many highway improvement projects in our state wouldn't be possible without federal funding," Bingaman said. "This bill will make it possible for New Mexico communities to make much-needed road improvements."
   The funding in the bill will be used to implement New Mexico's Statewide Transportation Improvement Program (STIP) - the list of highway and road projects the state has identified as priorities for construction. 
   At this point in the process, SAFE-TEA does not contain earmarks, or special funding identified for specific projects. However, referring to the current STIP, Bingaman has identified projects that are expected to receive federal funding through SAFE-TEA. Those projects identified in the STIP are listed below next to the estimated cost of the project. The federal government typically pays for 80 percent of the projects.
