SEN. BINGAMAN AMENDMENT WOULD PROTECT AMERICAN WORKERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today won support for an amendment that would set the cap for the Senate immigration bill's guest worker program at 200,000. The underlying bill had set the cap at 400,000, with an opportunity for that number to grow to 600,000. Within a decade the number of visas issued under the bill could have reached 3.4 million This is the second Bingaman provision in the comprehensive immigration bill under debate. 
   The first would provide up to $50 million in grant funding each year to border law enforcement agencies. "The guest worker program in this bill is unproven and untested, and I'm very concerned about what it will do to wages in our country. There are a variety of jobs that may be filled by guest workers, from construction to hotel service, and we shouldn't be placing American workers in the position of competing with an unlimited number of guest workers," Bingaman said. The Senate will continue debating this legislation. Over the past several years, Bingaman has secured millions of dollars to address the security needs of border communities. For example, he has cosponsored legislation to significantly increase the number of Border Patrol agents. Bingaman has also secured millions of dollars to construct vehicle barriers along the New Mexico-Mexico border and enhance the New Mexico National Guard Counterdrug Program for border security related projects.
