NNSA SECURITY BREACH
  "I'm very concerned that this breach appears to have gone undetected for quite some time. But even when it was discovered, the NNSA did not take the appropriate action of notifying the employees whose personal information was compromised. This is clearly unacceptable and we need both to hold people accountable and make sure this is fixed so it doesn't happen again," U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman said.
