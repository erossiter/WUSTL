REP. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENT AWARDED FEDERAL GRANTS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the two New Mexico Fire Departments have been awarded federal funds through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   Funding can be used to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   The following fire departments will receive funds: 
   * Cuba Volunteer Fire Department $38,000 
   * Causey Fire Department $76,958 
   "It's important that we keep New Mexico's fire departments in top shape so that they are always prepared to handle any emergency situation that should arise," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program, which provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
