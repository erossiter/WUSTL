SEN. BINGAMAN ASKS AIR FORCE TO SUPPORT CLEANUP OF ORDINANCE IN OTERO CANYON
  In a letter to Air Force Secretary James Roche, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today voiced his strong support for setting aside funds to remove unexploded ordinance in Otero Canyon.  
   Bingaman said the sooner the ordinance is removed the sooner the hiking and biking trains in the area can be reopened to the public.
   "I understand that while there have been no incidents involving unexploded ordinance during the many years of public use, the Air Force is obligated to investigate the presence of UXO, and where it's found remove it," Bingaman wrote to Roche. 
   "Toward this end, I urge Air Force headquarters to provide adequate funding for Kirtland to accomplish this task, and I will strongly support Kirtland's and the Air Force's efforts to secure funding for this purpose," Bingaman continued. "This funding for UXO remediation on the land would ensure that the many people who have used this land for recreation could promptly and safely return to using it."
   When it was announced that Kirtland would be building a security fence on its eastern perimeter, Bingaman strongly urged the base to keep public hiking and biking trails open. The Pentagon is in the process of reviewing where the fence line should be. In his letter, Bingaman pressed Roche to find a way to protect the base while allowing for public access on the trails.
   "While I recognize that there is a critical need to keep our nation's military installations and Kirtland specifically protected against terrorism, I believe that the Air Force can and should proceed in a way that meets the security needs of KAFB while ensuring continued public access to existing hiking and biking trails," Bingaman wrote. 
   "I am writing to ask that you carefully consider both interests as you deliberate on the placement of the eastern boundary perimeter fence," he wrote.
