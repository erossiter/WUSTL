SEN. BINGAMAN: CARLSBAD, COLUMBUS FIRE DEPARTMENTS AWARDED FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico fire departments will split a total of $164,089 from the federal government.  
 Funds were awarded through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant program, which is used to help fire departments acquire vehicles including pumpers, brush trucks, tankers, rescue vehicles and ambulances. 
   "It's essential that fire departments throughout the state have the training and equipment needed to respond to emergency situations," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that the federal government is pitching in to help ensure that fire departments in our state are prepared."
   The following fire departments were awarded:
   * Carlsbad Fire $102Department,314
   * Columbus Volunteer Fire $61Department,775
   Bingaman is an original cosponsor of S. 2411, the Assistance to Firefighters Act of 2004. This bill would reauthorize the Assistance to Firefighter Grant program (AFG), which provides much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
   Additionally, the bill makes it easier for fire departments serving small and rural communities to access federal funding by reducing the amount of matching funds they must raise.  
   The Bush Administration has consistently sought to slash funding for the grant program, calling it an "unneeded fire grant program" that "did not represent an appropriate responsibility of the Federal government." Bingaman said that as a state with many rural communities and a high threat of fires, New Mexico greatly benefits from this program and he will continue to support it.
