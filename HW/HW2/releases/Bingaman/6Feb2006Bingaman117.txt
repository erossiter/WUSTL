SEN. BINGAMAN: END OF AMTRAK SERVICE WOULD THREATEN NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today expressed his disappointment in the Bush Administration proposal to cut Amtrak services, which could result in the end of passenger rail service in New Mexico. 
   The Bush administration today presented Congress with its fiscal year 2007 budget proposal, which outlines the administration's spending priorities. The proposal makes deep cuts to Amtrak funding to $900 million in 2007 from $1.3 billion in 2006. 
   "Amtrak provides many of New Mexico's rural communities with a link to the rest of the country. Loss of service would dramatically impact their ability to attract new businesses and new jobs. I hope we can once again turn back the Bush Administrations proposal to gut Amtrak and provide the funding Amtrak needs to maintain all its New Mexico lines," Bingaman said.
   Amtrak maintains two lines that run through New Mexico. The Southwest Chief serves Raton, Las Vegas, Lamy, Albuquerque and Gallup and the Sunset Limited serves Deming and Lordsburg. The cut in funding would eliminate both of these rail lines. 
   The budget request submitted Monday by the White House to Congress is the first step in the annual appropriations process. Over the next several months, the House of Representatives and the Senate will proceed with the actual work of writing the federal budget. But the White House numbers serve as recommendations to Congress that could set the parameters of the budget debate.
