SEN. BINGAMAN: SENATE APPROVES ANTI-METH PLAN
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said the Senate has approved legislation aimed at helping families affected by methamphetamine use.  
   The Improving Outcomes for Children Affected by Meth Act of 2006 provides $40 million in new funding for family-centered treatments for methamphetamine addicted parents, and for other support services for their children. The funding could be used for: 
   * family-based drug treatment services; 
   * early intervention; 
   * counseling for children and families. 
   "Meth is having a devastating impact on families in our state. This funding could be used to help fight addiction, and assist families in recovering from the terrible affect meth is having on them," Bingaman said. 
   The bill also reauthorizes the Promoting Safe and Stable Families Program (PSSF), which provides states with federal funding for a variety of child welfare and family support services including adoption promotion. In addition, the bill significantly increases funding and improves access to child welfare programs for Indian Tribes. In 2006, New Mexico received $3.82 million for family support services across the state.
