SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS TO HONOR OTERO COUNTY VETERANS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the federal government is releasing funding he helped secure for a veterans museum in Otero County.  
   Bingaman secured $198,000 in a fiscal year 2006 spending bill for the museum. Otero County and the non-profit Armed Forces Museum are coming together to build a veterans museum on US Highway 82, east of Alamogordo. A 1.25 acre site has been acquired and $50,000 has already been raised for the project. About 7,000 items have been donated from area veterans for the museum. 
   "This veteran museum will honor the brave men and women from Otero County who have served their country proudly," Bingaman said.
