SEN. BINGAMAN MEETS WITH PRIME MINISTER BLAIR TO DISCUSS GLOBAL WARMING, AIDE TO AFRICA
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined Prime Minister Tony Blair and a few other senators at the British Embassy for breakfast and to discuss pressing issues such as global warming and aid to Africa.  
   Bingaman, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is working to include a provision in the Senate energy bill aimed at reducing the greenhouse gases associated with global warming. 
   "Prime Minister Tony Blair will lead the upcoming G8 summit in Scotland, and he has put climate change at the top of the agenda. I share the prime minister's concerns about global warming, and like him I would like to see steps taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions," Bingaman said. "I hope that in his meeting with President Bush that he was able to make a strong case for taking action." 
   G8 nations include the United States, United Kingdom, France, Russia, Italy, Germany, Japan, and Canada. 
   The Senate will begin debate on the energy bill next week. Bingaman worked closely with Senator Pete Domenici to draft legislation aimed at meeting the nation's future energy needs through conservation and increased production.
