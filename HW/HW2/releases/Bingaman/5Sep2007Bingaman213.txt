SEN. BINGAMAN: RED RIVER FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Red River Fire Department has been awarded a $475,000 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   Funding comes from the Vehicle Acquisition Program and can be used to purchase pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, aerials, foam units and fire boats. 
   "The funds awarded today will help ensure that Red River Fire Department can acquire the necessary vehicles it needs to be prepared for any emergency situation," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
