SEN. BINGAMAN: USDA EXPANDS GRAZING PROGRAM TO HELP RANCHERS IN TIME OF DROUGHT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the federal government is expanding a program that would help many New Mexico ranchers feed their livestock.  
   Bingaman said the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) is expanding the amount of acreage eligible through the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) for emergency haying and grazing. The availability of additional acreage will allow livestock producers from eligible counties to obtain needed hay or forage for their animals. The counties of Curry, Roosevelt, Harding, Quay, Union, and Lea and any producer within 150 miles of these eligible counties are eligible to apply for assistance. 
   "New Mexico's ranchers continue to suffer the consequences that weather conditions are having on their businesses," Bingaman said. "The expansion of this federal grazing program will be of great benefit to many of our state's ranchers and will provide them with a food supply for their livestock." 
   CRP is a voluntary program, which offers agricultural landowners annual rental payments and cost-share assistance to establish long-term, resource conserving covers on eligible land. Today's announcement will permit approved CRP participants to cut hay or graze livestock on CRP acreage, providing an additional food supply to producers whose pastures have been affected by drought. The Farm Service Agency will reduce the payment reduction from 25 percent to 10 percent. CRP participants who prepaid the 25 percent reduction will have the difference refunded. 
   The Farm Service Agency (FSA) has posted a map of counties approved for emergency haying and grazing with an approximate 150-mile radius on its web site www.fsa.usda.gov/dafp/cepd/hay_graze_status_7_13_06.jpg .
