SEN. BINGAMAN URGES USDA TO ACT NOW TO PREPARE FOR COUNTRY OF ORIGIN LABELING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has written to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns, urging him to take steps necessary to help meat and agricultural producers meet the September 26, 2006 date for instituting a Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) policy.  
   In a letter, Bingaman and several colleagues urged Johanns to immediately provide the finishing touches to the regulation guiding that process - one that is cost-effective and least burdensome to producers. 
   "U.S. producers have waited long enough and want to know that their products will be marketed as "Made in the U.S.A." Producers deserve to have sufficient time to fully understand and make necessary operational changes to minimize the burden of compliance," the senators wrote.
   The senators also asked that the regulation take into special consideration the impact on smaller cow/calf livestock operations, finding ways to ease the burden of compliance.
  "Our producers have waited long enough. Country of origin labeling is widely supported by producers and consumers. We ask that USDA immediately publish an interim final rule without further delay," the letter said. 
   Bingaman is also the cosponsor of legislation that would prevent the further delay of instituting COOL.
