SEN. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS AWARDED FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico communities have been awarded federal funds though the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. The following fire departments will use their grant to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.  
   * Porter Fire Department in San Jon $67,272 
   * Fairacres-Picacho Volunteer Fire $29,949 Department in Las Cruces 
   "Many New Mexico fire departments depend on federal funds to help keep them equipped and well-trained. This funding is an important investment in New Mexico's communities," Bingaman said. Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
