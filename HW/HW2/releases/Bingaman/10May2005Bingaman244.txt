SEN. BINGAMAN APPLAUDS NEW MEXICANS FOR PRESTIGIOUS PUBLIC SERVICE AWARD
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Bureau of Land Management (BLM) employee Manuel Guerra of New Mexico has been chosen to receive a prestigious a national award for his public service contributions.  
 The Socorro Field Off-Highway Vehicle Program Volunteers of New Mexico will also be awarded.
   The award comes from the U.S. Department of the Interior and recognizes Guerra's work as the BLM's Las Cruces Field Office's Recreation Facility Manager. Guerra oversees activities at four busy BLM recreation sites and supervises site staff. In 2004, he directed volunteers and contractors in remodeling a visitor center, volunteer host quarters and student housing at the Dripping Springs Natural Area. Guerra also oversaw the opening of the new trails in the Organ Mountains and was instrumental in preparing the site for hikers. 
   Additionally, Volunteers at the Socorro Field Off-Highway Vehicle Program of New Mexico will also be recognized for their work. The volunteer group helps educate visitors on the unique natural, cultural and recreational resources of the 6,000 acre Gordy's Hill Off-Highway Vehicle (OHV) Area. BLM estimates that in 2004, more than 7,000 people visited Gordy's Hill. The volunteers' work also includes resource management activities such as Global Positioning System (GPS) mapping of existing and proposed OHV routes. 
   "I'd like to congratulate Manuel Guerra and the volunteers at the Socorro Field Office Off-Highway Vehicle Program for their dedication and hard work," Bingaman said. "They are making a difference on public lands in our state."
