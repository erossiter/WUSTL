SEN. BINGAMAN ANNOUNCES ALBUQUERQUE-AREA STUDENTS NOMINATED TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced his nominees from Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Corrales, Tijeras and Los Lunas for admission to each of the nation's four military service academies.  
   Each year Bingaman selects students for nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy or the U.S. Naval Academy. The United States Military Service Academies are the country's premier officer training programs. 
   "The students I am nominating today have demonstrated a commitment to their communities and their education and now they are prepared to serve their country. I congratulate them for their accomplishments and am pleased to give them my recommendation for admission to our country's military service academies." Bingaman said. 
   The selection of nominees was based on the recommendations of Bingaman's Academy Nomination Review Board, which is made up of New Mexicans from around the state. The Board recommends candidates according to academic achievements, extracurricular activities and leadership potential. Each academy will make the final selection on admission.
