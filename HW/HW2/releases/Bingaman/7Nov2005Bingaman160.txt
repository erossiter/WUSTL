SEN. BINGAMAN SECURES $2 MILLION TO SUPPORT JOB CREATION IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that he has secured $2 million for New Mexico entities that promote the creation of jobs in our state.  
   The funding is included in the fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill which has been finalized and is ready to clear its final Congressional hurdle and be sent to the president.
   Bingaman secured $1 million for New Mexico State University's Arrowhead Center, which promotes entrepreneurship and business development. He also secured $1 million for the New Mexico Community Development Loan Fund/Women's Self-Sufficiency Team Corporation Cooperative Proposal, the premier alternative lender and technical assistance providers in New Mexico for small entrepreneurs typically unable to obtain capital through normal lending channels.  
   "Small businesses are the backbone of our state's economy. In order to create jobs in our state we must continue to support the organizations that work closely with entrepreneurs and help ensure that their good ideas get off the ground," Bingaman said. "This federal investment will be used to support the creation of good jobs in our state."
