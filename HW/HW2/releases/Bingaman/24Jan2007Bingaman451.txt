SEN. BINGAMAN CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN POSTAL SERVICE STAFFING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today raised concerns regarding reports that the United States Postal Service (USPS) is considering eliminating 40 positions in the Albuquerque and Rio Rancho service area.  
   The Albuquerque Journal this morning reported that USPS is planning to cut 40 mail sorting positions. 
   In a letter to Postmaster General John Potter, Bingaman today expressed his concerns regarding proposed job reductions, especially in light of continuing complaints over late mail delivery and staffing shortages at local facilities. 
   "New Mexico has suffered from poor postal service in recent years. My office continues to receive complaints regarding postal service throughout the state. Complaints in Albuquerque and Rio Rancho tend to center on long lines at post offices, late or missed delivery, and, in Rio Rancho, a lack of postal facilities to serve the public," Bingaman wrote. 
   Bingaman asked Potter to provide him with further information about the Postal Service's plans for the Albuquerque, Rio Rancho area. 
   "Mail service in our state has been consistently poor. It's hard to see how this would fit with an overall strategy of improving mail service in New Mexico," Bingaman said.
