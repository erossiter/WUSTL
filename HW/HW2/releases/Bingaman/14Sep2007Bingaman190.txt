SEN. BINGAMAN REACTS TO PRESIDENT BUSH'S ADDRESS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement reacting to President Bush's address to the nation. 
   "The idea that next summer - after we've drawn down troops - that we'll be back in the same position we were in last January does not represent substantial progress. I have real doubts about continuing with the current course of action. It seems to me it's not achieving the results we had hoped for or were promised," Bingaman said. 
  In his statement, Bush said he would begin reducing troop levels in Iraq in the coming months, cutting back to pre-surge troop levels by next summer. 
   Bingaman voted against the resolution to go to war in Iraq.
