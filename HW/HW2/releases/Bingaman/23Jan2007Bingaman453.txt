SENATORS INTRODUCE BILL TO NAME SANTA FE COURTHOUSE IN HONOR OF JUDGE SANTIAGO CAMPOS
  Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici today introduce legislation to designate the United States Courthouse in Santa Fe as the "Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse." Rep.Tom Udall introduces the same measure last week. Santiago Campos, appointed to the Federal Bench in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter, was the first Hispanic federal judge to serve in New Mexico.  
   "Naming the Santa Fe courthouse in honor of Judge Santiago Campos will help ensure that his service and dedication to the people of New Mexico and the country are never forgotten," Bingaman said. 
   "Santiago Campos was a groundbreaking judge who served with distinction on the federal bench. Naming the courthouse for him would be an appropriate way to honor his career," Domenici said. 
   Campos served as a seaman first class in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the Assistant Attorney General and then First Assistant Attorney General of New Mexico and was a district court judge in New Mexico's First Judicial District from 1971 to 1978. He was the prime mover in reestablishing federal court judicial activity in Santa Fe and had his chambers in the courthouse there for over 22 years. For his dedication to the state, Judge Campos received distinguished achievement awards in 1993 from both the State Bar of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico. 
   Campos held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from February 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989 and took senior status in 1992.
