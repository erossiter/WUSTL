SEN. BINGAMAN VOTES AGAINST FLAWED IMMIGRATION BILL
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today voted against a bill that would have replaced a broken immigration system with one that was equally flawed.  
   Bingaman tried to make improvements to the legislation. The bill contained a provision he wrote to provide millions of dollars to border law enforcement agencies. Bingaman also won support for a proposal to cap the number of guest workers who could enter the country annually through the new "Y-1" program at 200,000. 
   But Bingaman concluded that the bill was not good policy. He released the following statement: 
   "I support comprehensive immigration reform, which is why I voted for the bill we passed last year. As a senator from a border state, I am well aware of the fact that our immigration system is broken and I strongly believe that this is an issue that needs to be addressed. 
   However, it's critical for us to replace the broken system with one that is both workable and addresses the shortcomings that exist under current law. Whatever legislation we pass is likely to be in place for many years to come, and I am deeply concerned that the immigration bill, as it was drafted, wasn't going to accomplish many of its stated goals. 
   Replacing our broken immigration system with the dysfunctional one outlined in this bill does not make sense. 
   As written, this legislation created an unnecessarily complicated guest worker program that would have depressed American wages and encouraged immigrants to overstay their visas, while making dramatic changes - but not necessarily for the better - to the process individuals would use to legally immigrate to our country. 
   For these reasons, I could not support this legislation."
