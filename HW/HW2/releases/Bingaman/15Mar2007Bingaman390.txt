SEN. BINGAMAN VOTES TO SUPPORT TROOPS, CHANGE MISSION IN IRAQ
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today voted to support American troops, and to press President Bush to change course in Iraq.  
   Bingaman supported a non-binding proposal stating that Congress should provide funds for troops in the field and set aside funding to provide adequate health care to veterans when they return. That measure passed overwhelmingly. Bingaman supported another binding proposal directing President Bush to change the mission in Iraq by redeploying our troops in the next 120 days to training, force protection, and targeted counter-terror. That resolution narrowly failed. 
   "In 2002, I voted against the resolution to go to war because I believed it was an open-ended and broad grant of authority," Bingaman said. "Like millions of Americans, I am very concerned about the deteriorating situation in Iraq, which is why I voted today to change course."
