SEN. BINGAMAN: ARROWHEAD/NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY AWARDED $2 MILLION
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman announced today that the Arrowhead Center at New Mexico State University has been awarded a $2 million grant from the U.S. Department of Energy.  
   Under the contract, Arrowhead and NMSU will work with partners on and off campus to implement a National Security Preparedness Project. The project consists of two parts. The first aims to validate developing technologies to be incorporated into the National Nuclear Security Administration. Second, the center will develop a business incubation for start-up companies related to nuclear preparedness. 
   "This grant is acknowledgement that the Arrowhead Center is a very important resource that we can tap for the benefit of the entire country," Bingaman said.
