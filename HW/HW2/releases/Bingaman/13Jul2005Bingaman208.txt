SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO CHILE INDUSTRY TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that New Mexico's chile industry will benefit from a $53,000 federal grant. 
   Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Federal-State Marketing Improvement Program and will help New Mexico State University - New Mexico Chile Commission partnership, along with other industry partners, to explore and implement new handling methods and packaging for fresh green chile. Funds will also help educate consumers about the many uses of fresh green chile and to expand marketing opportunities for this regional specialty product.
   "New Mexico is the country's leading producer of chile and it is an important contributor to the state's economy. I am pleased this federal grant will be invested in our chile industry helping it to grow," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is currently working to secure a $200,000 grant from the Economic Development Administration for the New Mexico Chile Task Force. The task force works to identify the best management practices that will help increase yield and profitability for chile growers. If awarded, the funding would be used to implement the following projects: 
   * Commodity systems review: study of infrastructure needs and changes brought about by mechanizing due to market pressures. Work to create a list of new technologies for the mechanization.
   * Storage capacity: investigate new methods for storing red chile to make the production season longer for local red chile growers;
   * Marketing and food technology : exploring global markets for green and red chile, and identifying how to access those markets;
   * Labor review : determine how mechanization will affect the labor involved in this industry and what can the public sector do to mitigate any displacement that may occur with mechanization.
