SEN. BINGAMAN HOPES CONGRESS WILL TACKLE IRAQ, ENERGY, EDUCATION, HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES IN 110TH CONGRESS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman, who was sworn in for his fifth six-year term, today said he is hopeful that the 110th Congress will begin to immediately address the nation's serious challenges.  
   "Our country faces very serious issues. We need to become more energy independent so that we can rely less on the most volatile parts of the globe. We must find a way to make health care more affordable for those who are fortunate enough to have health insurance, and accessible to the millions of Americans who do not. We need to make investments in education now to ensure that we remain competitive in the global marketplace in the future. And, of course, we must find a way bring our troops home from Iraq," Bingaman said. 
   "The only way we'll be able to make any progress on any of these issues is to work across party lines," he said. 
   Beginning today, Bingaman assumed the chairmanship of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. In a speech on the Senate floor today he said: 
   "The Committee of Energy and Natural Resources has a strong tradition of bipartisan accomplishment that I plan on continuing in this new Congress. I look forward to working with my colleague, Senator Pete Domenici, and all the members of the Committee as we forge an effective path forward to promote our energy and energy-related environmental security."
