SEN. BINGAMAN EXPRESSES CONCERNS OVER POTENTIAL JOB CUTS AT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said he is disappointed that Los Alamos National Laboratory's financial situation is requiring potential cuts of between 500-750 jobs.  
   "Los Alamos National Laboratory is one of the finest institutions of its kind in the world, and LANL employees perform a tremendous service to our nation," Bingaman said. "It is extremely disappointing that job cuts must even be considered." 
   "I will continue working with the Senate leadership and the New Mexico congressional delegation to get the highest level of funding for both of our state's national laboratories," he added. 
   On a related note, Bingaman pointed out that the Senate leadership has been trying for months to enact spending bills that for the first time in several years give a greater emphasis to domestic spending. They have proposed spending $22 billion more than President Bush requested to fund the government. 
   Because Bush has vetoed one spending bill and threatened to veto others, congressional leaders have agreed to reduce proposed domestic spending by $11 billion. Bingaman is concerned that reducing proposed domestic spending could have a negative impact on the labs' budget.
