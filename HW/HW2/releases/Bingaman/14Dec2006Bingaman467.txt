SEN. BINGAMAN: DOT SEEKS REQUEST FOR PROPOSALS FOR COMMERCIAL AIR SERVICE TO HOBBS, CARLSBAD
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that the U.S. Department of Transportation is seeking requests for proposals for commercial air service to Hobbs and Carlsbad.  
   The request was made from DOT's Essential Air Service Program, which helps ensure smaller communities can afford commercial air service. Currently, EAS subsidizes air service through Mesa Airlines. 
   "Air service is an important factor in helping communities keep and recruit jobs," Bingaman said. 
   DOT is seeking proposals for a two year contract, beginning June 1, 2007. The agency will review all proposals and award a contract.
   Contact: Jude McCartin and Maria Najera, 202/224-5521.
