  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman announced today that the federal government is releasing $9.99 million he helped secure for Cannon Air Force Base in a FY 2005 spending bill. 
   Funding will be used for the construction of a 28,000 square foot facility to house an airmen center, dining facility and post office at Cannon Air Force Base. 
   "The funding released today will help make needed improvements at Cannon, and help ensure that the base can properly accommodate all the needs of its airmen and women," Bingaman said.
