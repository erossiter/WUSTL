SENATE APPROVES SEN. BINGAMAN'S AMENDMENT ENSURING NATIONAL LAB SCIENTISTS CAN ASSIST WITH NATIONAL SECURITY
  The U.S. Senate today adopted a measure written by Sen.  
 Jeff Bingaman that allows national laboratory scientists to continue assisting governmental agencies responsible for our national security.
   The Senate is currently debating the National Intelligence Reform Bill, legislation aimed at overhauling the Central Intelligence Agency. The bill closely follows recommendations outlined in the 9/11 Commission report released during the summer.
   The bill as introduced did not specifically allow for the continuation of a practice that encouraged national laboratory scientists to offer their intelligence expertise to various governmental agencies. Over the years, national laboratory scientists from Sandia and Los Alamos and other national laboratories have advised such entities as the National Counterterrorism Center and the Joint Atomic Intelligence Committee, which produce strategic assessments on foreign nuclear weapons programs. 
   Lab scientists have also helped produce technical design handbooks on foreign nuclear weapons and assisted special mission units to disable improvised nuclear devices, just to name a few.   
   Bingaman's amendment, which was cosponsored by Senator Pete Domenici, specifically authorizes national laboratory staff with intelligence expertise to continue offering their assistance to governmental entities.
