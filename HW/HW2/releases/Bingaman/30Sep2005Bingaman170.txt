SEN. BINGAMAN CONGRATULATES MONTE VISTA ELEMENTARY SCHOOL FOR RECEIVING NATIONAL RECOGNITION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today congratulated Monte Vista Elementary School for being named a "state champion" by the President's Council on Physical Fitness.  
   Monte Vista was selected for its demonstrated commitment to physical activity. Students competed on the school's behalf, demonstrating the ability to score at or above the 85th percentile in several fitness categories. Those categories included a one mile walk/run for heart and lung endurance; curl-ups for abdominal strength; a sit and reach stretch for flexibility; pull-ups for upper body strength; and a shuttle run for agility. 
   "Too many of our nation's young people are overweight and therefore unhealthy. I applaud schools like Monte Vista that see the value in ensuring their students exercise their bodies as well as their minds," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman has focused attention in Washington on the problem of obesity, particularly among young people. Last week he won support in the Senate for an amendment he wrote that doubles to $20 million the amount the federal government sets aside for nutrition education in schools. In seeking support for his measure, Bingaman said the $10 million the U.S. Department of Agriculture spends annually is enough to provide funding to only 21 states. New Mexico does not currently receive funding. 
   Bingaman's amendment was made part of the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture spending bill, which the Senate is expected to pass this week.
