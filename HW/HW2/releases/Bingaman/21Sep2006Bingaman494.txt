SEN. BINGAMAN URGES KEY NEGOTIATORS TO SUPPORT $275 MILLION FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged four key negotiators finalizing a major spending bill to keep intact an amendment that sets aside $275 million to fight fires in the Western United States. Bingaman was the sponsor of the amendment, which was made part of the fiscal year 2007 Defense Spending Bill.  
   In a letter to Senators Ted Stevens and Daniel Inouye and Representatives Bill Young and John Murtha - the four members of Congress negotiating the final version of the defense bill - Bingaman said the funding is needed because the Forest Service and the Department of the Interior are on the verge of exhausting their fire suppression funds. 
   Nearly nine million acres burned this year, which is nearly double the 10-year average. Without additional funding, federal agencies will have to cancel and delay projects, including forest restoration and hazardous fuels reduction initiatives. 
   Bingaman's amendment, which was cosponsored by U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, appropriates $100 million for the Department of Interior and $175 million for the U.S. Department of Agriculture. 
   "The Forest Service and Department of the Interior are expected to exhaust their appropriated funds for wildfire suppression well before the end of this fiscal year, and this money will be necessary to cover those expenses and repay funds that were borrowed from other accounts," Bingaman and others wrote.
