SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHOULD STEP-UP COUNTER DRUG & AND EDUCATION EFFORTS TO FIGHT METH USE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said the federal government should take steps to tackle the use of methamphetamines by stepping-up drug interdiction efforts and increasing funding for a national anti-meth campaign.  
   Bingaman today participated in a Senate Finance Committee hearing titled "Breaking the Methamphetamine Supply Chain: Meeting Challenges at the Border." He said one way to reduce meth addiction is to mount an aggressive education campaign aimed at reducing meth use and meth-related crime. Bingaman has secured $500,000 for anti-meth education efforts in New Mexico, but he believes a sustained national campaign is also necessary. 
   "Meth has taken a toll on our state. While we continue to ensure law enforcement has the tools they need to deal with the serious problem, we also need to devote a lot more resources to ensuring young people never get hooked on this deadly drug," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also said the federal government must ramp up efforts to crack down on the smuggling of meth into the United States from Mexico. Law enforcement has determined that while less meth is being manufactured in the United States much larger quantities are coming across the border. 
   Toward this end, Bingaman has secured $3 million for the New Mexico National Guard's Counter Drug Support Program in the Senate's version of the fiscal year 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill, which cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee last week. He also has secured more than $6 million for the counter drug effort in the previous three years. 
   "We need to do a much better job cracking down on drug smuggling from Mexico," Bingaman said.
