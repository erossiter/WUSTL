SEN. BINGAMAN CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATION TO PROMOTE COMPUTER SERVER ENERGY EFFICIENCY
  A bill co-sponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman was introduced with the goal of promoting efficient energy use in computer servers.  
   Currently, computer servers - computers that share resources with other computers on a network - consume $3.3 billion worth of energy annually. And the costs are expected to rise with the increase in the number of servers, which is expected to go to 4.9 billion in 2009 from 2.8 billion in 2005. The "Energy Efficient Computer Server Act" (S. 3684) would require that the EPA analyze this energy consumption and identify ways to use energy more efficiently. 
   "This EPA analysis would help find ways to conserve the amount of energy consumed in two areas where energy use will skyrocket in the next few years," Bingaman said. "This legislation has already been passed by overwhelming numbers in the House and it is essential in promoting energy efficient technology."
