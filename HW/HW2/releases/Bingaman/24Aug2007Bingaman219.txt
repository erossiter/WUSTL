SEN. BINGAMAN URGES FAA TO MOVE QUICKLY TO ESTABLISH AIR SERVICE FROM ROSWELL TO DALLAS/FORT WORTH
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman this week urged the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to sign off on improved commercial air transportation in southeastern New Mexico.  
   The City of Roswell has an agreement with American Eagle Airlines for regional jet service between Dallas/Fort Worth and Roswell. Twice-daily service is slated to begin on September 5th, but is contingent on FAA's completing and approving the required environmental assessment. 
   In a telephone call to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey earlier this week, Bingaman pressed the federal agency to expedite the review of the environmental assessment for Roswell's new jet service in time for flights to begin on September 5th as planned. 
   "Expanded air service from Roswell to Dallas/Forth Worth will be a great benefit to the southeastern New Mexico's economy and will help attract businesses and jobs to the area. For this reason I have urged FAA to help clear this final hurdle that is needed before American Eagle is cleared for takeoff," Bingaman said. "I was assured the agency will do what they can to move the environmental assessment along."
