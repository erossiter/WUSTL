SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS STUDENTS FOR SUMMER INTERNSHIPS IN WASHINGTON
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today encouraged students to apply for a summer internship in his Washington office. The application deadline is March 31. The internships are open to college and university undergraduate students who attend school in New Mexico or attend school in the state.  
   The internship program is designed to educate New Mexico students about the political process and to allow them to gain experience in the daily operations of a U.S. Senate office. Summer interns will work five 40-hour weeks in Bingaman's Capitol Hill office during one of two sessions: 
   First session: May 27 - June 27 
  Second session: June 30 - August 1 
   Applicants are required to complete an intern application form, as well as provide a resume, three letters of reference, a writing sample and answers to three essay questions. 
   Because of continued delays in mail delivery to Senate offices in Washington, students are encouraged to complete and submit the application online at: http://bingaman.senate.gov. The link to internship information is located under the "Services and Programs" section on the main page. Students may also submit a printed version via fax at (202) 224-2852. 
   Students who apply on Bingaman's home page will input their resume information, writing sample and answers to three essay questions into the page's special application forms. Letters of reference should be submitted by fax or e-mailed by the writer to interns@bingaman.senate.gov To confirm receipt of completed applications, students can call (202) 224-5521. 
   Intern positions in Bingaman's state offices are also available. Please contact state offices for more information.
