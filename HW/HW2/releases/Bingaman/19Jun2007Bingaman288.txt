SEN. BINGAMAN: ALBUQUERQUE ANTI-DRUG AND VIOLENCE 'WEED & SEED' INITIATIVE AWARDED $200,000
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the Albuquerque Department of Family and Community Services has been awarded a total of $200,000 for its comprehensive anti-drug and violence "Weed and Seed" program. 
   The funds provided today will be used by law enforcement to support efforts to decrease the presence of drug houses and drug dealers, and to reduce crime related to gangs, drugs and alcohol. Community policing goals include increasing coordination and cooperation among law enforcement, neighborhood associations, business, community members, youth and other entities in the community.
   "This funding will provide law enforcement with the tools they need to help eradicate crime and keep neighborhoods safe," Bingaman said.
   The grant will benefit Albuquerque's Eastside Weed & Seed site, which was recognized by the U.S. Department of Justice as an official Weed and Seed site in May 2003.
   A multi-agency initiative, Weed and Seed coordinates the delivery of criminal justice and social services to eliminate violent crime, drug trafficking and drug-related crime. The program "weeds" out criminal offenders engaged in drug crimes and violent offenses through targeted law enforcement and criminal justice services. Once a targeted area is stabilized through community policing, service agencies "seed" the neighborhood with housing, employment and revitalization opportunities.
