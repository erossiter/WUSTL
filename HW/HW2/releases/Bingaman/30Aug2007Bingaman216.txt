SEN. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO PUEBLOS TO BENEFIT FROM HUD FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico pueblos will benefit from a total of $3.4 million in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, which helps meet the needs of low-income communities.  
   "This funding for Indian communities across the state will help meet the housing needs of many. I am pleased the federal government is making this important investment," Bingaman said. 
   Funds were awarded to the following pueblos: 
   Pueblo of Zuni $679,731 
   Nambe Pueblo Housing Entity $2.73 million 
   The ICDBG program aims to help with the development of viable Native American communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
