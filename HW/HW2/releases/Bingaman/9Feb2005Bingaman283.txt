SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico fire departments have been awarded funds through the Department of Homeland Security.  
   "It's essential that fire departments throughout the state have the training and equipment necessary to respond to emergency situations," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that the federal government is pitching in to help ensure that fire departments in our state are prepared."
   Sunland Park Fire Department in Southern New Mexico will receive $166,500 for a firefighting vehicle. La Luz Fire Department near Alamogordo was awarded $71,188 for operation and firefighter safety programs.
   The grant was awarded through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighter Grant program, which is used to help fire departments acquire vehicles including pumpers, brush trucks, tankers, rescue vehicles and ambulances.
   Bingaman said he was disappointed that the president's 2006 budget, which he sent to congress on Monday, cut funding for the grant program by $150 million, going from $650 million in 2005 to $500 million in 2006. 
   The Bush Administration last year also recommended slashing funding for the grant program, calling it an "unneeded fire grant program" that "did not represent an appropriate responsibility of the Federal government." Bingaman said that as a state with many rural communities and a high threat of fires, New Mexico greatly benefits from this program and he will continue to fight to maintain adequate funding.
