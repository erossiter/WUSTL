SEN. BINGAMAN PROVISION WOULD INCREASE PORT HOURS AT SANTA TERESA
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that a bill passed by the Senate contains a provision he authored to extend commercial hours of operation at the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.  
   Bingaman's provision, which was cosponsored by U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, would extend hours at Santa Teresa to at least 16 hours a day, up from 10. Current staffing levels at Santa Teresa are not conducive to the flow of commercial traffic. 
   "By expanding the hour of operation at the Santa Teresa we can increase commercial traffic at our state's ports of entry," Bingaman said. "That, in turn, will help bolster New Mexico's economy." 
   "I'm pleased the Senate has adopted this amendment to keep the Santa Teresa Port of Entry open longer. Doing so will allow for greater commerce between southern New Mexico and Mexico, and it will improve Santa Teresa's standing as a viable alternative to the crowded El Paso crossing. It makes sense to keep Santa Teresa open longer to encourage economic development in the region," Domenici said. 
   The provision is part of the Port Security bill, which authorizes an increase in federal funding to improve safety at our nation's ports. 
   Bingaman was also able to put the same provision in a separate measure - the Customs and Trade Facilitation Reauthorization Act of 2006, to increase the chances of getting it enacted into law. The Senate will debate that measure later this month.
