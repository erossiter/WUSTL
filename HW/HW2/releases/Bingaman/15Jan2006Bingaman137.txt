SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS IN CELEBRATING MARTIN LUTHER KING JR'S LIFE, LEGACY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman released the following statement on the life and legacy of Dr.  
 Martin Luther King, Jr.:
   "As we celebrate the 77th anniversary of Dr. Martin Luther King's birth, it is important to not only reflect upon the life and legacy of this civil rights leader, but also to renew our commitment to the fight for equality.
  "The struggle for racial equality in the United States did not begin with Dr. King's 1955 non-violent bus boycott, nor did it end when he was so tragically taken from us in April of 1968. Indeed, the NAACP has been working to "ensure the political, educational, social and economic equality rights of all persons" since 1909. That struggle continues today. 
  "As a U.S. Senator, I will continue to support polices that reflect the ideals of racial equality that Dr. King fought to institute and uphold. We need to do more to ensure equal access to employment, healthcare, and higher education. And as we have seen in past two presidential elections, there is a critical need to improve the election process to ensure that all citizens are able to participate in the democratic process. 
  "Dr. King's service and devotion to the civil rights movement demonstrates the qualities of courage, determination, and an unwavering faith in the equality of all people. Let us continue to look to Dr. King's life as a leading example of the work each of us should undertake to end racial discrimination and bring equality to all Americans."
