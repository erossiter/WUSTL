SEN. BINGAMAN PRESSES FOR DAY OF RECOGNITION FOR RANCHERS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman is once again cosponsoring a resolution to recognize the "American Cowboy."  
   The Senate resolution acknowledges the role of ranchers in the development of the West. The resolution states that ranchers embody our nation's strong work ethic, are good stewards of the environment, and play a major role in our nation's economy. This year American Cowboy day is July 26, 2008. 
   Approximately 800,000 ranchers are in business across the country. New Mexico ranchers generated $964 million in sales in 2005, the most recent year for which numbers are available. In terms of agriculture production, only the dairies are a larger industry in New Mexico than ranching. 
   "Ranching in New Mexico is not just a tradition; it's a way of life. This bill would recognize the hard working men and women of our state who continue to keep ranching alive," Bingaman said. 
   The resolution encourages communities across the country to observe July 26, 2008 as the National Day of the American Cowboy, and mark the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
