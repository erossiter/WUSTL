AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL CONTAINS FUNDS SEN. BINGAMAN SOUGHT FOR NEW MEXICO
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a spending bill being written in the Senate contains funding for several key New Mexico initiatives.  
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the fiscal year 2008 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which contains the $500,000 Bingaman requested for the Fresh Fruits and Vegetables Pilot program. The New Mexico program provides students with healthy snacks. Funds are awarded through a competitive process and would benefit many of New Mexico's schools. Bingaman secured $1 million in fiscal year 2006 to begin the program. 
   "Healthy eating habits are an important part of a child's educational curriculum. The funding included in this bill will help New Mexico schools continue this crucial program," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman said he was pleased the bill also contained $250,000 he requested to restore and maintain riparian areas along the Rio Grande, Pecos and Canadian Rivers where the state is working to treat and kill the noxious salt cedar. 
   "I am pleased this bill includes funding to continue the battle against the salt cedar that plagues our state's river banks," Bingaman said. 
   The bill also contains funding for the following: 
   * $24 million to continue a Bingaman-created grant program that supports community development projects in Native American communities. Many Indian communities lack basic drinking water and wastewater facilities; tribal colleges are often housed in rundown, decrepit or even condemned buildings; and capital to start and expand job-creating small businesses is in short supply. This funding aims to help deal with those needs. 
   * $25 million for water and wastewater projects in colonias along the U.S.-Mexico border. New Mexico is expected to get about $7.9 million of this funding. 
   * $2.4 million New Mexico State University's (NMSU) Agricultural Products Food Safety Lab: This funding would be used to continue operation of the Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory for the FDA's food safety program. The lab is developing and evaluating rapid-screening methods to detect contamination in food products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Bingaman secured $2.15 million to operate the lab in FY2005 and $2.35 million in FY2006. 
   * $990,000 for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Management. The institute conducts research on agricultural, range management, animal husbandry, education and extension programs. The institute is a joint effort of NMSU, Texas A&M and Montana State. 
   * $841,000 for USDA to contract with the Albuquerque-based National Tribal Environmental Council to continue a Native American circuit rider program to provide technical assistance for rural water systems.
   * $542,000 for NMSU and the State Department of Agriculture to continue work on an Internet-based system for early detection and reporting of outbreaks of infectious diseases in food animals. The system is known as the Rapid Syndrome Validation Program for Animals. 
   At Bingaman's request, the bill contains a provision urging the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to use available funding to provide testing, monitoring, surveillance, and other services, to the New Mexico Livestock Board as needed to help control and eradicate bovine tuberculosis (TB) in the state. TB testing is currently required in portions of Curry and Roosevelt Counties. 
   The bill will now be considered by the full Senate.
