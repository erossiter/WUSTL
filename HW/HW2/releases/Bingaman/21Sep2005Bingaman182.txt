SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS TO BENEFIT FROM HOMELAND SECURITY GRANTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico fire departments have been awarded funds through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   The grant will be used to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment and modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   The following fire departments were awarded:
   * Logan Volunteer Fire Department $32,804
   * Taos County - Amalia Ventero Volunteer Fire Department $20,947
   "The proper training and equipment can go a long way in helping prevent fires. I am pleased that this funding is being made available to provide fire departments in Taos and Logan with access to preventative training," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
