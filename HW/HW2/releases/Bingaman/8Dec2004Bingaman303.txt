SEN. BINGAMAN: SPENDING BILL FUNDS LAS CRUCES COURTHOUSE
  A key spending bill signed into law today contains funding sought by Sen. Jeff Bingaman to construct a new federal courthouse in Las Cruces. The measure also contains funding for key initiatives in Dona Ana, Hidalgo, Sierra, Lincoln, and Otero counties. 
   The fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Spending Bill contains more than $60 million for the construction of a new courthouse that would house the district court, bankruptcy court, probation office, pretrial services office, U.S. Trustee, and Marshals Services. The current facility, the Runnels Federal Building, has serious security and operational problems due to a significant shortage of space. In fact, the Judicial Conference - an organization set up by Congress to serve as the principal policy making body for the administration of U.S. Courts - declared a space emergency in Las Cruces. In the last 16 years, the conference declared only one other such emergency, in Brooklyn, New York. 
   "This new courthouse is badly needed and it's good news that we were able to secure the funding this year to construct it," Bingaman said. 
   It has been some time since the Governmental Services Administration (GSA) discovered that the total cost for construction was likely to be closer to $69 million. Knowing this, Bingaman worked with the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to authorize a higher level of funding. As a result of Bingaman's efforts a key Senate committee has agreed to authorize $68.379 million for the project. Authorization is required before funds can be released. Bingaman is working to secure any additional funding that may be needed for this project. 
   The spending bill approved today also contains $100,000 for water improvements in Lordsburg. The Environmental Protection Agency has informed Lordsburg that the city's drinking water is high in fluoride, which is a health concern. This funding will be used for preliminary engineering design. 
   "It's important to address this health issue as quickly as possible. This funding will be used to take the first step toward designing a system that will do a better job of removing excess fluoride," Bingaman said. 
   Also benefiting Hidalgo County is a $100,000 appropriation for Hidalgo Medical Services. The funding would upgrade Med Square Clinic, operated by Hidalgo Medical Services, to improve primary medical, dental, mental health and family support services throughout the region.
   Bingaman said he is pleased that the spending bill contains $6.5 million for desalination research and development, including $3.5 million to continue construction of the Tularosa Basin Research Facility in New Mexico. 
   "Water is fast becoming our most precious resource in the West. Desalination research and development could help us to make the most of the resources we do have," Bingaman said.
   The bill also contains the following
  * $15,000 to support New Mexico State University, College of Education, Southern New Mexico 
   Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy (SNM SEMAA) 
   The SNM SEMAA program promotes increasing science and math achievement for all students, especially those under-represented in the science, math, and engineering fields. The impact of the additional funding would allow the program to increase the number of students served.
   * $125,000 La Clinica de Familia CHC in Las Cruces. This funding will support promotoras/community health workers program. Promotoras are community health advocates that are trained to promote health education and wellness in their communities and serve as connectors between health care consumers and providers to promote health among groups that have traditionally lacked access to adequate health care. These community health workers also undertake activities such as assisting families in enrolling low-income children and pregnant women into Medicaid/CHIP.
   * $50,000 for New Mexico State University and Dona Ana Branch Community College to expand its manufacturing bridge program. New Mexico State University (NMSU) and Dona Ana Branch Community College (DABCC) have partnered with Gadsden High School in southern Dona Ana County to offer a new bridge program specifically designed for technical careers in the manufacturing area. Funding is requested to continue and expand this program, from the Gadsden School District to the Las Cruces School District. 
   * $150,000 - Do?a Ana County Command Post Vehicle Funding would be used for a Specialty Command Post Vehicle for the Do?a Ana County Sheriff's Department. The vehicle would greatly improve the ability to respond to criminal activity and enhance communication interoperability between law enforcement agencies along the U.S.-Mexico border. 
   * $2.15 million for New Mexico State University's Agricultural Products Food Safety Lab: This funding would be used to continue operation of the Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory for the FDA's food safety program. The lab is developing and evaluating rapid-screening methods to detect contamination in food products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Bingaman secured $1.9 million to operate the lab in 2004.
   * $1.3 million for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Management: The institute conducts research on agricultural, range management, animal husbandry, education and extension programs. The institute is a joint effort of NMSU, Texas A&M and Montana State. 
   * $150,000 for the City of Elephant Butte. The city plans a multi-phase effort to build a wastewater collection and treatment system in the north area of Sierra County. 
   * $25 million for water and wastewater projects in Colonias along the U.S.-Mexico border. New Mexico can expect to get about $7.9 million of this funding. 
   * $50 million for the United States-Mexico Border Program: Created in the wake of the North American Free Trade Agreement, this program is helping to make environmental infrastructure projects affordable for communities throughout the border region by combining grant funds with loans or guarantees for projects that would otherwise be financially unfeasible. This funding is shared by border states.
  * $3 million for the Ultra-Long-Duration Balloon Project, New Mexico State University: The Ultra-Long-Duration Balloon Project seeks to develop balloon systems capable of carrying payloads that weigh several tons to 40 kilometers for flights that last several months. 
   * $2.5 million for the Southwest Center for Environmental Research and Policy-SCERP: Funding would be used to support the ongoing work of a consortium of five U.S. universities (New Mexico State, Arizona State, San Diego State, University of Texas at El Paso, and Utah) and four Mexican universities that performs applied research and develop policy issues that are deemed practical for border communities. Bingaman secured $2.5 million in 2004.
   * $600,000 to finalize the report on reconstructing 43.5 miles of levees along the Rio Grande, including rehabilitation of the San Marcial railroad bridge which is critical to complying with the Middle Rio Grande ESA biological opinion.
