SEN. BINGAMAN REACTS TO IRAQ STUDY GROUP'S REPORT
Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement about the Iraq Study Group's recommendations for improving the situation in Iraq.  
 "The report essentially says the Bush Administration's current policies in Iraq and the Middle East are not working. It also makes clear that no matter what steps we take to extricate ourselves from this situation, it will continue to be at a great cost to our country - both in lives and resources. 
 "I will carefully study this report, and I hope that the Administration does as well, to see what it can tell us about our future actions in Iraq."
