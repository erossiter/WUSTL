SENS. BINGAMAN, ALEXANDER URGE INCREASED SCIENCE FUNDING IN CONTINUING RESOLUTION
  Sens. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Lamar Alexander (R-TN) are circulating a letter urging appropriators to ensure that the proposed Department of Energy Office of Science budget is not cut this year. More than 15 Senators have already signed. The letter, which is still circulating, will go to Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman Byron Dorgan and Ranking Republican Pete Domenici.  
   "The Office of Science funds much of our nation's leading edge R&D, and it would be a big mistake to allow the proposed budget to be cut. We should do everything we can to make sure the Office of Science is adequately funded not only this year, but for years to come," Bingaman said. 
   "Even during times of tight budgets, we need to make this pro-growth investment in scientific research to grow new jobs and keep them from being shipped overseas," said Alexander. "The work at our national laboratories must move ahead at full steam if we are to keep our competitive edge in this global economy." 
   The President's budget for Fiscal Year 2007 requested an increase of $500 million for the Office of Science -from $3.6 billion to $4.1 billion. The senators' letter 
   In their letter, the Senators wrote: "This level of funding is justified in a time of increasing dependence on overseas sources of energy, and where U.S. industry is finding it easier every day to outsource R&D talent overseas." Noting the challenge posed by China and other global competitors, the letter continues, "The Office of Science is at the forefront of our efforts to compete in this global economy." 
   As the letter notes, flat-line funding could result in: 
   * Closure of laboratory facilities that scientists from across the country can apply to use, such as Oak Ridge's Spallation Neutron Source; 
   * Increased construction costs for new facilities; 
   * Layoffs of hundreds of scientists, engineers and support staff, and 
   * A sharp reduction of university programs. 
   The letter mirrors one the two Senators spearheaded last year that garnered the signatures of 70 Senators. A copy of both letters is attached along with the names of the 70 Senators who signed on to support Office of Science funding last year.
