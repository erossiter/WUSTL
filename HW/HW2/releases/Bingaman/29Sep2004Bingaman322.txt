SEN. BINGAMAN: NATIONAL TRIBAL ENVIRONMENTAL COUNCIL AWARDED $750,000 FEDERAL GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was pleased to announce a $750,000 grant to the National Tribal Environmental Council.  
 The Council offers technical assistance and training to managers of tribal drinking water systems. The organization advises tribes in New Mexico, North Dakota, South Dakota, Alaska, Wisconsin, Utah and California.  
   "The National Tribal Environmental Council is a resource that tribal water utility managers across the country can tap into. This funding will be used to support the important work the Council does," Bingaman said.
   The grant comes through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development fund.  
   Last week, Bingaman reported that the fiscal year 2005 Agriculture Spending Bill contains $800,000 for USDA to contract with National Tribal Environmental Council to continue providing technical assistance for rural water systems.
