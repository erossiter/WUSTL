SEN. BINGAMAN PRESSES FOR AIR SERVICE FROM CLOVIS TO ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Bush Administration to continue providing air service from Clovis to Albuquerque.  
   Last month, Bingaman joined in calling on the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to renew their contract with Great Lakes Airlines to continue providing air service to Clovis through the Essential Air Service Program. Unfortunately, DOT ignored Clovis's request and awarded the contract for flights to Denver instead of Albuquerque. 
   In a telephone call to a top DOT official, Bingaman made it clear that the city was seeking continued air service to Albuquerque. 
   "While I was pleased to hear that the Great Lakes Airlines has been chosen to continue providing Essential Air Service from Clovis, I was confused as to why Denver was chosen over Albuquerque as the destination for these flights," Bingaman said. "I hope DOT will take my concerns, as well as the concerns of Clovis officials, into consideration and correct this mix-up." 
   Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before deregulation continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico has a total of 5 EAS communities: Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs and Silver City.
