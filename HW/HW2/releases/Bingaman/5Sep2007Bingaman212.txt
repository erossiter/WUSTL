SEN. BINGAMAN: AMERICAN EAGLE LANDS IN ROSWELL
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today joined in celebrating American Eagle's new non-stop air service between Roswell and Dallas/Ft. Worth (DFW). The first jet flight from DFW to Roswell landed today at approximately 1:00 p.m. MST.  
   Bingaman, a strong supporter of the project, was instrumental in helping the Southeast New Mexico Air Service Coalition (which consists of the cities of Roswell, Artesia, as well as Carlsbad and Chaves and Eddy counties and the Chaves County Development Foundation) build federal support for the twice daily service. Bingaman worked directly with the Federal Aviation Administration to expedite approval of the Environmental Assessment that was needed before air service could begin. 
   "This new air service will open many doors for the region and will serve as an important economic development tool for the area. I applaud and congratulate everyone who worked hard to bring regional jet service to the people of southeastern New Mexico," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also worked with the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) to ensure security screeners were in place in time for today's flight.
