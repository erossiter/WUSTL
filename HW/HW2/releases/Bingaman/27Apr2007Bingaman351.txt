SEN. BINGAMAN MEETS WITH TESLA REPRESENTATIVES, RIDES IN 100 PERCENT ELECTRIC ROADSTER
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman met with representatives of Tesla Motors and rode in the company's 100 percent electric roadster. Earlier this year, Tesla announced it will build a new automobile assembly facility in Albuquerque, bringing 400 high wage jobs and a total capital investment of $35 million.  
   "Having taken a ride in the Tesla's Roadster I am sure this company will be a catalyst for change in the automotive industry. I am looking forward to the opening of their manufacturing plant in Albuquerque," Bingaman said. Tesla Motors, based out of San Carlos, CA, will use the plant to produce its "WhiteStar" car, a four door, five-passenger sports sedan which is also 100 percent electric. The New Mexico plant will be the company's first assembly facility in the United States. The plant will be built on the West Side of Albuquerque, at Cordera Mesa adjacent to the new Tempur-Pedic plant. The 400 new jobs will pay between $24,000 and $100,000 a year, plus excellent benefits and stock options.
