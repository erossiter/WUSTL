SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED FEMA WILL HELP WITH TRIGO FIRE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has approved a grant application that will help New Mexico cover the cost of the Trigo fire. 
   Under the terms of the grant, the federal government picks up 75 percent of the share of costs associated with the following:
   * Equipment and supplies;
   * Emergency work and operations centers;
   * Personal comfort and safety items for firefighter health and safety;
   * Mobilization and demobilization costs;
   * Temporary repair of damage cause by firefighting activities;
   * Mitigation, management, and control of declared fires burning on co-mingled federal land, when such costs are not reimbursable by another federal agency.
   "As always, I am impressed by the bravery of the firefighters who continue to battle the Trigo fire. And I am grateful that the federal government has recognized the impact of the fire and has agreed to provide the state financial assistance necessary to keep fighting," Bingaman said.
