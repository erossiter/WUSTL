SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON AFTERMATH OF KATRINA
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman released the following statement today:
   "My heart goes out to all those affected by the devastation left behind by Hurricane Katrina.  
 This is a tragedy the scale of which we are just beginning to understand, and we will be dealing with its aftermath for years to come. I am pleased that the Senate is acting quickly tonight on this first wave of aid, which provides $10 billion to FEMA and $500 million to the Department of Defense. In addition, in my capacity as ranking Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will be focusing particularly on doing what I can to help restore the energy producing capacity of the region, which has implications not only for the Southeast, but for the entire country. However, there is far more we must be doing in the days, weeks and months ahead to help people rebuild their lives, their homes, and their businesses. I urge the people of New Mexico and the country to come together and do all they can for those in need of help."
