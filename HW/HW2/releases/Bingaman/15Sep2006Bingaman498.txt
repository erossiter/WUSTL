SEN. BINGAMAN ANNOUNCES $3.3 MILLION FEDERAL GRANT TO BRING BROADBAND ACCESS TO LAGUNA PUEBLO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Pueblo of Laguna will receive a total of $3.3 million in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Agriculture to bring wireless broadband the area.  
   Laguna by far won the largest grant of the $8.9 million in funds awarded this year through this USDA initiative. 
   "This funding will allow Laguna to bring wireless broadband technology to the community, allowing for fast Internet that could have a dramatic impact on economic development in the region," Bingaman said. 
   In addition to bringing wireless broadband to Laguna, the funding will aide in the renovation of the existing community center.
