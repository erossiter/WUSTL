SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS TO BENEFIT LAS CRUCES TRANSIT SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is releasing $86,320 in federal funds he secured to help RoadRunner Transit in Las Cruces purchase two para-transit vans. Bingaman secured the funding in the 2005 highway bill.  
   "With the price of oil continuing to soar, public transportation provides local residents with less costly transportation alternatives," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman directed an additional $250,000 in the 2005 highway bill for RoadRunner in FY 2007, $300,000 for FY 2008 and $350,000 for FY 2009. 
   Additionally, Bingaman is seeking $320,000 in a fiscal year 2008 spending bill to help RoadRunner Transit to purchase four Diesel para-transit buses to replace four aging vans. Replacement of these older vans will improve operation efficiency and provide more suitable transportation options for our patrons.
