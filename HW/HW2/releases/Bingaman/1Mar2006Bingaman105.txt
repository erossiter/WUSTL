SEN. BINGAMAN COSPONSORS BILL THAT MAKES CONSTRUCTION OF TUNNELS TO CROSS U.S. BORDERS ILLEGAL
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined in introducing legislation that would make it a federal crime to construct or finance tunnels that could be used to cross illegally into the United States. 
   The bill, sponsored by Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-CA), would impose a punishment of up to 20 years imprisonment for constructing or financing a tunnel crossing international borders to the United States. It also would:
   * Impost a punishment of up to 10 years imprisonment for an individual who recklessly permits others to construct or use an unauthorized tunnel on their land;
   * Punish any person who uses a tunnel to smuggle aliens, weapons, drugs, terrorists, or illegal goods by doubling the sentence for underlying offenses;
   * Instruct the U.S. Sentencing Commission to amend sentencing guidelines to provide for criminal penalties for persons convicted under this bill.
   "This is one step we can take to improve the protection of our nation's border communities," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also is the sponsor of legislation called the Border Law Enforcement Relief Act of 2005 that would provide up to $30 million in grant funding to border law enforcement agencies within 100 miles of the U.S.-Mexico border to hire additional personnel, purchase equipment, and/or to cover overtime and transportation costs.
  Additionally, Bingaman will strongly oppose cuts proposed by the Bush administration to the High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area (HIDTA) program, which coordinates local, state, and federal law enforcement efforts to disrupt drug trafficking in the most active areas of the country. New Mexico HIDTA received approximately $7 million in 2006. The Bush budget reduces overall funding for the program to $207 million from $225 million.
