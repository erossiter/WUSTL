SEN. BINGAMAN REACTS TO BUSH'S STATE OF UNION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman issued the following statement after President Bush's State of the Union address:  
   "I'm disappointed that I didn't hear anything new on Iraq. I'm very concerned about the president's plans to escalate the number of troops there and doubt very much that such a move will achieve the results all of us desire. 
   "I was very encouraged that the president has set the goal of reducing our country's gasoline usage in the United States by 20 percent in the next 10 years. That is an initiative all Americans can get behind. 
   "But I am very disappointed that the president did not say much about addressing global warming in a comprehensive way. There is a great desire across the country - including from leading American companies - for presidential leadership on this important issue. By essentially ducking the issue of taking a mandatory, economy-wide approach to the problem, the president has missed a real opportunity. 
   "With regard to health care, I'm pleased that the president is focusing attention on the need to extend coverage to uninsured Americans. But I'm concerned that the president's proposal would make health care more expensive for millions of middle class Americans, especially those with chronic diseases. I am also concerned that this proposal may undermine incentives for employers to provide robust health insurance coverage for their employees. If we want to make health care more affordable, and extend coverage to the nearly 50 million people who are currently uninsured, the president's proposal is not the most effective and efficient way of doing so."
