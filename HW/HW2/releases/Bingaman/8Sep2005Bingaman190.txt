SEN. BINGAMAN HELPS WRITE HEALTHCARE PROVISIONS IN SWEEPING KATRINA RELIEF PACKAGE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman helped write some of the key provisions in the major Hurricane Katrina package Senate Democrats introduced today.  
  The bill addresses four key areas: health care, homelessness, keeping children in school, and helping affected Americans get back on their feet. In his capacity as a member of the Senate Finance Committee, the panel with jurisdiction over Medicaid, Bingaman worked with Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) on important aspects of the health care provisions. 
  One of the provisions Bingaman helped write drastically simplifies the paperwork associated with signing up for Medicaid, the federal/state financed health care plan for low-income Americans. Another provides 100 percent federal reimbursement to states such as New Mexico that offer care to evacuees through Medicaid. And a third provision prevents scheduled cuts to Medicaid from being implemented, ensuring that New Mexico will not lose $79 million next year as planned. 
  "Thousands of families have been displaced from their homes, and many of them will be needing health care. We cannot ask these families to delay seeking care until the federal bureaucracy kicks in. We need to streamline the process, and this legislation does just that," Bingaman said. 
  "This bill also ensures that the federal government bears the total cost of health care given to evacuees through Medicaid, rather than asking states to share the burden. This is a national crisis, and the federal government should take on the total responsibility of paying for Medicaid expenses," Bingaman said. 
   The package introduced today also does the following:
   HOUSE THE HOMELESS:
   * Provide Emergency Housing Vouchers for Evacuees 
   * Expedite Applications Procedures so Evacuees can Find Housing 
   * Provide Time for Survivors to Find Work Before Tenant Contributions are Required 
   * Identify Federal Facilities to House Victims 
   KEEP KIDS IN THE CLASSROOM:
   * Award $2,500 Grants Per Student and Other Assistance to School Districts Receiving Displaced Students 
   * Provide Temporary Assistance to Early Childhood Education Programs and Agencies Receiving Displaced Children 
   HELP AMERICANS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET:
   * Give the Victims a Moratorium of 180 Days on Any Loan Payments or Other Obligations to the Federal Government 
   * Waive Any Limitations on Total Assistance to Individuals 
   * Provide Mortgage and Rental Relief to Protect Americans from Foreclosure or Eviction 
   * Ease Bankruptcy Laws for Victims 
   * Extend and Expand Unemployment Insurance for Victims
