SEN. BINGAMAN AGREES WITH PRESIDENT THAT ENERGY POLICY IS NEEDED, BUT RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT WHITE HOUSE SOCIAL SECURITY PRIVATIZATION PLAN
  Following President Bush's news conference, Sen. Jeff Bingaman said he fully supports the president's call for a comprehensive energy policy. But he said he does not support Bush's plan to privatize Social Security. 
   "It's time for our country to adopt a comprehensive energy plan that balances production and conservation. I am working closely with Senator Domenici toward developing a bipartisan energy bill that we can get through the Senate," Bingaman said. "I'm pleased to say we are making very good progress."
   But when it comes to Social Security, Bingaman said he cannot support the president's plan to privatize this key anti-poverty initiative.
   "The White House plan would cut the guaranteed benefits New Mexico workers have earned. This is not a position I can support," Bingaman said.
   In addition to the risky nature of investing in the stock market, Bingaman cites the huge cost as a reason to reject the White House proposal to privatize Social Security. 
   Estimates are that it could cost as much as $5 trillion to privatize Social Security. Bingaman points out that our country is already deep in debt, and the president's plan would require us to borrow trillions more dollars. 
   Furthermore, the president's plan depends on making significant changes to the way benefits are calculated, resulting in cuts of nearly 50 percent.
   In New Mexico it is estimated that Social Security has reduced the poverty of seniors from 45 percent to 12 percent, pulling an about 800,000 seniors above the poverty line. Without Social Security, 48 percent of New Mexico's seniors would be living in poverty. Bingaman also noted that without Social Security, 54 percent of New Mexico Hispanics would be living in poverty.
