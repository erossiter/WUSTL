SEN. BINGAMAN: BUDGET WOULD INVEST IN N.M. AIR FORCE BASES
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said New Mexico Air Force Bases would receive a total of about $57 million in improvements under the Bush administration's budget proposal for 2009.  
   All three bases would see upgrades under the plan, which was released by the Bush administration today. 
   "The budget proposal makes an investment in each of our Air Force bases. We must make sure our bases remain in state-of-the-art condition, so that they can meet their missions," Bingaman said. "As we move forward in writing spending bills, I will work with the entire Congressional delegation to make sure our bases get the upgrades they need." 
   The proposed budget is as follows: 
   Holloman in preparation for the F-22 bed down January 2009 
  Hanger for maintenance for Low Observable materials $14.5 million 
  Air Craft maintenance facility $1.05 million 
  Flight Simulator Facility $3.15 million 
  Jet Engine Maintenance Shop $2.15 million 
  Aerospace Ground Equipment Facility $4.6 million 
   Cannon AFSOC bed down 
  AC-130 maintenance hanger $18.1 million 
   Kirtland 
  Replace fuel storage tanks $14.4 million 
   The budget request submitted Monday by the White House to Congress is the first step in the annual appropriations process. Over the next several months, the House of Representatives and the Senate will proceed with the actual work of writing the federal budget. But the White House numbers serve as recommendations to Congress that could set the parameters of the budget debate.
