SEN. BINGAMAN ANNOUNCES FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP PRESERVE HISTORIC CHURCH
Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of the Interior is making $150,000 available to help preserve a historic building at the Isleta Pueblo.  
 Funding will be used to assist with the restoration of Saint Augustine Church. The church, built in 1613, is the one of the oldest in New Mexico. 
 "We need to preserve historic treasures, such as Saint Augustine, so that future generations may have the opportunity to enjoy them. I am pleased these funds will allow the Pueblo of Isleta to move forward with this important project," Bingaman said.
