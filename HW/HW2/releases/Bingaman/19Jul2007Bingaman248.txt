SEN. BINGAMAN: SENATE DEBATES BILL TO MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE FOR NEW MEXICANS
  The Senate today began debating a bill U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman helped write to make a college education more affordable and accessible to New Mexicans. 
   Bingaman said the Higher Education Access Act increases student aid by more than $17 billion over the next 5 years. The bill would substantially increase Pell Grants to $5,100 next year and to $5,400 by 2011. Under this proposal, the maximum Pell Grant would increase by $790 next year alone. 
   In addition, the bill simplifies the financial aid process for low-income students by increasing the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell Grant, and protects working students, increasing the amount of student income that is sheltered from the financial aid process.
   "The cost of a college education continues to rise. This is the first time in recent years that we've made an attempt at helping students pay for college. It's my hope that we pass this bill so more New Mexicans can afford to get a college degree," Bingaman said. 
   This new student aid package could mean as much as $177 million in new grant aid for New Mexico students over the next 5 years. According to estimates, this increase means:
   * Almost $41 million for students attending the University of New Mexico; 
   * Almost $44 million for students attending New Mexico State University; 
   * Almost $15 million for students attending Eastern New Mexico University;
   * More than $6 million for students attending Western New Mexico University; and
   * More than $5 million for students attending New Mexico Highlands University. 
   This bill also would cap federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income, bringing needed relief to students with excessive debt. And it creates and incentive for students to purse careers in public service by forgiving for 10 years the debt of borrowers who work in public service careers, such as nursing, teaching, or law enforcement. 
   The bill also contains a provision Bingaman wrote that would prohibit colleges and universities from counting special combat pay received by men and women in the Armed Services against their financial aid. 
   Bingaman said the Senate could vote on the bill as soon as Thursday.
