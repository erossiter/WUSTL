SEN. BINGAMAN: FLOOD RELIEF NOW AVAILABLE TO MCKINLEY COUNTY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has added McKinley County to the list of New Mexico counties eligible for disaster aid as a result of flooding from recent storms.  
   Today's decision means that McKinley County is eligible for "public assistance" - meaning federal funding will be made available to cover at least 75 percent of the cost to repair, replace, or restore publicly owned facilities. 
   "Severe flooding this summer had a devastating impact on many communities throughout the state," Bingaman said. "It's very good news that FEMA is stepping up to help McKinley County."
