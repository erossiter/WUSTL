SEN. BINGAMAN: NORTHWEST NEW MEXICO COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Northwest New Mexico Council of Governments (NWNMCOG) has been awarded $81,168 from the federal government to help reduce the risk of exposure to toxic chemicals and enhance community education. 
   Funding was awarded through the United States Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Community Action for a Renewed Environment (CARE) and will help the NWNMCOG begin the process of organizing and forming collaborative partnerships aimed at addressing the contamination of soil, air, and water primarily caused by industrial processes such as uranium mining, oil and gas development, and power plant emissions.  
   "This grant will help begin the process of environmental cleanup. It's a very good investment in Northwest New Mexico," Bingaman said. 
   Following the organization and formation of partnerships, the Council can apply for additional funding to begin work on toxin reduction.
   The NWNMCOG is a voluntary association of local units of government serving as the regional planning organization for the northwest corner of New Mexico. Members include: the counties of Cibola, McKinley, San Juan; the cities of Grants, Gallup, Farmington; and the Crownpoint Navajo Chapter.
