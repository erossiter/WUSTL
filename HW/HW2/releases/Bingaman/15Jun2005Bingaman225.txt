SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO GAINS $600,000 TO IMPROVE JUVENILE JUSTICE PROGRAM
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department (CYFD) has been awarded a $600,000 grant from the federal government to support efforts to prevent juvenile crime.  
   "The funds awarded today will make it possible for CYFD to invest in innovative ways to address juvenile delinquency and I am confident that the state will put the money to good use," Bingaman said. 
   The funds are being provided through the U.S. Department of Justice's Office of Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention (OJJDP). Funds will be used to support state and local delinquency prevention and intervention efforts, as well as general improvements to the juvenile justice system.
