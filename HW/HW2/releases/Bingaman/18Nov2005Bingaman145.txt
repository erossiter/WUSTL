SPENDING BILL CONTAINING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SECURED BY SEN. BINGAMAN ON ITS WAY TO BECOMING LAW
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased a spending bill that contains millions of dollars in funding he requested for New Mexico transportation projects is on its way to becoming law. 
   The fiscal year 2006 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation contains $320,000 Bingaman requested for a Red Apple Transit in Farmington. That measure passed the Senate today and will be sent to the president for signature.
   "High gas prices have made public transportation an attractive alternative. The funding included in this bill will help keep Red Apple Transit running," Bingaman said.
   Farmington will use the funding to replace four buses to serve the area. Cost of maintenance for the buses has doubled due to their age and heavy use. The bill also contains $580,000 for Red Apple Transit operations and equipment. Bingaman secured $100,000 in 2004 to purchase bus shelters.
   The bill also contains a provision Bingaman wrote that prevents the use of federal funds to implement a controversial proposal that would force communities within 100 miles of a hub airport to contribute as much as $100,000 toward the cost of subsidizing commercial air service. Bingaman's provision would benefit Alamogordo and Hobbs.
   "Many of New Mexico's small communities depend on federal funds to keep their commercial air service running," Bingaman said. "I am pleased the federal government is continuing this important investment in communities such as Alamogordo and Hobbs."
   Bingaman secured funding for the following projects:
   * $110 million - Full Funding for the Essential Air Service Program: Since 1978, the EAS program has ensured that small, mostly rural communities could retain commercial air service after the industry was deregulated. Currently, five New Mexico communities take part in EAS: Alamogordo - $592,000; Carlsbad - $600,000; Clovis - $1.4 million; Hobbs - $519,000; and Silver City $1.35 million.
   * $1.165 Forest Road 235 Access to Magdalena Ridge Observatory: Funding will be used for improvements to Forest Road 235 from the mouth of water canyon to the planned Magdalena Ridge Observatory (MRO). The 8.6 mile long Water Canyon Road (FS 235) is a key element of the MRO Project and provides the only access between Highway 60 and Magdalena Ridge. This road was constructed fifty years ago and now requires extensive rehabilitation.
   * $1.54 Million - Navajo Route 13 Pavement Rehabilitation: Funding will be used for the pavement rehabilitation on 5.5 miles of NR 13 from US Highway 491 west toward Red Valley. Rehabilitation will consist of removing and replacing the existing poor quality surface materials. N13 is the major access route to US 491 for the communities of Red Valley and Cove to the commercial and medical centers of Shiprock and Farmington in New Mexico.
   * $1.475 Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico: Funding will help the Valles Caldera Trust with four projects 1) Construction of a Wildlife Viewing area on State Highway 4, 2) Upgrades to the preserve's main entrance on NM4, 3) Installation of highway safety signs on all public roads, and 4) Completion of a cultural resource survey of all roads open to public use. Bingaman secured $1.2 million for the preserve in FY2004 and $1.25 million in FY2005.
   * $1 million - Bus and Bus Facilities, Las Cruces: RoadRunner Transit would use the funds to purchase three heavy-duty diesel transit buses to complete the conversion to a fully accessible fleet, four Diesel para-transit buses to replace four aging vans, upgrade the city's Dial-a-Ride program with Mobile Data Terminals and automated vehicle locator capabilities to automatically dispatch vans and reschedule rides to the best van to do the trip, and to purchase a drive-through vehicle wash system and equipment to wash bus-shelters. Bingaman secured $375,000 in FY04 for Las Cruces to purchase buses.
   * $575,000 County Road 4990, San Juan County: Funding will be used to resurface County Road 4990, which serves as the main access road to San Juan County's oil and gas fields. It connects US 550 approximately one mile south of Bloomfield and runs easterly approximately 14 miles to CR 4450 in Largo Canyon. The road is used by area residents, school buses, and other vehicles.
   * $450,000 Bus and Bus Facilities, North Central Regional Transit District (NCRTD): Funds will be used to continue the Northern New Mexico Park and Ride program. Commuter buses currently operate between Albuquerque and Santa Fe and between Santa Fe, Pojoaque, Espa?ola, and Los Alamos;
   * $200,000 New Mexico State University Bridge Research Center: Funding will benefit the Bridge Research Center for non-destructive structural evaluation technology at NMSU. The center will benefit the nation by extending the life of bridge systems and reducing the deterioration of critical infrastructure, improving public safety, and saving money. Bingaman secured $125,000 in 2005 for the center, $500,000 in 2004, $250,000 in 2003 and $600,000 in 2001.
   The bill also includes funding for operations and equipment for the following public transit companies:
   * $7.3 million - Albuquerque Ride
   * $1.3 million - Las Cruces Roadrunner
   * $1.3 million - Santa Fe Trails
   * $6.9 million - Statewide transit grants for rural areas
   * $800,000 - State wide transit grants for elderly and disabled
   * $10 million - Small Community Air Service Development Program: The program helps improve air carrier service to airports not receiving sufficient service. Grants are provided to communities with smaller airports to help improve their commercial air carrier service. Bingaman helped secure $20 million in 2003, 2004, and 2005.
