SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDING WILL BENEFIT NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY FOOD SAFETY LAB
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was pleased to learn that New Mexico State University's Agricultural Products Food Safety Lab will receive $1.47 million from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to help continue important work at the facility. 
   The NMSU food lab was slated to receive funding through a fiscal year 2007 spending bill. However, this year, most federal agencies are being funded by a continuing resolution (CR) - a single bill, rather than the multiple measures that are typically passed to fund the government. The CR was based on funding levels from 2006, but it did not set aside specific amounts for every program.
   "The FDA and New Mexico State University have worked in partnership to help assure food safety and security," Bingaman said. "This collaboration between NMSU and FDA continues to yield benefits that cannot be easily replaced or replicated. I believe this investment will benefit FDA and helped improve food safety and security for Americans."
   The food lab develops and evaluates rapid-screening methods to detect contamination in food products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals.
   Earlier this year Bingaman wrote to the FDA to urge them to fund the NMSU lab. Bingaman is seeking $4 million in a fiscal year 2008 spending bill for the food safety lab.
