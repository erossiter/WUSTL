SEN. BINGAMAN: RADAR AT SANTA FE AIRPORT WOULD ENSURE SAFETY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today called on the Federal Aviation Administration to install radar equipment at the Santa Fe Municipal Airport (SAF).  
   Bingaman said he has received numerous reports of potentially dangerous situations at the airports because of the lack of radar coverage. Currently the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) does not consider a radar installation justified at SAF. 
   In a letter to FAA Administrator Marion Blakey, Bingaman said the location of the airport and plans for future aircraft upgrades require the installation of radar. 
   "The Santa Fe Municipal Airport is located in a mountainous terrain, including the nearby 12,000-feet Sange de Cristo Mountains and 10,000-feet Sandia Crest. The tower now handles a broad range of aircraft, including Santa Fe's commercial air service, which will likely soon be upgraded to 50-passenger Regional Jets. I believe radar coverage is needed at Santa Fe to ensure safe and efficient air service," Bingaman wrote. 
   Bingaman last year worked to get a provision included in the fiscal year 2006 Senate Transportation Appropriations bill that would have directed the FAA to work with Santa Fe to improve radar coverage for the area. Unfortunately, no efforts have been made to address the problem.
