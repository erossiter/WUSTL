SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS TO BENEFIT SANDOVAL COUNTY HEALTH COMMONS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the federal government is releasing funding he helped secure to help improve health care services in Sandoval County.  
   Bingaman secured $247,500 in a fiscal year 2006 spending bill for the Sandoval County Health Commons. Funds would be used to provide the Health Commons -a public/private partnership that provides family and health services - with dental equipment, prenatal and other medical equipment and new furnishings, structural and to expand services to include prenatal and dental services. 
   "Access to heath care is vital to improving a community's quality of life. And with tooth decay being the single-most common childhood disease nationwide I am especially pleased that this funding will be used to expand dental services," Bingaman said.
