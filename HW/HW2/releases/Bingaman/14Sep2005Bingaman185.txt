SEN. BINGAMAN: JAPANESE BAN ON U.S. BEEF MUST BE RESOLVED
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Bush Administration to work with Japanese officials to resume U.S. beef exports to the country. Sen. Bingaman is the top Democrat on the Senate Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade. 
   Japan barred U.S. beef exports in December 2003 after an isolated case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or "mad cow" disease, was detected in a Canadian-born dairy cow in the state of Washington. 
   In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, Bingaman joined other Senate colleagues emphasizing the importance of resolving this issue. 
   "The beef industry is a pivotal economic component of many rural communities in our country. The industry is losing $100 million each month that Japan remains closed to U.S. beef. Since December 2003 the United States meat industry has lost 10,000 jobs, mostly attributed to lost export markets. That is why we must do all we can to ensure stability in the market and resume trade with Japan as soon as possible. I urge you to make this issue a top priority," the letter states. 
   In a meeting earlier this year with Ryozo Kato, Japan's Ambassador to the United States, Bingaman joined Senate colleagues in expressed their disappointment in the country's refusal to lift the ban despite the numerous steps the United States has taken to ensure food safety. 
   Prior to the ban, U.S. beef exports to Japan amounted to approximately $1.7 billion, Japan the largest export market for U.S. beef. 
   Bingaman has also been working to get the Mexican government to reopen the U.S.-Mexico border to exports of live cattle. Last month Bingaman spoke with USDA Secretary Mike Johanns and urged he work with Mexican officials to reopen the border once again to U.S. cattle exports. Mexico has barred U.S. live cattle exports after the December 2003 Washington state case.
