SEN. BINGAMAN NOMINATES EASTERN NEW MEXICO STUDENTS TO MILITARY SERVICE ACADEMY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced his nominees from New Mexico for admission to each of the nation's four military service academies. 
   Among the students nominated by Bingaman to the service academies are Barret Stewart of Clovis and Matthew Wilmeth of Hobbs. Stewart attends Clovis High School and is being nominated to the United States Air Force Academy. Wilmeth attends Lovington High School and is being nominated to the United States Military Academy. 
   Each year Bingaman selects students for nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy or the U.S. Naval Academy. The United States Military Service Academies are the country's premier officer training Schools. 
   "Barret and Matthew have excelled in academics and given of themselves in community service. We are fortunate that they are also willing to serve our country, and I am pleased to recommend them for admission to our country's military service academies," Bingaman said. 
   The selection of nominees was based on the recommendations of Bingaman's Academy Nomination Review Board, which is made up of New Mexicans from around the state. The Board recommends candidates according to academic achievements, extracurricular activities and leadership potential. Each academy will make the final selection on admission.
