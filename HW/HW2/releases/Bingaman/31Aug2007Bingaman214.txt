SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM DOJ GRANTS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that three New Mexico communities will benefit from federal grants being awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ). 
   Santa Clara Pueblo has been awarded a $300,000 grant to expand work currently being done through a tribal juvenile justice program and tribal court.
   The City of Farmington has been awarded $102,633 grant, which will be used for new weapons to equip recently hired Farmington police officers. Additionally, funding will be used to purchase taser weapons and accessories for the San Juan County Sheriff's Office. 
  Taos County will receive $10,436 from DOJ to purchase radar monitoring equipment to enhance the county's ability to provide efficient traffic control.
