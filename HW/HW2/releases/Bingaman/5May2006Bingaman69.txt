SEN. BINGAMAN CONGRATULATES ALBUQUERQUE FOR BEING NAMED NO.1 FOR BUSINESS, BY FORBES MAGAZINE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today congratulated the city of Albuquerque for being named "the Best Places for Business and Careers" by Forbes Magazine. 
   "I'm pleased that Forbes Magazine is letting the world know what all of us already know - Albuquerque is the place to be," Bingaman said. "From aviation to high technology manufacturing, Albuquerque has become the number one place to do business and I congratulate all that have worked so hard to make this happen."
   The magazine credits the low cost of doing business, five-year job and income growth, and a wide range of other attributes Forbes has used to create the 200-city list for moving Albuquerque from number five in 2005 to its number one spot this year.
