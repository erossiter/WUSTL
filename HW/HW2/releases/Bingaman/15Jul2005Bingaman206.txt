SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL WOULD BENEFIT NEW MEXICO'S VETERANS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced his support for a bill that would help increase health care access for New Mexico veterans.  
   Bingaman is cosponsoring the "VetsRide Act", which would provide grants to state Veterans Service Offices and Veterans Service Organizations to help provide veterans with transportation options to VA hospitals and outpatient clinics. The bill authorizes $3 million in each of the next 5 years. 
   "For many of New Mexico's veterans, especially for those living in rural areas of the state, transportation to the nearest VA medical center is not always easily available," Bingaman said. "State veterans organizations have programs in place to provide rides to those who need them, but budget constraints can limit their ability to help. This bill would make federal funds available to help veterans get the health care services they need." 
   While New Mexico has 13 outpatient clinics throughout the state that provide many important health services to veterans, the states only VA Hospital, located in Albuquerque, is better equipped to handle more serious needs.
