SEN. BINGAMAN DECRIES WHITE HOUSE BUDGET CUT FOR MIDDLE RIO GRANDE PROJECT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is concerned about the Bush administration's budget proposal for the Middle Rio Grande Project because it wants to cut it by 35 percent. 
   The White House's 2006 budget unveiled Monday requests $19 million in Bureau of Reclamation funds for the Middle Rio Grande Project. That represents a $10.2 million cut over current spending. At least $4 million would be cut from funds available for activities to maintain compliance with the Endangered Species Act. 
   In 2003, the Department of the Interior developed a 10 year plan to ensure a manageable balance between endangered species and water use in the Middle Rio Grande. Implementation of that plan, by the department's own estimates, will exceed $230 million. Yet, over the last three years, the Bush administration has only proposed investing $19.4 million. 
   Bingaman pointed out that this shortfall is particularly alarming because failure to maintain ESA compliance threatens water use in New Mexico's most populous region. 
   "This White House either doesn't understand what needs to be done for Middle Rio Grande, or it lacks the commitment to it. In either case, it's not good news for the people who live along the Middle Rio Grande," Bingaman said.
   "Congress may once again fund this effort more responsibly, but it's always an uphill battle when the White House isn't supportive," he said. 
   Making matters worse, the fiscal year 2006 Fish & Wildlife Service budget calls for eliminating $542,000 in funding for the Middle Rio Grande Bosque initiative, labeling it a "lower priority project."
