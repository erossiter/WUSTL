SEN. BINGAMAN: LAS VEGAS ORGANIZATION AWARDED FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that Somos Familia Institute, Inc. in Las Vegas has been awarded $494,364 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) to help fight domestic violence in the counties of Guadalupe, Mora and San Miguel. 
   Somos Familia, a non-profit organization, will use the funding to implement a new project that combines prevention education and victim advocacy training. The program will do the following: provide victim outreach and advocacy service through community-based prevention educator and victim advocates; provide violence prevention education to six school districts and to communities through the development of brochures, culturally appropriate materials, and public service announcements; and develop referral and tracking systems to be used by the advocates and project partners. 
   "Domestic violence and other violent crimes against women are a serious problem, and they deserve our full attention. I am pleased the funding awarded today to Somos Familia will help make service available to women who need it," Bingaman said. 
   The funds announced today were provided through the Rural Domestic Violence and Child Victimization Enforcement Grant Program, which implements certain provisions of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Bingaman is a cosponsor of legislation that would reauthorize the VAWA.
