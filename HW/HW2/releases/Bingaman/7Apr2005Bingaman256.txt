SEN. BINGAMAN OUTLINES SPENDING PRIORITIES FOR CANNON AIR FORCE BASE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today outlined his fiscal year 2006 spending priorities for military construction projects at Cannon Air Force Base. 
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $5.5 million to upgrade the Munitions Storage Area at Cannon Air Force Base. The current munitions maintenance facility, which provide for the assembly, repair, inspection, and other tasks involving conventional munitions, dates to 1951 and its condition hinders the wing's mission flying capability, its ability to train with a diverse set of munitions over the Melrose range and the safety of the airbase. 
   "Cannon Air Force Base has played an important role in our country's national defense and the funding I am requesting today will help strengthen its ability to continue to do so," Bingaman said.
   The funds requested by Bingaman would be used for the construction of a new facility and would help eliminate delays in equipment maintenance, and in turn, limits the number of mission-ready armaments needed to support flying operations. 
   Bingaman also requested $14.2 million for a Communications Facility at Cannon. Funds would be used for the construction of a new communications facility needed to consolidate communications operations and for the construction of a new command post. The three main communications facilities are spread throughout the base providing an inefficient and unproductive work environment. The command post is in a small, cramped area with inefficient and inadequate communications and security capabilities. A new facility would replace these decaying buildings with one central, efficient facility.
