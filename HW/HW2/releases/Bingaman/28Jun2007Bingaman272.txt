SEN. BINGAMAN: COMMITTEE APPROVES SPENDING BILL WITH FUNDS FOR SANDIA AND LOS ALAMOS LABS, WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PROJECT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that a key Senate committee has approved a spending bill that funds several of his priorities at Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories and the Waste Isolation Pilot Project (WIPP). 
   The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved the fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill that funds the National Nuclear Security Administration at $6.48 billion, which funds the stockpile stewardship program performed by Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories. 
   "This bill is a very good starting point. It does a good job funding the most important work performed by our two outstanding national laboratories. I congratulate Senators Dorgan and Domenici for working together to come up with a bill that puts the Senate in a good position to negotiate with the House of Representatives," Bingaman said.
   At Bingaman's request, the bill includes $24.2 million the National Center for Solid State Lighting, which works to overcome fundamental challenges critical to the success of the U.S. solid state lighting industry - the next generation of lighting. Sandia National Laboratories' Center for Integrated Nanosciences will benefit from this funding. Bingaman has been leading the effort to secure federal funds to support research and development on the next generation of lighting.
