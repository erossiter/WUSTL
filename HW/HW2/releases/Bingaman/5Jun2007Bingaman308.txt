SEN. BINGAMAN: GALLUP CLEARS FINAL HURDLE NEEDED TO BEGIN COMMERCIAL AIR SERVICE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Great Lakes Airlines is one step closer to providing commercial air service from Gallup to Phoenix and Denver. 
   Bingaman has conformed that the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) will have security screeners in place by July 1, 2007, which is when air service is slated to begin. In November, Bingaman urged TSA to work with the city of Gallup to clear this final hurdle needed to begin service.
   "Commercial air service will be a great benefit to Gallup's growing economy. With security screeners in place, Great Lakers Airlines will finally be ready for takeoff," Bingaman said.
   At Bingaman's urging the U.S. Department of Transportation last year awarded Gallup with a $600,000 grant from the department's small communities air service development grant program to help pay for the air service.
   Weekday departures from Gallup will be scheduled as follows:
   6:55 a.m. - Show Low, AZ with through service to Phoenix
  11:38 a.m. - Farmington with through service to Denver
