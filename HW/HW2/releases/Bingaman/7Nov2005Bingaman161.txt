SEN. BINGAMAN: PUEBLO OF POJOAQUE TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Pueblo of Pojoaque will benefit from $260,000 to help provide food and nutrition programs to low income members of the community. 
   Funding comes from the U.S. Department of Agriculture and will be used to help the pueblo establish a Community Food Project (CFP). The CFP will focus on health consciousness, collaboration, and business expertise through the expansion of existing farm production and retail operations such as farmers market, new publication and cooking classes that promote nutrition and feature locally grown food.
   "Good nutrition is key to maintaining a healthy lifestyle," Bingaman said. "The funding awarded today will help the Pueblo of Pojoaque provide nutrition information to the community."
