KEY SPENDING BILL CONTAINS FUNDING FOR SEN. BINGAMAN HEALTH AND EDUCATION INITIATIVES
  The Senate has approved to a key spending bill that contains millions of dollars U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman requested for New Mexico health and education initiatives. The measure also contains $150 million Bingaman secured to increase staffing at Social Security Administration offices to address a serious backlog situation. 
   But the president has threatened to veto the legislation, putting all the funding in jeopardy.  
   "This bill funds a host of health care and education initiatives important to our state, and would help us begin to address the serious backlog situation at the Social Security Administration," Bingaman said. "It is very disappointing that the president intends to veto it." 
   At Bingaman's request, the fiscal year 2008 Labor, Health and Human Services and Education Spending Bill contains $960,000 for McKinley County Dialysis Center to construct a new dialysis center in Gallup. There is a growing epidemic of diabetes and renal failure in McKinley County, especially with Native American populations. 
   Also at Bingaman's urging, the bill contains $750,000 to expand and renovate the emergency department, establish a cardiac program, and enable the hospital to pursue Level II trauma designation at St. Vincent Regional Medical Center in Santa Fe. 
   And the bill sets aside $750,000 in funding for Hidalgo and Grant County Health Center to construct a comprehensive ambulatory care center to provide services for the Grant County. 
   There is also $750,000 in the bill for upgrades at Sierra Vista Hospital in Truth or Consequences. This geographic region is beginning to experience an increase in its population, which is projected to double in the next 10 years, but the hospital facilities need to be improved to keep up with the growth. 
   In the area of education, Bingaman helped secure $340,000 for Southwest Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) in Albuquerque. SIPI will use the funds to expand their renewable energy training program and community projects by offering distance education and by offering short courses which lead to industry certification. 
   Bingaman also helped secure $340,000 for New Mexico State University (NMSU), Do?a Ana Branch Community College and Gadsden High School's Bridge program, which transitions high school students into technical careers to support the local manufacturing industry. This funding will help continue and expand this program to the Las Cruces School District. Bingaman helped get start-up funding for this program. 
   And Bingaman helped secure $170,000 for the Community Partnership for Children, a non-profit organization working to develop new options for affordable, high quality childcare for children in Grant County. 
   Bingaman also helped include the following in the bill: 
   * $210,000 for the New Mexico Human Services Department to expand psychiatric services for children and youth in rural New Mexico through school-based health centers and telehealth technology. 
   * $85,000 - Zia Tribal Health Clinic is the most important source of healthcare services to the tribal members of Zia Pueblo. The funding will be used to make critical renovations to the clinic as well as purchase new equipment. 
   * $300,000 in funding for Jewish Family Services' New Mexico Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities demonstration project to ensure that senior residents can safely and securely maintain their independence. 
   * $297,000 in funding for the Community Action Agency of Southern New Mexico Access to Care Initiative to address the unmet healthcare needs in Do?a Ana and southern Otero counties through the web-based "iReach" software that provides a uniform screening criteria of patients to help find a payer source for uninsured and underinsured patients and coordinate care. 
   * $500,000 for Rio Rancho Public Schools to give high school students in the rural communities of Cuba and Jemez the opportunity to take upper level science and math courses through the New Mexico Cyber Academy. 
   * $150,000 to Eddy County to construct the new Legacy Regional Substance Abuse Rehabilitation Center in Carlsbad. The planned 100-bed center will provide multiple levels of substance abuse treatment with a primary focus on methamphetamine addiction. The new center will be the only treatment facility to serve the Southeast New Mexico region of Eddy, Lea, Otero, Lincoln, Curry and Roosevelt Counties. 
   Bingaman also helped with the following: 
   * Increase funding for Advanced Placement programs to $46 million (almost $9 million increase over current funding). This funding will help low-income students pay for the test fees associated with AP exams, and will be to increase students' access to AP courses, particularly those in math, science, and critical foreign languages. 
   * Secure $5 million to strengthen math and science teaching skills by funding bachelors and master degree programs in math, science, technology, and engineering education, as authorized in America Competes 
   * Secure $8 million for Tribally Controlled Postsecondary Career and Technical Institutions, such as Navajo Technical College 
   * Secure $81 million for the Smaller Learning Communities program 
   * Secure $97.2 million for Hispanic Serving Institutions
