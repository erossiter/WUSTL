SEN. BINGAMAN OUTLINES 2006 TRANSIT FUNDING REQUESTES FOR ALBUQUERQUE, SANTA FE, LAS CRUCES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he will be working hard this year to secure federal transit funding for the cities of Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Las Cruces, as well as for projects that benefit the entire state.  
   In the coming months, Congress will take up a key piece of legislation that will direct federal funds to various transportation projects in New Mexico. The legislation will rewrite the expiring TEA-21 law, which "authorized" transit projects and sets aside funds for highways. Bingaman is seeking "authorization" in the new TEA-21 legislation for major New Mexico transit projects because federal funding is easier to secure with such authorizations, and is mandatory for rail projects - including the planned Belen to Santa Fe commuter rail service. 
   "Having good roads and adequate public transit systems are key to having a strong economy. That is why it is so important for New Mexico to fight for its fair share of funding," Bingaman said. "This bill is vital to our state, and I will do everything I can to ensure it meets New Mexico's needs."
   As a first step toward securing federal funding for New Mexico transportation projects, Bingaman today wrote to Senators Richard Shelby (R-Ala.) and Paul Sarbanes (D-Md.), the chairman and ranking members, respectively, of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, seeking authorization of major transit projects. The Banking Committee is the panel that will be writing a major part of the new TEA-21 law. 
   Bingaman is seeking the following:
   ALBUQUERQUE:
   * A $2 million authorization request for the West Side Transit Facility.
   * A $375 million authorization request for the city's Rapid Transit Project.
   * A $38 million authorization request for new buses.
   * A $1 million Job Access and Reverse Commute 
   LAS CRUCES:
   * A $4.87 million authorization in the new TEA-21 legislation for new buses and bus facilities. Of that amount, Bingaman is seeking $1.3 million to replace five heavy-duty, 35-foot buses; $850,000 to replace paratransit vans; $2 million to expand maintenance and operations, adding two bays so that vehicles can be repaired more quickly; and $480,000 for technology improvements, including Global Positioning Systems and automated fare boxes.
   SANTA FE:
   * A $5.4 million authorization for the Santa Fe/El Dorado commuter rail line.
   * A $10.68 million authorization for the Santa Fe Trails Bus System, which will allow for the purchase of buses, paratransit vehicles, trolley buses and support vehicles, and to improve bus facilities.
   * A $2.6 million authorization for Job Access and Reverse Commute.
   Bingaman is also seeking more than $100 million for New Mexico Department of Transportation projects. 
   Specifically, he is working to secure a $75 million authorization to help pay for the Belen/Santa Fe Commuter Rail project. The state is paying for Phase I - service between Belen and Bernalillo. Bingaman is seeking funding for Phase II - service between Bernalillo and Santa Fe.
   "Rail travel between Belen and the town of Bernalillo is expected to be available later this year. I will be working on the part the part of this exciting project that will connect Bernalillo to Santa Fe," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is also seeking $12 million for the Job Access and Reverse Commute, and $30 million for the Statewide Commuter Option Bus Service.
