SPENDING BILL CONTAINS SEN. BINGAMAN SECURED FUNDS FOR NATIONAL GUARD BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a spending bill that contains funding Sen. Jeff Bingaman requested for a highly-effective counterdrug interdiction program at the New Mexico-Mexico border. The fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the Department of Defense contains $3 million Bingaman requested for the New Mexico National Guard Counterdrug Program, which supports counterdrug activities, including the surveillance of high-traffic border areas and mobile vehicle inspection and dismantlement at select Border Patrol checkpoints on major roads. Funding is also used to hire full-time Guardsmen to construct vehicle barrier along the border. Bingaman secured $2.8 million for the program last year and $1 million in fiscal year 2005.  
   "For the last several years the National Guard has been instrumental in helping Border Patrol and local law enforcement with the difficult task of keeping drugs out of the country and securing our borders. This funding will help them continue their critical mission and I am pleased it has been included in this bill," Bingaman said. 
   The counterdrug program is completely separate from Operation Jump Start, the administration's plan to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops along the border. 
   The bill is now ready for full Senate consideration.
