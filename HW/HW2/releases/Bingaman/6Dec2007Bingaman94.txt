SEN. BINGAMAN COSPONSORS BILL THAT STUDIES BORDER CROSSING NEEDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today cosponsored legislation aimed at determining how to improve the flow of commercial and passenger traffic between the United States and Mexico.  
   Bingaman today joined in introducing the Border Wait Times Study Act, whose primary sponsor is Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-TX). The measure would study: 
   * The traffic patterns of commercial and passenger vehicles entering land ports of entry along northern and southern borders; 
   * The volume and wait times of commercial and passenger vehicles entering and exiting the United States at ports of entry since 2000; 
   * How staffing levels have affected wait times at ports of entry since 2000; 
   * The impact of traffic delays at ports of entry on commerce in international border communities and border states as a whole. 
   "The study will help us understand the needs of our nation's ports of entry, and how we can increase commercial activity in the border region while reducing unnecessary delays," Bingaman said. 
   Once enacted, the U.S. Departments of Transportation and Commerce would have 180 days to complete the study and send it to Congress.
