SEN. BINGAMAN MEETS WITH MEXICO'S ATTORNEY GENERAL, AMBASSADOR TO U. S. TO DISCUSS BORDER VIOLENCE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today met with Eduardo Medina-Mora and Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican attorney general and ambassador to the United States, respectively, to discuss violence along the border and other important border-related issues. 
   Citing an increase in drug-related violence, Bingaman wrote to Ambassador Sarukhan urging Mexico to step up security in Palomas and other cities in northwest Chihuahua. Sarukhan and Medina-Mora visited Bingaman today in his Capitol Hill office to report that they are aware of the uptick in violence and are committed to stepping up efforts to fight drug trafficking. The Mexican officials also said additional Mexican law enforcement resources are being sent to the Palomas area.
   "In recent weeks, we've seen an increase in violence in the border region. Today's meeting was an opportunity for me to convey to the Mexican government that New Mexicans have serious concerns about this violence and that it needs to be addressed right away," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman also took the opportunity to present the attorney general and ambassador with a copy of a resolution passed today by the Do?a Ana County Commission that raises concerns regarding the safety of residents of Lomas del Poleo - a Mexican community just south of Sunland Park. Lomas del Poleo is a colonia that is subject to an ongoing land dispute.
   "I'm glad I was able to bring this issue to the attention of the Mexican attorney general, and that he committed to looking into the situation," Bingaman said.
   Finally, Bingaman urged the Mexican officials to find ways to improve health care in Palomas to take some pressure off the already over-stressed health care system in southern New Mexico.
