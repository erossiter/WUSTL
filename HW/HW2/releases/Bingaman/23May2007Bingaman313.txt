SEN. BINGAMAN: PUEBLO OF LAGUNA TO BENEFIT FROM FEMA FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Pueblo of Laguna will benefit from a $1.127 million grant from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). 
   The Pueblo of Laguna will use the funding to repair damage to the Skyline Lagoon waste water system, which was caused by heavy rains and flooding. Restoration efforts will replace 6 cells surrounded by engineered compacted berms, vinyl liners and PVC pipe connecting the cells to each other. 
   "I am pleased FEMA is making this funding available to help the Pueblo of Laguna fix damage to their wastewater system," Bingaman said.
