SENATE APPROVES LONG-OVERDUE INDIAN HEALTH CARE LEGISLATION
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today applauded passage of legislation to address the health care needs of Indian Country.  
   The Indian Health Care Improvement Act was approved by a 83-10 vote. The original law governing health care for Indian Country was approved in 1972, but the law expired several years ago. 
   "One need only look to the 45 million uninsured Americans to see that nationwide we have a serious health care crisis. But nowhere is lack of access to health care more obvious and troubling than in Indian Country," Bingaman said. "The passage of this legislation is long overdue. I hope we can get a bill to the president very soon." 
   The Indian Health Care Improvement Act (S. 1200) does the following: 
   * Authorizes additional tools for tribal communities to address suicide among Indian youth; 
   * Addresses the lack of access to health care services by amending the Social Security Act to permit reimbursement by Medicare and Medicaid for covered services provided by the Indian Health Service. 
   * Responds to the very serious backlog in needed health care facilities, such as hospitals and alcohol and substance abuse treatment centers, and in unmet need for sanitation facilities in tribal communities; 
   * Makes permanent a number of successful federal programs providing services to Native Americans in long-term health care, diabetes prevention, and other key areas; 
   * Expands scholarship and loan programs that encourage more American Indian people to enter health care professions. 
   S. 1200 will now be sent to the House of Representatives for consideration.
