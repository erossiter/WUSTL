SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED PROGRESS IS BEING MADE ON AAMODT SETTLEMENT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today applauded efforts to move negotiations forward on the Aamodt water settlement.  
   "I'm happy that several parties to the case are negotiating and making progress, especially on areas of concern, such as the cost of the settlement," Bingaman said. "Given the initiative taken by the state, the pueblos, and other parties to address a range of difficult issues, it is my hope and expectation that the administration will now fully engage in the negotiations."
   In a letter to Interior Secretary Gale Norton, Bingaman in February urged the Bush administration to exercise leadership in negotiating the Aamodt case. Shortly after that, a high-level Interior official was named to the case. 
   Bingaman has also expressed disappointment in the Bush administration's statements earlier this year that it would contribute as little as $11 million to the cost of settling the 40-year-old case because that's what it determined its "liability" to be. Bingaman has pointed out that just last year, the president signed into law two bills that contributed significant amounts of federal funding to water settlements in the West.
