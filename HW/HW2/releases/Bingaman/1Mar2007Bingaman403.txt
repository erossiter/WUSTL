SEN. BINGAMAN COSPONSORS BILL TO IMPROVE CARE TO WOUNDED SOLDIERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined Senate colleagues in introducing legislation aimed at ensuring injured soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan receive the care they deserve.  
   Bingaman is a cosponsor of the "Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act of 2007", which would direct the Department of Defense (DOD) to reduce the burdens of the current system on recovering service members and families. Specifically, the bill would require improvements to facilities, an increase in facility inspections, improved counseling services, and reduce paperwork and red tape for wounded service members and families. 
   "I was greatly disturbed by recent news accounts of unacceptable living conditions for many outpatients at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. Our brave men and women who risk their lives to serve our country deserve the very best treatment we have to offer. I hope we can get this bill passed and signed by the president as soon as possible," Bingaman said. 
   The legislation also provides important new support for military families, including medical care and job counseling for family members while caring for injured loved ones at military facilities. It also creates federal protections to prevent them from being fired while they are away from their jobs. 
   Additionally, the bill creates a Wounded Warrior Oversight Board to monitor the Pentagon's implementation of these reforms and to serve as an independent advocacy board for outpatients. The board - comprised of veterans, wounded service members, family members and medical experts - will play an active role in ensuring that the nation's recovering soldiers receive quality care. 
   The bill is cosponsored by Senators Barack Obama (D-IL) and Claire McCaskill (D-MO). It was also introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives by Reps. Rahm Emanuel (D-IL) and Harry Mitchell (D-AZ).
