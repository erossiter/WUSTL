SEN. BINGAMAN URGES PASSAGE OF 'IMPACT ACT'
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today called on both chambers of Congress to immediately take up and pass legislation he co-authored to help tackle the serious problem of obesity - especially among young people.  
   Bingaman is urging the passage of the "Improved Nutrition and Physical Activity Act," or "IMPACT Act." The act, among other things, would provide federal funds for community education on improved nutrition and increased physical activity. 
   "Obesity has reached crisis proportions in our country, and it is an increasing problem around the world. The sooner we begin to tackle the problem, the better," Bingaman said. "The federal government spends many millions of dollars per year treating obesity-related health problems, and it can play a constructive role in reducing obesity and preventing it." 
   "We've been talking for several years about passing legislation to address the serious problem of obesity in our country. The time has come to pass the IMPACT Act and get it to the president," Bingaman added. 
   Bingaman thanked the Eating Disorders Coalition for working in the final hours of this Congressional session to pass the IMPACT Act.
