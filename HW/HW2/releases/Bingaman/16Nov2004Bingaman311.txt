SEN. BINGAMAN: NASA AWARDS $1.496 MILLION GRANT TO UNM 'CREATE' PROJECT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the University of New Mexico's Department of Earth and Planetary Science received $1.496 million earmark to help fund a project that will reduce the time between capturing and viewing satellite images.  
   The grant, awarded through NASA's Stennis Space Center, will fund the Center for Rapid Environmental Assessment and Terrain Evaluation (CREATE) project. The project aims to acquire real-time remotely sensed data from satellites collecting environmental data and integrate it with CREATE's analytical and computational facilities. 
   The funds will be used to purchase the satellite dish that will be the centerpiece of the CREATE project. The new dish will make it possible to examine images of land and water in detail within hours of being captured by the satellite. It will allow for the quick assessment of changing environmental conditions in New Mexico as well as across the region from central Mexico, to Canada, and from the Mississippi to the Pacific Ocean. 
   "Prior to CREATE, researchers had to wait weeks for images from the U.S. Geological Survey, NASA or commercial providers. CREATE will make it possible to take data that is being produced and apply it to real problems in the present. I'm pleased that NASA is lending support to this important program," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman helped secure the $1.496 million earmark in the fiscal year 2004 appropriations bill. In FY 2003 he helped secure $1.787 million for the project.
