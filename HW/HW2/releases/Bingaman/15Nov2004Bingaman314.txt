SEN. BINGAMAN COMMENTS ON ENERGY SECRETARY ABRAHAM'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement about Spencer Abraham's decision to step down as energy secretary: 
   "I think Secretary Abraham served the president well at the Department of Energy. I have appreciated his willingness to consider my views on many energy issues, and to work with me on other issues over which DOE has jurisdiction. 
  "Spencer Abraham understood how important Sandia and Los Alamos are to the country, and he strongly supported them over the past four years. It will be essential for the new energy secretary to have same knowledge and understanding of our labs so that they continue to play a major research and development role. 
  "As for management of LANL, I fully expect that the department will stick with its current timeline for issuing its request for proposals and for awarding a new contract by next fall."
   Bingaman is the senior Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
