SENATE APPROVES BILL TO NAME SANTA FE COURTHOUSE IN HONOR OF JUDGE SANTIAGO CAMPOS
  The Senate on Monday approved legislation written by Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici that designates the United States Courthouse in Santa Fe as the "Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse." Santiago Campos, appointed to the Federal Bench in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter, was the first Hispanic federal judge to serve in New Mexico.  
   "Judge Santiago Campos was a highly respected lawyer and jurist who devoted himself to serving his state and his country. Naming the court house in his memory is a fitting tribute to this extraordinary public servant," Bingaman said.
   "Judge Santiago Campos was a distinguished public service who served our nation and our state with distinction. He became one of the well-respected legal minds in the history of New Mexico, so naming the Santa Fe federal courthouse after him is a natural fit. I'm pleased the Senate has agreed, and I look forward to House passage so we can move forward to honoring Judge Campos in this way," Domenici said. 
   Campos served as a seaman first class in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the Assistant Attorney General and then First Assistant Attorney General of New Mexico and was a district court judge in New Mexico's First Judicial District from 1971 to 1978. He was the prime mover in reestablishing federal court judicial activity in Santa Fe and had his chambers in the courthouse there for over 22 years. For his dedication to the state, Judge Campos received distinguished achievement awards in 1993 from both the State Bar of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico. 
   Campos held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from February 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989 and took senior status in 1992. He died in January 2001.
   Representative Tom Udall introduced the same measure in the House of Representatives.
