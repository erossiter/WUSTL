SEN. BINGAMAN: LOS LUNAS HEAD START AWARDED $3.5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman announced today that the Mid-West New Mexico Community Action Program has been awarded $3.5 million in federal funding to support its Head Start program.  
   "Head Start works to ensure children are ready to enter elementary school," Bingaman said. "This funding will be of great benefit to children in the Los Lunas area." 
   Created in 1965, the Head Start Program helps low income, pre school children prepare for school by providing comprehensive development services for children ages 3 to 5. The program, which is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also provides social services for their families. 
   A senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Bingaman has long been a strong supporter of Head Start programs across New Mexico.
