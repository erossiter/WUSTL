SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT DEMING AIRPORT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today the Deming Municipal Airport will benefit from $1.4 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Funds will be used to begin phase I construction to extend runway 08/26. 
   "Airports are one of the best economic tools that a community has to offer, but they are expensive to maintain. I'm pleased the federal government is lending a helping hand to help the Deming airport make some needed improvements," Bingaman said.
