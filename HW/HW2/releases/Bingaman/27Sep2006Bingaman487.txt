SEN. BINGAMAN: HISTORIC AGREEMENT GIVES RAMAH NAVAJO CHAPTER ACCESS TO TRANSPORTATION FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today applauded the signing of an agreement that would for the first time allow highway funds to be directly managed by Ramah Navajo Chapter. Attending the singing ceremony in Washington, DC was Ramah President Lee Pino.  
   Under the agreement signed today, Ramah can now directly manage their transportation improvement funds allocated by the federal government and five them the authority to address road safety on reservation lands. Previously, the U.S. Department of the Interior managed the funds for them. 
   "This agreement honors Native American sovereignty and rightfully allows tribes to decide what transportation project are a priority," Bingaman said. "I am pleased President Pino was able to come out to Washington to take part in this historic event." 
   Among the top priority transportation projects for the Ramah Chapter are the paving of Navajo Route 122 and the reconstruction of Navajo Route 125. 
   The "Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act: A Legacy for Users" (SAFETEA-LU) law that was signed last year significantly increased funding for the Indian Reservation Roads (IRR) program, which funds road projects on reservation lands. The new law provides the IRR Program $1.86 billion over five years for road construction and safety training, up from the $1.6 billion that was in the pervious six years law. Ramah's share, determined by a formula, is about $1 million per year.
