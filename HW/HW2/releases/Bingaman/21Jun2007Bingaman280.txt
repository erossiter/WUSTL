SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO TO BENEFIT FROM OVER $1 MILLION IN ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today confirmed that three New Mexico organizations will benefit from federal funding being awarded through the U.S. Economic Development Administration. 
   All Indian Pueblo Council will receive $1 million for infrastructure improvements in a Historically Underutilized Business Zone (HUBZone) in Albuquerque. The area will serve retail and commercial businesses and will create 200 new jobs and is estimated to generate private investment of up to $3 million. 
   New Mexico Community Capital will receive $350,000 to support the establishment of IMPACT-New Mexico, a technical assistance program offering sustainable business services and entrepreneurial assistance to high-potential companies in rural communities in the state. 
   "This funding represents a tremendous investment in job creation initiatives in New Mexico," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also said Northern New Mexico College in Espa?ola will benefit from a $97,850 economic development grant. Funding will support the EDA University Center program at the collage, which promotes job creation and private investment in northern New Mexico.
