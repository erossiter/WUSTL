SEN. BINGAMAN URGES SUPPORT FOR PROGRAM VITAL TO NEW MEXICO PEANUT PRODUCES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Senate's top two leaders to support a key program that would save New Mexico peanut farmers more than a million dollars.  
   The provision covers the cost of peanut storage and handling fees for peanut producers, and was first enacted in the 2002 farm bill. The program expired with last year's crop. The loss of this key peanut program feature would cost peanut growers up to an additional $50 to $60 per ton, which represents at least $74 million to the nation's peanut producers per year. 
   In a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Bingaman urged that the peanut storage program be included in the new version Iraq supplemental spending bill that will soon be negotiated by a Senate-House panel. 
   "It would be devastating to peanut farmers, if Congress failed to extend one of the vital features of the peanut program. Elimination of this part of the program would change the economics of growing peanuts, thereby causing peanut farmers to switch production to other commodities or even go out of business. New Mexico is the tenth largest peanut producing state in the nation. In 2006, the state's crop was 43.2 million pounds with a value of $8.8 million. About 12,000 acres will be planted in peanuts this year. Roosevelt and Lea are the principal peanut producing counties.
