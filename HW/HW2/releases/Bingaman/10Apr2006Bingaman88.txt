SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN SEE USAF ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT AS POSITIVE STEP TOWARD HOLLOMAN F-22A PHASE-IN
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today said they view the U.S. Air Force announcement to begin an environmental assessment of deploying F-22A Raptor aircraft at Holloman Air Force Base as a positive step for the base. 
   The Air Force on Monday published in the Federal Register a notice of intent to conduct an assessment of the potential environmental consequences of the F-22A aircraft beddown at Holloman. In addition to aircraft operations, the review will also assess expected personnel and facility changes that the new mission will require. Such assessments generally take six to nine months to complete.
   The assessment is linked to the Air Force's FY2007 budget request to begin retiring the F-117 stealth fighters--10 aircraft in FY2007 and the remaining 42 F-117A and T-38A aircraft in FY2008. The Air Force intends to establish two squadrons of F-22A aircraft in New Mexico as its third Raptor operational wing. 
   "I will take the Air Force's prompt action for an environmental assessment as good news because it means plans are underway to clear a path for the F-22s to be assigned to Holloman," Domenici said. "I don't foresee any problems with this process, and look forward to its successful conclusion."
   "We have been pressing the Pentagon to make a seamless transition from the F-117s to the Raptor. I'm encouraged that the Pentagon is making the necessary steps to make that possible," Bingaman said. 
   The Federal Register notice on the Holloman assessment plan can be found at: http://a257.g.akamaitech.net/7/257/2422/01jan20061800/ edocket.access.gpo.gov/2006/E6-5169.htm. Each squadron eventually assigned to Holloman is likely to consist of 18 F-22As. Holloman is slated to be the third base to receive the aircraft, with F-22A squadrons first being sent to Langley and Elmendorf Air Force bases. 
   As part of the assessment, the Air Force will conduct three public scoping meetings in New Mexico, including:
   * Ruidoso Downs - Monday, April 17, 5:30-7:30 p.m., Best Western Pine Springs Inn, 1420 W. Highway 70.
   * Truth or Consequences - Tuesday, April 18, 5:30-7:30 p.m., T or C Civic Center, 400 W. Fourth St.
   * Alamogordo - Wednesday, April 19, 5:30-7:30 p.m., Sergeant Willie Estrada Memorial Civic Center, 800 E. First St.
   Last month, the New Mexico Senators requested that language be included in the FY2007 Defense Authorization Bill to ensure that F-22A Raptor aircraft are ready for deployment before the Air Force retires the entire fleet of F-117 stealth fighters at Holloman Air Force Base in Otero County.
   The F-22A Raptor is a new aircraft that will form the backbone of future military air operations. The aircraft has stealth and supersonic capabilities and is equipped with the latest avionics and weapons systems. It is suited for both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat missions.
