SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED THAT KEY SPENDING BILL CONTAINS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO FIGHT METH USE, OTHER CRIMES IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a key spending bill that the full Senate will soon consider contains millions of dollars to fight meth use, tackle border crime, and support the state's drug courts.
   The funding is in the fiscal year 2008 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill, which has already been approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee.  
   "This bill would send millions of dollars to New Mexico to fight crime. It would help us tackle meth use, which has reached epidemic proportions in parts of our state, and provide critical support to law enforcement," Bingaman said. 
  Bingaman secured funding for the following projects: 
  * $250,000 Luna County Sheriff's Department, Southwest New Mexico Border Law Enforcement Alliance: Funding was requested on behalf of the Southwest Border Law Enforcement Alliance to assist border law enforcement agencies situated along the New Mexico-Mexico border with border-related criminal activity, such as human smuggling, narcotics trafficking, vehicle thefts, and destruction of private property. The Alliance is composed of the Sheriff's Departments of Dona Ana County, Hidalgo County, Grant County, Luna County, Otero County, and the Columbus Police Department. Funds would be used to purchase needed equipment to improve communication capabilities, surveillance, and enhance officer protection. 
  * $300,000 New Mexico Administrative Office of the Courts, Drug Court Program: As part of a 5-year plan to place a drug court in every county, the state has established 31 drug courts in 18 of New Mexico's 33 counties. Drug courts have been incredibility effective in New Mexico-the average drug court recidivism rate is 13.4 percent, compared with 27.5 percent nationwide. Funding will be used for the Juvenile Drug Court Program in the 13th Judicial District, Cibola County, and the Adult Drug Court Program in the 12th Judicial District, Otero County, to provide treatment, case management services, and drug testing. 
  * $100,000 Office of the District Attorney, Second Judicial District, Methamphetamine Prosecution Unit: Using seed money by the City of Albuquerque in 2006, the District Attorney created a Methamphetamine Prosecutorial Unit designed to work with local, State, Federal, and Tribal, law enforcement in targeting meth cases. This funding would be used to provide additional staff to screen economic, property, and drug crimes directly related to meth use, production, and distribution, and to prosecute meth-related cases.
  * $150,000 Third Judicial District Attorney's Office, Rural Domestic Violence Initiative, Dona Ana County, New Mexico: Dona Ana County is the fastest growing county in the State and home to many rural areas without basic services to victims of domestic violence. The current program consists of two prosecutors, two victims' advocates and one secretarial position. An additional outreach advocate who travels to the rural areas of the county to underserved victims is needed as well.
  * $100,000 New Mexico Department of Public Safety, Rural Meth Enforcement Activities: Funding will be used to enhance the State Narcotic Section's ability to conduct proactive undercover operations and reduce the supply of meth in New Mexico's rural areas. Specifically, funding is required for meth operations, to obtain specialized equipment and supplies to collect and store evidence, and acquire equipment for undercover operations.
  * $500,000 New Mexico State Police Athletic Leagues (PALS), Gang Prevention-Intervention Program: Funding is requested to further implement a Gang Prevention-Intervention Program by the Coalition of State Police Athletic Leagues (PALS). PALS would use the funding to identify children and youth who are at-risk for gang recruitment and involvement and seek to reduce the attractiveness of gang membership and its lifestyle. 
  * $300,000 Laguna Pueblo Integrated Justice Center: The Laguna Pueblo Integrated Justice Center was originally constructed as an adult detention center to house approximately 21 inmates. Although the facility has been expanded, it has been recommended by the Indian Health Services, National Institute of Corrections, and the Department of Justice, that the detention facility be closed due to insufficient space, substandard conditions, and structural problems. Funding would allow for the planning and design work for a new center to include detention, police, and court space. The facility would also house the Victim Witness Program, the Laguna Prosecutor, and the Public Defender Services.
  * $250,000 City of Albuquerque Police Department (APD), Comprehensive Information Project: Funding was requested to design, implement, and support a state-of-the-art information system. The system would be a fully integrated and centralized system, including a records management system, computer aided dispatch, mobile data computing, automated field reporting system, and a data warehouse available to multiple agencies and jurisdictions. APD's existing information system is outdated and composed of disparate systems that do not integrate well. 
  * $375,000 National Hispanic Juvenile Delinquency Prevention Project of the Self Reliance Foundation: Funding was requested to continue Spanish-language outreach that links Spanish-speaking callers to local after school programs and youth services nationwide, such as Boys and Girls Clubs, YMCA, and proven youth empowerment programs, and to continue critical Hispanic gang prevention efforts.
  * $200,000 Southern New Mexico Science, Engineering, Mathematics, and Aerospace Academy: New Mexico State University (NMSU) College of Education requests the funding to continue the development of a unique model focused on space education for meeting the mathematics and science learning needs of under-represented K-12 students. The SNM SEMAA program promotes increasing science and math achievement and opportunities for increasing the numbers of diverse students entering the science, mathematics, and engineering fields.
