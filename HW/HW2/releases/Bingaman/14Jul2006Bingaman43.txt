SEN. BINGAMAN PROVISION WOULD INCREASE PORT HOURS AT SANTA TERESA
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was pleased a bill pending before the Senate contains language he authored to extend commercial hours of operation at the Santa Teresa Port of Entry.  
   Bingaman provision would extend hours at Santa Teresa to at least 16 hours a day up from 10. Current staffing levels and hours of operation have created long delays at Santa Teresa and are not conducive to the flow of commercial traffic. 
   "It's vital that we work to secure our borders while at the same time recognize how important facilitating trade is to our country's economic wellbeing," Bingaman said. "Increasing operation hours at Santa Teresa would help encourage businesses to use New Mexico's ports of entry and would be a big boost to the state's economy." 
   The provision is part of the Customs and Trade Facilitation Reauthorization Act of 2006, which authorizes the commercial operations and revenue functions of U.S. Customs and Border Protection to facilitate safe, efficient international commerce. The bill is currently pending before the Senate Finance Committee. Bingaman is the top Democrat on the Finance Committee's Subcommittee on International Trade. 
   The bill also does the following: 
   * Adds personnel for all U.S. ports of entry; 
   * Authorizes the negotiation of bilateral customs partnerships (such as the Container Security Initiative) with foreign governments to facilitate safer U.S.-bound trade; 
   * Requires CBP to target and report on Methamaphetamine and precursor chemical seizures and traffic; 
   * Authorizes a Customs Industry Partnership Program (including the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism) to facilitate safer trade; the program shall offer benefits to qualifying customs users who use secure business systems and meet appropriate physical security requirements. 
   Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill that passed the Senate yesterday contains a provision Bingaman worked to include, which directs Customs and Border Patrol to provide a report regarding commercial traffic at Santa Teresa port.
