TWO NEW MEXICO GROUPS TO BENEFIT FROM SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that two Northern New Mexico organizations have been awarded funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Business Grant Programs: Native American Funding Sections.  
 Bingaman helped create the program, which sets aside funding for loans and grants to benefit Native American Tribes.
   The Native American Lending Group in Santa Fe will benefit from a $95,000 grant to supplement a Revolving Loan Fund that will be used to assist Native American Communities where poverty rates exceed 20 percent.
   Picuris Pueblo has been awarded a $102,000 grant, which will be used to develop a comprehensive economic development plan for the pueblo.
   "These grants are an important investment in creating and supporting economic opportunities in Indian County," Bingaman said.
