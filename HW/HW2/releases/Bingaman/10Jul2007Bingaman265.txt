SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ADDRESS NEEDS OF BORDER RANCHERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the U.S. Department of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) will incorporate cattle fencing as part of their efforts to rebuild vehicle barrier along the New Mexico-Mexico border.  
   In late June, Bingaman called on CBP to act quickly to replace a new vehicle barrier along the border that was unintentionally erected by the U.S. government on the Mexican side of the border. Bingaman also called on CBP to integrate a cattle component as part of the rebuilding process. The misplaced barrier is located about 17 miles west of Columbus. 
   In a letter to Bingaman, CBP formally announced that they have begun the process of dismantling the 1.5 miles of existing vehicle barrier that was constructed on the Mexican side of the border and are simultaneously constructing new barrier on the U.S. side. Temporary fencing will be erected during the rebuilding process to ensure the border remains secure. 
   "I am encouraged to learn that CPB is taking immediate steps to correct this mistake and that they are working to ensure that this does not happen again," Bingaman said. "Vehicle barriers play an important role in helping secure our country's southern border and I am pleased that CBP is working to address the needs of border ranchers as part of their reconstruction efforts." 
   The addition of a cattle component to the vehicle barrier is one of the key recommendations made by the Southwest New Mexico Border Security Task Force. Bingaman created the Border Task Force 2003. Fencing is essential in preventing cattle from roaming back and forth over the border and in helping guard against the spread of animal diseases.
