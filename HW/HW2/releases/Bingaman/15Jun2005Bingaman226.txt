DOT RELEASES FUNDS SECURED BY SEN. BINGAMAN FOR ALBUQUERQUE'S WEST SIDE TRANSIT BUS PROJECT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the federal government has released $600,000 he helped secure for a transit bus project on Albuquerque's West Side.  
   The funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and will go toward the construction of the West Side Transit Facility. Although Bingaman secured $972,000 in the fiscal year 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Act for the facility, DOT is only releasing $600,000 for phase IV of the project. The remaining funding will be released in the coming months. 
   "Albuquerque's public transportation system continues to expand, and it needs a home that can accommodate it. The West Side Transit facility will provide ABQ Ride with the room needs to grow," Bingaman said. 
   The funding being released today will be used to complete construction of the maintenance facility, the operations building and the bus parking/storage structure.
   The facility, which is being constructed on 20 acres of land located at the southwest corner of Unser Blvd. and I-40, will relieve overcrowding at the Yale Transit Facility. The city plans to transfer approximately one-half of its fleet and some support vehicles to the new facility when it's completed.
   Bingaman secured $2 million in 2000 and $5 million in 2001 for Phase I of the project, which included road construction, perimeter wall and site infrastructure. He also secured $3.75 million in 2002 and $2 million in 2004. Bingaman has requested $2 million for fiscal year 2006 to continue work on the project.
