SEN. BINGAMAN: UNION COUNTY FARMERS AND RANCHERS ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER AID
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that Union County has been declared eligible for disaster assistance due to its proximity to Oklahoma counties, which were declared disaster areas due to heavy rains, flooding, high winds and tornados that occurred earlier this year.  
   As a result of the declaration, farmers and ranchers in Union County are now eligible to be considered for low-interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   "I am pleased the USDA is lending a helping hand to farmers and ranchers in Union County who were economically harmed due to the extreme weather in the area," Bingaman said. 
   For more information or to determine eligibility for a low interest loan contact the local USDA Farm Service Center.
