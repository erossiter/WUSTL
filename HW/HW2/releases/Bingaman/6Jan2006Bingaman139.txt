SEN. BINGAMAN HELPS SECURE FUNDS FOR NEW TOWER AT DOUBLE EAGLE II
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the federal government is making another investment in Double Eagle II airport, the home of Eclipse Aviation. 
   Bingaman today participated in a groundbreaking ceremony that will lead to a new contact tower at the busy airport. Bingaman has helped secure $1.9 million in federal funding for the new control tower now under construction. He also secured $12 million for the upgrade of the Paseo de V?lcan interchange and access road. Additionally, though Bingaman's efforts, the Federal Aviation Administration provided $3.5 million last year and an additional $1 million this year for work to upgrade runways and taxiways at the airport. 
   "Double Eagle II is a very busy airport, and this new tower will help improve safety for pilots," Bingaman said. "This is another in a series of investments that that federal government is making in Double Eagle II, which is the home to Eclipse Aviation. Clearly the Double Eagle II airport will be an economic engine for the city." 
   Bingaman praised Mayor Martin Chavez for his efforts in support of Double Eagle II. 
   "I look forward to continuing to work with Mayor Chaves for the additional infrastructure needed here for Eclipse Aviation and for future developments in Albuquerque," Bingaman said.
