FEDERALS RELEASE FUNDS SECURED BY REP. BINGAMAN FOR ROSWELL AIRPORT PROJECT
 Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the federal Department of Transportation (DOT) has released $1.09 million he secured for improvements at the Roswell International Air Center. 
   Funds will be used to purchase a new aircraft rescue and fire fighting (ARFF) vehicle to replace the current one, which is old and unreliable. Funding will also allow the airport to add an elevator to the terminal building, which is needed to be compliant with the American with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   "Airports are one of the best economic tools that a community has to offer, but they are expensive to maintain. I'm pleased the federal government is lending a helping hand to help the Roswell airport make some needed improvements," Bingaman said.
