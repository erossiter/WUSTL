SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL CONTAINS PROVISIONS THAT WOULD BENEFIT CARLSBAD, SANTA TERESA RAIL YARD RELOCATION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a key transportation bill, which corrects and updates a number of provisions originally passed in the 2005 SAFETEA-LU (The Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act-Legacy for Users), contains language he requested that will benefit two New Mexico projects. 
   Bingaman secured $5 million, in SAFETEA-LU for the reconstruction of 7 miles of the NM-524 truck bypass in Carlsbad. Mayor Bob Forrest asked Bingaman to seek Congressional approval of a provision that would allow the city to use some of the $5 million for a Canal Street reconstruction project. Additional funds for Canal Street would supplement the state and federal funding already identified for the project. The total cost of the 1.6-mile project is approximately $7.3 million.
   "The City of Carlsbad has designated the Canal street reconstruction project a high priority. The language in this bill will make it possible for them to access the funding they need to help complete it," Bingaman said.
   Because the $5 million was originally set aside in the law exclusively for N.M.-524, Congressional approval is needed before the funds can be redirected.
   The bill also redirects $14 million, originally slated for the relocation of the El Paso rail yards to Santa Teresa, for road infrastructure and other projects relating to the relocation of the new yard. United Pacific Rail Road has already begun the process of relocating the rail yard to its new location.
   "The relocation of the rail yard to Santa Teresa will bring about economic development opportunities in this region of the state. This funding would be a great investment," Bingaman said.
   The bill is now ready to be considered by the full Senate.
