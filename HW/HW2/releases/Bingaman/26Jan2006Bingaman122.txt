SEN. BINGAMAN SAYS HE WILL VOTE NO ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ALITO TO REPLACE JUSTICE SANDRA DAY O'CONNOR
  After thoroughly examining the judicial record of Judge Samuel Alito, and carefully listening to the judge's responses to the Senate Judiciary Committee, Sen.  
 Jeff Bingaman today announced that he has decided to vote "no" on the nomination of Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
   Bingaman said he believes Judge Alito will fundamentally shift the balance of the Court and move the country in the wrong direction. 
  "We need to have a Supreme Court that's prepared to provide the necessary checks and balances crucial to our democratic system of government. I believe Justice O'Connor charted a moderate course in terms of Congress's authority to enact legislation aimed at protecting the welfare of Americans and with regard to upholding the rights of citizens' vis-?-vis their own government. And I believe it is important to maintain that same course," Bingaman said in a speech on the Senate floor.
   "At a time when the president has asserted expansive powers with regard to imprisoning U.S. citizens without charges, with regard to wiretapping without warrants, with regard to using interrogation techniques that amount to torture, it's essential that we have justices on the Supreme Court that are willing to provide a check on the authority of the executive branch. Judge Alito's record indicates that he may not be the right person to provide this check," he added.
   This is the President Bush's second nominee to the Supreme Court. Bingaman voted in favor of the nomination of Chief Justice John Roberts.
