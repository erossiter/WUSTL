SEN. BINGAMAN: PUEBLO OF LAGUNA TO BENEFIT FROM UTILITY DEVELOPMENT GRANT FUNDING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Pueblo of Laguna Utility Authority (PLUA) has been awarded a $140,000 grant from the Indian Affairs Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development (IEED).  
   Funding will be used to conduct a study to examine the feasibility of the PLUA operating the electrical utility system serving the tribe's main reservation and three separate land areas while providing improved service at costs no higher than its customers now pay. The study also will establish electrical reliability standards, identify the type and cost of electrical distribution system improvements needed to meet those standards, and address the practicality of developing village-scale renewable energy projects. 
   "I am pleased the funding awarded today will help the Pueblo of Laguna provide important electrical service to its citizens without placing an extra burden on them," Bingaman said. The PLUA seeks to improve electricity service in order to attract high technology businesses to the 533,000-acre reservation. 
   The Office of Indian Energy and Economic Development helps tribes stimulate job creation and foster the development of domestic energy resources to reduce the nation's dependence on foreign energy sources.
