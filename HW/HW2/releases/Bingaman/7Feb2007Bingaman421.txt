SEN. BINGAMAN ANNOUNCES NEW VA VET CENTERS COMING TO LAS CRUCES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Las Cruces will soon be home to a new vet center, which provides readjustment counseling and outreach services to combat veterans.  
   Bingaman said he was pleased the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs' (VA) vet center program is expanding into 23 new communities around the country, including Las Cruces. "It is important for the federal government to provide American combat veterans with access to a variety of support services when they return home. This center will be an important resource for veterans living in Las Cruces and the surrounding region," Bingaman said. 
   All vet centers are community-based and provide combat veterans and their families with mental health and employment counseling and family issues, education, bereavement and outreach services. Each center is staffed with counselors, outreach specialists and other specialists, many of whom are combat veterans themselves. 
   New Mexico currently has three existing VA vet centers. They are located in Albuquerque, Santa Fe and Farmington. 
   The vet center program was established by Congress in 1979. Combat veterans and their families are eligible for military related care at a VA vet center at no cost. Also eligible are veterans who were sexually assaulted or harassed while on active duty and the families of service members who die on active duty. 
   Bingaman is a strong supported of the VA's vets center program and has supported legislation to expand the program.
