SEN. BINGAMAN ATTENDS AEORJET RIBBON CUTTING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today attended a ribbon-cutting ceremony for AeroJet's new fire-suppression equipment systems, which will create 12 new jobs.  
 He released the following statement:
   "I want to congratulate AeroJet and Steve Welch, the plant operations manager on the collaborative effort with your sister plant that brought this project to fruition. These fire-suppression systems for Ford's Crown Victoria police cruisers will help protect our nation's first responders. AeroJet has a good reputation in the defense community and I am pleased to see that you are expanding the effort here in Socorro to apply this unique expertise beyond the military arena. 
  "New Mexico Tech has a long history of successful collaboration with AeroJet and I want to thank Van Romero and Dr. Lopez for all of their good work. That collaboration has created and enhanced local technical know-how in a variety of areas and helped create good jobs here in Socorro. I will do what I can to see that these good efforts can continue here in the future. 
  "I understand the State Department of Economic Development and Rick Homans have supported this new plant with a Job Training Incentive Grant, and I want to thank Rick for all of the good work he is doing in New Mexico to bring quality employment opportunity to the state, and to ensure that New Mexicans are trained to meet the challenges of these new jobs.
  "Again, thank you for inviting me today and I look forward to continuing to work to promote economic development and job creation in Socorro in the future."
