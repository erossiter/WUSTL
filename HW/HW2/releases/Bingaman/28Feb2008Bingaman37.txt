SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT OF SUPPORT FOR GOVERNOR'S ACTION ON AKELA FLATS GAMING
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement: 
   "I fully support Gov. Richardson's action. I believe the state has the right to insist that any gaming that occurs in New Mexico be done in accordance with our state laws. Clearly the state has not agreed to establish a casino at this location, and the governor is acting to preserve the laws of New Mexico."
