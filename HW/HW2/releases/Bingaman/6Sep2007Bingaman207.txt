SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT CARLSBAD HIGHWAY PROJECT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman announced today that the State of New Mexico has been awarded a $560,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  
   Funding will help with the 4-lane reconstruction of the 35-mile segment of US Highway 62/180 that extends from Carlsbad south to the Texas state line. The route provides an important transportation connection between Mexico and the United States, and is vital to the economic development of southeast New Mexico. The route also provides access to Carlsbad Caverns National Park. 
   "Widening US 62-180 from two lanes to four will help improve traffic flow and enhance the safety of the corridor. The funding awarded today will help with this important project," Bingaman said. 
   Separately, Bingaman also helped secure $5 million for the highway project in fiscal year 2005 spending bill. That funding has been released and construction is expected to begin this month.
