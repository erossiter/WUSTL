SEN. BINGAMAN: DEPARTMENT OF STATE DISPATCHES TEAM TO HELP ISSUE PASSPORTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the U.S. Department of State is taking immediate action to help clear the backlog of applications for U.S. passports. In recent months, the number of Americans applying for passports has increased dramatically, in large part because as of January U.S. citizens must have passports to enter or re-enter the United States when are traveling by air. 
   Bingaman's state offices have been working on behalf of New Mexicans who are waiting to receive their passports, and discovered that there is a serious bottleneck at the Houston Passport Agency - where many New Mexico applications are processed. Bingaman has expressed his concern to the State Department, and today learned that a team has been assigned to the Houston office. The team will provide reinforcements to reduce the backlog, as well as analyze the reasons for the problems so that a long-term fix can be implemented. "New Mexicans have been waiting for months for their passports, and that is totally unacceptable. I'm glad that the State Department has assigned a team to address the situation, and I'll be looking for immediate progress," Bingaman said.
