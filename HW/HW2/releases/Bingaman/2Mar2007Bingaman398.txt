SEN. BINGAMAN REACTS TO SELECTION OF LIVERMORE/SANDIA LABS FOR RRW DESIGN WORK
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement regarding the Department of Energy's announcement that the team of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories will design the Reliable Replacement Warhead. Los Alamos National Laboratory had also submitted a proposal to design the RRW.  
   "I know LANL put together a very competitive proposal. Notwithstanding this decision, LANL clearly is home to some of the best scientists in the world and will continue to play a major role in ensuring we have a safe, reliable and secure stockpile, and in advancing basic science and technology R&D," Bingaman said. 
   Sandia National Laboratories will perform significant non-nuclear components of the RRW.
