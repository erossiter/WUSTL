SEN. BINGAMAN WELCOMES LOPRESTI TO BELEN
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said it is clear New Mexico is becoming a hub for aviation with the news that LoPresti is opening a manufacturing plant in Belen. "First Albuquerque received the great news that Eclipse will soon be ready to begin delivering planes, and now Belen has its own reason to celebrate.  
   New Mexico is fast becoming a hub for the aviation industry, and I believe this is just the beginning of aviation-related economic development in our state," Bingaman said. "I'd like to be among the first to welcome LoPresti to Belen. I believe they made a very wise decision to move to this community." Bingaman took several steps to help recruit LoPresti. Last month he personally called Curt LoPresti, the company's CEO to tout Belen. Bingaman also is also working to secure $1.5 million in the fiscal year 2007 Transportation Appropriations Bill, which is working its way through the Senate, for a new crosswind runway at Belen's Alexander Municipal Airport. He secured $609,000 in FY2006 and $871,287 in FY2005 to acquire land and complete the design of the runway. LoPresti will build the LoPresti Fury aircraft at the airport.
