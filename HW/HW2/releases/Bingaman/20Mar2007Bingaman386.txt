SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS EFFORTS TO RESTORE FULL BENEFITS TO MILITARY SPOUSES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined in cosponsoring legislation that would help ensure that the widows and their dependent children of the brave man and women who have served our country are not shortchanged.  
   Widows of active duty and or retired military service members who have died from a service-connected cause are eligible to receive annuity payments from the Department of Defense (DOD). Widows of retired service members are eligible for an additional annuity payment from the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA). Unfortunately, under current law, those eligible for both have their DOD payments reduced by the amount of the VA compensation. 
   The legislation Bingaman is cosponsoring would make it possible for spouses and dependent children of military service men and women to collect both benefits in their entirety. 
   "We must never forget the men and women who have served our country proudly. We must also always remember their families who have also made an enormous sacrifice," Bingaman said. "The loss of a soldier is also the loss of a son, daughter, father, mother, sister or brother. Ensuring their family members receive fair compensation is the least we can do for these brave Americas."
