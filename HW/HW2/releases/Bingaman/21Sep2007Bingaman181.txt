SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AWARDED $4.84 MILLION TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE ABUSE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman confirmed today that the New Mexico Department of Health has been awarded a $4.83 million from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
   Bingaman said funding will be used to provide people seeking drug and alcohol treatment with vouchers allowing them a greater range of choices in selecting the services most appropriate for their needs. 
   "There is more than one way to combat drug and alcohol addiction, and what works for one person might not work for another. This funding will help the state provide those seeking treatment with the ability to choose a program right for them," Bingaman said. 
   Under the grant program, New Mexico will increase and enhance treatment and recovery support services and offer client choice by sustaining and expanding its current voucher-based system, which has served more than 11,000 clients. The project will also provide substantial outreach to potential clients, new providers, especially faith-based providers, and to referral partners in each local community, all with the goal of further increasing choices in recovery support services through faith- and community-based organizations. 
   Bingaman is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees HHS.
