SEN. BINGAMAN MEASURE BOLSTERS NEW MEXICO HEALTH CARE BY $66 MILLION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today won Senate support of an amendment to bolster New Mexico's health care safety net by $66 million.  
 The vote was 54-45. 
   Under a new formula that determines the level of funds the federal government sends to states to support Medicaid - the federal and state funded health care program for low-income Americans - New Mexico lost $79 million this fiscal year. Bingaman's amendment to a key budget bill restores $66 million of that amount. 
   "Our state relies heavily on federal funding to help give uninsured New Mexicans access to health care. Medicaid in our state is stretched to the limit, and it would be devastating if the federal government suddenly cut off tens of millions of dollars in support," Bingaman said. 
   Specifically, the Bingaman amendment directs the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to ensure that no state receives a cut of more than 0.5 percent of their federal Medicaid matching payments. 
   The amendment was made part of the Senate's version of the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005. That bill is expected to pass the Senate today or tomorrow, and will then have to be finalized by House and Senate negotiators before it can go to the president.
