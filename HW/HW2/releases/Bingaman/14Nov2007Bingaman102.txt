SEN. BINGAMAN: MCKINLEY, SAN JUAN COUNTIES COULD RECEIVE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR TRANSPORTATION & OTHER PROJECTS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today reported that the final version of a key spending bill contains millions of dollars to address transportation and other needs in Northwest New Mexico.  
   A House-Senate panel has finalized the fiscal year 2008 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and Related Agencies spending bill, and it is now poised for a final vote. But Bingaman said the funding is in jeopardy because the White House is threatening to veto the measure. 
   "This spending bill directs millions of dollars to New Mexico. I hope the president changes his mind about vetoing this important bill," Bingaman said. 
   At Bingaman's request, the fiscal year 2008 Transportation Appropriations Bill contains $635,000 for McKinley County - $300,000 for the improvement of bridges and $335,000 for the construction of a juvenile crisis and detention complex. 
   Bingaman was also pleased the bill set aside an additional $3 million for New Mexico's highway bridges. The additional funding would supplement the $315 million that the underlying bill already provides to the state for transportation improvement projects, including interstate highways, bridges and major roads on the national highway system. New Mexico would decide how to use the extra money to repair or replace highway bridges. 
   The bill also contains the following for San Juan County: 
   $900,000 for improvements to Pi?on Hills Blvd East in Farmington: The funding would be used for a four-lane extension that would run from the current intersection on Main Street (NM 516) across the river to county road 3950. 
   $600,000 San Juan County Road 3900 construction: Funding will be used to construct 1 mile of County Road 3900 to connect with the Pi?on Hills Boulevard extension from Farmington onto Crouch Mesa. 
   $600,000 for a relief route to bypass the City of Aztec: Funding would be used for the construction of a two-lane paved road designed to provide an alternative route for large truck traffic. More than 9,000 vehicles, including heavy industrial traffic, travel through Aztec on a daily basis, creating safety hazards and significantly deteriorating its roads. 
   $300,000 San Juan County, County Road 7500: Funding will be used for upgrades to this road, which is a two-lane dirt and gravel road which becomes impassable during inclement weather due to muddy, slick and washboard conditions. CR 7500 is also the major school route for the Bloomfield, Bureau of Indian Affairs School and the Navajo Head Start systems, which combined, transport 1,500 children each day to and from school. 
   The bill also funds other initiatives Bingaman supports, including the following: 
   * $500,000 for San Juan County Road Bridge #567, NM. 
   * $50,000 for the Pueblo Acoma for a community and wellness center.
