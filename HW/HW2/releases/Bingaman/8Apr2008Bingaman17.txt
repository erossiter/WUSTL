SEN. BINGAMAN: CLOVIS AIRPORT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Clovis Municipal Airport has been awarded an $80,000 grant through the U.S. Department of Transportation. 
   Bingaman said the airport will use the funds to conduct a runway end survey needed to implement a new vertical guidance approach, which will make the airport more accessible to pilots.
   "This is a major investment in the city's future and will help ensure that its airport continues to provide a vital service to the community and to Cannon Air Force Base," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is seeking an additional $8 million over the next two years to reconstruct and extend runway 04/22 to accommodate increased traffic associated with the new mission of Cannon Air Force Base.
