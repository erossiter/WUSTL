SEN. BINGAMAN, REP. UDALL URGE USDA TO ACT QUICKLY TO AID NEW MEXICANS SUFFERING FROM SNOW STORM
  Today, Sen. Jeff Bingaman and Rep. Tom Udall continued working to ensure that the federal government is doing all it can to assist New Mexicans who have been hurt by the storm that dumped more than two feet of snow in the state last week.  
   Bingaman today called U.S. Department of Agriculture Secretary Johanns to encourage him to act immediately on Gov. Bill Richardson's request for a disaster declaration. Udall's office also once again contacted Secretary Johanns and Undersecretary Mark Keenum to urge the agency to make available all resources necessary to ensure the needs of his constituents are met. They have also contacted the National Guard to offer support in facilitating food drops to the livestock in the area. 
   "The storm took a major toll on our state, particularly on New Mexico ranchers. I hope Secretary Johanns will act quickly to approve Governor Richardson's disaster request. This issue deserves the secretary's immediate attention," Bingaman said. 
   "The livelihoods of New Mexico ranchers have been threatened by the major storms that have hit our state. Since day one of the disaster, I've worked with Governor Richardson, Secretary Johanns, and the National Guard to help remedy the situation. Now we urge the Secretary to approve the Governor's disaster request with the necessary urgency," Udall said.
