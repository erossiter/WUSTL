SEN. BINGAMAN: FORT SUMNER FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that Valley Fire District in Fort Sumner has been awarded a $142,500 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   Funding comes from the Vehicle Acquisition Program and can be used to purchase pumpers, brush trucks, tankers/tenders, rescue vehicles, ambulances, aerials, foam units and fire boats. 
   "This fund will help ensure that the Valley Fire District has the resources they need to handle any emergency situation that should arise," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters programs, which provides much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
