SEN. BINGAMAN PRESSES FOR AIR SERVICE FROM SILVER CITY TO ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Bush Administration to continue providing air service from Silver City to Albuquerque.  
   Last month, Bingaman joined in calling on the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) to renew their contract with Great Lakes Airlines to continue providing air service in Grant County through the Essential Air Service Program. Unfortunately, a misunderstanding lead DOT to interpret Grant County's desire to mean it preferred flights to Phoenix instead of Albuquerque. 
   In a telephone call to a top DOT official, Bingaman made it clear that the country was seeking continued air service to Albuquerque and additionally seeking funding for flights to Phoenix. 
   "While I was pleased to heat that the Great Lakes Airlines has been chosen to continue providing Essential Air Service from Silver City, I was confused as to why Phoenix was chosen over Albuquerque as the destination for these flights," Bingaman said. "I hope DOT will take my concerns, as well as the concerns of Grant County and Silver City officials, into consideration and correct this mix-up." 
   Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before deregulation continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico has a total of 5 EAS communities: Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs and Silver City.
