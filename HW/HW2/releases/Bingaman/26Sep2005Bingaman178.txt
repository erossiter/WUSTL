SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP COMBAT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that two New Mexico Indian Pueblos have been awarded federal funds to help combat violent crimes against women.  
 The funds come from the U.S. Department of Justice.
   The Pueblo of San Felipe was awarded $125,174 and the Pueblo of Pojoaque was awarded $125,000 to implement a variety of activities aimed at strengthening the tribal justice systems' response to violent crimes committed against Indian women. 
   "Domestic violence and other violent crimes against women are a serious problem. Unfortunately, many times these crimes go unpunished and victims are left to fend for themselves. The funding awarded today will help women get the help they need," Bingaman said. 
   The funds announced today were provided through the "STOP" (Services, Training, Officers and Prosecution) program. That program provides funding to states to fight crimes against women by investing in four components: victims services programs, law enforcement, prosecution, and the courts. 
   The STOP program was created in 1995 as part of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). Bingaman is a cosponsor of legislation that would reauthorize the VAWA.
