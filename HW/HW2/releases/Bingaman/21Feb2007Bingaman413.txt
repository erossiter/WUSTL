SEN. BINGAMAN VISITS CESAR CHAVEZ TO LEARN ABOUT FRESH FRUITS, VEGETABLES PROGRAM BENEFITING STUDENTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today met with students and teachers at Cesar Chavez Elementary School to discuss how the fresh fruits and vegetables they receive daily through the aid of federal funding benefits them.  
   Bingaman secured $1 million in a fiscal year 2006 spending bill to help schools throughout the state provide fruits and vegetables to students, thus encouraging them to eat healthful foods. He is working to secure an additional $1 million to keep the overall program going next year. 
   "Too many on our nation's young people are filling up on food with no nutritional value. I've secured federal funding to help New Mexico schools provide healthy food choices, with the added benefit of teaching students about good nutrition," Bingaman said. 
   The Fresh Fruits and Vegetables program is intended to, as much as possible, bring local farm produce into schools. These healthy foods are served free of charge to children as snacks. The $1 million secured by Bingaman was used to implement the program at 25 New Mexico schools.
