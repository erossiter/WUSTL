SEN. BINGAMAN: SETTLEMENT REQUIRES EL PASO NATURAL GAS TO INVEST MILLIONS TO IMPROVE THE SAFETY OF ITS PIPELINE SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today welcomed news that El Paso Natural Gas will make an $86 million investment in its pipelines to ensure their safety.  
   The U.S. Departments of Justice and Transportation today announced the action against El Paso Natural Gas, which stems from the explosion of one of its pipelines in 2000 that caused the tragic death of 12 people in Carlsbad. 
   In addition to the significant investment in El Paso Natural Gas' pipeline system, the company would also be required to pay $15.5 million in civil penalties. 
   "The explosion that occurred in Carlsbad seven years ago was a tragedy that must never be repeated. The best way to prevent such a devastating accident in the future is to ensure that companies have a strict pipeline maintenance program in place," Bingaman said. "The settlement announced today will require El Paso Natural Gas to invest at least $86 million in its pipeline system." 
   Bingaman was instrumental in helping strengthen pipeline safety inspections and maintenance laws while he was chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in 2002 when the Pipeline Safety Act was reauthorized. 
   According to the Departments of Justice and Transportation, El Paso Natural Gas must do the following: 
   * Modify its Natural Gas Pipeline System to enable certain segments to be inspected by in-line inspection tools to determine the wall thickness of the steel pipes; 
   * Remove pipeline drips that are not as effective as utilizing cleaning pigs on its system; 
   * Collect and analyze liquid samples for corrosive properties whenever a pipeline, vessel, pig trap, meter tube or tank is opened on its system; 
   * Comply with Gas Quality Guidelines that require the monitoring of potentially corrosive gas quality constituents in the gas stream, and report semi-annually that it complied with operating procedures for enforcement; 
   * Conduct annual reviews of EPNG's Site Specific Plans and review all of its non-destructive examination (NDE) records and high resolution magnetic flux leakage data to determine if any facility needs to be inspected, reinspected or monitored to determine if wall loss is occurring; 
   * Develop a training program for EPNG's corrosion control specialists and engineers.
