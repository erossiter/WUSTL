SEN. BINGAMAN: SALE OF BEEF PROCESSORS COULD HURT NEW MEXICO CATTLE RANCHERS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today said the acquisition of two beef processors by the world's largest beef producer could hurt New Mexico cattle ranchers and he is urging the federal government to look into the economic and legal implications of the sale. 
   Brazilian owned JBS announced last month that it had arraigned to purchase U.S.-based Smithfield Beef Group and National Beef Packing Company. The deal would make JBS the largest beef producer in the United States.
   In a letter to the U.S. Justice Department, Bingaman questioned what affect the acquisition would have on the country's beef industry and requested that the department examine the proposal.
   "JBS's proposal to acquire these two U.S. beef processors would give a single company control of about one third of the domestic market and a monopoly in many areas of the country. I am concerned about the possible antitrust implications of the acquisition, as well as its impact on competitive market access for the many small and independent cattle growers in New Mexico. I urge you to consider carefully the implications this merger on the cattle market and the consequences it will have on beef producers who want nothing more than a fair and open marketplace for their product," Bingaman wrote to Attorney General Michael Mukasey.
