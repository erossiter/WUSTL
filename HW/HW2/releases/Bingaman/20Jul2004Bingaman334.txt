SEN. BINGAMAN OPTIMISTIC ABOUT AIR SERVICE RETURNING TO ALAMOGORDO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that four small airlines are bidding to bring air service back to Alamogordo.  
 Rio Grande Airlines, which had served Alamogordo, stopped operating planes to and from the city last month. 
   Bingaman reports that the U.S. Department of Transportation received bids from Mesa Airlines, Arizona Express, Westward Airlines and Great Lakes Aviation. To compete for the DOT-subsidized contract, each airline had to offer two flights from Alamogordo to Albuquerque on workdays. DOT will pay an airline up to $530,000 per year for the air service.
   "Air service is a powerful tool communities can use to attract and retain jobs. That is why I am pleased these four airlines have expressed interest in providing air service to Alamogordo," Bingaman said. 
   "It's even more important for the city to have an airline serving it given that another round of base closures is under way. Having airline service to accommodate visitors to Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range will complement the efforts we have already made to ensure these military installations are strong," he said.
   In the coming weeks, DOT will evaluate the bids and consult with the city of Alamogordo before selecting an airline. Bingaman said he hopes that process is complete by late summer or early fall. 
   When the airlines were deregulated 25 years ago, Congress made a commitment to ensure that smaller communities would continue to have air service, and therefore provides funding every year to subsidize air service to communities such as Alamogordo.
