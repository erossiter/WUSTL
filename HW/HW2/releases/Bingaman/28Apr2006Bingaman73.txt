SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED WITH PROGRESS ON IMPROVEMENTS TO HIS/HOSPITAL CONTRACT PAYMENTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the federal government is moving forward with plans to make it easier and more affordable for the Indian Health Service (IHS) clinics to contract with hospitals for emergency care.  
   Bingaman wrote the provision in the new Medicare prescription drug law that calls on the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to improve the process by which IHS clinics contract with hospitals for care clinics are not able to provide. The current process is extremely costly and overburdens the already underfunded federal program that pays hospitals that contract with IHS to provide emergency services. 
   HHS today unveiled a draft of the guidelines for how much hospitals can bill IHS and Bingaman said it is a vast improvement. Rather than requiring every clinic to negotiate their own reimbursement rates with hospitals for medical procedures, the new regulation says hospitals cannot charge IHS more than Medicare pays hospitals for those same procedures. 
   "This proposal would provide a tremendous benefit to New Mexico tribes and pueblos by streamlining the reimbursement process and providing greater access to care," Bingaman said.
   The regulation is subject to public comment before it is finalized.
