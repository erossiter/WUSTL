SEN. BINGAMAN: MILITARY SPENDING BILL CLEARS SENATE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a key spending bill that passed the Senate contains $20 million for a new Armed Forces Reserve Center at Kirtland Air Force Base (KAFB).  
   The funding, which is contained in the fiscal year 2006 Military Construction Appropriations Bill, will be used to consolidate multiple reservist facilities at KAFB into a single new building. The building was authorized by the 2005 Base Closure and Realignment Commission (BRAC). 
   The bill also contains $11.4 million for a Pararescue Jumper/Combat Rescue Officer Rescue and Recovering Training Center at KAFB. 
   "This bill will help ensure that Kirtland Air Force Base remains state-of-the-art so that we can continue to protect our country and its interests," Bingaman said. 
   The House and Senate must now meet to negotiate a final bill that can be sent to the president for signature.
