SEN. BINGAMAN MEETS WITH RIO RANCHO MAYOR JIM OWEN TO DISCUSS PLANS FOR NEW POST OFFICE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today met with Mayor Jim Owen to discuss plans for a new post office in Rio Rancho. 
   Last week Bingaman met with Postmaster General John (Jack) Potter to, among other things, press the U.S. Postal Service to take immediate steps to open a second post office in Rio Rancho. Bingaman was assured that a new storefront post office could be opened before summer.
   Today, Bingaman said he would work to encourage cooperation between the USPS and the city.
   "The Rio Rancho community should have input as to where the storefront post office should be located. I will be urging the USPS to work closely with Mayor Owen to find a suitable location, so that a new post office can be opened no later than three or four months from now," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman requested the meeting with Potter after concerns about postal service were raised by New Mexicans in Albuquerque, Rio Rancho, Las Cruces and Santa Fe.
   The postmaster thanked Bingaman for bringing postal problem in New Mexico to his attention. After being contacted by Bingaman, the USPS began a process of internal review of all postal operations in New Mexico, which confirmed that service in New Mexico did not meet the standards of the USPS. In recent weeks the USPS has been working with area managers to address problems in management, operations, and staffing. 
   Bingaman and Owen also discussed the city's water needs and how the federal government may be able to help meet them by providing funds for innovative water supply facilities.
