SEN. BINGAMAN WORKING TO DIRECT FEDERAL FUNDS TO CANAL STREET PROJECT
  At the urging of Carlsbad officials, Sen. Jeff Bingaman is working to direct more than $3 million in federal funds to the Canal Street reconstruction and enhancement initiative. Canal Street restoration, from North Y to Pompa Street, is the highest priority infrastructure project for the city.  
   Last year in SAFETEA-LU (The Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act-Legacy for Users), Bingaman secured $5 million specifically for the reconstruction of 7 miles of the NM-524 truck bypass in Carlsbad. Mayor Bob Forrest asked Bingaman to seek Congressional approval of a provision that would allow the city to use some of the $5 million on the Canal Street project, and some of the funds on the NM-524 initiative. The additional funds for Canal Street would supplement the state and federal funding already identified for the project. The total cost of the 1.6-mile project is approximately $7.3 million. 
   Today, the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee passed legislation that contains Bingaman's provision to allow the $5 million appropriation to be shared between the projects. That measure, a SAFETEA "technical corrections" bill, can now be considered by the full Senate. 
   "The Canal Street reconstruction project is clearly the highest priority for the city and I'm glad to help make it a reality," Bingaman said. 
   Because the $5 million was originally set aside in the law exclusively for N.M.-524, Congressional approval is needed before the funds can be redirected. 
   Bingaman hopes that Congress will complete work on the legislation before adjourning for the year.
