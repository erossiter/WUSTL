SEN. BINGAMAN PRESSES FOR DAY OF RECOGNITION FOR RANCHERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman is once again cosponsoring a resolution to recognize the "American Cowboy."  
   The Senate resolution acknowledges the role of ranchers in the development of the West. The resolution states that ranchers embody our nation's strong work ethic, are good stewards of the environment, and play a major role in our nation's economy. This year American Cowboy day is July 28, 2007. 
   Approximately 800,000 ranchers are in business across the country. New Mexico ranchers generated $964 million in sales in 2005, the most recent year for which numbers are available. In terms of agriculture production, only the dairies are a larger industry in New Mexico than ranching. 
   "Ranching is a way of life in New Mexico. This resolution will allow us to pause and recognize the important role ranchers play in our state and in the entire West," Bingaman said. 
   The resolution encourages communities across the country to observe July 28, 2007 as the National Day of the American Cowboy, and mark the day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
