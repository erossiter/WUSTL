SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS TO BENEFIT FARMINGTON TRANSIT SERVICES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has released $316,800 to Red Apple Transit - the city's main bus service provider. Bingaman secured the funds in a fiscal year 2006 appropriations bill.  
   "Many people in the Farmington area depend on bus services to get to and from work. I am pleased the funding released today will help Red Apple Transit continue to provide local residents with access to reliable transportation," Bingaman said.
   Red Apple Transit will use the funding to purchase ten, twelve-passenger buses to replace its existing eight, which are old and unreliable.
