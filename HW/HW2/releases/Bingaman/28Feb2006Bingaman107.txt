'PACE' ACT GETS SECOND CONGRESSIONAL HEARING
  Legislation cosponsored by Sen. Jeff Bingaman to keep the nation competitive in the global marketplace today got its second Congressional hearing. 
   The Senate Health Education Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee today held a hearing on the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, legislation that focuses on improved math and science instruction, and greater emphasis on scientific research and development. The focus of the hearing was on the strengthening the math and science teaching skills of the teaching workforce.
   At Bingaman's invitation, N.M. Education Secretary Veronica Garcia testified about ways in which New Mexico is working to strengthen math and science instruction in the state. For instance, the state Legislature has set aside $1.7 million for Math and Science Summer Institutes for teacher professional development; and $1.2 million to expand Advanced Placement.
   "New Mexico is taking steps to ensure its teachers are highly qualified to teach math and science, and that is exactly what we need to be doing more of in our state and across the country," Bingaman said. "The PACE Act would provide the resources to help ensure that every New Mexico student has a highly qualified math and science teacher."
   The measure also links teachers and students to our nation's Department of Energy laboratories where they can be mentored by world-renowned scientists, mathematicians, and engineers. 
   Earlier in the month, the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee held a hearing about the energy provisions in the bill.
   The HELP Committee will host a second hearing Wednesday about the PACE Act.
