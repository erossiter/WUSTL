SEN. BINGAMAN: EXTENDED HOURS AT SANTA TERESA POINT OF ENTRY WILL BENEFIT LOCAL ECONOMY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today applauded the U.S. Customs and Border Protection's announcement that extended hours at the Santa Teresa Port of Entry will begin in September. 
   At the urging of Bingaman, CBP last year announced it would extend the commercial hours of operation at the port for one year under a pilot program. Beginning September 3, 2007 the Santa Teresa port will operate 14 hours a day, on Mondays through Fridays, up from ten hours per day. If the level of traffic increases during the year port hours may be permanently expanded. 
  "Increased hours at Santa Teresa will boost Southern New Mexico's economy and by reducing wait times in the region, will make the entire area more competitive," Bingaman said. "I believe that it is very important to make our state's ports conducive to trade and this is a step in the right direction."
   Bingaman helped negotiate the extension of commercial port hours with CBP Deputy Commissioner Deborah J. Spero in December 2006.
