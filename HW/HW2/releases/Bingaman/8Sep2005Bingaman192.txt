SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES TO BENEFIT FROM HUD GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that the two New Mexico organizations have been awarded a total of $2.03 million to help with a variety of projects that aim to improve conditions in their communities.  
 Funds were provided through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   The following groups were awarded:
   * Pueblo of Acoma Housing Authority $1.22 million
   * Isleta Pueblo Housing $802Authority,312
   "Affordable housing continues to be out of reach for many in our state," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that the funding awarded today will make a needed investment in helping families and individuals in Indian Country find a place to call home."
   Funds were awarded through HUD's Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) Indian Housing Block Grant Program. The pueblo can use the funds to implement a number of affordable housing activities. Those activities may include: operating assistance, housing services, and housing management for low-income housing; new construction, acquisition, modernization or rehabilitation of rental or owner-occupied housing; and crime prevention.
