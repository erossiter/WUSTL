SEN. BINGAMN PLEASED USPS IS ADDING THIRD SHIFT AT MAIL PROCESSING PLANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that the U.S. Postal Service has agreed to hire 15 employees to staff a third shift at the El Paso mail processing plant.  
   Last month, Bingaman and Rep. Silvestre Reyes wrote to Postmaster John Potter, asking for a reevaluation of the decision to move the Las Cruces processing operations to El Paso and called on the USPS to take the steps needed to improve delivery to the area. 
   They wrote: "We have received complaints regarding late delivery of mail, specifically of bulk items, many of which are time sensitive. The El Paso mail processing facility has been the focus of many mail delivery issues in the area and the United States Postal Service (USPS) has failed to address the problems sufficiently. 
   "We urge you to conduct a study and determine whether transferring the Las Cruces processing operations to El Paso was an appropriate action to take. If USPS determines that the move was necessary, then it is clear that more personnel must be hired to ensure the efficient and timely operation of the El Paso facility. While we commend USPS for its recent hires in the Albuquerque area to address delivery issues, these same steps have not been taken to address the delivery issues in the El Paso/Las Cruces area." 
   Today, Bingaman applauded the decision to hire additional staff. 
   "I'm very glad that the U.S. Postal Service is hiring additional employees at the mail processing center. We'll keep a close eye on the situation to ensure that Las Cruces residents see an improvement in service," Bingaman said.
