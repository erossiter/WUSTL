IN WAKE OF KATRINA, SEN. BINGAMAN URGES NO CUTS IN MEDICAID
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman is urging a key lawmaker to halt any effort to cut Medicaid, particularly in light of the fact that this key health initiative will be needed to help Americans affected by Hurricane Katrina. 
   In a letter sent late Tuesday, Bingaman joined Senators Gordon Smith (R-Ore.), Blanche Lincoln (D-Ark.), and Olympia Snowe (R-Me.) in asking Senate Finance Committee Chairman Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) not to take up legislation that calls for $10 billion in cuts to Medicaid - the federal-state financed health program for low-income Americans.
   Bingaman and Smith took the lead in working to prevent cuts in the fiscal year 2006 budget, but the White House has insisted in moving forward on making reductions. However, according to the bipartisan letter, moving ahead with Medicaid now would be a major mistake.
   "At a time when millions are displaced and seeking federal and state assistance, we believe it is inappropriate to move forward on the portion of the legislation package that would cut funding to Medicaid, food stamps, WIC, housing and education," the letter states.  
   Grassley chairs the committee that had been drafting a bill to be considered later this month that deeply cuts Medicaid.  
   Bingaman is also working with Senator Mary Landrieu (D-LA) in crafting legislation aimed at making it easier for evacuees to sign up for Medicaid, and which covers 100 percent of the costs associated with health care offered through Medicaid to evacuees, ensuring that states do not bear the burden.
