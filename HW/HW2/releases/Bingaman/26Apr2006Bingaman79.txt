SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS FUNDS FOR BELEN AIRPORT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced he is seeking funding to help make improvements to Belen's airport. Funds are requested through the fiscal year 2007 Transportation spending bill, one of the 12 bills Congress must pass this year to fund the federal government. 
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $4 million for the Alexander Municipal Airport. Funding would be used to construct a new cross wind runway, which is needed to accommodate additional aircraft at the airport.
   "Airports are one of the best economic tools that a community has to offer, but they are expensive to maintain. This funding would help the Alexander Municipal Airport make upgrades needed to stay competitive," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman secured $609,000 in FY2006 and $871,287 in FY2005 to acquire land and complete the deign of the runway, which was needed to begin the project.
