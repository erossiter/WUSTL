SEN. BINGAMAN RAISES CONCERNS ABOUT LACK OF CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said that a bill that extends some of the provisions of the Patriot Act unfortunately did not contain the important Constitutional protections he strongly supported.  
   Most of the Patriot Act, which was enacted in late 2001, did not expire and remains intact. But a handful of provisions - including one that allowed the federal government to view medical and library records of American citizens -had an expiration date that requires reauthorization. Bingaman said he did not support the final version of the bill that extended those provisions because the Constructional protections he strongly supported were deleted. 
   "I voted for the Patriot Act provisions that were approved by the Senate last year because they provided Constitutional protections that I believe Americans deserve. Unfortunately, those improvements were dropped from the final version of the bill. I strongly support giving law enforcement the tools they need to aggressively fight terrorism. I also believe there is a way to achieve that goal while protecting our Constitutional rights," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman said, for example, the bill does not require the federal government to demonstrate that medical and library records are relevant to the activities of a suspected terrorist.
   Bingaman said he will support measures aimed at modifying the Patriot Act in a manner consistent with the bipartisan bill that unanimously passed the Senate in July.
