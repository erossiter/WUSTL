SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT SILVER CITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that the Wellness Coalition in Silver City has been awarded a $180,000 grant by the federal government to help improve health care services in the area.  
   The Wellness Coalition will use the funding to help improve the delivery of quality health services through the development and use of distance technology and telehealth systems.
   "I am pleased the funding being awarded today will help improve access to health care services in Silver City," Bingaman said.
   The Wellness Coalition (TWC) is a network of health and social service providers in the four rural counties of southwestern New Mexico. The Coalition has spearheaded a number of collaborative programs, including a Healthy Community Access Program which established a shared database used for eligibility screening and enrollment in health coverage programs. TWC is the network entity and the applicant.
   The funding announced today was provided through the Department of Health and Human Services. Bingaman is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees that department.
