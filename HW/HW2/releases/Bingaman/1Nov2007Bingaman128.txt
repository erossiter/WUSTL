SEN. BINGAMAN: SCHIP BILL WOULD ALLOW NEW MEXICO TO PROVIDE HEALTH COVERAGE TO MORE CHILDREN
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today reported that Congress will send another bill that extends health care coverage to four million uninsured children - including thousands of young New Mexicans. But he is concerned that President Bush will veto the bill, just as he did the last version of the legislation.  
   The legislation would reauthorize the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) - a state/federal health care initiative crated in 1997 that covers millions of children and others who do not qualify for Medicaid but whose families cannot afford health insurance. 
   The bill sets aside $35 billion in new federal funding over the next five years to ensure that more than 10 million American children will either maintain health care coverage or receive it for the first time. 
   "Over the past few years, our nation's uninsured problem has gotten increasingly worse. We must take immediate action to provide health care coverage to young Americans," Bingaman said. "That's exactly what this bill does. I hope the president realizes how important this bill is to millions of young Americans and signs it into law."
