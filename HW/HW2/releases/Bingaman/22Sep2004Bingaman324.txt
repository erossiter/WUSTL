SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL GRANTS AWARDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AT SANTA TERESA, COLUMBUS PORTS OF ENTRY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he was pleased to announce that more than $2 million in federal funding has been awarded to make improvements at the Santa Teresa and Columbus ports of entry.  
   "With this funding we'll be able to make the investments needed to keep up with the volume of traffic at our ports of entry, so that we can perform the necessary safety inspections of commercial vehicle traveling through our state," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman, who wrote a letter of support for the applications made for these grants, said $1.88 million will be used to construct a commercial vehicle inspection facility at Santa Teresa for commercial vehicles entering the United States from Mexico. The new structure will replace the temporary facility, and would be moved closer to the border, adjacent to the bureau of Customs and Border Protection port of entry. In addition to this grant, the Department of Transportation has already provided $4.2 million over the last two years. 
   An additional $471,153 was awarded for the design or a new vehicle enforcement facility at Columbus for commercial vehicles entering from Mexico. The new facility would be fully automated, with weigh-in-motion scales, camera, variable message signs, and electronic data exchange with Border Patrol to expedite traffic.
