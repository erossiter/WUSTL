SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS GAO REPORT EXAMINING OIL, GAS ROYALTIES COLLECTED ON FEDERAL LANDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman is asking for a General Accounting Office (GAO) investigation into whether the federal government is collecting the correct amount of royalty revenue from oil and natural gas produced on publicly-owned lands.  
  According to a New York Times report today, despite extremely high gasoline and natural gas prices, the federal government's royalty intake has remained relatively stagnant over the past several years. After a three-month investigation, the Times concluded that if royalty payments were in step with market prices, the federal government would have collected $700 million more last year than it actually did. 
  "In this time of high oil and gas prices, I'm concerned by the alleged under-collection of royalties from public lands," Bingaman said. "This is an important, complicated issue, and we need to get the facts. That's why I'm asking GAO to look into these charges."
  Bingaman will seek GAO's review and analysis on the adequacy of the royalty accounting and collection process for oil and gas produced from federal and Tribal lands. He also will ask GAO to review and report as to why royalty collections are not increasing at a rate comparable to the rise in natural gas prices, and to review the adequacy of the Interior Department's audit capabilities.
