SEN. BINGAMAN GETS FIRST HAND-LOOK AT DO?A ANA COUNTY LEVEES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today took a closer look at International Boundary and Water Commission levees in Do?a Ana County that are in need of repair.  
   Bingaman met with IBWC Commissioner Carlos Marin and assured him that he is working to secure funding to make necessary improvements to the levees, so that they can qualify for Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) certification. 
   "In light of the devastation caused by Hurricane Katrina, it makes good sense to take a close look at the levees that protect communities across the country. We now know the IBWC levee system needs to be upgraded, and I am working to secure the federal funding needed to make those improvements," Bingaman said. 
   Some Rio Grande levees in Dona A?a County need to be raised in elevation to meet FEMA requirements. This will require approximately $20 million worth of work. To cover the costs, Bingaman is seeking funding in the emergency spending bill Congress is in the process of finalizing. But Bingaman is simultaneously working to secure funding in the fiscal year 2008 Foreign Operations bill that funds the IBWC. "The sooner we can get this project started, the better off Do?a Ana County residents will be," Bingaman said. 
   Later in the day, Bingaman toured New Mexico State University's Solar Research Facility and learned about its Solar America Initiative project. The facility recently won a competitive contract of over $4 million for 5 years of work on establishing codes and standards for solar energy to be more fully integrated into our nation's energy mix. 
   Bingaman is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
