SEN. BINGAMAN: PROVISION WOULD ENSURE TROOPS HEALTH PRIORITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today introduced legislation aimed at helping U.S. servicemen and women attain care and treatment for adverse affects associated with vaccines. 
   Bingaman's provision, offered to the 2005 Defense Authorization bill currently on the Senate floor, would authorize $10 million in funding for the country's four Vaccine Healthcare Centers Networks (VHC). The Bush Administration's 2005 budget allocated zero funding for the centers, an issue Bingaman found very troubling.
   "I am deeply disappointed the White House has proposed to cut funding for this program of important benefit to our nation's servicemen and women," Bingaman said. "We need to do better by the brave men and women who risk their lives to serve our country and convey to them that their heath is a high priority. This amendment will ensure they are not forgotten."
   The VHC Network plays an important role in increasing training and competency in understanding vaccine-associated problems, making proper diagnosis and offering treatment, and has played a fundamental role in developing and testing the Department of Defense's Smallpox Vaccine Program.
   Currently the VHC provides educational and clinical support services that are available to 2.4 million active duty and reserve service members and over six million family members for all immunizations - not just the anthrax vaccine. In 2003, the VHCs responded to over 160,000 contacts and provided case management for over 600 complicated vaccine-related cases from service members.
   The DOD's four VHC's facilities are located at Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington D.C., Naval Medical Center Portsmouth in Virginia, Womack Army Medical Center in North Carolina, and Wilford Hall Medical Center at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas.
