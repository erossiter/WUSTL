SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDS WILL HELP EDUCATE MORA KIDS ABOUT FIRE PREVENTION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Mora Fire Chief's Association has been awarded a $34,200 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   The association, which consists of the fire chiefs from Mora County's 11 fire districts, will use the funds to purchase a mobile trailer that will be used to teach kids about fire prevention and response. The trailer will resemble a common house and will be transported to schools. Kids will learn about kitchen fire hazards in the different parts of the house.
   "Teaching children how to prevent fires in the home and what to do in a fire emergency can help save their lives and those of others," Bingaman said. "I am pleased the funds awarded today will help educate Mora County kids about the importance of fire prevention and safety."
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
