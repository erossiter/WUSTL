SPENDING BILL CONTAINS FUNDS SEN. BINGAMAN REQUESTED FOR NEW MEXICO
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a spending bill that contains funding Sen. Jeff Bingaman requested for New Mexico projects.  
   The fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development contains $200,000 Bingaman secured for the construction of a Veterans War Memorial in Carlsbad. The memorial will be located at the Cascades riverfront development. 
   "This museum is a way for us to express our gratitude to those who have valiantly served our country," Bingaman said. 
   The bill also contains $300,000 Bingaman secured for the Socorro Boys and Girls Club. Funding will be used for the construction of a new facility to house the Socorro Boys and Girls Club. The area currently lacks a clean, safe, recreation area for local children. The existing facility is out dated, too small, and fails to meet the needs of the children. 
   "A community's local Boys and Girls Club provides children and young adults with a place to learn and grow. I am pleased funding has been included in this bill to construct a new facility that will benefit Socorro's youth," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also secured funding for the following projects: 
   * $250,000 - South Valley Regional Recreational Center in Do?a Ana County: Funding will be used to plan, design, and conduct site development for an 8,000 square foot regional community center serving the communities of Anthony, Berino, Monta?a Vista, Bosque, and Las Palmeras. 
   * $250,000 - T-VI Community College Division of Applied Technologies: Funding will be used to create a Southwest Center for Advanced Manufacturing and Mechatronics Education facility and to upgrade training infrastructure so TVI can continue to provide state-of-the-practice manufacturing workforce training for highly skilled technicians. 
   * $200,000 - Old Town Boys and Girls Club in Albuquerque: Funding will be used for the renovation of the existing Old Town Boys and Girls Club and for the construction of new areas for the Club. The facility serves over 3,000 youth each year engaged in various social, educational, and recreational activities. 
   * $200,000 - McKinley County Joint City-County Public Safety Building: Funding will be used to construct a new, joint-use public safety building in Gallup to house the Gallup Police Dept, municipal courts and McKinley County Sheriff Dept. The current building is seriously dilapidated and in need of replacement.
