SEN. BINGAMAN: SPENDING BILL CONTAINS $2 MILLION FOR AZTEC TRANSPORTATION PROJECT
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a spending bill that contains funding Sen. Jeff Bingaman secured for an Aztec transportation project.  
   The fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation contains $2 million Bingaman helped secure for a relief route to bypass the City of Aztec. Funding would be used for the construction of a two-lane paved road designed to provide an alternative route for large truck traffic. More than 9,000 vehicles, including heavy industrial traffic, travel through Aztec on a daily basis, creating safety hazards and significantly deteriorating its roads. 
   "This planned relief route would greatly benefit commercial traffic by saving them time and would also help keep traffic down in Aztec," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also secured the following: 
   * $1.5 million for Statewide Bus and Bus Facilities: Funding would be used for 45 buses and bus-related equipment and facilities to be used at the following: Angel Fire, Belen, Carlsbad, Clovis, Grant County, Hobbs, Pueblo of Laguna, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, NCI, Navajo Nation, Portales, Red River, Roswell, Taos, Zia Therapy, Zuni Zee Transit, Rio Arriba County, South Central COG, Grants/Milan/Cibola Transit, Care-A-Van, Sandoval County, and Tucumcari Housing Authority.
