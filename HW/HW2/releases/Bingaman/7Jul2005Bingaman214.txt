SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ABOUT TERRORIST ATTACKS IN LONDON
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement:
   "The world mourns the tragedy that occurred today in London. But just as the United States grew stronger after the attacks on our nation on 9/11, so too will the people of Great Britain overcome this reprehensible act of terrorism. 
  This event will only strengthen the resolve of countries across the globe to root out and defeat terrorism. We will not allow these extremists to prevail."
