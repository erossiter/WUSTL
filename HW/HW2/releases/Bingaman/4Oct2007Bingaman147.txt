REP. BINGAMAN: ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS APPROVES $4.5 MILLION FOR ALBUQUERQUE SOUTH VALLEY FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers will enter into a partnership cooperative agreement with the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD) for a flood control project in Albuquerque's South Valley.  
   Under the agreement, the U.S. Army Corp will provide $4.5 million to reconstruct three miles of substandard levee to protect Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD) irrigation facilities located along the Rio Grande, which serve the Albuquerque South Valley and Isleta Pueblo. 
   The Federal Emergency Management Agency is currently in the process of updating flood zone maps of the region. When the levee is constructed, FEMA will be able to certify that the area is safe from potential flooding. 
   "The reconstruction of this levee for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District will help prevent floods, protecting homes and residents," Bingaman said. 
   The estimated total project cost is $6 million.
