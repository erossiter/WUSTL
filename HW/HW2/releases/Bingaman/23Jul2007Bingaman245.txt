SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT ESPA?OLA'S POLICE DEPARTMENT
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the City of Espa?ola has been approved for a $125,000 low-interest loan and a $105,000 grant from the federal government.  
   Funding will help the city's police department replace ten vehicles, one of which will be fully equipped to process crime scenes. The city will also purchase computer equipment to enhance their record keeping ability. 
   "The grant and federal loan awarded today is an important investment in Espa?ola's police Department and in public safety," Bingaman said. 
   Funds were provided through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Program.
