SEN. BINGAMAN: KEY SPENDING BILL CONTAINS $2 MILLION TO BRING ELECTRICITY TO NAVAJO NATION, OTHER IMPORTANT PROJECTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman said he is pleased that a key spending bill working its way through the Senate contains funding he sought to continue bringing electricity to the Navajo Nation.
   The fiscal year 2008 Energy and Water spending, which cleared the Senate Appropriations Committee today, contains $2 million for the electrification of homes on the Navajo Nation. The funds would be made available through a program created by Bingaman-sponsored legislation which authorizes $75 million in grants to the Navajo Nation to expand traditional sources of power, and to implement renewable energy sources and other advanced electric power technologies. The initiative is expected to help bring electricity to the estimated 10,000 to 18,000 Navajo homes. 
   "I have seen first hand the important impact this program has made in the lives of Navajo families. I am glad this bill contains funding to keep this vital program going," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman was also pleased that the bill contains $500,000 for work associated with the Navajo-Gallup pipeline project. Bingaman is the author of legislation that would settle the Navajo Nation's water rights claims in the San Juan River Basin and would authorize federal funding for Navajo-Gallup pipeline project.
   "This funding is an important investment in the Navajo-Gallup water project," Bingaman said.
   Among the projects funded in the spending measure are:
   * $4.2 million for a flood control project in Alamogordo's Tularosa Basin:
   Funding would be used to construct two concrete and rip-rap lined diversion channels with 100-year flow capacity and a flood detention structure which will intercept flood flows from the Sacramento Mountains east of the City.
   * $1.5 million for the City of Albuquerque's wastewater treatment project: 
   The funding will be used to finalize the design and initiate construction of the city's Arsenic demonstration project, and to initiate construction of Southside Reuse project.
   * $500,000 for the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Supply (ENMRWS) pipeline project 
   In Clovis and Portales: Funding will be used to finalize planning and to initiate preliminary design work.
   * $500,000 to help the city's of Clovis and Portales meet water demands in the short-term while they seek to complete design and other requirements associated with the Eastern New Mexico Rural Water Project.
   * $500,000 for the Buckman Water Diversion project in Santa Fe County, which is needed to enable the City and County of Santa Fe to use their supply of San Juan-Chama project water to meet current and future water demands.
   * $200,000 for a watershed study in the City of Las Cruces: 
   The population in the East Mesa region of Las Cruces continues to grow at a rapid rate. As this growth occurs, the potential for flooding is increasing as the amount of water that can be absorbed into the soil is being reduced. Additionally, seven small dams, constructed prior to 1940 along the west side of the Organ Mountains, do not function as designed, are filled with silt, or are unsafe.
   * $100,000 for a flood control study in Socorro County:
   The project area encompasses several named and unnamed drainages tributary to the Rio Grande. Recent urban development in the area has been subjected to flood damages with increasing frequency and severity. 
   * $100,000 for a flood control study in Sandoval County:
   Recent urban development in the area has been subjected to flood damages with increasing frequency and severity. 
   The full Senate will take up the spending bill in the coming weeks.
