SEN. BINGAMAN APPLAUDS EXPANSION OF DO?A ANA COUNTY FOREIGN TRADE ZONE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the federal government has approved a plan that would expand the Foreign Trade Zone (FTZ) in Do?a Ana County.  
   Do?a Ana County's expanded FTZ incorporate an intermodal travel hub - a single location with various transportation options - south of its existing boundaries. An FTZ is an area created by the federal government to provide expedited customs procedures to U.S.-based manufactures engaged in international trade. Additionally, the approved expansion creates a new part of the FTZ directly along the U.S.-Mexico border, adjacent to the Santa Teresa Port of Entry. 
   "Santa Teresa is establishing itself as a fast-growing commercial center. The implementation of this FTZ expansion, along with the state-of-the-art border crossing, will help encourage more companies to use the Santa Teresa Port of Entry and will help boost southern New Mexico's economy," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman was instrumental in helping get the FTZ expansion plan approved and wrote to the U.S. Department of Commerce earlier this year urging them to approve the proposal.
