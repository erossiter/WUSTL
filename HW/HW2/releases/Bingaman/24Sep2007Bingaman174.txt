SEN. BINGAMAN: THREE NEW MEXICO COLLEGES RECEIVE FEDERAL BOOST
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that three New Mexico colleges will each receive more than $500,000 from a grant program he helped create.  
   Bingaman reported that Luna Community College (Las Vegas) will receive $574,445; Eastern New Mexico University-Roswell will receive $573,553; and Clovis Community College will receive $574,446. 
   All of funding comes from the U.S. Department of Education's Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSI) Program. Bingaman helped create the grant program, basing it on the Department of Education's long-standing "Historically Black Colleges" Program. Bingaman's HSI program gives grants to two-year and four-year colleges that serve a high population of Hispanic students. Many of New Mexico's schools qualify. 
   "This grant funding is a great investment in higher education in New Mexico," Bingaman said. "It will be put to good use helping prepare our state's workforce for good jobs." 
   Luna Community College will use its funding to revamp its distance learning system, allowing the college to deliver a complete general studies associated degree and high demand nursing courses. To enhance access to the school, the college will develop an Online Learning Lab as well as four small computer labs in outreach centers in communities surrounding Las Vegas. 
   ENMU-R will use its funding to improve student achievement levels in mathematics, science, and nursing. The goal is to decrease failure rates in math and science and double enrollment in the nursing program. 
   Clovis Community College will use its funding to strengthen its electronically delivered programs and services, investing in the on-campus math lab and in an online tutoring program, and improving teaching and learning through faculty development. 
   All three schools can expect to receive similarly sized grants in each of the next four years.
