SEN. BINGAMAN PRESENTS SANTA FE HUSBAND, WIFE TEAM WITH NATIONAL ART AWARD
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today helped recognize two New Mexicans for their skills, talent and contributions to the arts.    
   Bingaman presented Eliseo and Paula Rodriguez of Santa Fe with the National Endowment of the Art's (NEA) 2004 National Heritage Fellowship, the countries highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. The husband and wife team will share the fellowship's one-time award of $20,000.
   "Eliseo and Paula Rodriguez, masters of straw appliqu?, have revitalized this art, and have become master artisans. Their works have been recognized and honored around the world and in 1983, one of Eliseo's crosses was presented as a gift to King Juan Carlos I of Spain," Bingaman said. "Eliseo and Paula are not only recognized because of their great skill and talent, but because of their dedication to their art. We should all be thankful for their efforts to keep the art of straw appliqu? alive." 
   Straw appliqu?, sometimes called "the poor man's alternative to gilding", was developed in 16th century Europe and was taken to Mexico by Spanish colonists. Its popularity grew in New Mexico by the early 19th century, but began to die out in the 1900's. Currently there are more than 25 Hispanic straw appliqu? artists in New Mexico who work to keep this tradition alive by teaching others. 
   Twelve awardees were chosen for their artistic excellence, cultural authenticity and contributions to their field.
