SEN. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO PUEBLOS TO BENEFIT FROM HUD FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico pueblos will benefit from a total of $1.2 million in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Housing's Indian Community Development Block Grant (ICDBG) program, which helps meet the housing needs of low-income communities.  
   "This funding for Indian communities in the state will help meet the housing needs of many. I am pleased the federal government is making this investment in our state," Bingaman said. 
   Funds were awarded to the following pueblos: 
   Taos Pueblo Housing Authority $825,000 
  Pueblo of Jemez $375,689 
   The ICDBG program aims to help with the development of viable Native American communities, including decent housing, a suitable living environment, and economic opportunities.
