NEW MEXICO SENATORS URGE PASSAGE OF BILL TO MAKE CONSTRUCTION OF COMMERCIAL SPACEPORTS FINANCIALLY COMPETITIVE
  Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici today strongly backed a measure intended to make commercial spaceports more financially feasible by requiring the Internal Revenue Service to treat them as it does airports and seaports. Under current law, airports, seaports and rail are allowed to finance major infrastructure projects through tax-exempt bonds. The New Mexico lawmakers today joined Senator Mel Martinez in introducing the Spaceport Equality Act of 2007, legislation that would for the first time allow spaceports to qualify for tax-exempt bonds. "Other nations are emphasizing spaceport construction, and if we don't take action we will lose our ability to be competitive in this area," Bingaman said. "New Mexico is poised to become a leader in the future of space travel, and passing this legislation would greatly benefit our state." "I believe this bill would be useful for advancing Spaceport America. Our spaceport will involve massive infrastructure needs. Changing the tax code could stimulate more investment in space launch facilities, like Spaceport America, and lower the costs of financing these ambitious projects," Domenici said.  
   Over the past 40 years, about half of all major airport improvements projects were financed by tax-exempt bonds. Bingaman and Domenici believe extending tax-exempt bond status to spaceports would stimulate investment in space launch facilities in the United States. Other countries that have or will soon have commercial spaceports: Kazakhstan, Singapore, Australia and the United Arab Emirates.
