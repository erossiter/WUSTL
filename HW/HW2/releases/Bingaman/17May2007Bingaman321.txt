SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BENEFIT ALBUQUERQUE'S TRANSIT SYSTEM
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the federal government to invest in Albuquerque's bus service.  
   The City of Albuquerque is seeking a $13.4 million grant from the Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to purchase thirty 40-foot hybrid buses to replace buses that are more than 10 years old and at the end of their service life. 
   In a letter to FTA Administrator James Simpson, Bingaman expressed his strong support for the city's grant application. "The thirty new energy-efficient clean-fuel vehicles will run on low-sulfur diesel fuel supplemented by electric batteries in order to minimize pollution emissions. In addition to the direct environmental benefits, the new buses will help improve service in the region by reducing maintenance costs associated with older vehicles at the end of their useful life," Bingaman wrote. 
   The city's ABQ RIDE Transit System has a service area of 224 miles serving a population of approximately 600,000. There are currently 37 bus routes including local, circulator, commuter and express routes. Of the 144 buses in the fleet, 56 are outdated and not compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Combined with other ongoing bus procurements, the requested grant funds will bring 134 buses or 93 percent of the fleet within useful service life standards and all 144 vehicles will be ADA compliant.
