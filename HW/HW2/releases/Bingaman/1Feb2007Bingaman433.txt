SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS EFFORTS TO HELP DISABLED VETERANS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has joined Sen. Harry Reid (D-NV) and several other senators in introducing a bill which would overturn a century old prohibition on military retirees receiving both disability compensation and retirement pay.  
   Bingaman said the legislation would end the ban on so-called "concurrent receipt" immediately for all disabled veterans with 20 or more years of service. 
   "As we continue working to ensure that the brave men and women abroad receive the training, equipment, and medical care they need to accomplish their missions, we cannot neglect the compensation of disabled veterans and retirees. This rectifies an old injustice and is deserving of Congressional action," Bingaman said.
