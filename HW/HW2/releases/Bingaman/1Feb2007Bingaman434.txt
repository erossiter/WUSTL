SEN. BINGAMAN VOTES TO APPROVE MINIMUM WAGE INCREASE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the Senate is on record strongly supporting an increase in the minimum wage to $7.25 per hour.  
   "It's been years since Congress passed an increase in the minimum wage, and millions of American workers deserve a long overdue raise," Bingaman said. "I'm very glad that the new majority made increasing the minimum wage a top priority and that we were able to move it through the Senate so quickly." 
   The House of Representatives has already passed a minimum wage increase. A conference panel will now be appointed to work out the differences in the House- and Senate-passed bills.
