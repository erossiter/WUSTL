SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO SUPPORT RENEWABLE ENERGY
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that two New Mexico companies have been awarded federal funds through the U.S. Department of Agriculture to support renewable energy. 
   K&B Timberworks, Inc. in Reserve and Northridge Forest Products in Mora will each receive a $250,000 to help them develop innovative uses for woody biomass in national forests as a source of renewable energy.
   "With current higher energy costs we need to do more to invest in alternative forms of energy. I am pleased the federal government is making this important investment in New Mexico's renewable energy industry," Bingaman said.
   Woody biomass includes trees, woody plants, tree limbs, tops and needles that are byproducts of forest thinning and hazardous fuel reduction activities.
   Bingaman, the top Democrat on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, is a strong supporter of renewable energy production, such as biomass.
