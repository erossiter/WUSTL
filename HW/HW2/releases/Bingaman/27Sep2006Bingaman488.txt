SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDING WILL IMPROVE SAN ILDEFONSO PUEBLO'S DRINKING WATER
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Pueblo of San Ildefonso has been awarded $722,197 to help update the Pueblo's existing water system. The funding came from a special set aside Bingaman established for water and wastewater projects in Indian Country.  
   Funding will be used to construct a new water supply well and treatment system, a 140,000 gallon storage tank and for the installation of 10,000 feet of new 8 inch and 10 inch water lines. The water system improvements will provide additional storage for the Pueblo's future drinking water system. 
   "Access to clean, safe drinking water is key to maintaining a good quality of life and good health. I am pleased the federal government is making this investment in San Ildefonso Pueblo," Bingaman said. 
   Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development office.
