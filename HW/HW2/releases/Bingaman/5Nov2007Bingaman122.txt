SEN. BINGAMAN-SECURED FUNDS TO BENEFIT SANTA FE TRANSIT SYSTEM
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is releasing $500,000 in federal funds he secured to help Santa Fe Trails to replace several of its clean-fuel buses. Bingaman secured the funding in the 2005 highway bill.  
   "I'm very glad the federal government is making this investment in Santa Fe's public transportation system," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman also directed an additional $500,000 in the highway bill for Santa Fe Trails in FY 2008 for clean-fuel buses and $700,000 for FY2009. 
   Additionally, Bingaman is seeking $1 million in a fiscal year 2008 spending bill to help Santa Fe Trails construct new transit centers and purchase additional buses.
