SEN. BINGAMAN CELEBRATES GROUNDBREAKING OF ECLIPSE ASSEMBLY BUILDING
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined in celebrating the groundbreaking of the new primary assembly building for Eclipse Aviation. 
   Bingaman congratulated Eclipse Aviation for reaching this milestone, and for its plans to hire 550 employees in addition to the 500 already employed by the company. Bingaman noted that about 180 of the new employees will be housed at the assembly building.
   "Eclipse is doing a great job with its very-light jet airplane, the Eclipse 500. The plane performed some very impressive maneuvers out at the Double Eagle II airport a couple of weeks ago," Bingaman said. "Today's groundbreaking is yet another sign of the tremendous success of this company." 
   Two weeks ago, Bingaman participated in a groundbreaking ceremony at Double Eagle II Airport, which Eclipse relies upon heavily. Bingaman has helped secure $1.9 million in federal funding for the new control tower now under construction. He also secured $12 million for the upgrade of the Paseo de V?lcan interchange and access road. Additionally, though Bingaman's efforts, the Federal Aviation Administration provided $3.5 million last year and an additional $1 million this year for work to upgrade runways and taxiways at the airport.
