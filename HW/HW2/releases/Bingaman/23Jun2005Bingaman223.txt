AGRICULTURE SPENDING BILL CONTAINS FUNDS SEN. BINGAMAN SOUGHT FOR NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a spending bill being written in the Senate contains funding for several key New Mexico initiatives.  
   The Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the fiscal year 2006 Agriculture Appropriations Bill, which contains the $537,000 requested by Bingaman to restore and maintain riparian areas along the Rio Grande and Pecos River where the state is working to treat and kill the noxious salt cedar. 
   The funding would be used to restore native vegetation to riparian areas in order to stabilize soils; to maintain replanted areas; and for management to prevent invasive species from returning to treated areas. 
   "The work being done to treat and eradicate the noxious salt cedar growing along the banks of the Rio Grande and Pecos River is having a very positive impact on our state. I hope we can continue funding this important effort," Bingaman said.
   The bill also includes funding to a complete a flood protection project in Truth or Consequences. Four of five phases of the Truth or Consequences/Williamsburg Arroyos project have already been completed, at a cost of $11 million. Bingaman is seeking $2 million. 
   "This important flood control project has been under construction for five years. The funding I am seeking will bring the project to fruition," Bingaman said. 
   Currently, the spending bill contains the following:
   * $26 million to continue a Bingaman-created grant program that supports community development projects in Native American communities. Many Indian communities lack basic drinking water and wastewater facilities; tribal colleges are often housed in rundown, decrepit or even condemned buildings; and capital to start and expand job-creating small businesses is in short supply. This funding aims to help deal with those needs. 
   * $2.4 million for New Mexico State University's Agricultural Products Food Safety Lab: This funding would be used to continue operation of the Agricultural Products Food Safety Laboratory for the FDA's food safety program. The lab is developing and evaluating rapid-screening methods to detect contamination in food products and counterfeit pharmaceuticals. Bingaman secured $2.15 million to operate the lab in 2005. 
   * $992,000 for the Joe Skeen Institute for Rangeland Management: The institute conducts research on agricultural, range management, animal husbandry, education and extension programs. The institute is a joint effort of NMSU, Texas A&M and Montana State. 
   * $25 million for water and wastewater projects in colonias along the U.S.-Mexico border. New Mexico is expected to get about $7.9 million of this funding. 
   * $447,000 for Sandia Labs to continue work on an Internet-based system for early detection and reporting of outbreaks of infectious diseases in food animals. The system is known as the Rapid Syndrome Validation Program for Animals. Sandia is working Kansas State University on this project.
   * $850,000 for USDA to contract with the Albuquerque-based National Tribal Environmental Council to continue a Native American circuit rider program to provide technical assistance for rural water systems. 
   The bill can now be considered by the full Senate.
