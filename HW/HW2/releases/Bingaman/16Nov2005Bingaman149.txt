SEN. BINGAMAN SECURES $1 MILLION TO RECONSTRUCT ROAD LEADING TO ALAMOGORDO INDUSTRIAL PARK
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that a key spending bill contains $1 million he requested to improve LaVelle Road in Alamogordo, which leads from Highways 54 and 70 to the city's industrial park.  
   The funding is contained in the fiscal year 2006 Transportation, Treasury, & Related Agencies Appropriations Bill, which has been finalized. Congress is expected to approve the legislation in the coming days, and send it to the president for signature. 
   "The upgrade of LaVelle Road will encourage the further use of the industrial park, which will soon be home to an important new cookie plant. This is a great investment in Otero County - one that I hope will allow for further economic development in the area," Bingaman said. 
   Sunbaked Biscuits announced just last month that it would move into the facility formerly occupied by Presto Industries. Bingaman asked how he could help support the new jobs coming to Alamogordo, and learned about this $2 million project. The drafting of this year's Transportation Spending Bill was well underway when Bingaman made the request, and he was very pleased to have secured funding for LaVelle Road in this year's bill.
