SEN. BINGAMAN BACKS EFFORTS TO IMPROVE AIR SERVICE IN GRANT COUNTY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today threw his support behind Great Lakes Airlines' bid to continue providing air service from Silver City to Albuquerque.  
   Great Lakes Airlines is seeking to renew their contract with the U.S. Department of Transportation to continue providing air service in Grant County through the Essential Air Service Program. 
   In a letter to top DOT officials, Bingaman also urged the administration to provide additional funding to add air service from Silver City to Phoenix. 
   "Air service is an integral part of Grant County's social and economic health and remains vital to their current needs and future growth. Expanding air service to a large city, like Phoenix, would greatly benefit Silver City and Grant County," Bingaman said. 
   Congress established the Essential Air Service Program in 1978 to ensure that communities that had commercial air service before deregulation continue to receive scheduled service. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico has a total of 5 EAS communities: Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs and Silver City. 
   Great Lakes Airlines also services Clovis.
