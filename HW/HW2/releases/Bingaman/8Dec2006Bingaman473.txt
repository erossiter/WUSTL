SENATORS ANNOUNCE INCREASED PORT HOURS AT SANTA TERESA
  At the urging of Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) today agreed to temporarily expand hours of commercial operation at the Santa Teresa Port of Entry for one year. The Senators and Gov.  
 Bill Richardson had argued that current hours and staffing levels at Santa Teresa are not conducive to the flow of commercial traffic. Under the CBP plan, Santa Teresa would operate 14 hours a day for one year, up from ten hours per day. If the level of traffic increases during that year, it is likely that port hours would be permanently expanded. "We are a border state, yet Mexico ranks fifth among our state's top trading partners. That doesn't make sense. Expanding the number of hours at the Santa Teresa port will help alleviate long lines of trucks waiting to cross at El Paso and encourage businesses to use our port," Bingaman said. "I believe this move will be good for our state's economy." "We opened Santa Teresa almost a decade ago to foster trade and alleviate pressure on the El Paso-Ju?rez crossing. Santa Teresa has developed to a point where expanded hours make sense in terms of fostering greater economic growth in southern New Mexico and improving overall international traffic with our Mexican neighbors. I'm pleased CBP listened to our arguments and agreed to a one-year term to prove extended hours are workable and ideal," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. The start date for increased hours will be announced after negotiations with the Mexican government to coordinate an increase in hours at their companion port. Bingaman and Domenici each sponsored legislation to increase the port hours, but ultimately were able to negotiate the new hours with Deborah J. Spero, deputy commissioner at CBP.
