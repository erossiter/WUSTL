SEN. BINGAMAN HOSTS TRANSPORTATION BIOFUELS CONFERENCE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today hosted an Energy and Natural Resources Committee conference aimed at looking at the role home-grown, biologically derived fuels can play as part of the nation's transportation fuel mix. Bingaman is chairman of that committee.  
   The all-day Transportation Biofuels Conference welcomed comments and ideas from 33 panelists from around the country, including two from New Mexico. 
   Toby Bostwick, President of the New Mexico Sorghum Producers shared his knowledge and insight on the benefits of using sorghum as a renewable feedstock for ethanol production. Sorghum is an ideal crop for New Mexico due to its need for little water. 
   Dr. Terry Michalske with Sandia National Laboratories stressed the importance of investing in biofuel research and development. 
   "Home-grown fuel sources are our best hope of reversing the current trend of increased dependence on imported oil," Bingaman said. "Biofuel technology is being funded on a shoestring budget. Increased federal investment is needed if we are serious about making this a viable commercial option and I will press for additional funding." 
   Also a panelist at the conference was Chris Standlee, Executive Vice President of Abengoa Biotechnologies, which has an ethanol plant in Portales. The company has an operating cellulosic plant in Spain and is working to open one in the United States. Cellulosic technology makes it possible to make ethanol fuel out of corn byproduct.
