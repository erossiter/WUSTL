SEN. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO HEAD START PROGRAMS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that Head Start programs in Albuquerque and Silver City will share a total of $1.66 million in funding from the federal government. 
   "Head Start has made it possible for thousands of New Mexico's children to get the early education services needed to put them on a path to academic success. The grants awarded to Albuquerque and Silver City will help many New Mexico children get off to a good start," Bingaman said.
   * Home Education Livelihood Program in Albuquerque $1.057 million
   * El Grito, Inc. in Silver City $603,558
   Created in 1965, the Head Start Program helps low?income, pre?school children prepare for school by providing comprehensive development services for children ages 3 to 5. The program, which is funded through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, also provides social services for their families. The Senate Budget Resolution that passed earlier this year failed to provide any substantial increase in funding for Head Start. Under the Budget Resolution, nearly 20,000 children would be cut from the program and it would prevent head start agencies from making any quality improvements. Bingaman did not support the resolution and will work to ensure that New Mexico children receive this vital educational program. A senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, Bingaman has long been a strong supporter of Head Start programs across New Mexico.
