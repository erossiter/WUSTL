SEN. BINGAMAN URGES PRESIDENT TO KEEP NATIONAL GUARD IN SUPPORT ROLE ALONG N.M. BORDER
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today asked President Bush to keep National Guard personnel along the New Mexico border until an adequate number of Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents have been trained and assigned to the region. 
   The president deployed 6,000 Guard personnel to the U.S.-Mexico border in May 2006 to assist CBP with border security in a support role - to do such things as build barriers, monitor surveillance cameras, and maintain roads. Currently, about 700 Guardsmen and women are helping CBP along New Mexico's border. But under current plans, the number of Guard personnel assigned to the U.S.-Mexico border will be cut to 3,000 in September, reducing the Guard's presence in New Mexico to about 300. 
   In a letter to President Bush, Bingaman expressed concern about the planned reduction. 
   "As a result of the additional resources that have been deployed along the border, we have seen a significant reduction in the number of undocumented immigrants crossing the border through the El Paso Sector, which includes the entire state of New Mexico. However, I am concerned that if we prematurely reduce the number of Guard personnel it will be difficult to maintain recent achievements," Bingaman wrote. 
   Bingaman asked the president to consider keeping the Guard in the New Mexico border region for however long it takes to ensure there is an adequate number of CBP personnel assigned to the state. 
   "Although we are moving in the right direction, I do not believe that there are enough Border Patrol agents on the ground in New Mexico yet to justify a reduction of National Guard personnel by over 50 percent," Bingaman wrote.
