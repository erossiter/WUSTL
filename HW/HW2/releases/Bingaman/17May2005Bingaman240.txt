SEN. BINGAMAN: SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO TO BENEFIT FROM HIGHWAY BILL
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that a key transportation bill containing $1.77 billion for New Mexico's highways and $111 million for transit needs cleared the Senate today. The bill must now be reconciled with the House of Representatives version before it can be sent to the president for signature. 
   SAFETEA (Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act), the five-year highway bill that passed the Senate today, rewrites the expiring TEA-21 law that authorizes transit projects and sets aside funding for highways.
   "This long overdue bill contains funding that will help make needed improvements and upgrades to New Mexico's highways," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that we are now a step closer to completing this five-year bill and it is my hope that it will quickly make its way to the president's desk for signature." 
   The reauthorization bill will provide $1.77 billion over the next five-years to fund dozens of highway projects throughout the state, including many in southern New Mexico. In Do?a Ana County the state plans to use SAFETEA funding for the following projects: 
   * $6 million for four-lane reconstruction of 3.6 miles of McNutt Road near Airport Road in Sunland Park;
   * $4 million for four-lane reconstruction of N. Valley Dr (NM 185) in Las Cruces;
   * $3.5 million for the rehabilitation of the Avenida de Mesilla (NM 28) overpass on I-10 in Las Cruces;
   * $3.8 million to rehabilitate the NM 478 interchange at I-10 in Las Cruces;
   * $3 million to reconstruct .77 miles of US 70 in Las Cruces, north of Picacho Ave.
   * $3 million to complete the Sunland Park Drive extension from Rio Grande to NM 273, which would include a new bridge over the Rio Grande. Bingaman secured $4 million in fiscal year 2003 for phase I of the project, which extended the road from the Texas stateline to the Rio Grande;
   Below is a list of additional projects that the state also plans to finance through SAFTEA funding. They include the following:
   * $6 million to replace the Cuchillo Interchange North on I-25 in Sierra County;
   * $3.5 million to rehabilitate bridges on I25 in Socorro;
   * $1.4 million to improve 1.5 miles of NM195 through Elephant Butte;
   * $1 million for reconstruction of Bayard Street in Santa Clara;
   * $1 million to reconstruct Pearl Street in Deming, between 1st and Pine streets.
