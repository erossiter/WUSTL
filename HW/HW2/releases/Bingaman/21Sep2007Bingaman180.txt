SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS AWARDED TO HIDALGO MEDICAL CENTER
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman confirmed today that Hidalgo Medical Services (HMS) in Lordsburg has been awarded an $850,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS).  
   Bingaman said funding will benefit HMS's La Vida program, which works to reduce health disparities in diabetes treatment in Grant and Hidalgo counties through community outreach and family participation. 
   "Access to quality health care continues to be a challenge for many in our state. The funding awarded today will help HMS continue its work to expand health care access to those with diabetes," Bingaman said. 
   Specifically, the La Vida program provides: 
   * Intensive diabetes education classes for people with or who are at risk for diabetes; 
  * Supermarket tours that help participants learn how to read and understand food labels and strengthen their ability to choose healthy options; 
  * Tobacco cessation classes; 
  * Support groups to empower you to take control of many aspects related to your health care; and 
  * Physical fitness activities 
   Bingaman is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees HHS.
