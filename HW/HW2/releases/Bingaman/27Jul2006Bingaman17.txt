NEW MEXICO SCHOOLS AWARDED OVER $1 MILLION TO ENCOURAGE DISADVANTAGED YOUTHS TO PURSUE POSTSECONDARY EDUCATION
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman confirmed today that over $1 million dollars in funding has been awarded to several post-secondary education institutes in New Mexico.  
   The grants come from the U.S. Department of Education through the TRIO Talent Search Program. The goal of this program is to encourage disadvantaged youths to graduate from high school and enroll in a post-secondary school of their choice. Services provided under the Talent Search program include academic, career, and personal counseling, tutorial services, mentoring programs, exposure to college campuses, and career exploration. The program also targets drop-outs by encouraging them to return to school and pursue a higher education. 
   The funding will be dispersed as follows: 
   * Eastern New Mexico University/Portales - $381,014 
   * Eastern New Mexico University/Roswell - $295,721 
   * New Mexico Junior College - $250,261 
   * New Mexico State University - $220,000 
   * San Juan College - $220,000 
   * Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute - $380,364 
   "This funding is important because it will ensure that more New Mexico students from disadvantaged backgrounds have the resources they need to finish high school and pursue a higher education," Bingaman said. "This program will benefit our youth and I am pleased the federal government is continuing to funding it." 
   The president has proposed to eliminate funding for this program next year.
