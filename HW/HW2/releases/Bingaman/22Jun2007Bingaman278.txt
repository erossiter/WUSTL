SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED WITH SENATE PASSAGE OF NEW ENERGY BILL
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is very pleased with passage of a major new energy bill, but he will continue to work to push the nation' toward energy independence. Bingaman is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and helped write the legislation. 
  In a 65-27 vote, the Senate late Thursday night passed a bill that improves the fuel efficiency of American automobiles by 10 miles over the next decade - from 25 miles per gallon to 35 mpg. It also dramatically ramps up the use of homegrown biofuels, which will replace gasoline.  
  "The strong consensus of the American public is that our nation must move faster and go farther to secure its energy future," Bingaman said. "This bill responds to the deeply held view of most Americans that we can -- and should -- lead the world, when it comes to developing the new technologies that will produce clean, alternative energy and help address the threat of global warming"
  Bingaman said the Senate energy bill taps into America's limitless capacity for innovation so that America can become more energy self-sufficient. But he it could have been an even stronger bill if the Republican minority hadn't blocked consideration of two important pieces of legislation: a $30 billion package of incentives for the production of renewable energy and Bingaman's Renewable Electricity Standard, the requirement that utilities produce 15 percent of their energy through renewable resources. 
  "I am disappointed that we were blocked from adding these key clean energy provisions, which would have helped jumpstart our drive toward energy independence. But I will continue to work very hard to get these policies enacted," Bingaman said. 
   The Senate will negotiate with the House of Representatives on a final version of an energy bill. 
  A summary of the bill follows:
  DOMESTIC RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION
   The Senate energy bill:
   * Sets annual requirements for the amount of renewable fuels used in the U.S., escalating from 8.5 billion gallons in 2008 to 36 billion gallons in 2022, with environmental protections that are tougher and more effective than those we have today.
   * Requires new biofuels facilities to reduce lifecycle greenhouse gas emissions 20 percent compared to conventional gasoline. This is the first global warming regulatory provision ever to be passed by either House of Congress.
   Energy Efficiency Promotion throughout the Economy and in Government
  The Senate energy bill:
   * Requires a reduction in overall U.S. oil consumption of 2.5 million barrels per day by 2016, escalating to a savings of 10 million barrels per day by 2031.
   * By 2015, requires the federal fleet to reduce petroleum consumption 20 percent, federal buildings to improve their energy efficiency 30 percent, and the Federal government to get 15 percent of its electricity purchases from renewable energy.
   * Strengthens the Department of Energy's efficiency standards program, and enacts or expedites new standards for a range of household appliances, equipment and lighting.
   * The sum total effect of these enhanced efficiency provisions are:
   - Savings of over 50 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity per year (enough to power 4.8 million households).
   - Savings of over 17 trillion BTUs of natural gas per year (enough to heat a quarter-million homes).
   - Benefits to consumers of over $12 billion.
  CARBON CAPTURE AND SEQUESTRATION
   The Senate energy bill makes a strong start on turning the idea of capturing carbon dioxide and sequestering it into a reality by:
   * Expanding and improving DOE's existing research and development and demonstration program on carbon capture and storage. 
   * Directing the Secretary of Interior to complete a national assessment of geological storage capacity for carbon dioxide.
   * Authorizing a $100 million per year demonstration program on industrial-size carbon capture from a wide range of candidate facilities, including coal-to-liquid plants and other industrial gasification plants. This is crucial if we are to determine whether carbon capture and storage is a realistic option going forward.
