SEN. BINGAMAN VOTES FOR FARM BILL
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today reported that a comprehensive bill to support America's farmers and rural communities has passed the Senate. 
   The bill, called the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007, will have to be negotiated with the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the White House for signature.  
   "New Mexico is an important producer of peanuts, chile, pecans, cotton, corn, sorghum and other key commodities. This legislation will help ensure that family farmers can continue to do business in our state," Bingaman said. "It also focuses significant resources on soil and water conservation, biomass energy and to improving nutrition for young Americans." 
   Bingaman included provisions in the farm measure aimed at extending the life of the Ogallala Aquifer. The first one extends and increases funding for the Ground and Surface Water Conservation Program (GSWC) as it was originally created in the 2002 farm bill. Through the GSWC program, the Secretary of Agriculture provides cost-share payments, incentive payments, and loans to producers to carry out eligible water conservation activities. These include improving irrigation systems, converting to less water-intensive crops or dryland farming, improving water storage through banking and recharge, mitigating drought, and other measures. 
   The provision provides the eight states overlying the High Plains Aquifer (Ogallala Aquifer) at least $3 million annually in the GSWC Program. The eight states are Colorado, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma, New Mexico, South Dakota, Texas, and Wyoming. This will mean additional funding for New Mexico. 
   Another Ogallala provision identifies the Ogallala Aquifer as a priority area for a new program called the Regional Water Enhancement Program (RWEP). This program seeks to improve water conservation by working on larger-scale projects identified by local partnerships. These projects would complement and enhance on-farm conservation activities. The RWEP is within a larger section entitled "Partnerships and Cooperation" which is a $200 million annual section. 
   "Eastern New Mexico relies very heavily on the Ogallala Aquifer. We need to take these steps to continue to extend of life of this extremely valuable water source," Bingaman said. 
   The bill does the following: 
   Maintains a safety net for farm income protection for farm commodities grown in New Mexico and extends the diary price support and export assistance programs. Creates a new $5 billion fund to help farmers and ranchers deal with natural disasters, such as drought. 
   * Extends, albeit at a reduced level, a peanut storage program that expired last year that helps peanut producers market their peanuts. 
   * At Bingaman's urging, provides about $3 million per year to purchase fresh fruit and vegetables for New Mexico school children. Bingaman secured a $1 million earmark in 2006 to initiate a pilot fruit and vegetable program for 25 New Mexico schools. This bill makes the program permanent. The $3 million will provide fruits and vegetables to up to 60,000 students. 
   * Sets aside $5.4 billion in new spending for critical investments in low-income food assistance and child nutrition programs, including the renamed Food and Nutrition Program, farmers' markets, Community Food Projects, and The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP--extra $110 million per year for a total of $250 million/year) for food banks which are facing higher food prices and reduced food donations. Nutrition programs make up two-thirds of all the spending in the bill. 
   * Increases federal assistance to growers of New Mexico's $280 million/year fruits, vegetables and other specialty crops industry. About $2.5 million available to the New Mexico Department of Agriculture over four years to support the specialty crop industry, including New Mexico's chile industry. 
   * Contains $4 billion over five years for soil and water conservation such as CSP, EQIP and CRP. About $100 million in new funding over five years would be available in New Mexico to enroll up to three million acres in the Conservation Stewardship Program to promote agricultural production and environmental quality as compatible goals. Flexible funding would be available for a variety of conservation practices. 
   * Contains $135 million for pending applications for water and wastewater projects in rural areas. 
   * Strengthens mandatory country of origin labeling for meat and produce which will begin on October 1, 2008. 
   * Promotes increased use of broadband service in rural areas. 
   * Makes $50 million available for loans and loan guarantees for rehabilitating and improving hospitals with not more than 100 acute beds in rural areas. Priority shall be given to the acquisition of equipment related to health care improvements and interoperability. Priority will also be given to equipment purchased collectively among hospitals to lower costs. 
   The measure also contains $2.3 billion in federal support for farm-based energy programs, including assistance for conversion of crops such as sorghum to ethanol and manure to energy. It also includes $1.1 billion to encourage farmers to grow biomass crops, in financial aid to construct ethanol plants using cellulose, found in grasses and wood, as a feedstock, and to help refiners buy biofuel feedstocks. And it contains an additional $1.1 billion in tax credits for biofuels, including credits for cellulosic ethanol. 
   Bingaman was disappointed that the bill extends and increases the Milk Income Loss Contract (MILC) program, which New Mexico's dairy producers oppose. The subsidy has cost taxpayers $2.5 billion over the past five years and is projected to cost an additional $1.7 billion through 2012.
