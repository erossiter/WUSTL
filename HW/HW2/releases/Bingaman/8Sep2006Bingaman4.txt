SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDING TO BENEFIT NEW MEXICO CRIME LABS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the New Mexico will benefit from over $475,000 in grant funding from the U.S. Department of Justice.  
   Bingaman said the New Mexico Department of Public Safety has been awarded $430,467 to improve crime laboratories around the state that conduct DNA analysis. Improvements are aimed at helping prevent DNA backlogs and to help the criminal justice system use the full potential of DNA technology. 
   The New Mexico Department of Public Safety was also awarded a separate $45,000 grant, which will be used to analyze forensic back-logged DNA casework samples from rape and/or murder investigations. 
   "Eliminating backlogs at our state's crime laboratories is essential in ensuring our criminal justice system operates in a fair and swift manner. I'm pleased the federal government is making this investment in New Mexico," Bingaman said.
