SEN. BINGAMAN: BUSH BUDGET PROPOSES CUTS TO HEALTH CARE, EDUCATION, LAW ENFORCEMENT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is very concerned about President Bush's budget proposal, which calls for cuts in health care, education, law enforcement and other initiatives important to New Mexico. President Bush today unveiled his fiscal year 2008 budget proposal, which includes devastating cuts of $101 billion to health care programs. 
   Specifically, the Bush administration is proposing more than $75 billion in cuts to the Medicare program, which primarily provides health care to senior citizens and the disabled. In addition to cuts in benefits, Bush's Medicare proposal include significantly increasing premiums to seniors and others as well as significant decreases in payments to hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, hospice care, home health services, and several other critical health care services. The Bush administration also proposes nearly $26 billion in cuts over five years to the Medicaid program, which provides healthcare to low-income children, seniors, pregnant women and others. These cuts would include across-the-board restrictions on payments to safety-net providers that could result in New Mexico losing tens-of-millions of dollars in Medicaid funding annually. Similarly, the president proposes cuts in this year's federal spending for the State Childrens' Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) by $223 million, or 4 percent, and proposes funding levels that would result in thousands of children and others losing SCHIP coverage. SCHIP is a state/federal health care initiative serving low-income families that earn too much to qualify for Medicaid. The president's proposal also would restrict the ability of states to receive SCHIP funding for a large segment of children currently enrolled in the program, which could result in the loss to New Mexico of millions of dollars in federal SCHIP funding. The Bush administration also would eliminate the Community Services Block Grant, which had been funded at $630 million this year, as well as the Rural Community program. The proposal also includes deep cuts to the Social Services Block Grant. These cuts would result in the loss to New Mexico of millions of dollars of public health funding. "Nearly 50 million Americans lack health insurance, and that number continues to rise. Not only has the White House failed to propose a serious solution to this problem, it is urging deep cuts to the nation's most important health care initiatives," Bingaman said. "This is very disappointing, and it's my hope that Congress will turn back this terrible proposal." Bingaman also expressed concern that the Bush administration proposes to eliminate the already under-funded urban Indian health program, which provides critical funding to First Nations in Albuquerque as well as many other urban Indian health programs. One bright spot is the administration's proposal to provide federal support for state-based health insurance coverage initiatives. Bingaman is the lead sponsor of legislation in the Senate, the Health Partnership Act (S. 325), which would authorize such federal support to individual states, Indian tribal organizations, and others to expand health insurance coverage. Bingaman said he is disappointed with the president's FY08 budget for education, which proposes to cut Education Department discretionary funding by $1.5 billion. The education budget proposes small increases for some programs, but pays for them by eliminating funding for 44 programs, for a total of nearly $2.3 billion. Those programs include Bingaman's dropout prevention, smaller learning communities initiatives, and education technology grants. The budget proposes to underfund the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) by $14.8 billion, for a cumulative shortfall of $70.9 billion since enactment of the law. Under the President's budget, funding for NCLB and IDEA continues to fall short of the funding necessary for schools to meet the requirements of the law. It also cuts funding for career and technical education in half, and job training programs by $1 billion. These programs are critical if we are going to continue to prepare workers to meet the demands of the 21st century workforce. Job Corps is reduced by $55 million, or 3.5 percent. It also would cut Head Start by $100 million. "I continue to be disappointed by the White House's the lack of commitment to the No Child Left Behind Act and other key education initiatives," Bingaman said. "I hope that this year Congress can do a better job of making education a priority." Also of critical concern to Bingaman is the proposal of slash $1.25 billion in funding in local and state law enforcement assistance. 
   Specifically, the budget eliminates or drastically reduces funding for the following programs, among others: 
   * Justice Assistance Grants (JAG)--Supports state and local drug task forces, community crime prevention programs and prosecution initiatives. Reduced from $375 million in FY07 to $0 in FY08. New Mexico received $3 million in FY06 
   * Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program--Funds the hiring of police officers, crime-fighting technology, and other anti-crime initiatives. Reduced from $500 million in FY07 to $0 in FY08. New Mexico received $2.9 million in FY06. 
   * Office of Violence Against Women--Reduced from $415 million in FY07 to $370 in FY08. * Drug Courts--Funding eliminated. 
   * Prison Rape Prevention and Monitoring--Funding eliminated. 
   * Tribal Courts Initiative--Funding eliminated. Bingaman said he is also very concerned about the following: 
   * The administration's proposal to cut PILT by over $42 million in fiscal year 2008. This year, PILT is authorized at about $350 million, but funded at just $232 million. The administration proposes to cut PILT funding for FY 2008 to $190 million. 
   * The administration proposes to cut Community Development Block Grant funding, resulting in a reduction of millions of dollars to the state. 
   * The State Homeland Security Grant Program, which awarded $52 million to New Mexico from 2003 through 2006 was cut to $187 million nationally. New Mexico's FY08 Homeland Security Grant is projected to be $3.414 million, down from the projected $9 million New Mexico is expected to receive this year.
