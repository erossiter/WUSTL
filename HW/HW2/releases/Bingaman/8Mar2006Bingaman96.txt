SEN. BINGAMAN: EASTERN NEW MEXICO FARMERS ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER AID
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that four eastern New Mexico counties have been declared eligible for federal disaster assistance as a result of continuing drought in the area. 
   Farmers and ranchers in the counties of Quay, Curry, Roosevelt and Lea are now eligible to be considered for low interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture.
   "I am pleased the USDA is lending a helping hand to the farmers and ranchers of Eastern New Mexico who have been economically harmed due to the ongoing drought in the area," Bingaman said.
   For more information or to determine eligibility for a low interest loan contact the local USDA Farm Service Center.
