  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation is releasing $371,779 he helped secure to allow the City of Albuquerque to help complete the West Side Transit Facility. 
   "This funding will help the city protect their buses and other transportation vehicles from harsh weather conditions, which will help expand their longevity," Bingaman said. 
   Specifically, funding will be used for the construction of canopies and related paving, drainage and electrical work to protect transit vehicles from outdoor elements.
