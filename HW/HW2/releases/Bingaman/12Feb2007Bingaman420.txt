SEN. BINGAMAN: LAND TRANSFER 171 ACRES OF BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT LAND TO RIO ARRIBA COUNTY IS FINALIZED
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that 171 acres of land has been officially transferred to Rio Arriba County from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Bingaman is the author of legislation that required the transfer.  
   The "Rio Arriba County Land Conveyance Act", which Bingaman wrote and U.S. Senator Pete Domenici cosponsored, conveys a parcel of BLM land to Rio Arriba County to be used at a site for a new public school and for use as a public cemetery to be managed by St. John the Baptist Catholic Church. 
   "This land will be put to good use by the community. I'm glad the BLM was able to work so quickly with the county to finalize the land transfer, allowing community leaders to implement their plans for the property," Bingaman, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee that last year considered this legislation. 
   "I am pleased to the see the BLM move quickly to finalize this transfer so that the local community can move forward with its plans for this land," Domenici said.
