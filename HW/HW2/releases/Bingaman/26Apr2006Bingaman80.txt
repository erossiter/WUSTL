SEN. BINGAMAN OUTLINES KEY TRANSPORTATION SPENDING PRIORITIES FOR SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO/ ROSWELL
  As Congress prepares to begin the process of writing the 12 appropriation bills that fund government agencies, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today outlined his fiscal year 2007 transportation spending priorities for the Albuquerque area. 
   In a letter to top Senate appropriators, Bingaman requested $5 million for the widening and reconstruction of I-10 from Las Cruces to the New Mexico/Texas state line. The project will increase this section of the interstate from a 4-lane to a 6-lane facility. 
   "Well maintained roads and highways are key in helping New Mexico stay economically competitive. This funding would help expand and upgrade this section of I-10 to help relieve traffic congestion between Las Cruces and El Paso," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is also seeking $1.4 million for an alternate truck route in Luna County. The project would provide an alternate route to NM 11 through the City of Deming in Luna County to help improve significant congestion. The total length of the proposed bypass is 18 miles including a proposed interchange. 
   "Increase trade with Mexico through the Columbus - Palomas port of entry is having a significant impact on traffic congestion on NM 11. An alternative truck route would save commercial vehicles time and would cut down on traffic trough Deming," Bingaman said. 
   For Roswell Bingaman is seeking $400,000 to help replace five 21-passenger public transit buses and one 15-passenger transit van. The existing vehicles are all more than 14 years old. The cost to maintain these vehicles has risen to an unacceptable level. The cost of a bus is about $70,000 and the para-transit van about $50,000.
   "Many of Roswell's residents depend on bus services to get to and from work. This funding would help ensure reliable transportation is made available to those who need it," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is also seeking funding for the following transportation projects:
   * $1.52 million for Bus and Bus Facilities in Grant County:
  Corre Caminos, the county's bus service provider, would use the funding to plan and construct a multi-modal terminal facility. The new facility will house administrative and operational staff and a secured facility to perform repairs and house vehicles. Corre Caminos is operating in its fifth year and also provides some services to Hidalgo and Luna Counties.

   * $1 million for the New Mexico State University Bridge Research Center:
  New Mexico State University houses the Bridge Research Center for non-destructive structural evaluation technology. The center will benefit the nation by extending the life of bridge systems and reducing the deterioration of critical infrastructure, improving public safety, and saving money. Bingaman secured $200,000 in FY2006 for the center, $125,000 in 2005, $500,000 in 2004, $250,000 in 2003 and $600,000 in 2001.
   * $600,000 for Bus and Bus Facilities for RoadRunner Transit in Las Cruces: 
  The City of Las Cruces RoadRunner Transit System would use funding to build and a new intermodal transit center. A 1.8-acre site has been selected at the corner of Alameda Blvd and Lohman Ave. The facility will link local transit service, buses, taxis, bicycles, pedestrians, and airport shuttles. The total cost of the project is about $3 million. Bingaman secured $2 million in fiscal year 2002 to acquire land to design the center and $1 million in 2006 to purchase buses.
