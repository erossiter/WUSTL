SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE FOR MINORITIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman has joined in introducing a bill that would improve access to health care for millions of Americans. 
  The Minority Health and Health Disparities Act of 2007 addresses health inequalities in minority communities through education and training, improves healthcare quality and access, and strengthens research, data collection, and leadership and collaboration efforts. 
  "Access to quality health care continues to be a challenge for many Americans, particularly for ethnic minorities. This bill would help confront many of the disparities that exist in today's health care system," Bingaman said.
  The bill includes a provision written by Bingaman that would provide grants to the state, local, and tribal organizations, including community health centers and public health departments that target minorities. Funding would be used to hire community health workers - or promotoras - to provide health education, outreach, and referrals to those who otherwise would have little or no contact with health care services.
  Bingaman said that the bill also will establish a grant program to fund Centers of Excellence, which will be used to train Hispanic and Native American students in health professions.
  Among the issues the bill addresses are the following:
  * Improving cultural competency among health care providers through education and training;
   * Establishes grants for scholarships to minorities who make a mid-career change to a health profession
   * Establishes grants to communities for projects to promote positive health behaviors, and to improve outreach, participation, and enrollment in available healthcare programs'
   * Establishes demonstration grants to improve access to healthcare, patient navigators, and health literacy education services;
   * Establishes Health Action Zones to support State, tribal or local initiatives to improve minority health;
   * Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to increase and apply knowledge about genetic variation within and between minority populations and examine the benefits and availability of genetic screening, diagnostics, and treatment
   The bill was referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which Bingaman is a senior member of.
