SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDING TO AID NEW MEXICO BORDER-AREA LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the State of New Mexico will receive $1.58 million to assist border-area law enforcement.  
   Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Operation Stonegarden Grant Program and will be used to assist local law enforcement cover costs associated with addressing border related crime. 
   "Law enforcement agencies in southern New Mexico too often see their resources stretched thin as a result of having to deal with border-related crime. This funding will help them cover many of the additional costs," Bingaman said. 
   Operation Stonegarden gives states the flexibility to use DHS funds to help law enforcement agencies cover overtime pay and to purchase additional equipment, among other things. 
   Bingaman is the author of legislation that would provide up to $50 million in grant funding to border law enforcement agencies within 100 miles of the northern and southern international borders to hire additional personnel, purchase equipment, and/or to cover overtime and transportation costs. Bingaman's bill cleared the Senate as part of a larger bill but was not included in the final version that was signed into law.
