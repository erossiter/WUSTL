SEN. BINGAMAN BACKS APPLICATIONS FOR TRIBAL TRANSIT GRANTS
Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the federal government to strongly consider five applications submitted by New Mexico's North Central Regional Transit District (NCRTD) for grant funding made available through a grant program he wrote. 
 Bingaman is the author of a tribal transit program that works to help ensure communities in Indian Country have access to reliable public transit. The program was made part of the SAFETEA-LU (Safe, Accountable, Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act - Legacy User) highway bill that was singed into law last year.
 In a letter to the Federal Transit Administration, Bingaman expressed the importance of public transit services for Indian Country.
 "This tribal transit program help ensure Indian communities have access to public transportation, especially to help young people or seniors to get to work, to school or to the doctor. Transit is also vital to a community's economic growth and development.
 "The five pueblos are requesting federal transit funding to begin new transit service to near-by cities, including Espa?ola and Sante Fe. The funds will be used to support system administration and marketing, operations, and to purchase 12 wheelchair-equipped small buses, signs, benches, and shelters," Bingaman said. The applications were submitted on behalf of the Pueblos of San Ildefonso Pojoaque, Tesuque, Ohkay Owingey, and Santa Clara. The northern New Mexico pueblos are seeking a total of $1.025 million in federal funding and would provide total matching funds of $50,000.
 San Ildefonso Pueblo: $179,900 Pojoaque Pueblo: $199,900 Tesuque Pueblo: $204,450 Okay Owingeh Pueblo: $262,400 Santa Clara: $199,900.
