SEN. BINGAMAN: DEFENSE BILL WILL PROVIDE BETTER HEALTH CARE TO RETURNING TROOPS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today reported that the Senate has given final passage to legislation steps up the quality of health care offered to troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill can now be sent to the White House for signature.  
   The bill requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to develop a comprehensive policy on the care, management, and transition from the military to VA or civilian life of severely injured service members. 
   "Troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan do not always get the level of care they deserve," Bingaman said. "This bill will address that very serious problem." 
   The amendment was made part of the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Bill, which was approved in the Senate by a 90-3 vote. A summary of the bill follows: 
   * Creates the Wounded Warrior Resource Center to serve as a single point of contact for service members, their families and primary caregivers to report issues with facilities, obtain health care and receive benefits information; 
   * Requires a comprehensive policy to address traumatic brain injury (TBI), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), other mental health conditions and military eye injuries, as well as the creation of centers of excellence focused on these conditions; 
   * Mandates that the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs must establish a standard for rating service members' disabilities that takes into consideration all medical conditions; 
   * Requires semi-annual inspections of housing facilities for recovering service members; 
   * Requires the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly develop a comprehensive policy on the care and management of members of the armed forces, including the development of fully interoperable electronic health records; 
   * Mandates the establishment of new DoD-wide standards for processing medical evaluations and training and qualifying those performing the evaluations. This includes assigning independent medical advisors to assist recovering service members and families; 
   * Mandates the establishment of new DoD-wide standards for processing disability evaluations to reduce discrepancies between the Department of Defense assessments and those conducted by the Department of Veterans Affairs and to ensure consistent decisions among the military departments; 
   * Establishes a board to review the cases of service members separated without retirement benefits with a disability rating of 20 percent or less to ensure that such ratings are fair and accurate; 
   * Requires that a comprehensive description of entitlements be developed for service members upon their separation or retirement as a result of serious injury or illness;
