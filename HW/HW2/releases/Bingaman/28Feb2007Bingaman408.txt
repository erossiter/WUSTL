SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO STUDENTS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL ADVANCED PLACEMENT GRANT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that the New Mexico Public Education Department has been awarded $56,653 in federal funds to help students pay for Advanced Placement (AP) tests.  
   The funds, awarded through the U.S. Department Advance Placement Test Fee Program, will make it possible for the state to help low-income students pay for all or portions of the fees for AP or International Baccalaureate (IB) tests. The $56,653 will make it possible to help pay for 3,939 AP tests in the state. Bingaman is the author of legislation that created the AP Test Fee program. 
   "The Advanced Placement program plays an important role in helping students fulfill their dreams of going to college. Unfortunately, test fees can be a major barrier for student. These funds are vital in helping all students have the opportunity to benefit from the AP program," Bingaman said. 
   The AP program, administered by the College Board, is an internationally recognized set of approximately 30 rigorous courses in subjects ranging from history to chemistry. The classes are taught to high-school students at their schools by specially trained teachers. Students can obtain college credit for an AP course by passing a standardized exam. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the AP program and has been at the forefront of efforts to expand the program to more disadvantaged students - by helping states lower exam fees and train more teachers - and fought to make sure that the AP program was an essential component of No Child Left Behind.
