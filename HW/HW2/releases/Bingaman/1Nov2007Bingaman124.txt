SEN. BINGAMAN: EPA FUNDS TO BENEFIT TWO NEW MEXICO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has awarded a total of $771,000 to the Albuquerque Department of Health and Human Services for wastewater infrastructure improvements to two tribally owned systems.  
   The Pueblo of Cochiti will receive $475,000 for video inspection of the sewer main, sewer line replacement and lagoon lining replacement. The Jicarilla Apache Nation will receive $296,000 for cleaning of the entire sewer system and to conduct a video inspection survey for evaluation of rehabilitation alternatives. 
   "This funding is a good investment in these two New Mexico communities and I am pleased the federal government is making it available," Bingaman said.
