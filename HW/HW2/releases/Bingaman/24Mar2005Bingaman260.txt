SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO COLLEGES, UNIVERSITIES RECEIVE FEDERAL GRANTS TO SUPPORT LOW-INCOME STUDENTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that 13 New Mexico colleges and universities have been awarded federal funds to support low-income students. 
   The funds, which come through the U.S. Department of Education's Trio Program, will be used to provide support services to increase the retention and graduation rates of low-income and first generation college students. In addition to providing support services, grantees may use up to 20 percent of the total federal grant funds for grant-aid to eligible students.
   "Trio grants provide essential funding that helps give low-income students the support they need to stay in college and complete their degrees," Bingaman said. "I am very pleased that New Mexico colleges and universities are receiving this critical grant funding. It's unfortunate that the White House wants to eliminate this funding for our schools. I will be working hard to prevent that from happening."
