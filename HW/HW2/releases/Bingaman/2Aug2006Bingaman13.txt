SEN. BINGAMAN: CURRY COUNTY LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO BENEFIT FROM CRIME PREVENTION FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the City of Clovis has been awarded $15,579 to support efforts aimed at reducing and preventing crime.  
   Funding will be used to purchase three digital in-car video systems and will also cover installation costs. Digital in-car cameras have proven to be beneficial to the Clovis Police Department and the Curry County Sheriff's Office. 
   "In-car video cameras have proven to be valuable in documenting evidence that can be used in court. I am pleased the funding awarded today will make it possible for Clovis's and Curry law enforcement to purchase additional cameras," Bingaman said. 
   Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Justice's Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG), which provides grants to states, tribes, and local governments to help implement crime prevention and crime control policies in their communities.
