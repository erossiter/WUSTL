SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO AWARDED OVER $1 MILLION TO COVER COST OF INCARCERATING CRIMINAL UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that seventeen counties and the state of New Mexico have been awarded $1.086 million to help pay the cost of incarcerating criminal undocumented immigrants. 
   "Costs associated with illegal immigration should not have to be covered by border states. This funding reimburses New Mexico communities, ensuring that the federal government is taking responsibility - as it should - for immigration issues," Bingaman said.
   The funds were awarded to the following:
   * State of New Mexico $650,877
  * City of Albuquerque $225,367
  * County of Chaves $ 11,259
  * County of Colfax $ 1,009
  * County of Eddy $ 7,542
  * County of Lea $ 31,502
  * County of Otero $ 19,252
  * County of Rio Arriba $ 15,520
  * County of Santa Fe $15,897
  * County of Taos $ 1,634
  * County of Valencia $ 5,618
  * Dona Ana County $85,519
  * Luna County $ 4,914
  * Quay County $ 1,310
  * Roosevelt County $ 4,730
  * Sierra County $ 4,238
   The funds awarded today were provided through the U.S. Department of Justice's State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP). Created in 1994 as part of the Crime Act, SCAAP reimburses states and localities for the cost of incarcerating criminal undocumented immigrants being held on felony or two misdemeanor charges under local or state law.
   Although funding for SCAAP has never been sufficient to cover all the costs incurred by county jails and state prisons, the Bush administration has consistently called for the complete elimination of the program. Bingaman has strongly opposed cuts to SCAAP and has urged it be fully funded. The fiscal year 2006 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Bill contains $405 million for the SCAAP program.
