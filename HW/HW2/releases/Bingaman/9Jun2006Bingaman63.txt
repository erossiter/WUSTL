SEN. BINGAMAN REACTS TO DISCLOSURE THAT A HACKER BREACHED NNSA COMPUTER
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today released the following statement regarding the fact that personal information of 1,500 contract workers was hacked from a National Nuclear Security Agency computer: 
  "It's hard to imagine a worse way to have handled this situation. Not only was the personal information of 1,500 employees compromised, there was a total breakdown of DOE's own oversight policies and procedures for how to handle this type of security breach. 
  "Making matters even worse is the fact that in the many months since the breach took place, the employees were never informed that a third party had their Social Security numbers, clearance information and other private data. These employees have every right to be outraged.
   "This deplorable incident makes it clear that we need to take a very close look at DOE's cyber security program, as well as the department's security oversight, and fix it."
