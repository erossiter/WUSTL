SEN. BINGAMAN: CARLSBAD FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Carlsbad Fire Department has been awarded a $229,765 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   Funding can be used to implement operational and safety programs at fire departments and nonaffiliated EMS (Emergency Medical Services) organizations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, and health and safety modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   "It's important to ensure that New Mexico's fire departments are in top shape so that they are always prepared to handle any emergency situation that should arise," Bingaman said. "This grant will provide a big boost to the Carlsbad Fire Department." 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters programs, which provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments.
