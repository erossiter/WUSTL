SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS PRESIDENT FOR SIGNING OF ENERGY BILL
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman joined President Bush today for the signing of a major energy bill into law.  
   Bingaman, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, helped write the bill. He issued the following statement: 
   "This new law dramatically increases the efficiency of vehicles, home appliances and lighting, while helping reduce our dependence on fossil fuel. It's very good for American consumers and the environment. 
   "But it could have been even better. I would like to have seen us create a greater demand for renewable energy, and to have extended tax credits to help make the production of renewable energy more affordable. I will be working hard in the next session of Congress to get those provisions enacted."
