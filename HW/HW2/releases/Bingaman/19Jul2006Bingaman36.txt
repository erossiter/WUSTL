SEN. BINGAMAN: KEY SPENDING BILL CONTAINS MILLIONS FOR NEW MEXICO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that a key subcommittee has approved a spending bill that contains millions of dollars in funding he requested for New Mexico transportation projects.
   A Senate Appropriations Subcommittee has approved the fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation. The bill contains $1.5 million Bingaman helped secure for the widening and reconstruction of I-10 from Las Cruces to the New Mexico/Texas state line. The project will increase this section of the interstate from a 4-lane to a 6-lane facility. Last year, Bingaman secured $7 million to reconstruct the I-25/I-10 interchange. 
   "Transportation infrastructure is important to a community's economic development. I am pleased this bill contains funding to improve this section of I-10 and I will work to ensure it is included in the final version," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman also said he was pleased the bill contained $400,000 he requested to help the City of Roswell replace five 21-passenger public transit buses and one 15-passenger transit van. The existing vehicles are all more than 14 years old. The cost to maintain these vehicles has risen to an unacceptable level. The cost of a bus is about $70,000 and the para-transit van about $50,000.
   "Public transportation is an affordable and convenient alternative to today's high gas prices. I am pleased this bill makes an investment in Roswell's transit system," Bingaman said.
   The bill also includes $1.5 million Bingaman requested for a bus facility in Grant County. Corre Caminos, the county's bus service provider, would use the funding to plan and construct a multi-modal terminal facility. The new facility will house administrative and operational staff and a secured facility to perform repairs and house vehicles. Corre Caminos is operating in its fifth year and also provides some services to Hidalgo and Luna Counties.
   Bingaman secured funding for the following projects:
   * $4.79 million for Albuquerque Bus and Bus Facilities: Authorizes the Albuquerque transit system to use the existing funding to acquire 6 articulated buses and for the construction of a Westside park and ride lot for the Coors Blvd. North-South Rapid Ride.
   * $1.5 million for Statewide Bus and Bus Facilities: Funding would be used for 45 buses and bus-related equipment and facilities to be used at the following: Angel Fire, Belen, Carlsbad, Clovis, Grant County, Hobbs, Pueblo of Laguna, Las Vegas, Los Alamos, NCI, Navajo Nation, Portales, Red River, Roswell, Taos, Zia Therapy, Zuni Zee Transit, Rio Arriba County, South Central COG, Grants/Milan/Cibola Transit, Care-A-Van, Sandoval County, and Tucumcari Housing Authority.
   * $1 million RailRunner Commuter Rail: Funding will help extend service from Bernalillo to Santa Fe. Bingaman helped secured $500,000 for the project in fiscal year 2006.
   The bill also includes funding for operations and equipment for the following public transit companies:
   * $6 million - Albuquerque Ride
   * $1.1 million - Las Cruces Roadrunner
   * $893,000 - Santa Fe Trails
   * $514,000 - Farmington Red Apple
   * $7.1 million - Statewide transit grants for rural areas
   * $941,000 million - State wide transit grants for elderly and disabled
   $117 million - Essential Air Service (EAS) Program: EAS makes it possible for commercial airlines to provide affordable and reliable service to smaller communities. Without EAS, many rural communities would have no commercial air service at all. New Mexico's 5 EAS communities will benefit from the following:
   * Alamogordo - $717,000
   * Carlsbad - $599,000
   * Clovis - $1.3 million
   * Hobbs - $520,000
   * Silver City - $1.4 million
   Also, for the fourth year in a row the subcommittee included language Bingaman wrote that would ensure communities are not required to pay to maintain their commercial air service.
