SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN
 Sen. Jeff Bingaman will be attending a service for former President Ronald Reagan in the Capitol Rotunda later today.  
 Bingaman, who was elected to the Senate during Reagan's first term in the White House, released the following statement:
   "One of Ronald Reagan's great strengths was that he embodied the essential optimism that makes America great. He approached the presidency and all that he did with confidence that everything would work out, and he had great faith in the people he worked with - both in his cabinet and in Congress. I disagreed with many of his policies, but I always admired his ability to rally the country behind a positive vision.
   "These past few years were no doubt very difficult for the entire Reagan family, but for Nancy Reagan in particular. She is as devoted to finding a cure for Alzheimer's disease as she has been to the care of her husband. Her dedication is something we can all admire."
