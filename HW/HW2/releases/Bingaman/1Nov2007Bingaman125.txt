SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO FARMERS TO BENEFIT FROM USDA FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the University of New Mexico (UNM) has been awarded a $300,000 grant to help disadvantaged farmers and ranchers in the state. Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Cooperative State Research, Education and Extension Services (CSREES).  
   The grant will help UNM conduct outreach and technical assistance to encourage and assist socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers to own and operate farms and ranches. The grant will also help deliver a wide range of support services including: farmer management, and financial management and marketing to New Mexico farmers and ranchers. 
   "The funding awarded today will help strengthen New Mexico's family-owned farms and ranches," Bingaman said. "I'm glad the federal government is making this investment in our state's agriculture industry."
