BILL TO NAME SANTA FE COURTHOUSE IN HONOR OF JUDGE SANTIAGO CAMPOS GOES TO PRESIDENT
  The U.S. Senate today gave final passage to legislation introduced by Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici that names the United States Courthouse in Santa Fe the "Honorable Santiago E. Campos United States Courthouse."  
   The House of Representative earlier this week approved the bill, which was introduced in that chamber by Rep. Tom Udall. With Senate passage, the measure will now be sent to the president for signature. 
   Santiago Campos was appointed to the Federal Bench in 1978 by President Jimmy Carter, was the first Hispanic federal judge to serve in New Mexico. 
   "Santiago Campos was a highly distinguished New Mexico lawyer and judge. I'm glad that we can honor his service to our state by naming the Santa Fe courthouse after him," Bingaman said. 
   "Judge Campos served the state and nation well during his time on the federal bench. Naming the courthouse after him seems a proper tribute to the legacy he left behind in New Mexico as a public servant. After years of trying to get this enacted, I am pleased that we're now able to get this bill to the President," said Domenici. 
   Campos served as a seaman first class in the United States Navy from 1944 to 1946. From 1954 to 1957 he served as the Assistant Attorney General and then First Assistant Attorney General of New Mexico and was a district court judge in New Mexico's First Judicial District from 1971 to 1978. He was the prime mover in reestablishing federal court judicial activity in Santa Fe and had his chambers in the courthouse there for over 22 years. For his dedication to the state, Judge Campos received distinguished achievement awards in 1993 from both the State Bar of New Mexico and the University of New Mexico. 
   Campos held the title of Chief U.S. District Judge from February 5, 1987 to December 31, 1989 and took senior status in 1992.
