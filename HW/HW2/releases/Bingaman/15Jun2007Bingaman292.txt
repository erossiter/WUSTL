SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO COUNTIES TO SHARE OVER $22.74 MILLION IN PAYMENTS IN LIEU OF TAXES FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that New Mexico counties will share over $22.742 million in "payments in lieu of taxes" (PILT) - funds that go to local governments to replace lost tax revenue for federal land.  
   "PILT is vital for counties that have federal land with in their borders. It helps pay for important services that benefit the community," Bingaman said. "This funding will greatly benefit New Mexico and I will continue to work to strengthen PILT."
   Bingaman, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, has been the leading advocate in Congress for raising PILT payments to counties and has authored legislation to automatically and fully-fund the PILT program each year, which would exempt the program from the annual appropriations process. 
   Earlier this year, Bingaman coauthored a proposal that would fully-fund PILT through 2012. Additionally, the proposal would provide about $2.8 billion through 2011 to fund counties with National Forest lands under the Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act. It is estimated that New Mexico would receive a total of $97 million from 2007-2012 under the program. Currently, New Mexico receives about $2.3 million annually under Secure Rural Schools, which expired last year. The proposal was adopted (74-23) to the FY2007 Supplemental Appropriation Bill but unfortunately was removed during final negotiations Bingaman said he will continue to push for the enactment of that proposal. 
   Currently, PILT is authorized at more than $360 million, but was funded this year at just $232 million. Full-funding for PILT would provide about a 35 percent increase in total funding for the program. 
   County-by-county PILT awards for fiscal year 2007 are below.
