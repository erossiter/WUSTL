SEN. BINGAMAN INTRODUCES BILL TO CREATE BIPARTISAN COMMISSION ON MEDICAID
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined Republican Sen. Gordon Smith (Ore.) in introducing legislation that would create a bipartisan panel that would give a comprehensive and thorough review of what is and is not working about Medicaid and how to improve service delivery and quality in the most cost-effective way possible. Twelve other Senators are cosponsoring the measure. 
   Medicaid is the federal initiative that covers health care costs for low-income Americans.
   Earlier this week, the Bush administration unveiled a budget proposal that calls for $60 billion in cuts to Medicaid over the next decade. Bingaman strongly opposes the cuts because 400,000 New Mexicans rely on Medicaid for their health care. 
   Instead of enacting the White House cuts, Bingaman said he believes it is important to first hear from a bipartisan panel in charge of studying Medicaid.
   "One quarter of all New Mexicans rely on Medicaid for their health care," Bingaman said. "Of all 50 states, only Texas has a higher percentage than New Mexico of residents who lack health insurance. Cuts like the ones proposed by the Bush administration would be devastating to our state." 
   "Before making reckless cuts, it would make sense to find out what can be improved about Medicaid. This bill would accomplish that goal," he added. 
   The Medicaid Commission would be comprised of 24 members that reflect all the stakeholders and components in the Medicaid program. Those members include the following:
   *?One Member appointed by the President 
   * Two House members (current or former) appointed by the Speaker and Minority Leader 
   * Two Senators (current or former) appointed by the Majority and Minority Leader 
   * Two Governors designated by NGA 
   * Two Legislators designated by NCSL 
   * Two state Medicaid director designated by NASMD 
   * Two Local elected officials appointed by Comptroller General 
   * Four consumer advocates appointed by congressional leadership 
   * Four providers appointed by congressional leadership 
   * Two program experts appointed by Comptroller General 
   The Commission would have 14 months to hold public hearings, conduct its evaluations and deliberations, and issue its report and recommendations to the President, the Congress, and the public.
