SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RELEASE $495,000 FOR FAMILY CENTER
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that $495,000 he helped secure for to expand the Carlsbad Battered Family Shelter.  
   Specifically, the funding will be used to expand the 8-bedroom shelter, which suffers from overcrowding. The funds will allow the shelter to address safety and privacy concerns as well as structural deterioration. 
   "This shelter provides a safe haven for families who are suffering from domestic violence. I'm pleased federal funding will be used to expand and support the services it offers," Bingaman said. 
   The funds come through the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). 
   HUD also will release $744,000 for infrastructure improvements at the Hobbs Industrial Air Park. The successful completion of this project may ensure that up to 5,000 jobs are developed. 
   "This is a significant investment in a very important economic development project in Hobbs, and I am glad to support it," Bingaman said.
