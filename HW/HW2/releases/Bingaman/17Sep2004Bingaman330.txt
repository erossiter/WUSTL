SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO YOUTH BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman reported today that the New Mexico Police Athletic League (NM PAL) has been awarded a $200,000 grant from the Department of Justice.
   NMPAL works to help at risk youth in New Mexico and helps promote self-esteem through recreational, educational and cultural activities that unite youth with law enforcement officers, educators and other positive role models.
   "Low self-esteem can contribute to delinquency and violence in a young adult's life. The New Mexico Police Athletic League works to tackle this problem and I am pleased that the federal government is supporting these efforts," Bingaman said.
