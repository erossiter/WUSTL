SEN. BINGAMAN BILL WOULD SAVE NEW MEXICO HEALTH CENTERS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman has introduced bipartisan legislation to help ensure New Mexico health centers are fairly reimbursed for treating Medicare patients.  
   Bingaman's Medicare Access to Community Health Center (MATCH) Act would ensure that health centers are rightly compensated for their services. Currently, community health centers are subjected to an arbitrary cap on their Medicare payments. As a result, these safety-net providers often receive less than other service providers for providing the same services to Medicare patients. 
   In total, the National Association of Community Health Centers estimates that this cap has resulted in New Mexico health centers loosing more than a million dollars annually in forgone Medicare payments. 
   "New Mexico's community health centers provide high quality, comprehensive care to some of our state's most vulnerable people," Bingaman said. "It's unfair to ask these safety-net providers who already serve uninsured New Mexicans to be underpaid by Medicare. By fixing this inequity, my bill would make it possible to expand community health centers' efforts to provide care, which is so critical in New Mexico and throughout the nation."
