SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS FUNDS FOR NEW MEXICO'S COTTON INDUSTRY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that he is working to secure federal funding to help New Mexico's cotton industry.  
   Bingaman is requesting $2 million in the fiscal year 2007 Agriculture Appropriations bill to support the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Southwest Cotton Ginning Research Lab in Las Cruces - one of the country's most important cotton research facilities.
   "The Southwest Cotton Ginning Research Lab is not only critical to New Mexico's cotton producers, but to our nation's cotton industry. The research done here has kept our nation's cotton growers and processors at the top of the global cotton market - keeping cotton quality high, and continually improving production techniques," Bingaman said. "This funding would allow them to continue this valuable work."
   President Bush's budget proposal for 2007 contained zero funding for the research lab, which could result in its closing in September.
   Bingaman toured the cotton gin last year, and learned about the work being done there. Cotton is a $40 million per year industry in New Mexico. Because farmers alternate cotton with other crops, the lab also supports work in other critical New Mexico agriculture industries, such as chile.
