SEN. BINGAMAN PARTICIPATES IN SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE HEARING ON ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today participated in a Senate Finance Committee hearing to discuss what actions should be taken to stimulate the economy.  
   Bingaman is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which will write the Senate's version of a stimulus package. At the hearing, Senators discussed the need to pass a package that would be timely, temporary and targeted to those who need it most. 
   "There is growing consensus that we're in, or are headed into, a recession, and that an economic stimulus package is needed to help our ailing economy," Bingaman said. "Today's hearing made it clear that we must take steps to give our economy an immediate boost." 
   Bingaman said he believes "stimulus checks" to Americans will be part of a package, despite the fact that the IRS will not be able to begin processing such checks until the end of May. But he said he hopes a major part of the stimulus package will be even more immediate - such as a boost in unemployment benefits and food stamps.
