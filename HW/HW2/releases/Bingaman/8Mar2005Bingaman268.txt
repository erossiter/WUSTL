SEN. BINGAMAN MEASURE TO TRANSFER 150.86 ACRES OF BLM LAND TO RIO ARRIBA COUNTY TAKES FIRST STEP
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman said he is pleased that the Bush administration will support his plan to transfer 150.86 acres of land in the vicinity of Alcalde from the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) to Rio Arriba County. 
   The administration made its position known at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing on Bingaman's bill, which is cosponsored by U.S. Senator Pete Domenici.
   The "Rio Arriba County Land Conveyance Act" would convey a parcel of BLM land to Rio Arriba County to meet a number of needs, including grounds for a new public school and a public cemetery to be managed by St. John the Baptist Catholic Church. 
  "Rio Arriba County has come up with important uses for the excess BLM land. St. John the Baptist Catholic Church will use a portion of the land as a cemetery, while another piece of the property will be the home of a new school," Bingaman said. "It looks as though we've got enough support for this bipartisan bill to move it through Congress quickly." 
  "I am very pleased we have been able to find a mutually-agreeable solution that benefits both Rio Arriba County and the BLM. Rio Arriba County has great plans for the acreage, including a new public school and additional space for the local Catholic parish," Domenici said. "This is a strong piece of legislation that would put excess lands from the BLM to good use and I hope to see prompt action in the Senate."
