SEN. BINGAMAN: ALBUQUERQUE RECEIVES FUNDING TO COMBAT METH
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Albuquerque Police Department has been awarded a $446,454 federal grant from the Department of Justice Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) to help fight methamphetamine use.  
   Funding will be used to help combat the manufacture, use, and distribution of meth, and to collaborate with other entities in the prevention and treatment of meth abuse. 
   "The funding awarded today will help the Albuquerque Police Department continue its efforts to stop this dangerous drug from destroying peoples' lives and harming the community," Bingaman said. 
   The COPS program aims to advance community policing nationwide and supports state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. Bingaman is a strong supporter of the program.
