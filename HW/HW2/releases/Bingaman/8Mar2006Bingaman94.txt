SEN. BINGAMAN MAKES FOLLOW-UP INQUIRY ON POSTAL SERVICE PROGRESS IN SANTA FE
  Just weeks after meeting with U.S. Postal Service officials in Santa Fe, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today inquired about the status of progress being made to improve mail delivery in the area. 
   In a letter to USPS Albuquerque Regional Manager Momi Lee, Bingaman inquired about current and future staffing levels. The letter is as follows:
   "As you may recall in our meeting in January with Santa Fe Postmaster Ruben Romero we discussed the staffing problems in the Santa Fe area postal system. At that time you indicated that the post office would be hiring 7-10 new employees to address the service issues in the area, and it appeared that the USPS was willing and eager to make the necessary changes to improve service in the area. However, recent reports state that the post office has reduced its Santa Fe area staff by more than 30 employees from 2002 levels. It seems highly unlikely that the postal service will meet the needs of the Santa Fe area at levels that are below 2002 staffing levels. 
   "While I commend your recent efforts to improve postal service throughout New Mexico, significant improvements will only be seen with a serious commitment by the USPS to adequately staff postal offices and processing facilities. Please tell me what your intended actions are with regard to improving service in the Santa Fe area."
