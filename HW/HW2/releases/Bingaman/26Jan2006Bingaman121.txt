SEN. BINGAMAN: LORDSBURG FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Lordsburg Volunteer Fire Department has been awarded an $18,920 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program. 
   The grant can be used to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities.
   "It's essential for fire departments throughout the state have the training and equipment needed to respond to emergency situations," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that the federal government is investing in the Lordsburg Fire Department."
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters program and has co-sponsored legislation to provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
