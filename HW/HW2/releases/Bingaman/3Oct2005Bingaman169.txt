SEN. BINGAMAN: ORGANIZATIONS AWARDED FUNDS TO PRESERVE NATIVE LANGUAGES
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today that the Mesaclero Apache Tribe and the Indigenous Language Institute in Santa Fe have been awarded federal funds to support initiatives that aim to preserve native languages.  
 The funds come from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. 
   The Indigenous Language Institute (ILI), which will receive $175,000, facilitates community-based initiatives for language revitalization through collaboration with other groups, organizations and individuals. It promotes public awareness of the importance of Indigenous language preservation and helps teach endangered Indigenous languages.
   The Mescalero Apache Tribe will receive $174,864 to design and/or implement a language program that will help assure the survival and continued use of its language.
   "Language plays a key role in defining cultures. But many Native American communities are seeing their languages disappear. I am pleased the funds awarded today to Mescalero and to ILI will be used to help preserve our state's Indigenous languages," Bingaman said.
