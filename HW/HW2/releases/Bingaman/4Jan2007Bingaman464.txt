SEN. BINGAMAN COMMENTS ON RESIGNATION OF LINTON BROOKS AS NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement following the announcement that Ambassador Linton Brooks has resigned as administrator of the National Nuclear Security Agency.  
   "Clearly there have been a series of problems that the current leadership at the NNSA has not been able to solve with respect to security and I respect Secretary Bodman's decision. I think Ambassador Brooks instituted some measures that will help and I appreciate his service to the country. The challenge for Secretary Bodman is to find someone to fill the position who can address security concerns while encouraging the highest quality science," said Bingaman, who is the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee.
