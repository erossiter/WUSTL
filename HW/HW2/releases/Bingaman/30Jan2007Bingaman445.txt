  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced his nominees from Northern New Mexico and the Four Corners region for admission to each of the nation's four military service academies.  
   Each year Bingaman selects students for nomination to the U.S. Air Force Academy, the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy, the U.S. Military Academy or the U.S. Naval Academy. The United States Military Service Academies are the country's premier officer training programs.
