SEN. BINGAMAN: SIERRA COUNTY FIRE DEPARTMENT TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Winston-Chloride Volunteer Fire Department in Sierra County has been awarded a $46,360 grant through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's (DHS) Assistance to Firefighters Grant program.  
   Funding can be used to implement operational and firefighter safety programs at the fire stations. Funds can be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, and modifications to fire stations and facilities. 
   "It's important that we keep New Mexico's fire departments in top shape so that they are always prepared to handle any emergency situation that could arise," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is a strong supporter of the Assistance to Firefighters programs, which provide much-needed federal assistance to local fire departments for equipment, training, and fire prevention campaigns.
