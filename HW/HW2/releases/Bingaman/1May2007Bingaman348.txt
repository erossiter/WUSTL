SEN. BINGAMAN RESOLUTION ENCOURAGES INCREASED U.S. INVOLVEMENT IN SOLVING GUATEMALAN MURDERS
  A year after the Senate passed a resolution that urges U.S. involvement in helping solve the brutal murders of women in Juarez, Sen. Jeff Bingaman today introduced a similar Senate resolution aimed at raising awareness about the serious issue involving crimes against women in Guatemala. 
   Since 2001, more than 2,000 women and girls have been murdered in Guatemala. The murder rate of these women almost doubled from 2001 to 2006, increasing at a higher rate than the murder rate of men. According to data from Guatemala's public Prosecutors Office, few arrests and few convictions have been made. As of 2006 there have been only 20 convictions for these killings.
   "Like the women of Juarez murders, many of the Guatemalan cases remain unsolved due to insufficient resources, inadequate legal protections for women, and lack of independent and effective judicial and prosecutorial systems," Bingaman said. "The resolution I am introducing today is aimed raising awareness of this issue and encouraging the governments of Guatemala and the United States to work together to stop these killings."
   The Government of Guatemala has taken some steps to address these murders. Guatemala has created special police and prosecutorial units, and repealed the so called "Rape Law" which had absolved perpetrators of criminal responsibility for rape upon the perpetrator's marriage with the victim. The Government also recently entered into an agreement with the United Nations to establish the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala, which has a mandate to investigate and prosecute illegal security groups operating with impunity. And Guatemala established the National Institute for Forensic Sciences to improve investigatory and evidence gathering efforts.
   Specifically, among other things, the resolution:
   * Condemns these murders and expresses the sympathy of the Senate to the families of women and girls murdered in Guatemala;
   * Encourages the Government of Guatemala to act with due diligence in investigating and prosecuting those responsible for these crimes;
   * Urges the Government of Guatemala to recognize domestic violence as a criminal act and to provide adequate resources necessary to strengthen the integrity of the prosecutorial and judicial systems;
   * Urges the President of the United States and the Secretary of State to incorporate this issue into the bilateral agenda between the Governments of Guatemala and the United States; and
   * Encourages the Secretary of State to provide assistance in training and equipping special police units to investigate these crimes, implementing judicial reforms and rule of law programs, establishing a missing persons system, creating an effective witness protection program, and supporting efforts to enhance forensic capabilities.
   The U.S. House of Representatives today passed a similar resolution that was introduced by Rep. Hilda Solis (D-CA).
