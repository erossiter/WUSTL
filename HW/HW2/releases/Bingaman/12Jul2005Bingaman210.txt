SEN. BINGAMAN: SENATE APPROVES FUNDS FOR VETERANS HEALTH CARE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that the Senate has approved a provision that would provide critical funding needed to help meet the health care needs of the country's veterans. 
   The measure, which was made a part of the 2006 Department of Homeland Security appropriations bill currently on the Senate floor, would provide $1.5 billion in emergency supplemental funding for the Department of Veterans' Affairs (VA) for veterans' healthcare. 
   "With a record number of soldiers returning home from missions in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is now more important than ever to ensure VA health programs are adequately funded. The amendment approved today helps us uphold our commitment to the brave men and women who served our country. I hope it survives any changes made to the final bill," Bingaman said. 
  The U.S. House of Representatives passed a much smaller amendment to the 2006 Department of Interior appropriations bill last month. That measure only approved $975 million for the VA. Much less than what is needed.
   Last month the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) announced a $1 billion budget shortfall for fiscal year 2005 - just two months after an amendment to bolster veterans' funding by about $2 billion was rejected. Bingaman voted for that veterans' benefit increase, but the measure was defeated 46-54 on a near party line vote. Bingaman has also joined Senate colleagues in writing to President Bush urging him to increase VA funding to meet the health care needs of the nation's veterans.
   Adjusted for inflation, the VA is spending 25-percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000. In many cases veterans have to wait over three years to have surgery. In some VA hospitals are only seeing veterans who have more than a 50-percent service-connected disability.
