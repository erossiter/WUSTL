SEN. BINGAMAN: WHITE HOUSE BUDGET BAD FOR SMALL BUSINESS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman said he is concerned about the Bush administration's plans to cut funding to the Small Business Administration (SBA).  
   The SBA is designed to increase entrepreneurship and strengthen our economy by providing business advice, technical assistance, and low-cost loans to individuals that cannot obtain capital through normal means.
   "Future growth in our economy will depend heavily on the ability of our nation's small businesses to grow. Right now, many businesses in our state look to the Small Business Administration for help," Bingaman said. "It is a mistake to cut off the funds that assist our small businesses in essential ways." 
   The Bush budget does the following:
   * Zeroes out funding for the 7(j) and Microloan technical assistance, which is designed to help small, disadvantaged entrepreneurs gain the training to open and maintain a business. This will have a significant impact on Wesstcorp and New Mexico Community Loan Fund. This program was funded at almost $7 million this year.
   * Zeroes out HUBZone program, which was set up to stimulate economic development and create jobs in urban and rural communities by providing federal contracting preferences to small businesses. More than half of New Mexico is HUBZone eligible. This program was funded at almost $2 million this year.
   * Zeroes out funding for the National Women's Business Council, which was created to promote initiatives, policies and programs designed to support women's business enterprises at all stages of development in the public and private sector marketplaces - from start-up to success to significance. This program was funded at almost $500,000 this year.
   * Eliminates Sustainability Grants through the Women's Centers Grant program. Wesst Corp. depends heavily on funding from this program. 
   * Zeroes out funding for U.S. Export Assistance Centers, which are designed to allow small and medium business obtain access to export information. This program was funded at almost $1.5 million this year.
   * Zeroes out funding for microloans, and technical assistance grants. Wesst Corp. and the have received technical assistance grants, and Wesst Corp. has received funds from the microlending program. 
  The White House offers its ideas for spending in its budget proposal, but Congress is tasked with writing the bills that govern all federal spending. That process begins in spring.
