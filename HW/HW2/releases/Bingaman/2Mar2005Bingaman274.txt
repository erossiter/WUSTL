SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED WITH COURT DECISION THAT WILL KEEP BORDER CLOSED TO CANADIAN CATTLE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased that a federal judge has blocked the reopening of the U.S. border to cattle and expanded beef imports from Canada because concerns over mad-cow disease. The court case, decided in Montana, was brought by an organization of cattle producers that feared what would happen if the border was reopened to cattle exports. 
   Bingaman is the cosponsor of a Senate resolution that seeks to protect Americans from mad-cow disease by urging the Bush administration to keep the U.S.-Canadian border closed for cattle exports, despite the fact that the Bush administration has announced it wanted to reopen it this month. In May 2003, the United States closed the border to Canadian cattle imports after bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad-cow disease) was detected in a Canadian dairy cow. 
   "I think it's risky to reopen the border to Canadian cattle exports, particularly when mad-cow disease was detected in a Canadian cow just a few weeks ago. We need to protect both beef consumers and the cattle industry from this deadly disease," Bingaman said.
   The judge's ruling may only delay the opening of the border, so Bingaman is hopeful that the Senate will go on record Thursday supporting plans to keep the border closed for cattle exports. Bingaman was one of 33 Senators who signed a petition that will force the Senate to debate and vote on the resolution Thursday, March 3. 
   At the same time, Bingaman continues to urge the Bush administration to work with Mexican authorities to reopen the U.S.-Mexican border to cattle exports. The Mexican government closed the border to cattle exports last year, despite the fact that the only case of mad-cow disease in the United States was detected in a Canadian cow.
