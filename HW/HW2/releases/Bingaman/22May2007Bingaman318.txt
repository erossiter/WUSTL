SEN. BINGAMAN BACKS CITIES' RECOMMENDATION FOR AIR SERVICE TO CLOVIS, SILVER CITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today added his support to Clovis and Silver City's preferred airline for commercial air transportation to Albuquerque. 
   In a letter to Secretary of Transportation Mary E. Peters, Bingaman expressed his support for awarding a new two-year contract for Essential Air Service (EAS) to Great Lakes Airlines. Under the new contract proposal, Great Lakes would continue to provide 12 non-stop roundtrips per week to Albuquerque with a twin-turboprop, Beechcraft 1900D pressurized 19-passenger airliner. 
   "Communities such as Clovis and Silver City rely on commercial air service to attract business and promote economic growth in the region. Efficient and reliable air service is also critical to maintaining quality health care in small communities. I respectfully request that the department act quickly to approve a new EAS contract for Clovis and Silver City so that passenger service can be maintained without interruption," Bingaman wrote to Peters. 
   In March, Bingaman called on Secretary Peters to withdraw the department's decision to award a new two-year contract that switched Clovis' air service to Denver and Silver City's to Phoenix. 
   In April, DOT withdrew the contract award and asked for new proposals from airlines interested in provided service to Albuquerque. Now that both communities have submitted their recommendation, the DOT is expected to issue a final order awarding the contract to Great Lakes for service to Albuquerque in the next few weeks.
