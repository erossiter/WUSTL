SEN. BINGAMAN INTRODUCES BILL GIVING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO PROSECUTE FOR OVERPRICED GASOLINE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman (D-NM) and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-FL) have teamed to introduce legislation to allow the federal government to prosecute those who overcharge for gasoline and diesel during a major disaster. 
  Currently, just 23 states have laws banning such practices. The Bingaman-Nelson legislation would provide a minimum standard in all states. Bingaman is the ranking member of the Energy Committee and Nelson serves on the Commerce Committee.
   "It's the Federal Trade Commission's responsibility to investigate price gouging, but right now the Federal government can't prosecute price gougers during a disaster - or any other time, for that matter," Bingaman said. "That has to be fixed. In the wake of Hurricane Katrina, and now Hurricane Rita, this legislation is extremely timely."
  Modeled in part after Florida's anti-price gouging law, the legislation would give federal authorities, for the first time, power to prosecute people accused of charging excessively for motor fuels in a declared disaster area. Those convicted could face one year of imprisonment and/or a $500,000 fine. 
   The bill was referred to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.
