SEN. BINGAMAN: UNION/ COLFAX COUNTY RANCHERS ELIGIBLE FOR DISASTER AID
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased Union and Colfax Counties have been declared eligible for federal disaster assistance as a result of sever snow storms that occurred last month.  
   Farmers and ranchers in Union and Colfax Counties are now eligible to be considered for low interest emergency loans from the Farm Service Agency, which is part of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). 
   "Last month's snowstorms caused substantial damage to ranches, farms, and loss of livestock. The disaster declaration announced today will help New Mexico ranchers recover from these losses," Bingaman said. 
   Eligible applicants have eight months from the date of declaration to apply for a loan. The federal low-interest loan can be used to cover physical losses - damage to farm structures such as barns, dead livestock and fence damage. 
   Producers in Union and Colfax Counties are eligible for assistance as contiguous counties from primary disaster designations received in the bordering Colorado Counties. Bingaman and Congressman Tom Udall have called on USDA to make all of New Mexico counties impacted by recent snow eligible disaster assistance. 
   For more information or to determine eligibility for a low interest loan contact the local USDA Farm Service Center.
