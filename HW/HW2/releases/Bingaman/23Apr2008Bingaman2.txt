N.M. DELEGATION: ARMY CANCELS PRIVATIZATION STUDY AT WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE
  U.S. Senators Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici and Representative Steve Pearce today applauded the Pentagon's decision to cancel a study on whether to privatize some jobs at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR). 
   In 2006, the New Mexico lawmakers wrote twice to then-U.S. Army Secretary Francis Harvey pointing out that WSMR is expanding and saying it did not make sense to undertake a so-called A-76 privatization study while changes were being made. At the time, the Army said it did not believe the planned changes would "materially impact" the A-76 study.
   But the Army reconsidered and this week announced that the conditions were not right to complete the study because of the growth coming to WSMR and the region.
   "This is great news. It never made sense to move ahead with a study to privatize jobs at WSMR just as the range was about to experience a growth spurt. And in my own view, the important jobs these civilians do are inherently governmental in nature. I'm very glad the Army has finally come to this conclusion," Bingaman said.
   "It took the Army time to come to the right decision, but I'm pleased it finally did. We won't have the prospect of this personnel change hanging over WSMR as it readies itself for dramatic growth in the next few years," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
   "This is the correct decision for WSMR and the surrounding community. Given the increased demands on WSMR and the expected growth, a great change at this time would not be in the best interest. I deeply appreciate the support of my colleagues in the Senate as we continue our commitment to New Mexico's military bases," said Pearce.
