SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN LINCOLN COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today confirmed that Region IX Education Cooperative in Ruidoso has been awarded a $327,450 federal grant from the U.S. Department of Education.  
   Region XI Education Cooperative (RECIX) provides health and educational support services to children and families in the area. Bingaman said the funding awarded today will help the cooperative increase student access to quality mental health services. 
   "Mental health is an important part of an individual's overall wellbeing. Unfortunately, access to mental health services is not always readily available. This funding will help many Lincoln County residents," Bingaman said. 
   The project will build on the rapid expansion of New Mexico's school-based health centers (SBHC), Regional Education Cooperatives and telehealth services. The grant will provide funds to train school personnel in pilot sites to make appropriate referrals, identify core features of implementation for high-functioning SBHC, develop a web-based database of local and telehealth resources, develop a model for scaling up telehealth in SBHCs and to demonstrate the capacity and viability of this model. 
   RECIX serves the Capitan, Carrizozo, Cloudcroft, Corona, Ruidoso, Hondo, and Tularosa school districts and communities. Programs administered by RECIX are accredited by the New Mexico Public Education Department.
