SEN. BINGAMAN INTRODUCES BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE MEDICAL EQUIPMENT NOT CURRENTLY COVERED UNDER MEDICARE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman introduced legislation today that would provide many disabled Americans with the equipment, such as wheelchairs, they need to live independently.  
   Under the current interpretation of Medicare's "in the home" restriction, wheelchairs are only covered for use in the home. Coverage only applies to devices that assist in eating, bathing, grooming, toileting and dressing. This prevents individuals who need a wheelchair for mobility, and who depend on Medicare to pay for the wheelchair, from going out into their communities and leading independent lives. 
   Bingaman's "Medicare Independent Living Act of 2006" would ensure that wheelchairs, iron lungs, oxygen tents and hospital beds are covered under Medicare. Power-operated wheelchairs may also be covered if it is determined that there is a sufficient need due to the patient's medical condition. The bill also provides for blood-testing strips and blood glucose monitors for patients with diabetes. 
   "Wheelchairs make it possible for otherwise homebound individuals to have the freedom and opportunity to get around outside their homes," Bingaman said. "This bill allows people with disabilities to live independently in their community and I hope my colleagues in the Senate support it." 
   Bingaman was one of 34 Senators who signed a letter to the Bush Administration asking that the "in the home" restriction be dropped. The administration responded by saying that legislation was required to make the appropriate changes, which prompted Bingaman to author the Medicare Independent Living Act.
