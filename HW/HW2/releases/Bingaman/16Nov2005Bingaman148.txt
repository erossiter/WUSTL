SEN. BINGAMAN'S MEASURE SAVES ROSWELL AIRPORT FUNDS
  Congress is poised to give final approval to a proposal written by Sen. Jeff Bingaman that prevents Roswell International Air Center (RIAC) from losing most of its federal grant funding. Bingaman's amendment was attached to the fiscal year 2006 Transportation Appropriations Act which has been finalized and awaits final Congressional approval.  
   Currently "primary airports" - airports with 10,000 passenger boardings or more a year - receive a $1 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP). Airports with less than 10,000 annual boardings receive just $150,000. However, for the passed two years, Congress has allowed former "primary airports" - such as RIAC - that suffered a drop below the 10,000 threshold due to the effects of 9/11 to retain their full $1 million grant level. 
   Unfortunately, based on preliminary boarding data for 2004, there are still about 45 primary airports, including RIAC, that have not yet regained their previous boarding levels. As a result these airports were scheduled to receive $150,000, instead of the $1 million they had previously been awarded.
   Bingaman's amendment ensures that RIAC will receive $500,000, instead of getting cut to $150,000.
   "Congress invests heavily in airports that serve large communities. It shouldn't turn its back on smaller ones. It would have been devastating for the RIAC's funding to suddenly be reduced to almost nothing, and I am very glad I was able to prevent that from happening," Bingaman said. 
   Without Bingaman's amendment Roswell's funding would have dropped for 2006 and would have affected the planned upgrade of the shoulders at the airport's 13,000-foot main runway (3-21). That project is expected to cost $4.5 million.
   Senator Pete Domenici was a co-sponsor of Bingaman's amendment. "The conference committee, on which I served, has included this amendment in the final bill which ensure that the Roswell Airport will receive $500,000 from the FAA. Smaller airports, like Roswell's, should not be punished because of a national downturn in general and business aviation from 9/11. Now these airports will have an extra year to regain pre-9/11 traffic levels, which is tied to funding," said Domenici, who as a member of the TTHUD Appropriations Subcommittee served on the conference committee that finalized the measure.
