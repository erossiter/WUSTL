SPENDING BILL CONTAINS SEN. BINGAMAN SECURED FUNDS FOR NATIONAL GUARD BORDER SECURITY EFFORTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that a key spending bill that unanimously passed the Senate Thursday evening contains funding he requested for a highly-effective counterdrug interdiction program at the New Mexico-Mexico border.  
   The 2007 spending bill that funds the Department of Defense contains $3 million Bingaman requested for the New Mexico National Guard Counterdrug Program, which supports counterdrug activities, including the surveillance of high-traffic border areas and mobile vehicle inspection and dismantlement at select Border Patrol checkpoints on major roads. Funding is also used to hire full-time Guardsmen to construct vehicle barrier along the border. Bingaman secured $2.8 million for the program last year and $1 million in fiscal year 2005. 
   "The National Guard does an outstanding job helping Border Patrol prevent drugs from being smuggled into our country and keeping our border with Mexico secure," Bingaman said. "I'm glad this $3 million has been set aside in the Senate bill to continue carrying out this important effort." 
   The counterdrug program is completely separate from Operation Jump Start, the administration's plan to deploy 6,000 National Guard troops along the border. 
   The House and Senate must now meet to negotiate a final bill that can be sent to the president for signature.
