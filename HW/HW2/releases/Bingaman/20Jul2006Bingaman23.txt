SEN. BINGAMAN: SPENDING BILL CONTAINS $1.5 MILLION FOR BELEN AIRPORT
  The Senate Appropriations Committee today approved a spending bill that contains funding Sen. Jeff Bingaman secured for the Alexander Municipal Airport in Belen.  
   The fiscal year 2007 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation contains $1.5 million Bingaman requested for the Belen airport. Funding would be used to construct a new cross wind runway, which is needed to accommodate additional aircraft at the airport. 
   "Our state's airports are a key component to attracting new business opportunities to the state. This fund would help Alexander Municipal Airport stay competitive and I will work to see it is included in the final version of the bill," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman secured $609,000 in FY2006 and $871,287 in FY2005 to acquire land and complete the design of the runway, which was needed to begin the project.
