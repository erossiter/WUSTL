SEN. BINGAMAN: BILL PROMOTES NEW MEXICO BEEF INDUSTRY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today joined in introducing bipartisan legislation that promotes New Mexico's cattle industry. 
   The bill would implement mandatory country-of-origin labeling (COOL) by September 30, 2007 instead of the September 2008 deadline set in a Fiscal Year 2006 spending bill. Bingaman joined Senator Craig Thomas (R-WY) in cosponsoring the bill. Currently, federal law requires labeling only of fish. 
   "Consumers should have the right to know where their beef, lamb and pork comes from," Bingaman said. "Moving up the date for mandatory labeling is a good idea and it would also help promote New Mexico's beef industry in other countries." 
   In 2002, the President signed into law the farm bill which required the U.S. Department of Agriculture to implement country-of-origin labeling for food (meat, fish, peanuts and produce) by September 2004. Later, at the urging of the Bush Administration and large meatpackers, Congress moved to delay implementation of COOL for two years - until September 2006. The FY 2006 Agriculture Appropriations bill further extended the deadline an additional two years to 2008. 
   Most of New Mexico's ranchers and farmers support COOL. Bingaman also opposes efforts to make labeling voluntary.
