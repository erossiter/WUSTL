SEN. BINGAMAN: PRIVATIZING SOCIAL SECURITY WILL HURT NEW MEXICO SENIORS
  In light of Treasury Secretary John Snow's scheduled visit to New Mexico today, Sen. Jeff Bingaman underscored his concerns about the Bush administration's plans to privatize Social Security - the federal initiative begun in 1935 that has helped keep seniors out of poverty.  
   Bingaman is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over Social Security, and will be at the center of the debate if Congress moves to make changes to the popular program. He has said he supports private savings accounts, but he does not support diverting Social Security funding to create those accounts. In New Mexico it is estimated that Social Security has reduced the poverty of seniors from 45 percent to 12 percent, pulling an about 800,000 seniors above the poverty line. Today, there are about 29,000 seniors living in poverty in New Mexico - a number that is still far too high. Without Social Security, an estimated 109,000 seniors would be living in poverty - a very high percentage of them Hispanic.
   "For us in New Mexico, Social Security has particular importance. While the overall poverty rate for seniors has been reduced significantly over the years, the percentage of Hispanic seniors living in poverty today is twice that of non-Hispanic seniors at 22 percent. Hispanic seniors, and particularly Hispanic women aged 65 and older, are much less likely to derive income from pensions, interest, dividends, savings, or other sources. More than half of Hispanic women age 65 and older depend on Social Security for 100 percent of their income," Bingaman said.
   Last month, Bingaman joined Senate Democrats in unveiled a report showing the impact Social Security privatization would have on the Hispanic Community. The report, titled Privatizing Social Security: Benefit Cuts and Debt for our Familias, shows that the current Social Security system benefits Hispanics because:
   * Hispanics have lower earnings and benefit from Social Security's "progressive benefits";
   * Hispanics live longer and receive greater benefits during longer retirements;
   * Hispanics have a higher disability rate and rely on disability benefits more often;
   * Hispanics are less likely to have additional sources of retirement incomes; 
   * Without Social Security, 56 percent of Hispanics would live in poverty.
   As outlined in the report, if Social Security is privatized, it would mean there would be no more guaranteed monthly checks, and the benefits currently offered under the program would be cut by at least 45 percent. The report was prepared by the Democratic Policy Committee.
   Additionally, the government would have to borrow trillions of dollars to transition from Social Security as we know it to private accounts. That means young Americans would be saddled with a huge debt. Hispanics are on average a decade younger than their non-Hispanic counterparts and would carry a major portion of that burden.
   "The diversion of Social Security revenues to private investment accounts would shift much of the risks of old-age back to low-income seniors, and pose very serious challenges to families who depend on social security's survivor and disability insurance benefits," Bingaman said. "We can strengthen Social Security without privatization, and we can strengthen our private pension system to give more people access to private accounts. I'll devote my effort in this Congress to working with Senators from both parties to find and enact those alternative solutions."
