SEN. BINGAMAN PLEASED CONGRESS HAS PASSED TEMPORARY SPENDING MEASURE
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman issued the following statement after the Senate voted 94-1 to approve a temporary spending measure that funds the federal government, including New Mexico's two national laboratories. The measure can now go to President Bush for signature.  
   "This measure funds Sandia and Los Alamos laboratories at the highest level we could have hoped for, as Congress continues to work out a final spending bill. It is my hope that when we pass the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Bill in the coming weeks, that it will be similar to the amount the President requested in his 2008 budget," Bingaman said. 
   In a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid, Bingaman and U.S. Senator Pete Domenici last week asked that a temporary spending measure, called continuing resolution (CR), provide FY2007 funding levels after the Oct. 1 start of the 2008 federal fiscal year. 
   The Senators cited the problems that could occur within the nation's nuclear weapons complex if a CR mandates the funding levels in the House-passed FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration has initiated a workforce restructuring process based on the possibility of having to adhere to the steep House cuts as part of a CR.
