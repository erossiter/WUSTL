NEW MEXICO SENATORS SAY MEXICAN GOVERNMENT MUST CONTROL BORDER VIOLENCE
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today asked the U.S. State Department to encourage the Mexican government to address a disturbing rise in violent crime along New Mexico's border with Mexico.  
   The New Mexico Senators on Wednesday wrote Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice to call attention to the recent escalation of apparent drug war violence that has led to the death of at least seven people in Palomas, Mexico, the sister town to Columbus, N.M. The Senators asked Rice to encourage the Mexican government to address the situation before the problem worsens. 
   "This is an unwelcomed situation. Illegal drug problems rooted in Mexico are already a serious concern in New Mexico. The violence occurring in Palomas should be contained before it threatens New Mexicans or their interests," Domenici said. 
   "The situation across the border is disturbing. It's important for the Mexican government to do everything it can to put an end to the violence," Bingaman said. 
   Both Domenici and Bingaman sent staff to Luna County today where they were briefed on the violence, and offered to try to assist local communities in dealing with the situation. 
   In their letter to Rice, Bingaman and Domenici suggested that the State Department consider issuing a notice to constituents and travelers to the region, and asked her to encourage the Mexican government to address the situation. 
   "We believe the facts are sufficient to warrant a warning to our constituents in this area and to individuals who visit this area. We respectfully request that you consider issuing an appropriate warning to individuals who are in or may travel to this area. Furthermore, we hope you will urge the Mexican Government to take all appropriate steps to end this violence, including sending Mexican federal law enforcement personnel," the letter to Rice said.
