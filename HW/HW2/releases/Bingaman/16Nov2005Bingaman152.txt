SEN. BINGAMAN: KEY SPENDING BILL CONTAINS MILLIONS FOR NEW MEXICO TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today said he is pleased the Senate has finalized work on spending bill that contains millions of dollars in funding he requested for New Mexico transportation projects. 
   The fiscal year 2006 spending bill that funds the U.S. Department of Transportation contains $320,000 Bingaman requested for a Red Apple Transit in Farmington.
   "High gas prices have made public transportation an attractive alternative. The funding included in this bill will help keep Red Apple Transit running," Bingaman said.
   Farmington will use the funding to replace four buses to serve the area. Cost of maintenance for the buses has doubled due to their age and heavy use. The bill also contains $580,000 for Red Apple Transit operations and equipment. Bingaman secured $100,000 in 2004 to purchase bus shelters.
   The bill also contains a provision Bingaman wrote that prevents the use of federal funds to implement a controversial proposal that would force communities within 100 miles of a hub airport to contribute as much as $100,000 toward the cost of subsidizing commercial air service. Bingaman's provision would benefit Alamogordo and Hobbs.
   "Many of New Mexico's small communities depend on federal funds to keep their commercial air service running," Bingaman said. "I am pleased the federal government is continuing this important investment in communities such as Alamogordo and Hobbs."
   Bingaman secured funding for the following projects:
   * $110 million - Full Funding for the Essential Air Service Program: Since 1978, the EAS program has ensured that small, mostly rural communities could retain commercial air service after the industry was deregulated. Currently, five New Mexico communities take part in EAS: Alamogordo - $592,000; Carlsbad - $600,000; Clovis - $1.4 million; Hobbs - $519,000; and Silver City $1.35 million.
   * $3 million - Commuter Rail, Albuquerque to Santa Fe: to help conduct an Alternatives Analysis and preliminary design work for Phase II of a commuter rail to provide service between Bernalillo and Santa Fe. The Alternatives Analysis will consider the most effective method of providing transit services between Bernalillo and Santa Fe. The commuter rail is expected to alleviate severe congestion along the I-25 corridor. Phase I service between Belen and Bernalillo is slated to begin early next year.
   "I am pleased this bill contains the funding needed to begin the first step in making this important transportation project a reality," Bingaman said.
   * $2 million - I 25/Mesa del Sol Interchange in Albuquerque: The new interchange on I-25 to provide direct access to the core of the property and a much-needed access point to the Journal Pavilion and the Bernalillo County Recreation Complex. Bingaman helped secured $2.25 million for the project in FY2005.
   * $1.54 Million - Navajo Route 13 Pavement Rehabilitation: Funding will be used for the pavement rehabilitation on 5.5 miles of NR 13 from US Highway 491 west toward Red Valley. Rehabilitation will consist of removing and replacing the existing poor quality surface materials. N13 is the major access route to US 491 for the communities of Red Valley and Cove to the commercial and medical centers of Shiprock and Farmington in New Mexico.
   * $1 million - Bus and Bus Facilities, Las Cruces: RoadRunner Transit would use the funds to purchase three heavy-duty diesel transit buses to complete the conversion to a fully accessible fleet, four Diesel para-transit buses to replace four aging vans, upgrade the city's Dial-a-Ride program with Mobile Data Terminals and automated vehicle locator capabilities to automatically dispatch vans and reschedule rides to the best van to do the trip, and to purchase a drive-through vehicle wash system and equipment to wash bus-shelters. Bingaman secured $375,000 in FY04 for Las Cruces to purchase buses.
   "I am pleased this funding will help RoadRunner Transit expand its fleet and allow it to expand services to more Las Cruces residents," Bingaman said.
   * $825,000 - West Side Transit Facility, Albuquerque: for the completion of the maintenance facility and operations building. Bingaman secured $1 million in 2005, $2 million in 2004, $3.75 million in 2002, $5 million in 2001, and $2 million in 2000 for this facility.
   * $650,000 - Crosswind Runway, Belen Alexander Municipal Airport: The Airport's master plan includes the development of a second runway to accommodate additional classes of aircraft such as twin-engine planes, small business jets, and turbo-prop aircraft. The new runway will also provide crosswind coverage for aircraft. Bingaman helped secure $871,287 in FY05 to begin the land acquisition.
   * $225,000 for Albuquerque to purchase new hybrid diesel-electric buses that pollute less than conventional buses.
   The bill also includes funding for operations and equipment for the following public transit companies:
   * $7.3 million - Albuquerque Ride
   * $1.3 million - Las Cruces Roadrunner
   * $1.3 million - Santa Fe Trails
   * $6.9 million - Statewide transit grants for rural areas
   * $800,000 - State wide transit grants for elderly and disabled
   * $10 million - Small Community Air Service Development Program: The program helps improve air carrier service to airports not receiving sufficient service. Grants are provided to communities with smaller airports to help improve their commercial air carrier service. Bingaman helped secure $20 million in 2003, 2004, and 2005.
