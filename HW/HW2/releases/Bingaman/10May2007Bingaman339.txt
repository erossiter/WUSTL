SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO BENEFIT ALBUQUERQUE SUNPORT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman announced today the Albuquerque International Sunport will benefit from $2 million from the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). Funding will be used for taxiway rehabilitation at the airport. 
   "Airports are one of the best economic tools that a community has to offer, but they are expensive to maintain. I'm pleased the federal government is lending a helping hand to help the Sunport make some needed improvements to their taxiways," Bingaman said.
