SEN. BINGAMAN: FUNDING WILL HELP KEEP CLOVIS STUDENTS SAFE
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the City of Clovis has been awarded $50,128 in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) COPS Secure our Schools Grant Program.  
   Funds will go toward the protection and safety of Clovis school children. The program provides funds to cover the salary and benefits of police officers assigned to protect schools. The program also provides safety training for officers and the school's administration. 
   "I am pleased the federal government is making this important investment in student safety," Bingaman said. 
   The DOJ's COPS program was created by the 1994 federal crime bill, which Bingaman supported. Bingaman is also a cosponsor of the COPS reauthorization bill.
