SEN. BINGAMAN: FEDERAL FUNDS TO HELP PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO UNINSURED
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today confirmed that two New Mexico health care centers have been awarded funding through the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) to help low-income and uninsured patients access health care services.  
   The following health care centers were awarded: 
   * Ben Archer Health Care Center in Hatch $479,713 
   * Presbyterian Medical Services in Santa Fe $300,000 
   "New Mexico's health care centers provide essential primary care services to low-income individuals who lack health insurance. I am pleased the funding being released today will help the centers expand their services to help treat more people," Bingaman said. 
   Bingaman is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, which oversees HHS.
