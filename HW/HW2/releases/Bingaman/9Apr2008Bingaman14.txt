SEN. BINGAMAN: NEW MEXICO TO RECEIVE HIV/AIDS FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the state of the New Mexico Department of Health had been awarded a $4.06 million grant through the Ryan White CARE Act to help provide care, services and prescription drugs for people with HIV/AIDS. 
   "I am very pleased that New Mexico will be receiving this grant," said Bingaman. "I believe the federal government should be doing everything possible to prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS as well as to ensure HIV-positive New Mexicans have access to life-saving treatments."
   The Ryan White Comprehensive AIDS Resources Emergency (CARE) Act makes federal funds available to metropolitan areas and states to assist in health care costs and support services for individuals and families affected by acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or infection with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
