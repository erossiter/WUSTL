SEN. BINGAMAN: DEMING SCHOOLS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Deming Public Schools has been awarded a $675,988 grant from the U.S. Department of Education. 
   The Deming Public Schools will use the grant to fund the Programs that Improve, Enhance and Support (PIES) project, which aims to raise academic success within the Deming school district. The PIES program will work to provide these schools with high tech computer equipment to help students improve their educational skills and software to help identify areas of improvement or needed improvement in student's academic achievement. 
   "Technology is key to improving academic success in our nation's schools. I am pleased that the federal government is providing these funds to help children in Deming reach their full potential," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pension Committee which oversees the U.S. Department of Education.
