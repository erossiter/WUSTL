SEN. BINGAMAN APPLAUDS FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY RESEARCH
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman he was pleased to learn that Sandia National Laboratories and New Mexico State University will play key roles in shaping the country's alternative energy research. 
   Bingaman said Sandia National Laboratories is part of a partnership that is expected to receive million of dollars in U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) funding for biofuels research. Sandia is expected to receive $2 million annually for 5 years to help in the research and development of cellulosic ethanol and other biofuels.
   "Investment in biofuel research and technology will help reduce our country's dependence on foreign oil and I am glad that Sandia National Labs is playing an important role in that effort," Bingaman said.
   Bingaman is the author of a provision that was included in the energy bill that passed the Senate last week that requires an increasing portion of the renewable fuels consumed to be advanced biofuels, such as celluosic ethanol, biobutanol and other fuels derived from unconventional biomass feedstocks.
   Bingaman was also pleased to learn that New Mexico State University is part of a project working to establish a laboratory in Texas to test designs for wind turbine blades up to 300 feet long, about twice the length of blades now in common use. The project, Lone Star Wind Alliance, will receive $2 million in test equipment to develop the test facilities.
   "In New Mexico wind power is vital in the production of "green" energy," Bingaman said. "This federal funding will help expand the emerging renewable energy industry and I am pleased that New Mexico State University is helping make this possible."
