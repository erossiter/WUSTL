SEN. BINGAMAN: PROGRAM VITAL TO NEW MEXICO PEANUT PRODUCERS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged Congress to approve a key program that would save New Mexico peanut farmers million of dollars. 
   The 2002 farm bill included a provision that covers peanut storage and handling fees for peanut producers. The program expired with last year's crop. The loss of this key peanut program feature would cost peanut growers up to an additional $50 to $60 per ton, which represents at least $74 million to the nation's peanut producers per year. 
   In a letter to Senate appropriators, Bingaman joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in urging that the provision be included in the Iraq supplemental spending bill being negotiated by a Senate-House panel. 
   "Peanuts are a semi-perishable crop, and in order to protect farmers and allow orderly marketing, storage and handling payments are critical for peanut producers. It would be devastating to peanut farmers, if Congress failed to extend this program. Elimination of the program would change the economics of growing peanuts, thereby causing peanut farmers to switch production to other commodities or even go out of business," the letter states. 
   "New Mexico's farmers produce the prized Valencia peanut. More than 90 percent of the nation's Valencia peanuts are grown within 120 miles of Portales. These farmers depend on this program in order to stay competitive," Bingaman said. New Mexico is the tenth largest peanut producing state in the nation. In 2006, the state's crop was 43.2 million pounds with a value of $8.8 million. About 12,000 acres will be planted in peanuts this year. Roosevelt and Lea are the principal peanut producing counties.
