SEN. BINGAMAN OPPOSES GAMING ON FORT SILL APACHE TRIBAL LAND
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today wrote to top federal officials opposing a request by the Fort Sill Apache Tribe of Oklahoma to open a bingo parlor in Akela, New Mexico. Akela is about 38 miles west of Las Cruces.  
   In letters to the National Indian Gaming Commission (NIGC) and to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, Bingaman pointed out that when the Fort Sill Apache Tribe asked that the land be taken into trust it removed "gaming" from the list of potential uses. But the tribe is apparently making preparations to open a bingo parlor on the land even though it has only just begun the process for seeking permission from the NIGC. 
   "In light of the Department of Interior's recent policy regarding off-reservation gaming as well as the specific history in this case, I would request that the Commission consult with Interior on this question and deny the Tribe's request to conduct gaming on the Akela land," Bingaman wrote to NIGC Chairman Philip N. Hogen. 
   In his letters, Bingaman noted that more than a decade ago the tribe had asked that the land be taken into trust for the purpose of gaming, but that when objections were raised by then-Governor Gary Johnson the tribe withdrew that aspect of the request. 
   Bingaman asked Kempthorne to get involved in resolving this matter. 
   "I urge the Department of Interior to fully review the findings associated with the approval of the trust in consideration of the Tribe's stated intent to conduct gaming on the property and to ensure that any decisions relating to off-reservation gaming are consistent with Department of Interior's recent policy decisions on the matter. In addition, I would appreciate clarification as to whether the ongoing construction of a bingo parlor on the Akela land represents a violation of the trust," Bingaman wrote.
