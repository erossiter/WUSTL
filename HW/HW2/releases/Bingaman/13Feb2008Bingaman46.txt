SEN. BINGAMAN JOINS BUSH AT WHITE HOUSE FOR SIGNING OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS BILL
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today joined President Bush at a White House ceremony celebrating the enactment of legislation designed to aid the economy. Bingaman serves on the Senate Finance Committee, which helped craft the legislation.  
   The new law authorizes "stimulus checks" ranging from $300 for a single taxpayer to $1,200 for married couples. Some families also will qualify for a $300 per child credit. There are also provisions to assist businesses that are losing money in this economic downturn. 
   "This is not a perfect bill, but I hope it will provide the kind of stimulus that will help turn around our ailing economy," Bingaman said.
