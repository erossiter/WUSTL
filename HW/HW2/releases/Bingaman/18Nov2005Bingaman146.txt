SEN. BINGAMAN MEASURE SAVES ROSWELL AIRPORT FUNDS
  Congress today gave final approval to a proposal written by Sen.  
 Jeff Bingaman that prevents Roswell International Air Center (RIAC) from losing most of its federal grant funding. Bingaman's amendment was attached to the fiscal year 2006 Transportation Appropriations Act which is on its way to the president for signature.
   Currently "primary airports"- airports with 10,000 passenger boardings or more a year - receive a $1 million grant from the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Airport Improvement Program (AIP). Airports with less than 10,000 annual boardings receive just $150,000. However, for the passed two years, Congress has allowed former "primary airports" - such as RIAC - that suffered a drop below the 10,000 threshold due to the effects of 9/11 to retain their full $1 million grant level. 
   Unfortunately, based on preliminary boarding data for 2004, there are still about 45 primary airports, including RIAC, that have not yet regained their previous boarding levels. As a result these airports were scheduled to receive $150,000, instead of the $1 million they had previously been awarded.
   Bingaman's amendment ensures that RIAC will receive $500,000, instead of getting cut to $150,000.
   "The Roswell International Air Center counts on federal funding to help keep it in good shape, and I'm glad to see that the federal government will be making a substantial investment in the airport next year," Bingaman said. 
   Without Bingaman's amendment Roswell's funding would have dropped for 2006 and would have affected the planned upgrade of the shoulders at the airport's 13,000-foot main runway (3-21). That project is expected to cost $4.5 million.
   Senator Pete Domenici was a co-sponsor of Bingaman's amendment.
