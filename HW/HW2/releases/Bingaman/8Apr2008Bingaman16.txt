SEN. BINGAMAN MEETS WITH MEXICAN AMBASSADOR, FOREIGN MINISTER TO DISCUSS BORDER ISSUES
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today held his second meeting in the past few weeks with top level Mexican officials to discuss border issues. 
   Bingaman met today with Mexico's Foreign Minister Patricia Espinosa and Mexican Ambassador Arturo Sarukhan in his Capitol Hill office. Bingaman told them he appreciated Mexico's recent efforts to reduce violence in the border region and discussed ways to prevent future flare ups.
   "I'm glad that Mexico is working hard to reduce drug-related violence in Mexico. The goal now is to ensure that violence doesn't escalate a few weeks or months down the road," Bingaman said. "There are steps we can take together, such as stemming the flow of guns and drugs between our two countries, and I appreciated the opportunity to discuss some of those ideas with Foreign Minister Espinosa and Ambassador Sarukhan."
   Bingaman also thanked Espinosa and Sarukhan for Mexico's decision to allow American ranchers to resume exporting beef cattle to Mexico. Mexico barred live cattle imports in 2003 when an isolated case of "mad cow" disease was detected in a Canadian-born dairy cow in the state of Washington. In 2006 Mexico's ban on dairy heifers was lifted. Mexico's decision last month meant that New Mexico ranchers could resume exporting live beef cattle, as well.
   Last month, Bingaman met with Sarukhan and Mexico's Attorney General Eduardo Medina-Mora to raise serious concerns about the number of deaths along the U.S.-Mexico border. Shortly after the meeting, Mexico announced its comprehensive plan to reduce border violence in the state of Chihuahua.
