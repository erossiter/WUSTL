SEN. BINGAMAN ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S NOMINATION OF HARRIET MIERS TO SURPREME COURT
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statement on the nomination of Harriet Miers to the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "Since Sandra Day O'Connor announced her retirement earlier this year, I have said I hoped the president would nominate a moderate - someone whose views are generally consistent with those of Justice O'Connor's on the application of laws guaranteeing the rights of women, minorities, and disabled people. It's unclear to me whether Harriet Miers is that person. 
   "We don't know where Ms. Miers stands on many issues, and due to her lack of prior judicial experience, she doesn't have much of a record the Senate can review. This makes her testimony before the Judiciary Committee, and the White House's willingness to turn over relevant documents, all the more important. Before I can decide whether or not I support her, I would like to find out as much as possible about whether her views are in the mainstream of judicial philosophy."
