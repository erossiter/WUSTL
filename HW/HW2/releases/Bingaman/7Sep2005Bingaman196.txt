LAS CRUCES TO BENEFIT FROM BINGAMAN SECURED TRANSIT FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) is releasing $1.87 million for a transit facility in Las Cruces.  
 The funding was secured by Bingaman in a 2002 spending bill.
   "With high gas prices, public transit is now more important than ever," Bingaman said. "I am pleased that we are making an investment in the city's public transportation system." 
   In July the city picked a vacant parcel of state-owned land on the southwest corner of Alameda Blvd. and Lohman Ave. as a possible location for the transit facility. When complete, the facility will be home to many of the city's buses, shuttles, taxies and other transportation vehicles.
