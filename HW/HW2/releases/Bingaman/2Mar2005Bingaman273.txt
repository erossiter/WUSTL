SEN. BINGAMAN ASKS FOREST SERVICE TO BUILD NEW ?CACHE' IN SILVER CITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today urged the Forest Service to get behind his effort to have a new fire cache built in Grant County. 
   In an Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing today to discuss the White House's proposed 2006 Forest Service budget, Bingaman asked Forest Service Chief Bosworth to make building a new fire cache in Silver City a priority. Bingaman visited the existing cache two years ago and was disappointed to learn that it was a patchwork of old storage sheds, trailers and sheet metal garages. 
  "The fire cache in use is totally inadequate. Replacing it should be a Forest Service priority," Bingaman said. "I have raised this issue for a couple years now, and the Forest Service has promised to look into it. I hope that this year, the agency will agree to resolve this problem." 
  Bingaman said he supports the construction of a warehouse of sufficient size to hold the supplies needed. He also said he believes this new building would ultimately save the Forest Service money in labor, shipping, and maintenance costs. 
  Bosworth committed to Bingaman that he would look into the matter.
  Bingaman also voiced concern about the lack of funding by the Bush administration has committed to the Valles Caldera National Preserve. The White House proposed setting aside just $992,000 for the preserve in 2006, despite the fact that there are significant infrastructure needs, such as an integrated road and trails system, a visitor facility, and interpretive signs to name just a few. 
  "This White House has never funded the Valles Caldera in a way that will allow the ranch to become self-sustaining, which is a goal of the law that created the preserve," Bingaman said. "It's time to commit adequate resources to the ranch so that New Mexicans and others can enjoy the full benefits of having this property in public ownership."
