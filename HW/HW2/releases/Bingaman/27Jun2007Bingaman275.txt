SEN. BINGAMAN: JEMEZ MOUNTAIN PUBLIC SCHOOL AWARDED FEDERAL FUNDS
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today announced that Jemez Mountain Public Schools has been awarded a federal grant for a program to help recruit teachers to the area. 
   Jemez Mountain will receive $763,148 to implement a project that would help recruit, support and retain qualified teachers to serve in high need schools. The project will serve schools on the Navajo Nation, the Jicarilla Apache Reservation and in rural New Mexico.
   "Bringing quality teachers to high needs schools will help ensure New Mexico students are prepared for success," Bingaman said. "This funding will develop strategies to increase the number of highly qualified teachers in rural parts of the state."
   Funding was awarded through the U.S. Department of Education's Transition to Teaching Program.
