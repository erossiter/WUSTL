SEN. BINGAMAN: USDA COLONIA GRANT TO BENEFIT GRANT COUNTY COMMUNITY
  Sen. Jeff Bingaman today reported that residents of the Village of Santa Clara in Grant county will benefit from a $1.433 million grant from the federal government for upgrades to it's water and sewer system. 
   "Water and wastewater projects are needed to meet our state's basic health needs. The funds awarded today will help the Village of Santa Clara make many needed improvements to it's wastewater collection system and allow them to continue providing clean and safe drinking water to the community at a reasonable rate," Bingaman said.
  The funds awarded today to the Village of Santa Clara will be used to build a new well at the Twin Sisters Infiltration Gallery, realign the Ridge Crest Mobile Home Park water and sewer line, renovate the sewer mains that run north and south between Oak St. and Church St. in the alley between Prescott and Bayard and replace the water main along Bayard between U.S. Highway 180 and Oak St.
   The grant provided for this project comes from a U.S. Department of Agriculture program aimed at improving conditions in colonias by funding water and wastewater projects. Unfortunately, the Bush administration has proposed slashing funding to help colonias with water and waste water programs to $11.8 million from $25 million. New Mexico's share would go from about $7.8 million to $3.8 million next year.
