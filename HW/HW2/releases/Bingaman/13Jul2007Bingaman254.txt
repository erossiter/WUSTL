SEN. BINGAMAN: TWO NEW MEXICO AIRPORTS TO BENEFIT FROM FEDERAL FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the Clovis and Raton airports will benefit from federal funds being awarded through the U.S. Department of Transportation.  
   Bingaman said the Clovis Municipal Airport will receive $240,000 to fund the design of the proposed 1,800 ft. northeast extension to runway 4/22. The extension will make it possible for the airport to accommodate larger aircraft and upgrade its commercial air service. 
   "Upgrading the Clovis airport to handle larger aircraft is vital to preparing the community for Cannon's new mission," Bingaman said. 
   Clovis will receive an additional $40,000 to improve the airport's instrument landing system. 
   Raton's Municipal/Crews Field Airport will receive $189,679 to design an extension to runway 2/20. 
   "New Mexico communities benefit greatly from their airports. Unfortunately, they can be costly to improve. These funds will help make a needed upgrade to the Raton airport," Bingaman said.
