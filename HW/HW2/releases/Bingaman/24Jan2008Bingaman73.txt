SEN. BINGAMAN SEEKS FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AID IN KEEPING AIR SERVICE IN GALLUP
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today asked the top U.S. Department of Transportation official to help ensure Gallup is able to maintain commercial air service.  
   Last year Bingaman helped ensure that the Gallup airport had Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screeners in place, so that Great Lakes Air was able to provide service to Denver and Phoenix. Great Lakes is being subsidized with a one-time $600,000 grant under DOT's Small Community Air Service Development Program. 
   In a letter today, Bingaman asked Transportation Secretary Mary E. Peters to provide financial assistance to Gallup when the grant expires in July. 
   "Gallup is the center of commerce, mining and other energy-related industries for western New Mexico and eastern Arizona. In addition, the capital of the Navajo Nation is located in nearby Window Rock, Arizona. Because of Gallup's location at large distances from major urban centers, loss of commercial air service could hurt the city's efforts to expand existing industries and promote economic development," Bingaman wrote. 
   Bingaman suggested one possible source of funding could come from a provision in law that allows the secretary to help compensate an air carrier for service to a community that is not otherwise part of the Department's Basic Essential Air Service Program. Bingaman pointed out that Congress recently gave that program a $15 million boost over last year. He also reported to the secretary that the City of Gallup has $400,000 in local and state matching funds to help subsidize air service. 
   "I will work closely with the Department of Transportation and Secretary Peters to find ways to help the City of Gallup maintain commercial air service," Bingaman said.
