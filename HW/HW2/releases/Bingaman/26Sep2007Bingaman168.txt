SEN. BINGAMAN: DOT PICKS NEW MEXICO AIRLINES TO PROVIDE AIR SERVICE TO ALAMOGORDO
  U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has selected New Mexico Airlines (Pacific Wings) to provide air service to Alamogordo.  
   Under the agreement, New Mexico Airlines' proposal would provide 12 weekly nonstop round trips to the Albuquerque International Sunport under the Essential Air Service program for an annual subsidy rate of $994,623. 
   "Air service is vital to Otero County, especially given that it is home to Holloman Air Force Base and White Sands Missile Range. I am pleased DOT took quick action to ensure service was not lost," Bingaman said. 
   Mesa Airlines, which is currently serving Alamogordo, announced in May it would terminate service. New Mexico Airlines will coordinate with Mesa on a transition and will begin service as soon as possible. 
   The City of Alamogordo had urged DOT to choose New Mexico Air to replace Mesa.
