SEN. BINGAMAN CELEBRATES UNVEILING OF PO'PAY STATUE
  "I'm pleased to be joined here today by so many distinguished New Mexicans who have traveled so far to be here.  
 I am proud to be here at the unveiling of the 100th statue in the National Statuary Hall collection.
   "This sculpture, by Cliff Fragua of Jemez Pueblo, is quite remarkable. I believe Po'Pay is an excellent choice for our second New Mexico statue. It joins that of Senator Dennis Chavez, another man of vision, leadership and courage.
   "As the leader of the pueblo revolt, Po'Pay was said to be a humble man who was deeply rooted in the culture and traditions of his pueblo, San Juan.
   "When the pueblo way of life was seriously threatened, Po'pay brought together the leaders of many Pueblos and led the revolt that ensured their continued survival. In doing so, he preserved and strengthened the Pueblo heritage for future generations, bridging the rich Pueblo and Spanish cultures of the Southwest.
   "This statue will serve as a reminder for generations to come of his leadership and bravery. It will also reminds us of the contributions Po'pay made to what New Mexico is today - a wonderfully diverse state, rich in culture, tradition and spirit. 
   "We owe a debt of gratitude to the vision of many pueblo leaders, the New Mexico Statuary Hall Commission and Foundation, and the New Mexico legislature for bringing us to where we are today."
