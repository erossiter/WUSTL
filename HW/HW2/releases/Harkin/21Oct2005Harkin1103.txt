          Baseball fans young and old all across the country know the story of Shoeless Joe and recognize him as a legend who gave his all to baseball  He was truly one of the greatest players of all time     said Harkin     Shoeless Joe s record as a star player on the baseball field is unquestionable  His efforts helped make baseball America s favorite past time  It is long past due that Shoeless Joe be recognized for giving his all to the game                 Joe Jackson batted  408 in his rookie year  a feat which has never been equaled   He has the third highest batting average of all time  behind only Ty Cobb and Rogers Hornsby   Over a 10 year period  he never hit below  300   His fielding skills in the outfield are also legendary   His glove was named   the place where triples go to die      Babe Ruth once said of Shoeless Joe    I copied Jackson  s style because I thought he was the greatest hitter I had ever seen  the greatest natural hitter I ever saw  He s the guy who made me a hitter                 In 1920   Shoeless Joe  and seven other members of the Chicago Black Sox were accused of accepting bribes to throw the 1919 World Series against Cincinnati Reds  A Chicago jury acquitted Shoeless Joe of any wrongdoing in the 1919 Chicago Black Sox World Series scandal  However  without any hearings or investigations Major League Baseball Commissioner Judge Kenesaw   Mountain    Landis proceeded to ban Shoeless Joe Jackson from playing baseball for the rest of his life               After Harkin first sponsored a resolution in 1999  Baseball Commissioner Alan  Bud  Selig agreed to review the Shoeless Joe case to consider whether or not the baseball player can be reinstated to baseball thereby paving the way for Jackson s induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame   However  it has been six years since that investigation began  with no resolution                 Tomorrow  the Chicago White Sox will make their first appearance in the World Series since 1959     said Harkin     It was Shoeless Joe who led the White Sox to their last World Series Championship in 1917   I urge Commissioner Selig to step up to the plate and finally recognize Shoeless Joe for his outstanding accomplishments in baseball                 The story of Shoeless Joe was portrayed in the movie  Field of Dreams   which was filmed primarily in Dyersville  Iowa  The movie has drawn many Iowans to embrace the story of Shoeless Joe             RESOLUTION       Expressing the sense of the Senate that Joseph Jefferson   Shoeless Joe   Jackson should be appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball accomplishments           Whereas Joseph Jefferson   Shoeless Joe    Jackson  a native of Greenville  South Carolina  and a local legend  began his professional career and received his nickname while playing baseball for the Greenville Spinners in 1908               Whereas   Shoeless Joe    Jackson moved to the Philadelphia Athletics for his major league debut in 1908  to the Cleveland Naps in 1910  and to the Chicago White Sox in 1915               Whereas   Shoeless Joe    Jackson  s accomplishments throughout his 13 year career in professional baseball were outstanding  he was 1 of only 7 Major League Baseball players to ever top the coveted mark of a  400 batting average for a season  and he earned a lifetime batting average of  356  the third highest of all time               Whereas   Shoeless Joe    Jackson  s career record makes him 1 of our Nation  s top baseball players of all time               Whereas in 1919  the infamous   Black Sox    scandal erupted when an employee of a New York gambler allegedly bribed 8 players of the Chicago White Sox  including Joseph Jefferson   Shoeless Joe    Jackson  to lose the first and second games of the 1919 World Series to the Cincinnati Reds                Whereas in September 1920  a criminal court acquitted   Shoeless Joe    Jackson of the charge that he conspired to lose the 1919 World Series                Whereas despite the acquittal  Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis  baseball  s first commissioner  banned   Shoeless Joe    Jackson from playing Major League Baseball for life without conducting any investigation of Jackson  s alleged activities  issuing a summary punishment that fell far short of due process standards                Whereas the evidence shows that Jackson did not deliberately misplay during the 1919 World Series in an attempt to make his team lose the World Series               Whereas during the 1919 World Series  Jackson  s play was outstanding  his batting average was  375  the highest of any player from either team   he set a World Series record with 12 hits  he committed no errors  and he hit the only home run of the series               Whereas because of his lifetime ban from Major League Baseball    Shoeless Joe    Jackson has been excluded from consideration for admission to the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame               Whereas   Shoeless Joe    Jackson died in 1951  after fully serving his lifetime ban from baseball  and 85 years have elapsed since the 1919 World Series scandal erupted                Whereas Major League Baseball Commissioner Bud Selig took an important first step toward restoring the reputation of   Shoeless Joe    Jackson by agreeing to investigate whether he was involved in a conspiracy to alter the outcome of the 1919 World Series and whether he should be eligible for inclusion in the Major League Baseball Hall of Fame               Whereas it has been 6 years since Commissioner Selig initiated his investigation of   Shoeless Joe     but there has been no resolution               Whereas the Chicago White Sox are the 2005 American League Champions  and will compete in the World Series for the first time since 1959               Whereas   Shoeless Joe    Jackson helped lead the Chicago White Sox to their last World Series Championship in 1917  and              Whereas it is appropriate for Major League Baseball to remove the taint upon the memory of   Shoeless Joe    Jackson and honor his outstanding baseball accomplishments  Now  therefore  be it               Resolved  That it is the sense of the Senate that Joseph Jefferson   Shoeless Joe    Jackson should be appropriately honored for his outstanding baseball accomplishments
