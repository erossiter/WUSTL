        I voted today against the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act because this bill fails to truly address the energy problems facing this country and is bad policy   First  this bill was a grab for coastal states at the expense of states like Iowa   Under this legislation  revenue from 37 percent of revenue from leases on land that belongs to all Americans will go to four coastal states   This is a sweetheart deal for a few states but it hurts the rest of the country   As President Truman said    minerals off America  s coast belong to the federal government    that is all the people in this country     But not under this bill and that is a bad precedent to set            Fossil fuels are an essential component of our nation  s energy infrastructure and I support appropriate steps to build our supply and use   I have repeatedly called for construction of the Alaska natural gas pipeline  which would provide roughly forty times the amount of gas that can be recovered through the plan passed by the Senate today  And I voted for last year  s energy bill which contained numerous incentives and provisions for the development of fossil fuels               The Senate today  however  endorsed a   drilling only   plan and failed to take up any comprehensive plan to address America  s energy problems   We need an aggressive and continuing effort to promote conservation and to ramp up renewable energy   I was prepared to offer amendments that would have increased renewable fuels production and availability for America  s driving public   I also would have cosponsored a measure with Senator Obama  D IL  that would have increased gas mileage in America  s automobiles    Unfortunately  procedural maneuvering was used to block any amendments from being offered to improve this bill                The Senate should have a real debate about the challenges facing America  s energy security and how best to address them   It  s unfortunate we missed an opportunity to do so today                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
