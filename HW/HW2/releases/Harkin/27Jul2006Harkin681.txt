      WASHINGTON D C      Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  released the following statement today concerning the resumption of U S  beef exports to Japan            This is encouraging news for America  s cattle producers and beef processors   It is  however   long  overdue   U S  beef producers have been shut out of the Japanese market since late 2003  except for a brief one month window in early 2006              I  m concerned that the understanding between the U S  and Japanese governments only includes beef from cattle 20 months of age and younger   I hope we can expand trade further  using science   based international guidelines  It  s important that Japanese consumers understand that American beef is safe   By all accounts  the level of BSE in the United States is very low and additional safeguards are in place to protect the beef supply              From what I understand  under this agreement  Japan can still re impose its ban on U S  beef at its own discretion  much like what happened in January where one violating facility cost the entire U S  beef industry access to a valuable customer   We still need to agree on a framework that will help avoid similar messes in the future   USDA must now ensure all exporters know what  s expected of them and how to avoid shipments of prohibited material in the future                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
