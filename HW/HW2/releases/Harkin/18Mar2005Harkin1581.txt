        I have long been an advocate for the rights of people with disabilities   Many in that community are keenly aware of the risk of incapacitation  In such cases  I believe that every precaution should be taken to learn and respect their desires regarding the removal of life supports            Over the last week  I have been working hard  and in good faith with Senator Mel Martinez  R FL   Senator Rick Santorum  R PA   and others to come up with legislation that would allow federal review of the Terri Schiavo case   Yesterday afternoon  we came up with bipartisan measure that did just that and many of my Senate Republican and Democratic colleagues deserve praise for their hard and swift work            Unfortunately  the House Republican Leadership refused to take up the bill before sending members home for a two week vacation   There is no excuse for stalling a matter of such an urgent and life threatening nature   They are solely responsible for the consequences Ms  Schiavo and her family now face  as well as for today  s unfortunate events   Congressional action is this area should be based on respect for the wishes and dignity of those who are incapacitated              It is my belief that people with disabilities and those who are incapacitated deserve the utmost dignity and respect   I plan to continue to work with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give cases like this an opportunity for further review in federal courts               30             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
