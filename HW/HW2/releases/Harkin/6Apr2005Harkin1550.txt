        And yet as I look at the President  s budget for FY06  it  s with a sense of disappointment   Congress didn  t intend to double NIH  s funding so we could cut it to the bone from then on out   But that seems to be the President  s plan            His budget would provide the smallest percentage increase for NIH since 1970    just 0 5 percent   The total number of grants would drop by 402   And most importantly  the success rate for new and competing grants would fall to 21 percent   That  s the lowest percentage for as far back as NIH still has records            Our scientists have just mapped the human genome   This should be the golden age of medical research   Scientists should be flocking to this field   It  s the wrong time to hold the NIH budget basically flat            I  m also troubled by other developments   Top researchers are leaving NIH  and recruitment is suffering  because of the new conflict of interest regulations   While I strongly support restrictions on outside compensation  I  m concerned that the new regulations go too far  especially when it comes to requiring employees to divest stocks that they  ve had for many years            Meanwhile  the administration  s outdated policy on stem cells is making NIH increasingly irrelevant in one of the most exciting areas of research today   California is pouring  300 million into stem cell research  while NIH is spending less than one tenth of that amount   Inevitably  researchers will look to individual States for direction on stem cell research instead of to the NIH   That  s an unfortunate precedent            Nevertheless  NIH remains the greatest biomedical research institution in the world   Our federally funded scientists are on the front lines in the war against cancer  heart disease  diabetes  avian flu  and a host of other diseases that continue to reduce our quality of life   To me  there is no higher priority in this appropriations bill than funding NIH at an adequate level                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
