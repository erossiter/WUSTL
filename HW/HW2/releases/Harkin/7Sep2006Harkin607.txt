        Mr  President  the Senate should not have to debate the need to replace Donald Rumsfeld as Secretary of Defense   If the Bush administration believed in accountability  if it believed in performance standards  if believed in demanding competence from senior officials  Mr  Rumsfeld would have been dismissed long ago   Instead  as disaster has followed disaster  and as Iraq has descended first into guerilla war and then into civil war  Mr  Rumsfeld has been allowed to cling to his job                   For the record  I was the first United States Senator to call for Mr  Rumsfeld  s resignation   I did so nearly two and a half years ago  on May 6  2004  in response to the revelations about torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib   As I said then    For the good of our country  the safety of our troops  and our image around the globe  Secretary Rumsfeld should resign   If he does not resign forthwith  the President should fire him                      However  the scandal at Abu Ghraib is by no means the only disaster that can be traced directly to Mr  Rumsfeld   This Secretary of Defense has become virtually synonymous with disastrous decision making   The litany of his catastrophic mistakes is familiar to every United States Senator                     Before the invasion of Iraq  Mr  Rumsfeld sidelined Gen  Eric Shinseki  then Army Chief of Staff  for daring to state that hundreds of thousands of troops would be needed to secure Iraq   Instead  Mr  Rumsfeld insisted on going to war   on the cheap     with the bare minimum number of troops needed to overthrow Saddam                 Mr  Rumsfeld gave no thought to securing the country after Saddam  s fall   Indeed  he threw out the State Department  s plan for restoring order   It was Mr  Rumsfeld who dismissed the post war anarchy with the phrase   stuff happens                     He was complicit in the decision to disband the Iraqi army  which fed the chaos and drove many former Iraqi soldiers into the arms of the insurgency                    Again and again  he refused to increase U S  troop strength to a level that would allow law and order to be restored in Iraq                  He gave the green light to abusive practices that led to the scandal at Abu Ghraib                 He dismissed the insurgency as the work of a just a few   dead enders    who would soon be routed                    He failed to adequately equip our Armed Forces in Iraq  including basic items such as body armor and fortified Humvees                  Most recently  just last week  Mr  Rumsfeld lashed out at critics of the war in Iraq   He accused them of   moral and intellectual confusion     and of appeasing   a new type of fascism      This is the same Donald Rumsfeld who visited Baghdad in 1983  and was photographed warmly shaking hand with Saddam Hussein   He had been sent on that mission to court Saddam Hussein  and to communicate the Reagan administration  s desire to help the Iraqi dictator in his war against Iran   Mr  Rumsfeld went on that mission after Saddam Hussein had committed mass murders  and after he had used chemical weapons to gas Iraqi Kurds and Iranians   Mr  Rumsfeld is the last person to be preaching about   moral and intellectual confusion                      Mr  President  the litany of Donald Rumsfeld  s mistakes and misjudgments goes on and on and on and on   He has become almost a legend in his own time as a Secretary of Defense who has been catastrophically wrong again and again  but who arrogantly refuses to acknowledge any mistakes                     Earlier this year  when Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said that the U S  had made   tactical errors    in Iraq  Mr  Rumsfeld dismissed her  too   He said    If someone says  well  that  s a tactical mistake  then I guess it  s a lack of understanding of what warfare is about                  Well  maybe we should listen to those who truly do understand what warfare is about   Maybe we should listen to the generals                    In early April  Lieutenant General Greg Newbold  the former director of operations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff  wrote in Time magazine that the invasion of Iraq   was done with a casualness and swagger that are the special provenance of those who have never had to execute these missions    or bury the results      He added    The cost of flawed leadership continues to be paid in blood                     About the same time  Major General John Baptiste  who commanded the 1st Infantry Division in Iraq in 2004 and 2005  said     I believe we need a fresh start at the Pentagon       We need leadership up there that respects the military as they expect the military to respect them                          Marine General Anthony Zinni  the former chief of U S  Central Command  has accused Mr  Rumsfeld and his civilian advisers of   dereliction of duty    in failing to prepare adequately for war                    Mr  President  the remarkable thing about the debacle in Iraq is that nobody    aside from a few privates and sergeants    has been held accountable or dismissed   The four co architects of the Iraq debacle    Paul Wolfowitz  George Tenet  General Tommy Franks  and Paul Bremmer    have all been rewarded with the Medal of Freedom   Donald Rumsfeld has been rewarded with continued tenure as Secretary of Defense                    Meanwhile  our enterprise in Iraq continues to descend deeper and deeper into chaos and violence   And who is surprised by this   The same Secretary of Defense whose decisions created the quagmire in Iraq is still in office  still in charge  still making the key decisions   It boggles the mind   I  m reminded of the definition of insanity as doing the same thing again and again  and expecting a different result   Well  we have the same disastrous civilian leadership in place over at the Pentagon   Why should we expect anything but the same  disastrous results                  Mr  President  I saw a bumper sticker the other day that said    Support our troops  not poor leadership      I agree   Our soldiers and Marines on the ground in Iraq are putting their lives on the line every day   They are trying their best to salvage some kind of positive outcome in Iraq   They deserve our respect and our support   They also deserve competent civilian leadership                       Donald Rumsfeld ought to have the decency to step aside and allow for fresh leadership at the Pentagon   Instead  he stubbornly refuses to admit any error  he stubbornly refuses to change course  and he stubbornly refuses to go                     This is unacceptable  and it is time for the Senate to go on record saying that it is unacceptable   That  s what this amendment is all about   It  s about holding Mr  Rumsfeld accountable for his tragic mistakes   It  s about giving our troops the credible  competent civilian leadership they deserve   And it  s about charting a new course in Iraq  and also in the war against the terrorists who attacked us on September 11  2001                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter
