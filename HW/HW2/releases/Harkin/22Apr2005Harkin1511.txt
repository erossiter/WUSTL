      President Bush  s privatization commission has proposed creating private Social Security accounts that would cut benefits by one third or more  even for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts   Workers could invest two thirds of their Social Security contribution in stocks and bonds  but those returns could not make up for the deep benefit cuts and would be subject to the whims of Wall Street            Even many supporters of the president  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved          WHO           Senator Tom Harkin         WHAT         Fix It  Don  t Nix It Social Security Forum          WHEN         3 45 PM                           Saturday  April 23         WHERE       Mason City Public Library              225 2nd Street SE              Mason City                                          I want to work with the president to strengthen Social Security  but I want to do it right     Harkin said     There is no excuse to rush into a plan that will cut benefits for America  s seniors  adds trillions to the debt  and does nothing to strengthen the program   Millions of Iowa seniors  Americans with disabilities and others who rely on Social Security are depending on Congress and the president to protect this program                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
