      Today  s hearing covers the implementation of two programs that promote conservation on lands in agricultural production  the Conservation Security Program  CSP  and the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP    This hearing will examine the choices that have been made in implementing these programs and whether they are working as intended and delivering maximum environmental benefits              The Conservation Security Program was one of my initiatives in the 2002 farm bill   The objective is to pay farmers and ranchers for the environmental goods they produce    to pay them not for what they grow  but for the benefits of how they grow it   Conservation and environmental benefits produced from land in production have value to society  just as commodities do              On the positive side  CSP is up and running in all 50 states  with a high level of producer interest   On the other side  CSP has been compromised in two ways   dedicated funding has been taken away in appropriations and the budget reconciliation bills  and USDA regulations have distorted what we enacted in a way that excludes many of the producers we intended the program to benefit  and fails to maximize the conservation benefits CSP has the potential to provide              For the first time ever  in 2003 Congress offset the cost of natural disaster assistance by cutting a mandatory program in the farm bill   We would never consider telling Louisiana that the cost of recovery for New Orleans would come out of their state  s highway funds  or tell California that rebuilding after an earthquake would mean we would reduce other federal spending in their state   We must never accept taking conservation funds to pay for disaster assistance              Rather than the nationwide program we enacted  the program has been limited to just 12 6  of the watersheds in the continental United States   Even in those watersheds  many producers who would be willing to adopt better conservation practices are largely excluded   The Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS  has chosen to give priority to farmers who have already adopted conserving practices and exclude those who need cost share and transitional funding in order to adopt those practices              This hearing will examine whether these choices by NRCS are consistent with the program created in the 2002 farm bill  and whether they are the best way to achieve the maximum conservation benefits with the available funds for the program              We will also examine the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  which provides cost share and incentive payments for conservation   A September  2006 report by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  identified significant questions about the funding allocation formula used to allocate the annual funding to the states  particularly whether the factors in the allocation formula are closely tied to the program objectives    improving conservation on land in agricultural production    and supported by the best available data   It is important that these EQIP funds are allocated to match the conservation needs our country faces              The backlog of applications for EQIP funds varies widely from state to state    in 2005  the last year for which figures are available  according to the NRCS website  the percentage of unfunded applications for EQIP varied from 7 4 percent in Hawaii to over 73 percent in New Jersey   In Iowa  over 60 percent of all applications were turned down   Georgia had over 38 percent of all applications go unfunded   To me  this suggests that the problems identified with the allocation formula may be resulting in many good conservation projects going unfunded   This hearing will consider the EQIP allocation issue  and look at how both of these programs are functioning to promote good conservation practices on working land                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
