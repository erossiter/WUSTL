      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing to look at the role of U S  agriculture in the control and eradication of avian influenza   We  re all aware of the human aspects of this disease  but there has not been as much attention to the threat of avian flu to agriculture   If this disease comes to the United States via birds    and not by humans  as some experts fear    we will still have a problem on our hands   A widespread avian flu outbreak in poultry will not only be costly to producers  states  and the federal government in controlling and eradicating the disease  but avian flu in our poultry has the ability to instill fear in American consumers   And in agriculture  that can be more devastating to the industry than the disease itself                  Poultry is an important part of agriculture in Chariman Chambliss  s state of Georgia and my state of Iowa   Iowa is the nation  s top producer of eggs and its 10th largest turkey producer   I would like to welcome Gretta Irwin from the Iowa Turkey Federation   She brings Iowa  s perspective on avian flu and how the industry is preparing for it   Iowa produces the most hogs of any state   Pigs are another animal that factor into a discussion of avian flu because swine can contract both the avian flu virus and the human flu virus   Many experts have said that swine is the mixing vessel that can lead to a pandemic  as both viruses can co exist in pigs and transform into a virus that can readily infect humans   Nevertheless  I would like this panel to address issues of surveillance between species and how we are linking that up   We need to build better surveillance capacity for animal health in general  and find the best way to inform producers of various animal species what diseases are where in order to avoid cross species virus transmission               Another concern I have is how we will help local and state officials in the event of a flu outbreak in poultry or any other animal disease or biosecurity crisis for that matter   State departments of agriculture play a critical role in controlling and eradicating a deadly animal disease such as avian flu   Funding is needed for surge capacity in laboratories for rapid diagnosis of large quantities of samples  to protect first responders from animal diseases that can be contracted by humans  and for interstate coordination of response plans   State and local officials also must be adequately informed about federal indemnification programs to make producers aware of resources available to them   All of these needs come at a time when the federal government does not provide enough financial resources to states                   Today  s hearing will highlight the crucial role that agriculture plays in the management of this deadly disease   If we tackle the disease at its root  we may never have a human disease problem   However  should avian flu reach our shores via birds  we will have a serious economic problem on our hands  and somewhat greater risk to humans  although fear will be far greater than actual risk   Americans eat more chicken than any other meat   Our poultry industry is valued at over  25 billion  and our poultry exports are valued at over  1 7 billion   Other countries would quickly close their markets to our poultry and poultry products upon the discovery of this disease in the United States   But more frightening is the potential rejection of U S  poultry by American consumers   Recently  Dr  David Swayne  a scientist at the U S  Department of Agriculture  s Southeast Poultry Research Laboratory  stated if the virulent H5N1 strain of avian flu was found in the United States  poultry demand would drop by as much as 50 percent   Yes  the United States has had some experience with avian influenza  but we have never had experience with an animal disease that can cause this much consumer fear    I hope that today we can cover issues that not only will help us prevent  control  and eradicate this disease  but that will also help us respond and recover from what could potentially be a tremendous blow to our economy                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
