 WASHINGTON  D C   A longtime advocate for workers rights  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation to ensure that home care workers receive the same minimum wage and overtime protections as most other domestic workers do  The Fair Home Health Care Act of 2007 extends the protections of the Fair Labor Standards Act  FLSA  to home care workers to ensure these caregivers receive fair pay   As America faces a shortage of qualified home care workers  this new legislation will help to meet Americans growing demand for home based health care by protecting those who provide it  This bill is co sponsored by Senator Ted Kennedy  D MA   Chairman of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee  as well as Senators Patty Murray  D WA   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Maria Cantwell  D WA   Bob Casey  D PA   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Christopher Dodd  D CT   Barack Obama  D IL   and Chuck Schumer  D NY    Older Americans and people with disabilities are requiring help at home now more than ever  creating a high demand for qualified domestic care workers  Senator Harkin said  Our bill allows these employees to do their jobs under the same rules that cover others  This is not only the fair thing to do  but it is the smart and necessary action we need to ensure that Americans have first rate care   The Fair Home Health Care Act will end the exploitation of home care workers who have been denied federal minimum wage and overtime protections for too long  Senator Kennedy said  Guaranteeing fair pay for these workers will help them support their own families and encourage them to provide the best possible home care that millions of Americans depend on   All home care workers who are employed by a home care agency  work more than 20 hours a week  or perform home care on a regular basis would be covered by the Fair Home Health Care Act  This bill is being introduced to fix a Supreme Court ruling in June that upheld a Department of Labor regulation that stated that home health care workers are not protected by the FLSA  which was expanded to cover most domestic workers in 1974   The need to ensure home care workers are treated fairly unites two issues that are very close to my heart  independence and the quality of life for seniors and people with disabilities  and the basic rights of American workers to premium pay for overtime work  Harkin said  Both service providers and the people that they serve agree  no one is served well when home care workers are not paid a living wage  Seniors and people with disabilities deserve continuous relationships with home care aides that they can trust to deliver the care that they need   Currently  more than one million home care workers in the United States provide physically and emotionally demanding and often life sustaining care for the elderly and disabled in their homes  Eighty six percent of direct care workers turn over every year  Almost 90 percent of homecare workers are women  and they are predominantly minority women  making an average of just  9 an hour       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
