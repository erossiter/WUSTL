    WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that he included two key provisions to help former Iowa Army Ammunition Plant  IAAP  workers in the FY 06 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education  LHHS  appropriations bill   Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the LHHS Appropriations Subcommittee               While many former IAAP workers and their families are finally receiving compensation  there are many more who still need help     said Harkin     These workers helped protect our nation and deserve nothing less   By working to expand the special exposure cohort  we can ensure that workers who have cancer from radiation exposure will receive the help they need                  In 2005 after years of effort by former workers  advocates and government officials  former IAAP workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers were included in the Special Exposure Cohort  SEC    This entitled them to receive  150 000 in automatic compensation   Approximately two thirds of the eligible families have received this funding                 The first provision Harkin included would direct the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety  NIOSH  to prepare a report recommending other types of cancer likely related to work with radioactive materials that should be added to the 22 that already fall under the SEC   This would make it possible for additional workers with radiation related cancers to be included in the SEC              Harkin  s second provision requires that the NIOSH Advisory Board on Worker and Radiation Health receive an additional  4 5 million this year   The Advisory Board  s work was critical in proving that IAAP plant records were insufficient and inaccurate  and that it was necessary to instead provide automatic compensation to former workers who have become ill as a result of their work at the plant                  It is critical that the NIOSH Advisory Board receives the resources it needs     said Harkin     Additional funding will guarantee that the compensation program will continue to have strong oversight and assist former workers still seeking compensation                 IAAP was the   forgotten    nuclear weapons plant until Harkin brought it to the government  s attention after being contacted by Robert Anderson  a constituent and former IAAP worker who has non Hodgkins lymphoma  in 1997   Harkin was a Senate sponsor of the original Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 and he has obtained government funding for health screening of workers at the plant                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
