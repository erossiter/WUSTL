      WASHINGTON  DC    The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  Inspector General  OIG  today issued a report on USDA  s Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service  APHIS  oversight of Avian Influenza   The report found that APHIS does not have a comprehensive surveillance plan for avian influenza and is not able to target resources to areas of greatest concern   The extent of testing for the disease varies from state to state  and because APHIS does not have adequate information on testing by states and industry  it cannot know the extent to which U S  poultry is being monitored for highly pathogenic avian influenza  HPAI    APHIS does not properly document follow up actions taken after a potential case of avian influenza is identified  nor has it issued protocols for handling potential avian influenza cases involving live bird markets or non commercial poultry activities   Another weakness identified is that USDA fails to provide an avian influenza response plan on how vaccines and anti virals will be administered to animal health care workers involved in culling operations after an outbreak occurs                This report reiterates my concerns about USDA s preparedness plans in the event of a potential avian influenza outbreak  especially if a strain like H5N1 is found in the United States   The federal government continues to push the responsibility of finding and responding to a possible outbreak of avian influenza on states   As a result  USDA does not have a comprehensive national plan for surveillance and monitoring of poultry flocks and states lack adequate federal resources to respond to potential avian influenza outbreaks                   I am also concerned that USDA has not coordinated with the Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  to have a supply of vaccines and antiviral medications available to animal health care workers who are on the front line in our defense against highly pathogenic avian influenza   These individuals will be the first responders in the event of an outbreak  and it  s inexcusable that our government does not have a clear plan to protect them                I urge USDA to implement OIG  s recommendations for combating avian influenza without delay               USDA  s OIG report can be found online at www usda gov                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
