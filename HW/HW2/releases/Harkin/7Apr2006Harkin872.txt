      WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that the United States Postal Service  USPS  will hold a meeting on the proposed consolidation of the Siouxland Mail Processing Operations   The meeting will take place Thursday  April 20th at 10 AM at the Sioux City Convention and Conference Center on 801 Fourth Street   The meeting will be open to concerned residents and attended by Sioux City Chamber and government officials  Harkin staff and representatives of the USPS              This meeting is long overdue and it  s critical the Postal Service hears from Siouxland residents how its proposed consolidation plan will impact their community     said Harkin     Major issues such as the costs the USPS plan will impose on local businesses and possible delays in mail service need to be apparent to all involved before moving the mail processing facility             Harkin has been working to increase community input and transparency in the USPS proposed consolidation plans   Harkin has succeeded in pushing USPS to conduct a service audit to determine the impact consolidation would have on Sioux City   He also included language in the Postal Reform Bill that would block USPS from implementing any consolidation plan unless it has conducted a study to examine costs of the plan on Siouxland   This bill remains in conference committee where the provisions calling for the study must be agreed to before it would go to the White House for approval            At Harkin  s request  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  is conducting a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Eight months later after GAO  s original report  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing the recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process          Throughout this process Harkin has repeatedly called on USPS to increase its communication with Siouxland community leaders    In late January  Harkin along with Siouxland area officials  met with Bill Galligan  Senior Vice President for Operations for USPS   However  USPS failed to clearly provide the criteria they used when making consolidation decisions or to provide a clear timeline of when it will make its final decision   Most important of all  local postal customers and businesses have received no explanation of likely service delays and degradations as a result of consolidation                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
