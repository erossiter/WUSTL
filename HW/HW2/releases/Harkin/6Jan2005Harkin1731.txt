        Good leadership at the Department of Agriculture matters a great deal in my state of Iowa   Agriculture is critical to our economy  and we treasure our way of life in small towns and rural communities   Yet no matter where we live  we depend on food and agriculture   Thus the day to day responsibilities of the Secretary of Agriculture touch the lives of all Americans and millions of others around the world              Governor Johanns got a good start in life  growing up on a dairy farm near Osage  Iowa   As the governor of our neighboring state of Nebraska  he has added to his knowledge of food  agriculture and rural issues   Governor Johanns  I look forward to working with you on the many challenges we face              One of them is carrying out the farm bill   We passed a good bill in 2002  President Bush praised it and signed it into law  and for the most part it has been working   We stayed within the budget in writing that legislation  but since then the president  s budget and appropriations bills have taken a lot of funding away   In fiscal 2005 alone  over  1 2 billion was cut from programs such as conservation  rural economic development  research and renewable energy   On top of that  the administration insisted that disaster assistance could only be obtained by drawing funds out of the farm bill   This bleeding of funds from the farm bill is damaging and short sighted              Key farm bill initiatives are also suffering from delayed or misguided implementation   It seems as if the regulations for the Conservation Security Program were intentionally written to drive farmers and ranchers away through stingy payments and overly burdensome requirements   The new initiative to bring investment capital to rural communities has been largely nullified by unworkable rules   Funds dedicated to rural broadband access lie idle because of excessively tight fisted lending policies   These implementation problems can and should be solved            continued            It is encouraging that Governor Johanns understands the importance of developing markets for value added products    from pork and beef to farm based renewable energy and bio based products   Adding value to commodities holds real promise for boosting farm income  jobs and economic growth in rural America   We wrote a provision in the farm bill requiring all federal departments and agencies to give a preference to procuring bio based products whenever feasible    thus creating a huge potential market   Unfortunately  USDA  s rules to establish this requirement are now more than two years late   This initiative is too critical to delay any further              We also face unprecedented challenges in protecting the safety and security of our nation  s food supply    including from intentional acts scarcely contemplated in the past   Besides meat and poultry inspection  USDA has a crucial role in fighting plant and animal diseases  such as soybean rust or foot and mouth disease  and protecting human health  such as from BSE or Avian influenza   To do the job  USDA needs state of the art facilities  which is why we must provide the necessary funds to complete renovation of the animal disease center in Ames  Iowa                    We have a history of bipartisan cooperation in our Committee and with the administration in support of domestic and international food and nutrition assistance   It is helpful that the agriculture community understands this  farm food  connection and wants our nation  s abundance to help those who need it   I am proud to have worked with Senators Lugar and Cochran to strengthen the federal food assistance and child nutrition programs   Governor Johanns  I hope that you will continue USDA  s strong support for national eligibility standards and benefit levels in these programs              In trade  we have for years taken for granted our nation  s agricultural trade surplus   But for 2005  USDA projects that for the first time since 1959 our agricultural trade surplus will disappear   Clearly  global trade negotiations will require a lot of careful work  as will efforts to reopen markets for U S  beef   More work is needed on USDA  s just released rule for expanding imports of cattle and beef from Canada in the wake of BSE              Finally  there is an urgent need to step up enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act against anti competitive practices              Again  I welcome Governor Johanns to the Committee and look forward to today  s hearing and to working with him in the coming months and years           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
