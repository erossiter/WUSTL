        In Iowa and across the country  many of our family sized livestock producers are disappearing as large  corporate  vertically integrated operations grow     Harkin said     This trend is very disturbing and the lack of attention given to this issue by USDA is unacceptable   Serious questions persist about USDA  s commitment to enforcing the provisions of the Packers and Stockyards Act   That is why I am asking Ms  Fong to take a very close look at what USDA is doing to protect producers and root out unfair  anti competitive actions in livestock markets             Harkin  s letter to the USDA Inspector General focuses on a number of major concerns with GIPSA  s enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act  including            USDA  s failure to act against bad actors for anti competitive activities in the marketplace in the form of administrative complaints or proposing new rules or modifications to existing rules to keep up with the rapid changes in the market system   Possible inflation of the number of actual investigations conducted by the competition division in annual GIPSA reports to suggest a high rate of enforcement activity is taking place when in fact it is not   How USDA has interpreted and carried out recommendations from a 2000 Government Accountability Office  GAO  report  reportedly in ways that block and tie up investigations at GIPSA headquarters in Washington  D C   A high rate of staff turnover within the competition division attributed to low office morale  problems with leadership and GIPSA staff believing they are not allowed to conduct or move investigations forward          More than 80 years has passed since passage of the Packers and Stockyards Act  yet we are still having constantly tourge USDA to enforce the law     Harkin said     It is time for USDA to step up to the plate and actively and aggressively investigate anti competitive behavior to ensure that all livestock producers have an open and fair marketplace              Senator Harkin has worked for many years to increase competition and fairness in livestock and poultry markets   Last October  he released a Democratic staff report detailing the detrimental affects that an overly consolidated and unfair market system in the livestock industry poses to independent producers    This report can be obtained by going to Senator Harkin  s website at www harkin senate gov and clicking on agriculture  The report is titled   Economic Concentration and Structural Change in the Food and Agricultural Sector  Trends  Consequences and Policy Options             A copy of the letter is attached                     April 4  2005               The Honorable Phyllis K  Fong      Inspector General      U S  Department of Agriculture      14th Street and Independence Avenue S W       Room 117 W      Washington  D C  20250            Dear Ms  Fong                      It is my understanding that as part of its fiscal year 2005 annual business plan  USDA  s Office of Inspector General will conduct a followup audit review of the Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA    This review of GIPSA  particularly the competition division  is especially important since there have been many changes in the livestock and poultry industry and in the structure and operations of GIPSA since the OIG  s 1997 audit report and the Government Accountability Office  s  GAO  report in 2000   I commend you for planning this OIG review  very strongly support it and request that you examine the specific issues and concerns described in this letter                          For several years  there has been growing concern that GIPSA  s competition division is not sufficiently meeting its responsibilities to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act   Despite rapid changes in livestock and poultry markets  for the past four years there has been little or no activity by GIPSA to investigate and act against anti competitive activities in markets or to implement needed regulatory reforms   For example  in the past several years   GIPSA  s competition division has not filed any administrative complaints against market participants for anti competitive activity   And while the Secretary of Agriculture is directed by statute to write rules to carry out the Packers and Stockyards Act  there have not been any new rules or modifications to existing rules proposed or issued by GIPSA  s competition division in the past four years   Given these concerns  I request that the OIG investigate and make a full accounting of why GIPSA has apparently not aggressively pursued these matters as required by the Packers and Stockyards Act                      It also appears that GIPSA has interpreted and carried out recommendations from the 2000 GAO report in a manner that frequently thwarts investigations that are initiated in the regional offices   GAO recommended in that report that GIPSA develop a more systematic approach to investigations and make them more in line with the process utilized by the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission   Prior to the 2000 report  GIPSA regional offices could start investigations on their own and there were no specific requirements for approving an investigation plan at GIPSA headquarters   Today  it appears that elaborate investigation plans are required to be approved by GIPSA headquarters in Washington  D C  before an investigation can move forward   I request that the OIG examine whether GIPSA headquarters   current practice of particularized management and approval of investigations initiated by regional offices is blocking meritorious investigations of and action against anti competitive conduct   It is important that the OIG locate any memoranda  letters  e mails or other types of communication from any official in GIPSA  or from USDA  s Office of General Counsel  that would shed light on whether GIPSA headquarters is impeding meritorious investigations   In addition  I request that the OIG determine whether GIPSA has fully and properly implemented the other recommendations in the 2000 GAO report                      Serious questions are now evident about the manner in which GIPSA accounts for and represents the number of investigations it undertakes and completes of possible violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act   It is my understanding that GIPSA  s longstanding practice had been to classify investigations separately from actions consisting of relatively routine or simple monitoring or followup to complaints   A complaint is typically initiated when a producer calls or writes to GIPSA detailing a certain problem  but GIPSA may also initiate complaints itself   Once a complaint is initiated  GIPSA then evaluates it and determines if it deserves further action   If the further action involves sending field representatives to a firm  s location to examine records or taking similarly substantial steps  such action would be characterized as an investigation   If the followup to a complaint merely involves a telephone call or calls  or similarly insubstantial steps  such action would not be characterized as an investigation                                 It clearly appears that GIPSA  s approach to what actions are characterized as investigations has changed quite substantially within the past few years   Specifically  GIPSA appears to be inflating the number of investigations conducted by the competition division and listed in fiscal year GIPSA reports by tallying any followup in response to a complaint    no matter how minor    as an   investigation      By evidently redefining what constitutes an investigation   GIPSA  s internal records and annual reports appear to give a false impression that investigations are being conducted when in many cases they are not   Given the close overlap among GIPSA divisions  this same inflation of the number of investigations undertaken and reported could be occurring within the trade practices and financial protection divisions as well                      Accordingly  I request that you specifically examine the issues listed below involving GIPSA  s handling of and accounting for complaints and investigations for each of the Packers and Stockyards enforcement areas  competition  trade practices and financial protection   In examining these issues  it is essential that the OIG uses a clear and meaningful definition regarding the types and extent of actions that rise to a level constituting an investigation   GIPSA  s longstanding distinction between routine followup to a complaint and a true investigation  which was clear up until a few years ago  seems to be a reasonable basis for the OIG  s examination of the following questions          1          It is critical to evaluate the GIPSA complaints and investigations log for the years 1999 through 2005  which is maintained within the Packers and Stockyards program  s three regional offices in Atlanta  Denver and Des Moines   This evaluation will help gain an understanding of the actual number of complaints filed by producers with GIPSA and the number of complaints initiated by GIPSA itself          2          Of these complaints  how many became actual investigations   What number of investigations were resolved or evaluated within the confines of GIPSA  s offices and how many required GIPSA to do field work   Are there investigations that have been left open for an extended period of time   If so  why have they not been concluded or closed   Have there been any investigations unexpectedly halted or closed due to directions from GIPSA headquarters          3          Of the investigations approved by GIPSA headquarters to move forward  how many resulted in formal administrative complaints for violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act   It is essential that this information be separated to account clearly for the number of complaints  investigations and formal administrative complaints within each of GIPSA  s Packers and Stockyards program  s three main areas of enforcement  competition  trade practices and financial protection                        There have also been indications that GIPSA is not allocating adequate resources to the competition division or effectively utilizing resources within that division to carry out and complete investigations   I urge the OIG to evaluate GIPSA  s competition division budget from 1999 to the present to determine if the competition division is receiving an adequate level of funding and effectively using it to fulfill its responsibilities    specifically  pursuing  and completing competition investigations   For example  how much money is being spent each year for travel by GIPSA  s Packers and Stockyards program staff to investigate producer complaints in the field and pursue competition investigations   How much is spent each year by GIPSA for training staff regarding competition investigations   Are these amounts sufficient to fulfill GIPSA  s responsibilities   What is the dollar amount spent each year by GIPSA for office retreats for staff of the Packers and Stockyards program                        Anecdotal reports indicate a high rate of turnover within GIPSA  s competition division  particularly among staff located in the regional offices   This turnover has been attributed to low office morale  problems with GIPSA leadership and staff believing they are not allowed to conduct or move investigations forward   If those reports are correct  such problems would dramatically reduce the effectiveness of the GIPSA competition division   I ask that the OIG closely examine the following issues           1         The OIG should interview both past and present staff at GIPSA to determine if they are allowed by their supervisors to conduct competition investigations and otherwise fulfill their responsibilities to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act            2          Are there any leadership deficiencies or problems at GIPSA that would hinder staff in pursuing competition investigations or otherwise limit their ability to execute normal job requirements          3          What number of GIPSA staff for each of the three enforcement divisions  competition  trade practices and financial protection  have been relocated from one office to another  including relocation to other offices within GIPSA  or to another agency within USDA  particularly those who were transferred without promotions             4          For new staff hired by GIPSA  how do their years of experience and training for a particular position compare to the experience and training of their predecessors                      I respectfully ask that you review my concerns and issues described above and provide me in no less than 30 days a detailed letter describing whether the OIG will prepare an audit report covering the issues and answering the questions I have outlined   Please also include a time frame for completing such a report   In this letter  please describe any expected problems or reasons any specific issues in my letter cannot or will not be addressed   Please let me know if you have any questions about this request   The staff contact on the Committee for this matter is John Ferrell          Sincerely yours                                                                                 Tom Harkin
