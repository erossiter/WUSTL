  In recent months  Americans  have experienced the sense of insecurity that comes with volatile gas prices recently among the highest in U S  history  Although prices have abated  somewhat in the past couple weeks  we can expect more volatility in the future  This uncertainty hurts seniors on fixed incomes  It hurts farmers who need to  plant and harvest  It hurts working people  especially those with long  commutes  It also hurts our economy  because money spent at the pump is not  being spent in restaurants and retail stores on Main Street   But let me tell you  As bad as it is now   it could get a lot worse  In just the past few days  the possibility of an oil  worker strike in Niger caused oil prices to rise  And we saw in 2005 what a  hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico can do to gasoline prices  We are just one  major incident away from gas prices that could cripple our economy   For years  we have talked about reducing our dependence on  foreign oil  but we have chronically failed to act  Indeed  our oil consumption has  grown steadily  even while our domestic oil supplies have decreased  As a  consequence  we now import over 60 percent of the petroleum we use  Whats  more  almost our entire transportation sector  including cars  trucks   locomotives  and aircraft  is powered by fuels refined from  oil   Well  its time to stop talking about our oil addiction and our  energy problems  We need to be much more aggressive about making change  happen  And I am proud  Mr  Chairman  that our State of Iowa is leading the  way  In fact  Iowa has already achieved energy independence in one important  sense  If we didnt export ethanol to other states  we would produce enough  ethanol to displace 100 percent of our states gasoline consumption  In  addition  Iowa is third in the nation in windpower  On a per capita basis  Iowa  is No  1 in producing electricity from wind  So Iowa is leading  not just with  words  but with deeds   We have only just begun to tap the  potential in renewables  We hope to see a huge jump in production over the  coming two decades  By the year 2025  biofuels and windpower could provide  between 20 and 30 percent of Americas energy needs   This is a tremendous economic opportunity  for rural America  It means jobs for construction and operation of new  facilities  It means higher demand and prices for farm products  And it  provides local investment opportunities for Iowans  In fact  by some estimates   production of renewable biofuels could drive an increase in net farm income of  about 50 percent above todays levels by 2025  with Iowa and the Midwest  experiencing the largest increases   The bottom line is that when we draw our  fuels from the farm fields of the Midwest instead of the oil fields of the  Middle East  this is a win  win  win for America  Its good for our national  security  Its good for the environment  And its very good for the rural economy   Our challenge  today  is to accelerate the  shift to clean  renewable energy in a very aggressive way  We have a lot of  challenges if we are to meet the ambitious biofuels targets before the Senate  right now  36 billion gallons by 2022  One of those challenges is to rapidly  develop a well educated  well trained workforce in the alternative energy sector   and that  of course  is the aim of the Chairmans legislation  the New ERA  Act   There is no question that we need to  encourage community colleges and other institutions to support the education and  training of technicians in the alternative energy sector  We have already seen  some successful early adaptors  for instance  the wind power systems training  program at Iowa Lakes Community College  And there is great potential for  similar training programs for biorefinery employees  including engineers and  operators   So I commend the Chairman for a holding  this hearing  and for introducing this legislation  I look forward to answering  any questions the panel might have  Thank you       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
