        However  between fiscal year 2003 and 2005  over  1 billion in grant assistance to state and local law enforcement was cut from the DOJ budget   This year  you are taking the final step and eliminating what remains of these programs and depriving law enforcement agencies across the country of an additional  1 3 billion   That is quite a way to thank you to the men and women in law enforcement   It is quite a way to handle programs that have contributed to this amazing reduction in violent crime            Just as an example of what these cuts mean  the Byrne program  which is being eliminated  funds 4 316 cops and prosecutors working on 764 drug enforcement task forces nationally   Byrne funding led to 130 000 drug arrests in 32 states  the seizure of 136 tons of illegal drugs  the confiscation of over 7 000 weapons  and the seizure of 7 691 meth labs   Yet the Administration  s rationale for doing away with the program is that it has not demonstrated results             Mr  Attorney General  I would very much like for you to visit Iowa  where like many other Midwestern states we are in the middle of a methamphetamine crisis   Our Byrne dollars  the ones that may not exist next year  fund 74 task forces and pay for an additional 84 law enforcement salaries   They fund task forces responsible for the seizure of 63  of the meth in the state   They fund a women  s prison treatment program where only 9 percent have gone back on meth after their release  and an award winning dual diagnosis program   These funds are quite simply critical to the fight against meth and they are making a difference              I will be very interested in hearing from you about how you believe cutting these programs is a cost savings for the country and for meth affected states like Iowa                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
