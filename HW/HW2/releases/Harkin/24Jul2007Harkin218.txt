 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised the Senates passage of the Higher Education Amendments of 2007  a bill that will ensure federal student aid dollars are being used effectively to help students pursue a higher education  This bill restricts student lenders ability to bribe colleges to improve their bottom line and enacts long needed reforms to the student loan system so it offers students a better deal instead of maximizing lender profits   Last week the Senate reigned in subsidies to private loan leaders and made a bold new investment in programs that truly make college more affordable for American families  Today  the Senate continued to expand Americans education opportunities by passing legislation that will ensure the student loan industry does not gain preferential treatment that can result in higher student debt  Harkin said At a time when a college education is more important than ever for career success  these two pieces of legislation will ensure the federal government is effectively investing its resources to provide Americans with the tools they need to pursue higher education   Recent reports have shown how some in the student loan industry have improperly made financial agreements with educational institutions in return for being designated as a preferred lender  These preferred lenders often attract a large majority of students business  even though they may not offer students the best deal  The College Affordability Act passed by Congress last week will reduce many students debt by cutting excess subsidies to the private loan program by  18 billion and channeling those savings into Pell Grants  which students do not have to repay  The legislation will boost the maximum Pell Grant from  4 310 to  5 100 next year and  5 400 by 2011   In addition to making college more affordable  The Higher Education Amendments of 2007 also included an amendment sponsored by Harkin to establish a loan repayment program for new law graduates who work for legal aid Specifically  lawyers who commit to a minimum of three years of service would receive up to  6 000 a year in loan repayments   Our promise of equal justice under law rings hollow if those who are most vulnerable are denied access to representation  Harkin said  I am pleased that my amendment will help will make it easier for Legal Aid programs to attract and retain qualified lawyers that can help provide all Americans with equal access to justice  regardless of finances   A recent survey found that with median law school debt at  70 000  and an additional  16 000 in undergraduate debt  over 65 percent of new law school graduates were prevented from even considering a public service career  Individuals who take positions with legal aid often leave after two or three years  leading to a turnover rate that dramatically decreases the efficiency of the program and the vital services it provides       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
