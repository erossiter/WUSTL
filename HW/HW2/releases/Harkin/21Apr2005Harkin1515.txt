        There are approximately four million people in the United States that suffer from food allergies  and for some it can be a matter of life or death     Harkin said     It is just common sense that we provide these people with the information they need to prevent potentially dangerous health problems   It is time for USDA to act to make this information available             Each year about 30 000 individuals require emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die because of allergic reactions to food   Major allergens  defined as Crustacean shellfish  eggs  fish  peanuts  soybeans  tree nuts and wheat  account for about 90 percent of food allergies   Currently  USDA regulated firms that produce meat and poultry products are not required to label food allergens   Harkin is asking USDA to require that labels of meat and poultry products disclose the presence of major allergens  similar to the FDA  s requirement under the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act            In order to avoid confusion for consumers  I urge USDA to bring its labeling standards in line with the protections mandated by Congress and that will be required by FDA     Harkin said     Regardless of whether the food is under FDA or USDA oversight  consumers ought to know what ingredients are in the foods they buy  especially allergens known to have a risk of major health problems for some individuals             A copy of the letter is attached                        April 21  2005         The Honorable Mike Johanns      Secretary of Agriculture      United States Department of Agriculture              1400 Independence Avenue  SW      Washington  D C  20250         Dear Secretary Johanns                          Beginning in January 2006  food manufacturers regulated by the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  will be required to list on the label major allergens in foods they produce   Because product labeling is the main source of such information for consumers  Congress passed the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act  and President Bush signed the bill into law in August of 2004   That law requires that packaged foods  spices  flavors  and colorings regulated by FDA disclose in plain English the presence of major allergens  e g     wheat    rather than   semolina    and   milk    rather than   whey       While FDA  s regulation applies only to FDA regulated foods  the Department of Agriculture  s Food Safety and Inspection Service  FSIS  has declared that complete and clear food allergen labeling is important  and FSIS now permits voluntary labeling using the two formats required for FDA regulated foods   I am writing to request that USDA adopt regulations similar to FDA  s requiring labeling to disclose the presence of major allergens in meat and poultry products regulated by USDA                            Approximately four million individuals in the United States suffer from food allergies   Each year about 30 000 individuals require emergency room treatment and 150 individuals die because of allergic reactions to food   Major allergens  which for this purpose consist of Crustacean shellfish  eggs  fish  milk  peanuts  soybeans  tree nuts  and wheat  account for about 90 percent of all food allergies                            USDA already has the authority to mandate major allergen labeling to alleviate this risk to public health   In 1993  USDA adopted nutrition labeling requirements by using legal authority granted in the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act   Those laws prohibit the sale of foods with false or misleading labels and define a food as misbranded if the label is false or misleading in any manner   USDA took action on nutrition labeling after Congress passed the Nutrition Education and Labeling Act to require nutrition labels on foods regulated by FDA   Just as USDA harmonized its nutrition labeling regulations with those of FDA  USDA has authority to harmonize labeling again  this time to require labeling of foods containing major food allergens                           Having consistent labeling regulations for allergens at both USDA and FDA will promote understanding and minimize confusion among consumers   Requiring major allergen labeling will also help meat and poultry processors take appropriate steps and provide much needed guidance to eliminate undeclared major allergens in their products as they increase their production of marinated and value added meat and poultry products for the market                           I urge USDA to propose regulations as soon as possible to require mandatory labeling of major food allergens in meat and poultry products consistent with the Food Allergen Labeling and Consumer Protection Act   When FDA  s regulation becomes effective January 1  2006  FDA regulated firms will have had 18 months to prepare for and comply with the allergen labeling act passed in August of 2004   Within the same period of time from now  or even sooner  USDA should propose  finalize  and have in effect regulations requiring that labels for meat and poultry products disclose the presence of major allergens                          Thank you for your attention to this matter                                                                                                 Sincerely yours                                                                                                      Tom Harkin
