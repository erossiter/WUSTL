           Farmers bought into federal crop insurance so they could be protected against unforeseen problems  such as aflatoxin damaging their corn     said Harkin     It is not acceptable that USDA  s loss adjustment procedures and rules are denying farmers just compensation for financial loss from aflatoxin                Aflatoxin is a fungus that makes corn unsuitable and dangerous for food or animal feed use if present at high levels   The toxin contaminates corn when it is exposed to droughts  such as those afflicting Eastern Iowa and portions of the Midwest               In order to receive federal crop insurance compensation for aflatoxin  farmers must submit a request to their crop insurance company asking their crop be tested for the toxin   However  the testing techniques used yield faulty results 25 40 percent of the time   As a result  farmers have been told at their local elevators that their crops were contaminated by aflatoxin even though loss adjusters found their products to be aflatoxin free   Since the aflatoxin was discovered after harvest  USDA denies the claims for compensation   Some farmers have put off harvesting their crops so that they can be tested for the fungus               Harkin today urged that the Risk Management Agency  RMA  allow testing be done after harvesting  when corn is in storage so that farmers do not delay their harvest or face unfair denials because of a faulty testing system   Harkin also asked that corn which has to be destroyed because of extreme levels of toxicity be eligible to receive loan deficiency payments  LDP  to help make up for a complete loss in their corn crop               I  ve been hearing a lot of frustration from farmers who face a myriad of obstacles in getting the federal crop insurance coverage for these damaged crops     Harkin said     I urge the administration take measures immediately to allow farmers a fair chance to collect on the insurance they invested in at the beginning of the growing season                 A copy of the letter is available upon request                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
