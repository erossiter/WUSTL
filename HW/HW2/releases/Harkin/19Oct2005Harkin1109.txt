         Americans are being told these cuts are necessary to bring the deficit down   With annual deficits and the national debt setting new records  fiscal responsibility would make a lot of sense   Yet the irony is that the cuts required of our Committee are contained in a budget resolution that will actually worsen budget deficits   That is because the resolution requires cutting  35 billion from programs that mostly help middle and lower income Americans  while it authorizes additional tax breaks of  70 billion    the lion  s share of which will go to the very wealthiest Americans             Three years ago we crafted a new bipartisan farm bill  which President Bush praised and signed into law   That legislation reinstated counter cyclical farm income protection and added new funding for agricultural conservation  nutrition assistance and other areas  such as food and agriculture research             It would be hard to find a worse time to break the commitments made in the farm bill   Farm income is falling substantially because of higher production costs    including record energy prices    along with lower commodity prices   USDA information indicates that agriculture will suffer a nearly  5 billion negative impact this year just from energy related costs   FAPRI estimated a 20 percent annual increase in the cost of production for all major crops  again mainly from higher energy related costs   Cutting farm income protection can only worsen the hardship for farm families and the rural economy             Nor is there any justification for cutting USDA support for agricultural conservation  yet conservation suffers a disproportionately large share of the cuts in this package   Farmers and ranchers need conservation dollars so they can afford practices that improve the environment for all Americans   It is especially unfair that the Conservation Security Program  CSP  absorbs the vast majority of the damage to conservation funding  since CSP has already been cut by well over  3 billion in previous measures             The Chairman is to be commended for agreeing not to cut federal nutrition assistance in this package   That is the right thing to do  and it reflects the tradition in our Committee of bipartisan support for fighting hunger and malnutrition   Surely  a basic budgetary principle for this body should be that the most vulnerable Americans will not be thrown overboard             The budget resolution has dealt this Committee a difficult hand   I know the Chairman has worked hard to meet these obligations    even as it seems clear he does not relish this task   I cannot support the package  but I pay my respects to the Chairman as he has worked to fulfill his responsibilities                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
