      WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   top Democrat on the panel that funds labor initiatives  today issued the following statement on the Bush Administration  s reversal on Davis Bacon Wage Protections affecting the Gulf Coast            I am pleased that the Bush Administration has finally reversed its rash  misguided decision to suspend Davis Bacon wage protections in the Gulf Area devastated by Hurricane Katrina   Too many hard working Americans in this region were already struggling to make ends meet and it defied logic that they were paid less after the devastation this disaster caused              While this is a step in the right direction  it is time to offer a smarter approach to rebuilding America  s Gulf Coast region   This means that the Bush Administration also needs to reverse its suspension on anti discrimination protections and advocate for a fair contracting process that helps strengthen local and minority businesses   As workers begin to rebuild their lives and all the communities along the Gulf Coast  they must have the most basic protections             Together  we can do better   And we can certainly do better for the hard working Americans who have lost so much             Last month Harkin  along with Senator Edward M  Kennedy  D MA   introduced a bill to reverse President Bush  s proclamation stripping these key wage protections from workers rebuilding the troubled Gulf region    Harkin also planned to offer the bill as an amendment to the Supplemental Appropriations bill expected for Katrina relief  The Harkin amendment would have blocked the Bush order  ensuring that workers who toil to rebuild the Gulf Coast region will be paid wages that will also allow them to rebuild their lives           The Davis Bacon Act requires that workers employed on federally funded construction projects be paid the prevailing wage rate of the area where their work is conducted   It is intended to ensure that employees performing work on government contracts are paid wages that reflect the fair market value of their work                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
