 Washington  D C   A Government Accountability Office  GAO  report requested by Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and released today found weaknesses in USDAs plan to implement a national animal identification system  Harkin asked GAO to examine USDAs animal ID plan in November 2005 after concerns were raised that USDA was not effectively implementing the system and not informing producers and livestock market operators how much the system will cost their operations  Harkin is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry   In response to concerns about animal disease outbreaks  the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  announced in December 2003 that it would implement a nationwide programlater named the National Animal Identification System  NAIS to help producers and animal health officials respond quickly and effectively to animal disease outbreaks in the United States   Animal diseases are a constant and very real threat to the livestock and poultry industries since an outbreak could wreak havoc for trade and our domestic markets  Yet  USDA has taken a slow  indecisive and confusing adoption of the animal ID system   This GAO audit confirms the concerns producers and livestock market operators had about USDAs animal ID plan for some time now  that is USDA has much further work to do so that this system is on the right track and workable  I strongly urge USDA to implement GAO recommendations without delay and make it clear to producers what is expected of them and how they envision this system working   The GAO report shows that unless they are corrected  these problems will undermine the USDAs ability to rapidly and effectively trace animals back to their origin when a disease breaks out  The agency identified the following issues of concern     The USDA lacks a comprehensive cost estimate or cost benefit analysis for the implementation and maintenance of the animal ID system  In response to GAOs recommendation to do so  USDA has now entered into a contract to have a cost estimate conducted     USDA has not prioritized the implementation of the animal ID system according to economic value of the species or those most at risk for specific animal diseases     USDA has not developed a plan to integrate the animal ID system with preexisting animal disease eradication programs for hogs  cattle  sheep or goats  thus duplicating effort and cost to producers     USDA has awarded 169 animal ID cooperative agreements totaling  35 million but has failed to adequately monitor the agreements or determine if the intended outcomes  for which the funds were used  were achieved  USDA has also not consistently shared the results of the agreements with state departments of agriculture  industry groups  or other stakeholders to allow them to learn from experience under the cooperative agreements     The timeframe for effective animal disease traceback from where animals have been raised is not clearly defined for specific species  Some contagious diseases need to be tracked and identified in a very short amount of time to limit further spread of the animal disease     Tracing animals from their original origin will be problematic given that USDA is not requiring critical information  such as the type of animal species  date of birth  or approximate age of animals to be recorded in the animal ID system  This information is necessary to limit the scope of an animal disease investigation     USDA has no benchmarks to determine if there is sufficient participation to achieve an effective animal ID system   USDA Needs to Resolve Several Key Implementation Issues to Achieve Rapid and Effective Disease Traceback  GAO 07 592  will be available later today on the GAO website       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
