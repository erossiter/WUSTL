        USDA needs greater authority to ensure meat and poultry plants are not violating public health standards     Harkin said     Through litigation  the meat and poultry industry has scaled back USDA  s ability to close plants that repeatedly violate standards to protect their consumers   This law ensures USDA can shut down repeat offenders             In 1996  USDA adopted new rules to help them enforce basic safety and sanitation standards in the production of meat and poultry   These rules  called Pathogen Reduction and Hazard Analysis Critical Control Points  HACCP   are critical to ensuring that microbial pathogens are kept out of meat and poultry sold to consumers in restaurants and on grocery store shelves   Unfortunately  the meat and poultry industry has used lawsuits since then to stop the government from enforcing these important food safety standards   The courts struck down USDA  s ability to enforce pathogen standards for Salmonella and to require meat grinders to stop using low quality  potentially contaminated beef trimmings   These lawsuits threaten USDA  s ability to shut down a plant that repeatedly violates basic sanitation regulations            Kevin  s Law gives USDA the authority to enforce existing protections against pathogens such as Salmonella and E  coli   It requires USDA to set standards for foodborne pathogens based upon the best available science and available technology to reduce contamination   The law also makes clear that USDA also has the authority to enforce basic sanitation requirements in meat and poultry plants              Regrettably  we have not had the administration  s support on this bill in the past     Harkin said     I hope that will change and we can strengthen USDA  s hand to fight foodborne pathogens in meat and poultry   Passing Kevin  s Law would mean USDA can take action against plants that repeatedly violate sanitary standards             Cosponsors of the bill include Senators Arlen Spector  R PA   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Dick Durbin  D IL   Russ Feingold  D WI   Herb Kohl  D WI  and Charles Schumer  D NY                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
