        This is great news for those IAAP workers that have suffered from cancer due to exposure at IAAP     Harkin said     It has been years since Bob Anderson  a constituent and former IAAP worker  brought this issue to my attention and I am pleased that the workers and their families will finally receive this long overdue compensation             If accepted  IAAP workers from 1947 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers will be receiving  150 000   The NIOSH Radiation Health Advisory Board is expected to consider the petition on Wednesday  February 9   The Secretary of Health and Human Services  HHS  will then have 30 days to act  and following that approval  Congress has 30 days to act   If no actions are taken to block NIOSH  s recommendation  then they will take effect by early April         Under a new rule issued in June  NIOSH was given the authority to add groups of workers to the Special Exposure Cohort  SEC   a category that was created for workers whose exposure levels can  t be documented   Workers from Kentucky  Ohio  Alaska  and Tennessee are already included in the SEC  By classifying IAAP workers as SEC  workers would be immediately and automatically eligible for compensation   A recent study by NIOSH revealed that little to no radiation screening was conducted at IAAP prior to 1975   As a result of the inadequate documentation  many workers made sick by exposure at the plan will have difficulty receiving compensation unless they are added to the SEC              These workers have waited years to be compensated     said Harkin     IAAP workers and their families devoted their lives to our national security  and their compensation is long overdue             In order to quickly move the IAAP petition  Harkin successfully added an amendment in June 2004 to the Defense Appropriations bill that speeds up efforts to administratively add workers to the cohort if recommended by HHS   Harkin also introduced an amendment in June 2004 that would allow IAAP workers to be automatically eligible for compensation   However  Republicans in Congress stripped the amendment from the Defense Authorization Bill            IAAP was the   forgotten    nuclear weapons plant until Harkin brought it to the government  s attention after being contacted by Robert Anderson  a constituent and former IAAP worker who has non Hodgkins lymphoma  in 1997  Harkin was a Senate sponsor of the original Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 and of a bill to amend it last fall  and he has obtained government funding for health screening of workers at the plant                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
