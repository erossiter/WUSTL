        While I appreciate that the Board feels compelled to examine the revised site profile that became public after the vote  I  d like to point out two things about this site profile   First  it would never have been revised  and the dose estimates would never have increased in fundamental ways  if I had not requested that officials from NIOSH come and meet with the workers last June   At that meeting  NIOSH finally heard first hand about operations at the plant   I can assure you that Congress did not intend for dose reconstruction to be done without taking into account the workers   information about how operations were carried out   Second  while the revised site profile contains many models    which  essentially  are creative ways to make guesses about the radiation doses    it contains no new data that would make possible a more accurate dose reconstruction              In St  Louis  the board heard compelling testimony from Bob Anderson on the contribution these workers made to the national security of the United States   Mr  Anderson also spoke movingly of the catastrophic diseases and death that  too often  have resulted from that service   While I have expressed my gratitude individually to many of the workers I  ve had the honor of meeting since 1998  our first order of business here today ought to be    on behalf of the government and people of the United States    to say thank you to these unsung heroes                Thank you for your service and sacrifice   Thank you to every person who worked on Line 1  who worked in the Gravel Gerties  who assembled  disassembled and guarded some of the most potent nuclear warheads this country has ever built                They did their job with excellence  and they did it at a great personal peril that was not fully known at the time   The men and women of the Burlington area were on the front lines of the Cold War   They served in total secrecy   They received no medals  no thank you  s   Instead  they paid a terrible price   The levels and types of cancer that have afflicted this workforce are shocking   And along with these illnesses have come financial hardships  pain and suffering  which family members have witnessed and nursed them through  and  in too many cases  premature death           That is why  almost five years ago  Congress enacted a law    EEOICPA    to provide some measure of recognition and recompense to these workers   I have come here  today  to remind the board of the simple purpose of that law  At long last  to provide compensation                While the law relies on the science of dose reconstruction when it can be used  we knew then  just as we know now  that dose reconstruction has limits   That is why we specifically required that there be a mechanism for workers to be able forgo dose reconstruction and be automatically compensated   The law expressly notes that there will be some facilities where the records simply do not exist  and where the workers are so old that they shouldn  t be required to wait any longer   And there is no question that that is precisely the situation at IAAP                Further  because NIOSH did not seem to have gotten that message  just last year in the Omnibus Appropriations bill Congress reminded them agaik n that the purpose of this program is to compensate people   That conference report clearly states    The Committee encourages the Department to recognize that in situations where records documenting internal or external radiation doses received by workers at the specific facility are of poor quality or do not exist that workers should promptly be placed in a special exposure cohort                The test that we set up in the law to determine if an SEC is warranted is   if it is not feasible to estimate dose with sufficient accuracy   That is the fundamental question before the Board today                I put these words up on a chart because in the entire five years that this process has dragged out  not once has there been a genuine analysis of this question   NIOSH has not attempted to answer the question of whether accurate dose reconstruction is possible   Instead  NIOSH has spent almost five years trying to find some way    any way    to do dose reconstruction                But EEOICPA does not say    Find whatever records you can and then borrow information from other facilities and build really creative models to make a somewhat better guess      No  it says  Make a determination first as to whether it is feasible to accurately reconstruct dose              I believe    and I hope that the Board will continue to share my view    that it is not feasible to estimate dose with any degree of accuracy at IAAP   The only records that we have    the only records that we had in February    are worker badge data from 1962 to 1974 that monitored anywhere between 3 percent and 25 percent of the workers                We have worker testimony that of those few workers who did have badges     some were supervisors and inspectors who spent little time in proximity to the weapons   So the doses from those badges are most likely underestimates                Meanwhile  among the huge numbers of workers who were not badged were the security guards who spent cold Iowa winters inside the storage areas with the weapons   Thus we have some workers without badges who likely received large doses that we have no way of recovering              We also have workers   testimony that  of those who were supposed to be badged  many didn  t regularly wear their badges   While NIOSH has thrown out the zero readings  it isn  t possible to account for doses that were never measured              We have no accurate understanding of the job categories for the workers   For some job categories there may only be data from one or two badges  creating serious uncertainty that the doses are representative                       And that  ladies and gentleman  is all we have   So we ask   Based on this grossly inadequate data  is it feasible to accurately estimate dose   The answer  beyond question  is   no                Many documents have been lost or never existed   We have an old and very ill workforce   These are factors that Congress intended you to take into account   And that is what you must do now                You will also be hearing from your own consultants  who have looked closely at the period for which no records exist   They will explain the method NIOSH has used to try and deal with that problem   While I commend the inventiveness of those who created the generic pit model  imaginativeness is no substitute for hard data   This model simply injects too many uncertainties into this process                First  there is an admitted factor of uncertainty injected for reasons of national security               Second  the   work factor   utilized to approximate the actual period of exposure for a worker    which essentially amounts to one hour a week    is contradicted by the workers   statements                Third  the classification and transparency issues have not been resolved because a claimant will be unable to appeal a decision using the model                Fourth and most critically  in an attempt to bend over backward to find a way to do a dose reconstruction in the absence of actual data and to account for uncertainties  NIOSH has created a gross disparity in the treatment of IAAP workers   Thus  if two workers developed the same cancer and had the same job description but one worked for a year in 1960 and the other worked for five years from 1962 to 1967  the first worker would be compensated and the second one might not   Ladies and gentlemen  that is not dose reconstruction with a sufficient degree of accuracy                Finally I  d like to address why it is that the Board is reconsidering this matter today   When the Board debated this matter back in February  NIOSH recommended a cohort for the entire time period for IAAP   Even though it had completed the site profile before making that recommendation  NIOSH never in any way reserved judgment or suggested that concerns about classified material could be addressed by the site profile                Yet when the site profile cleared classification review unchanged  NIOSH changed its position with regard to the SEC   Despite multiple requests over the last few weeks by me and others  NIOSH refuses to acknowledge that it has changed positions with regard to the SEC   Indeed  it has refused to acknowledge what that position is   Frankly  this has been one of the most unfair and misleading processes that I have seen in 30 years in government                I  d like to take a moment to read from an article that appeared in the Des Mines Register after the vote in St  Louis              Quiet  poignant moments filtered through the room late Wednesday afternoon as former plant workers and their supporters realized the long trip to St  Louis and their emotional testimony had proved worthwhile   The petition will be forwarded to the Department of Health and Human Services secretary for approval              The board  which advises the National Institute of Occupational Health and Safety  homed in on controversial radiation dose reconstructions required to estimate the likelihood and amount of radiation exposure for each cancer claim           One of the stalled claims was filed by Debbie Detherage and Jane Stonger on behalf of their father  Floyd Todd  Todd was a production worker at the plant who died of non Hodgkin s lymphoma in 1970              We made it    Detherage said  throwing her arms around Fuortes after the board s decision   I need a hug    Like dozens of other plant workers and their families  Detherage came to the meeting searching for closure and acknowledgement that loved ones had been hurt by something at the plant     It s finally a win for us for once    she said                Ladies and gentlemen of the board  the law passed by Congress was intended to compensate people like the family of Floyd Todd   It was not intended to raise their hopes and then crush them time and time again   The people of IAAP believed that they had finally received justice on that day in St  Louis   For NIOSH to summarily nullify that justice was not only wrong  it was cruel                You  the members of the board  have the opportunity to rectify this by reaffirming your February vote   On behalf of all the IAAP workers and their families  I urge you to do so
