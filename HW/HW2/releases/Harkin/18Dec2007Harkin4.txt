 Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  tonight applauded Senate passage of a catch all federal funding bill that would make key investments in programs that reflect Americans values and priorities  The Omnibus appropriations bill passed the Senate with a vote of 76 to 17    The bill was a second attempt to push through domestic funding after President Bush vetoed Congress first attempt    Harkin is Chair of the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations bill     I am pleased to say that we did not allow the Presidents heartless  misguided priorities to prevail entirely  said Harkin  While our bill largely yields to the Presidents top line budget numbers  it also addresses some of the bottom line priorities of the American people  I guess you could say that the Grinch tried to steal Christmas  but we didnt let him get all of it    Within the constraints of the bill  Harkin fought for significant increases for programs that President Bush insisted on cutting  including       607 million for the National Institutes of Health     788 million for home heating assistance programs for low income families     77 million above the Presidents budget for Community Health Centers  allowing more than 50 new centers to be opened     955 million for Head Start  Title I  special education  and teacher quality programs     150 million for the Social Security Administration to help clear out the backlog of disability claims    This is the best possible bill under the worst possible circumstances  said Harkin  While the President refused to compromise  refused to negotiate  refused to respect Congress as a full partner in the budgeting process  we kept at it and succeeded in funding our priorities  While the President provoked a bitter confrontation over a fraction of what he spends on his war in Iraq  we remained focused and succeeded in investing in our own back yards  Im proud of our limited successes              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
