           Good morning   I  d like to thank the Chairman for having this important hearing today about the state of the biofuels industry   I  d also like to thank all of our witnesses for joining us   A special thanks to Dr  Robert Brown at Iowa State University for coming all this way              Just a few years ago  many Americans saw ethanol as a boutique product    an obsession for farmers and entrepreneurs in Iowa  and the corn belt  but not all that relevant to the rest of America            Well  you know the world has changed   The price of oil is at record highs and escalating energy prices are rippling throughout our economy   Gas prices are at or above  3 a gallon  Renewable fuels are a solution to this problem             Truth is  we desperately need biofuels   We are  as the President admits and spoke about yesterday  addicted to oil  and biofuels are our best bet for weaning America from this dangerous addiction              And yet the President suggested yesterday to ethanol producers and supporters that they are part of the problem   He seems to have fallen for the propaganda that somehow ethanol was partly responsible for the run up in gasoline prices   He says this when the price of crude is  73 barrel and counting   The fact is ethanol is helping to moderate gas prices by affording the nation increased fuel supplies            Despite this we have been making progress on the biofuels front   The Renewable Fuels Standard  which I championed  is a big step forward   E 85 installation tax credits are also going to help              The biomass provisions that Senator Lugar and I put into the recently passed energy bill are a big step forward as well   They will help guarantee we get more ethanol out of a kernel of corn than we get today  and increase the number and variety of feedstocks we can use to produce ethanol   The President  s budget proposes only half of the funding provided for in the energy bill for this noble effort             We also need to make sure the alternative fueling infrastructure expands very quickly   Thousands of additional E85 pumps must be deployed at gas stations across the country             And we need to continue to press auto companies to produce FFVs throughout their entire lineup of cars  trucks and SUVs   Consumers should have the choice to fill up with home grown renewable fuels              We know that biofuels are a solution to the great environmental challenge of our time  global warming   The more ethanol and biodiesel we produce  the less petroleum we use   And of course we will also need better fuel economy and the expansion of other vehicle technologies such as hybrids and hybrid  FFVs              Lastly  we will write another farm bill in the near future   In the 2002 farm bill  I included with Senator Lugar the first ever clean energy title that promotes biofuels  and wind power  among other renewable energy resources             I am disappointed that the President has year in and year out proposed to slash funding we devoted in the farm bill for these forward thinking initiatives  and Congress has gone along and cut funding    The energy price crisis drives home the critical need for the President and Congress all to get on the right track and make the necessary federal investment in biofuels and biobased products research and development             I  m determined to build on our efforts to date  and again welcome all of our distinguished witnesses                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
