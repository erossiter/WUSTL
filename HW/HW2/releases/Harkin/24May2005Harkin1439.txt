      Text of the letter  signed by Specter  Harkin  and bill cosponsors Orrin Hatch  R UT   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Gordon H  Smith  R OR   and Edward M  Kennedy  D MA  follows   A PDF is attached            We are writing to urge you to bring H R 810    The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005     to the floor for consideration without amendment as soon as possible   Today  the House of Representatives passed H R 810  which is identical to S 471  with a strong bipartisan vote   It is time for the Senate to act on this critically important measure as well            When the President announced his stem cell policy on August 9  2001  we welcomed it as an important  though limited  first step   As you know  this policy restricts the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research to those that were derived by the date of that announcement   It is now clear that these lines  all of which are contaminated with mouse feeder cells  will never be sufficient to realize the full potential of stem cell research   Our Nation  s top scientists agree  The current federal policy is delaying progress toward cures and treatments for a wide range of diseases and health conditions that affect millions of Americans            Passage of The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will expand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research   U S  scientists and doctors will gain access to newer  more advanced lines that have never come in contact with mouse cells and  thus  are more likely to be used in clinical treatments   Moreover  none of the additional lines require the creation of new embryos  instead  these lines could be derived from any of the more than 400 000 embryos that are left over from fertility treatments and will otherwise be discarded            In addition  this bill strengthens the ethical requirements that scientists must follow in conducting stem cell research   States are currently moving ahead with their own stem cell initiatives  creating a patchwork of laws that vary across the Nation   The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act will ensure that all stem cell research in this country conforms to the same  high ethical standards              A clear majority of Americans    from both parties    agree that the current federal stem cell policy should be expanded   The House of Representatives has just passed legislation that would accomplish this goal  the Senate must now do the same            We urge you to schedule a vote on The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2005 as soon as possible                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
