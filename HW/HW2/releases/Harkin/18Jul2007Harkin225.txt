 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  made the following statement on the Senate floor at 1 00 a m  EST this morning  July 18  to call for a strategic redeployment of our troops out of Iraq  Democratic Senators worked through the night to urge Senate Republicans to stop blocking simple up or down votes on amendments calling for a new course in Iraq   Mr  President  I have come to the floor  this evening  on behalf of the many Iowans who have been calling and e mailing my office  The overwhelming majority of people in my state have turned against the war in Iraq  as have the overwhelming majority of Americans elsewhere  According to a USA Today Gallup poll released last week  71 percent of Americans favor removing all U S  troops from Iraq by April 1 of next year   The American people are sick of seeing our brave men and women killed and maimed in what has become a vicious civil war in Iraq  They want to chart a new course in Iraq  a course out of that civil war  And they simply cant believe that President Bush and his allies in this body have responded to their wishes with a strategy of obstruction  filibuster  and veto threats  They cant believe that Republican Senators are blocking votes on the number one issue before our nation       the number one issue on the minds of the American people   In a nutshell  people calling my office are saying that Republican Senators have a right to support President Bushs war in Iraq  They have a right to advocate that we stay the course  But they do nothave a right to block simple up or down votes on amendments calling for a new course in Iraq   The President and his allies are demanding that we wait until September  before we act   But this is the same game of obstruction and delay that they have been playing for years now  Time and again  the President has announced a new plan or a new strategy for victory in Iraq  Time and again  he has asked for patience  Time and again  he has cited progress  and suggested that success is just around the corner   Meanwhile  with each new plan and with every new strategy  the United States gets dragged deeper into the quagmire in Iraq       more Americans get killed and maimed       and Iraq spirals deeper into chaos and sectarian division   The Presidents spokesman insults our intelligence by saying that the surge is only a couple weeks old  and we should give it a chance  But  as we all know  the surge was announced in January  more than six months ago  I remember very well  because just one day after the President announced his surge  640 soldiers from the 133rd Infantry of the Iowa Army National Guard were told that they would not be coming home from Anbar Province in Iraq as planned  Instead  their combat tour in Iraq would be extended to 16 months  nearly a year and a half in the middle of some of the most deadly combat in Iraq   Since the surge began back in January  615 more U S  troops have died in Iraq  and many thousands more have been injured  Since the surge was announced  eight more soldiers from Iowa have been killed in Iraq  including a second soldier from the small town of Tipton  Iowa  Think about that  a small community of 3 100 people in rural Iowa has lost two of its sons in Iraq   On Sunday  the Washington Post published a story about Tipton  Iowa  and its growing disillusionment with the war in Iraq  The story noted that in the first six months of this year  since the surge began  125 troops from 10 Midwestern states have died in Iraq  the bloodiest stretch of the war so far   Let me quote from the article  While opposition to the war has been stronger and more visible on the east and west coasts  small towns in the heartland and the South have provided the Bush administration with some of its most steadfast backers  But that support has cracked amid the echoes of graveside bagpipes and 21 gun salutes  which have been heard with greater frequency in recent months in small Midwestern communities   Mr  President  as more and more Iowans and other Americans turn against this war   as more and more of our young men and women are killed and wounded  the administration asks us to be patient  But patience is not a virtue in the face of a manifestly failed policy  And there is no virtue in staying the course when the course you are on is dragging you deeper and deeper into a geopolitical disaster   Just last week  the administration issued the required progress report on benchmarks for Iraq  As expected  the report shows that the government in Baghdad has failed to meet any of the benchmarks for political and economic reform  The Iraqis have failed to make progress in passing a law governing the sharing of oil revenues  They have failed to make progress in allowing former Baath party members to return to their jobs  They have failed to make progress in disarming militias  They have failed to make progress in organizing new provincial elections  Indeed  the only thing the Sunnis  Shiites and Kurds in parliament can agree on is that they will go on vacation for the month of August   Mr  President  the American people refuse to be patient in the face of this monumental failure  And I agree wholeheartedly with Senator Lugars recent remarks on this floor  to the effect that we cannot and should not wait until September to begin to chart a new course   This war has been spiraling downward for 52 months  What possible difference will another two months make  Indeed  I can predict right now what will happen when we get General Petraeuss report in mid September  Against all evidence to the contrary  the President will cherry pick the report to claim positive military results from the surge  And he will say that those results justify staying the course until the end of the year  or into the spring  or for another year  Indeed  yesterday  the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said that the surge could well be followed by a request for even more troops   It is abundantly clear to me that this President has no intention whatsoever of changing course or reducing the number of troops in Iraq through the end of his term on January 20  2009  He will only change course when and if he is compelled to do  And that is exactly what a clear majority of the Senate is attempting to do with amendments to this defense authorization bill   As I said  the President and his allies are responding with a furious campaign of obstruction  filibuster  and veto threats  They refuse to listen  They refuse to learn  They refuse to consider a new direction    Mr  President  it is one thing for President Bush and Republican Senators to reject the Iraq Study Groups recommendations  It is one thing for them to reject the results of the election last November  which was a clear referendum on the war  It is one thing for them to reject poll after poll showing the American peoples disgust with this war  But what is unacceptable       what is unconscionable       is their refusal to listen to the families of the soldiers who are putting their lives on the line for a manifestly failed policy in Iraq    I personally know many Iowans serving in our Armed Forces  whether active duty or in the Guard and Reserve  They are disciplined professionals who love their country  Even those who profoundly disagree with the war and the surge will continue to do their duty  They deserve our profound respect and appreciation   But  Mr  President  we need to listen to them  And we need to listen to their families   Let me read just a few of the emails and letters that I have received in recent days    One of them is from Peggy  I will not use her last name  in Council Bluffs  Iowa  whose son is serving in Iraq  She writes   My 19 year old son is in Iraq with the United States Army  Please  please get us out of this horrific nightmare and bring them all home  I cant go a day without crying as I worry about him  Every single member of our brave military that dies in this quagmire is a waste  a tragic waste of life  If my son were to be killed over there  I could never reconcile to it due to the fact that we should not be over there in the first place  We invaded a country based on lies and have caused the death and suffering of untold thousands of Iraqi people         Please vote to withdraw the troops   I received the following letter from Regina  again  I will not use her last name  from Bloomfield  Iowa  She writes   While reading some articles yesterday  I ran across several stating the possibility of extending even more the tours of duty of our soldiers in Iraq  Is there anybody thinking about these soldiers other than how many live in a day and how many die  Do they understand how hard this is on these soldiers  and costly to our government and more important the tremendous pain and agony on the families and the troops  Have you ever been in a war zone for an extended time or members of your family in Vietnam  Kuwait or Iraq       If you sense frustration here  it is   I feel it  every time we lose a soldier over there for something we can never win        I have never taken as much to heart  and fear for my grandchildren          Where is the common sense of our country   Mr  President  since the surge began  I have heard from many family members of Iowans whose tours in Iraq have been extended    Let me read portions of a letter from Barbara of Waverly  Iowa   I sit here to write this letter  not knowing why  since Im feeling like no one cares anymore or will be able to do anything about it  I am a 41 year old woman  a military wife of 23 years  and a mother of three   My husbands unit is  currently serving in Iraq and has been gone for 16 months so far on this mission  The soldiers and the families have finally been feeling like we were seeing light at the end of the tunnel  As the new year began  we all started our countdown for our reunions expected for April  Our worlds came crashing down once again as we learned that our loved ones would not be coming home in April  but were being extended until August  thus being deployed for almost two years by the time they return  I am angry  I am devastated  How could this happen        I have lost all hope and faith in our government  I dont understand politics  so my biggest question is  if so many people are against this war and the increase in troops being sent over  then why is the president not listening  Doesnt he care  I voted for him and believed in him  and he has let me down        Please think about the effects this is having on our soldiers and their families  We all have given so much and though we are proud to have been part of serving our country  its time for our soldiers to come home  Please bring them home   And  Mr  President  let me read excerpts from one more letter  This is from a mother in Dows  Iowa   I have a 19 year old son  my only child  who is fighting in Iraq  He is a smart  strong  and brave infantry soldier  He has always wanted to be a soldier and is proud to serve in the United States Army      He is our pride and joy  Heaven forbid  if anything happens to him in Iraq  my husband and I will be crushed beyond measure        My point in telling you all of this is that we are talking about young lives that have a bright future  This is not some political game  Why should our government put our soldiers lives at risk for a civil war in Iraq  Like it or not  thats what it is  a civil war  and our precious soldiers are smack dab in the middle of it        Why should our soldiers be losing limbs and even dying for a group of people who cant get along and will probably never get along  Iraq did not attack us        Things are going from bad to worse in Iraq        Unless you have a loved one fighting in Iraq  you cant begin to understand how difficult it is  It is time to get the troops back home and back to their families  Every one of these soldiers who have died meant everything to someone  They were a husband  wife  son  daughter  grandchild  or close friend to someone        I am neither a Republican nor Democrat  I am just an American mother who wants this violent war stopped and to get our soldiers home safe   And  Mr  President  I want you       I want all of our colleagues        to listen especially closely to the final words from this soldiers mother  She writes   With the overwhelming majority of the American people wanting to bring our soldiers home and stop the war  dont you think  since you actually work for the American people and are elected by the American people  that you should seriously consider our views and hear our voices  Someone told me I was wasting my time writing this letter  but I believe otherwise  I want my voice heard and isnt this what democracy and freedom are all about  I plead with you with all my heart that you will consider this and do what is best for our troops  their families  and the United States   Mr  President  the letters and emails that have come into my office are just heartbreaking  They tell the story of lives disrupted  lives put at risk  lives ended in a war that the overwhelming majority of Americans believe was a tragic mistake   And now  six months into a surge that has failed to significantly reduce the violence in Iraq       six months into a surge that has utterly failed to bring about any progress or reconciliation within the Iraqi government       the Republicans in this body are pulling out the stops to block a simple up or down vote on charting a new course in Iraq   All we are asking for is the opportunity to have a simple up or down vote  And they refuse   I was shocked  last week  when they even filibustered Senator Webbs amendment  which was supported by the distinguished ranking Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee  Senator John Warner  The amendment would require that active duty troops receive as much time at home  recuperating and retraining  as they spend deployed in combat  The amendment allowed for a presidential waver if the troops are needed for an emergency    This ought to be an amendment that draws strong  bipartisan support  After all  many troops in Iraq are now on their third or even fourth deployment  The Army chief of staff has warned Congress that the current pace of combat deployment threatens to break the Army    The Webb amendment would have passed if we had been allowed a simple up or down vote  But the Republicans filibustered it  and killed it    Mr  President  the wives and mothers and family members who have written to me have their own idea of what it means to support the troops  They believe that it means allowing the Senate to have straight up or or down votes on amendments to ensure decent treatment of our troops  They believe it means allowing straight up or down votes on setting a new direction in Iraq  But they are being denied even this by a willful  obstructionist minority here in the Senate         a minority that believes  frankly  that they know better than the American people       a minority that insists on endlessly prolonging a war that the American people want to bring to a close    Mr  President  the American people are not only angry about this war  they are also angry about the way our brave men and women in uniform have been misused and mistreated    The President rushed our troops into combat without proper equipment  and in insufficient numbers  He has insisted on staying the course with a failed policy for more than four miserable years  He has sent many troops back to Iraq for a third and even fourth rotation  with insufficient time to retrain and regroup  In January  he decided to roll the dice one more time by throwing another 30 000 troops into the middle of a sectarian civil war in Baghdad and elsewhere  And now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff is suggesting that  come September  the President may decide to send even more troops to Iraq   Mr  President  at this point  the single best way to support the troops is to tell President Bush  More than four years of bungling  bad judgment  and bullheadedness are enough  We have complete and total confidence in our troops  But we have no confidence in your leadership    So  this evening  we have reached an extraordinary juncture  We have a surge in Iraq  now six months old  which was designed to give the Iraqi government breathing space for reconciliation  But the surge has had mixed military results  at best  And  as I said  the only thing the Sunnis  Shiites and Kurds in parliament can agree on is that they will go on vacation for the month of August   Meanwhile  here in Washington  we have a President who refuses to listen to the American people  supported by a Republican minority in Congress that is determined to obstruct any legislation charting a change of course  If they prevail  our military units will be deployed again and again until they finally break  And the United States will stay bogged down and bleeding in Iraq  creating terrorists around the world faster than we can kill them    It has reached the point  frankly  where you either side with the President and his failed policies  or you side with the American people and our military commanders  who have concluded that there is no military solution to the mess in Iraq  You either support this endless  pointless war  or you support a smarter  more focused campaign against the terrorists who truly threaten us    Mr  President  it is unconscionable that the Republican leaders  at the behest of President Bush  are refusing to allow the Senate to vote on changing our course in Iraq  At long last  it is time for them to listen to the American people and to the families of our troops in the field  The Senate should be allowed to vote on the number one issue facing this country  It is time for the Republicans to stop their obstruction  and to allow this body to work its will       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
