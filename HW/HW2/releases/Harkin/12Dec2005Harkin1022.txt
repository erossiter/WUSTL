         WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to Housing and Urban Development  HUD  Secretary Alphonso Jackson today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  called on the Bush Administration to quickly close a loophole in Section 8 housing so low income Americans have access to the housing assistance they need   Last month  Harkin successfully pushed a provision tightening Section 8 housing rules after learning that a loophole allows students  regardless of financial need  to live free of charge or at a greatly reduced price in government housing   Harkin called on HUD to immediately issue these new regulations  and conduct a timely review into whether current Section 8 residents truly qualify for government assistance               Now that Congress has acted to end abuses in Section 8 housing  it is time for HUD to step up to the plate     said Harkin     I hope that Secretary Jackson will act quickly to fix this problem and implement rules so that this program can help those who really need it    Thousands of low income  elderly  and disabled Iowans depend on Section 8 housing to meet their basic needs   It is an abuse of this important program if people who do not really need help are displacing the many that truly do need it                  The Harkin provision requires that HUD develop new regulations that take into account parental income to determine Section 8 housing eligibility for students unless they are over 24  married  veterans  or have dependents   This is the same criteria students must meet to be declared   independent    for federal financial aid purposes  Additionally  any financial aid received over tuition will be counted as income   The legislation requires that HUD issue final regulations within 30 days of enactment   This 30 day period expires on December 29  2005               Given that Section 8 housing is very limited and the current waiting list is two years long  Harkin called on HUD to issue regulations that include an accelerated review of current Section 8 residents to determine whether they are truly eligible for government housing  particularly in areas heavily populated with college and university students               Since learning about this loophole  Harkin has repeatedly called on the Bush Administration to take action against abuses in the public housing system which has allowed student athletes receiving scholarships and housing stipends to displace needy Iowans in an Iowa City public housing facility    Although HUD issued revised Section guidelines in August 2005  the limited changes did little to close the loophole   Subsequently  abuses in the system have continued even though the average waiting period is two years for Iowans who truly need Section 8 housing                   Section 8 is meant to be a stepping stone for low income Americans to achieve self sufficiency  and we need to get serious about assuring that this goal is realized     said Harkin     Unfortunately  a big loophole has continued to plague this program and it is past due that HUD gets rid of it                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
