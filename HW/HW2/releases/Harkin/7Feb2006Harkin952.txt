   WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds education and health initiatives  today criticized President Bush for providing tax breaks to the wealthy and pushing other controversial big spending measures at the expense of providing needed resources for beneficial health and education programs              The president  s FY07 budget reflects the president  s misplaced priorities by slashing Medicare funding  36 billion  eliminating vital medical research initiatives  and raids education by proposing the largest cut in history                The President  s budget reminds us that there is no such thing as a free lunch     said Harkin   Just last week  the Senate passed another  70 billion in tax breaks  mostly for the wealthy   And yesterday  the bill came due  to be paid by seniors on fixed incomes  the working poor  people with disabilities  cancer patients  and public school children  A budget is a moral document  and the President  s budget flunks the most basic moral test   It calls for literally hundreds of billions in additional tax cuts  with the lion  s share going to those making more than  1 million a year   And it calls for deep cuts to programs that our most vulnerable citizens depend on for their very survival               EDUCATION FACING DEEPEST CUT IN 26 YEARS             The President  s budget makes the deepest cuts in education in history  at a time when schools are struggling to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act   Among the initiatives slated for elimination is the Upward Bound program that provides grants to colleges to help disadvantaged high school students succeed in college  Other programs eliminated included education technology initiatives  state grants to keep schools safe and drug free  smaller learning communities  alcohol abuse reduction  school dropout prevention and dozens of other education initiatives              Additionally  the President  s much hyped  1 5 billion High School Initiative is more than offset by  2 1 billion in cuts to similar education initiatives like vocational and adult education           TITLE I AND IDEA           The President substantially underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act  His budget leaves behind 3 7 million students    including about 18 000 in Iowa    who could be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the level the President promised   Since NCLB  s enactment  the Bush Administration has underfunded NCLB programs by a total of  55 7 billion              The Bush Budget also shortchanges students with disabilities by providing a smaller share of states   total costs for special education for the second year in a row             The president also comes up short on after school programs  funding them at less than half the amount recommended in NCLB Act  As a result  10 000 at risk Iowa students who should receive after school services will have to go without            BUSH SLASHES HEALTH INITIATIVES AND RESEARCH           Once again  the president  s budget provides woefully inadequate resources for health initiatives and research   On the heels of the first cut to the National Institutes for Health  NIH  since 1970  the President has shortchanged vital medical research initiates   The president has completely eliminated funding for preventive health services  the Prevention Health   Health Services Block Grant  universal newborn hearing initiatives  emergency medical services for children  and the Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank    which was just recently touted by the Bush Administration and the Republican leadership              ELIMINATES PREVENTION INITIATIVES            The President has proposed completely eliminating the Prevention Health and Health Services Block Grant at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  and other preventive health services initiatives            MEDICARE SLASHED BY  36 BILLION          These deep cuts will compromise hospital care  home health care  lab tests  and other Medicare services for Iowa seniors and people with disabilities   Iowa  s Medicare providers already rank at the bottom for Medicare reimbursement and the Bush budget will make the problem even worse              CORD BLOOD STEM CELL BANK ELIMINATED            The President  s Budget eliminates all funding for the Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank  an initiative that the President and the Republican leadership themselves touted in December   Harkin has secured funding for the Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank through the Labor HHS Appropriations subcommittee for several years                CUTS TO 18 OF THE 19 INSTITUTES AT THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH  NIH           The President  s budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 institutes at NIH   Funds for the National Cancer Institute would drop by  40 million  and funds for the National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute would drop by  21 million                Instead of funding a war on cancer  the President budget is funding a retreat     said Harkin                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
