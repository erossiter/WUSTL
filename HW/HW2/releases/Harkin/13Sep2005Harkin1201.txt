           I am hopeful that the Senate Judiciary Committee is successful in learning Judge Roberts   views on the rights guaranteed under federal law to Americans with disabilities     Harkin said     Judge Roberts   record is one that indicates a deep skepticism about whether individuals with disabilities are truly entitled to equality of opportunity  and whether Congress has the ability to guarantee these rights                Since the ADA  s enactment 15 years ago  the ADA has provided opportunity and access for the 54 million Americans with disabilities   Prior to the law  s passage  people with disabilities routinely faced prejudice  discrimination and exclusion in their daily lives   Since the law passed in 1990  it has repeatedly been subject to litigation seeking to scale back key provisions               Specifically  Harkin called on Judiciary Committee members to examine Roberts   history of limiting the ability of people with disabilities to enforce their rights in federal court   This upcoming term  the Supreme Court will examine two cases dealing with disability issues and if confirmed  Judge Roberts will likely cast the deciding votes on these cases               Despite the tremendous advances of the ADA and other disability legislation  the rights of Americans with disabilities continue to hang in the balance     said Harkin     The rights of the disabled in this country rest upon this nominee for Chief Justice   It is critical that we better understand Judge Roberts   views on the rights of people with disabilities              A copy of the letter is available upon request                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
