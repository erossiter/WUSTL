          Like many  I have watched in dismay as more and more details of this Administration s efforts to fire federal prosecutors and replace them with loyal partisans have become public   Our U S  Attorneys play a very critical role in this country   These are incredibly important jobs and the people that hold them are responsible for overseeing the most complex and serious prosecutions of the most treacherous crimes                              While these are political appointments  in the past  mere political loyalty was not generally sufficient to get you the job   Under both Republican and Democratic administrations  you also needed to have the support of the legal community in the district  and to have demonstrated solid legal skills   Ensuring that people who were known in the community and had the necessary judgment  skills and independence to fulfill the demands of these positions is the reason that home state Senators are consulted                                That s why DOJ s intention to replace sitting prosecutors with highly political White House and other Administration staffers on an  interim  basis without sending them to the Senate for confirmation is so deplorable    The legislation passed today would revoke that ability   This is just one of the problematic provisions slipped into the Patriot Act and revoking it will help restore the balance to the process of appointing US attorneys                           I am glad the Administration has dropped its opposition to this bill  and I look forward to seeing the President sign it into law   But this exercise has been an eye opener for those of us in the Senate  and I hope for the American people  about the contempt this Administration has for the Congress  and the willingness of the Administration to politicize any and every office                                In fact  this controversy has once again underscored the value of oversight into our system of government   For the past six years  this Administration has operated without any independent check on its power   But those days are over   By passing this legislation and beginning the necessary work to restore the integrity of our nation s U S  Attorneys  we can begin to restore Americans faith in our system of justice                                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
