      Chicago  IL      Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today delivered the following opening statement at a Democratic Policy Committee hearing examining the Bush Administration  s failure to provide sufficient resources to train and equip the Iraqi Security Forces              Mr  Chairman  I thank you for convening this important hearing    and for doing it here in the heartland   It is refreshing to be in the State of Illinois  and not  like President Bush and Secretary Rumsfeld  in the state of denial   And it is critically important to have this committee providing the kind of tough minded oversight that is almost totally lacking in the Republican controlled Congress               The fact is  in the wake of the National Intelligence Estimate release last month  the state of denial is becoming increasingly untenable   Senator John Warner of Virginia  the chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee  returned from Iraq last week and said this     In two or three months       if this level of violence is not under control and this  Iraqi  government able to function  I think it s a responsibility of our government internally to determine  Is there a change of course that we should take     I appreciate Senator Warner  s candor   But I do not think we have the luxury of another two or three months to decide whether to change the current failed course in Iraq              We have been brought to the brink of total mission failure in Iraq because  time and again  the Bush administration has failed to provide competent management  it has failed to properly plan  and it has failed to adapt prudently to changing circumstances   Just one example is the failure to anticipate the large scale breakdown in public order in the aftermath of the U S  invasion of Iraq and then failing to train  equip  and deploy an effective Iraqi security force                President Bush has said repeatedly that as the Iraqi security forces stand up  our American forces will stand down   But  increasingly  the Iraqi security forces are not the solution  they are the problem   By and large  they are poorly trained  led  and motivated   Worst of all  they have been infiltrated by sectarian militias  death squads  and criminal gangs   Instead of protecting the Iraqi people  they are mistrusted and feared   It is painfully clear that rogue elements in the security forces have become a greater threat to Iraq and its overall security than the insurgency   And only the Iraqis can clean up their own house              General George Casey  our commander in Iraq  told the Senate last September    Increased coalition presence feeds the notion of occupation  contributes to the dependency of Iraqi security forces on the coalition   and  extends the amount of time that it will take for Iraqi security forces to become self reliant                 I couldn  t agree more   We need a new course in Iraq   President Bush has given the Iraqi government a blank check payable in the lives of American soldiers and Marines   It  s time to tear up that blank check   It  s time to chart a new course that will serve American interests as well as the interests of the Iraqi people              Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I appreciate our witnesses having the courage to speak out this afternoon   And I look forward to their testimony                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
