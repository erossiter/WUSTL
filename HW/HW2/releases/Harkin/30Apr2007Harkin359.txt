            WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today urged Congress to pass the Employee Free Choice Act  citing a new report which says that if this bill becomes law  more Iowans would likely have health insurance and pension benefits  Harkin is Chairman of the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations panel that funds labor initiatives  Harkin also co sponsored the Employees Free Choice Act  which requires employers to respect their workers  choice to join a union                         Middle class families in this country have an increasingly difficult time making ends meet   More than 47 million Americans lack health insurance  and even those with coverage find that if often covers less and less   This should not be happening in America   Harkin said   By passing the Employee Free Choice Act and giving workers a seat at the table  we can start to reverse these negative trends  Union participation in the workplace means everybody wins   When employees have a voice   when they can ask for better wages and benefits and make suggestions about how to do things better   employers benefit too                        A report released today from the Institute for America s Future shows that if the Employee Free Choice Act became law  it is likely that 40 445 more Iowans would have health insurance  14 6 percent of Iowa s uninsured would receive coverage  and 35 654 more Iowans would have pensions  Nationwide  the Employee Free Choice Act will lead to approximately 3 537 625 more people with health insurance and 2 773 045 more people with pensions                          When workers join together and act collectively  they can achieve economic gains that they would never be able to negotiate individually   Harkin said   It is clear to me that in order to provide America s working families with economic security  we must first rebuild strong and vibrant unions   The first step in doing this is to reduce unfair barriers to union organizing                            The Employee Free Choice Act would allow workers to choose whether they want to form a union through majority sign up or through a longer election process outlined in the National Labor Relations Act  NLRA   However  the protracted NLRA process can be threatening and intimidating to many employees since employers can campaign against those working to form a union in the workplace  The Employee Free Choice Act would protect workers from undue pressures from employers in the organizing context                            The bill does not establish a new election process or eliminate secret ballots  It simply requires employers to honor employee choice  Under current laws  a company gets to decide whether it will recognize a majority sign up vote  Under the Employee Free Choice Act  employees may decide                                In addition  the act will increase penalties for employers who illegally punish employees for trying to form a union  It will also create an arbitration process to aid in writing a first contract after a new union is established  if workers and management cannot reach consensus in a timely manner                        Unionized workers earn 30 percent more than their non union counterparts  They average more vacation time  are more likely to have health insurance  disability insurance  and are far more likely to have a secure defined benefit pension                     The Employee Free Choice Act passed the House of Representatives on March 1st and will soon be voted on in the Senate                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
