 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today ushered to the Senate floor the 2007 farm bill  the Food and Energy Security Act of 2007  The measure passed the Committee on October 25th     Following are excerpts of Chairman Harkins opening floor speech on the bill  as prepared for delivery   In my view  a very positive feature of this bill is that we continue the counter cyclical income protection system we reinstated in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002   We also will allow farmers  at their option  to choose a new form of counter cyclical program named Average Crop Revenue   and modeled after legislation introduced by Senators Durbin and Brown   This new choice for farmers will make farm income protection stronger and more flexible   It will allow farmers better to manage their farms risk in todays uncertain and evolving farm environment   This legislation will help our nations specialty crop growers to address the diverse array of challenges they face in todays increasingly complex and competitive global marketplace   The programs within this bill will help Americas specialty crop producers gain access to overseas markets where they can promote and sell their products   It will also strengthen our national prevention and surveillance system for invasive pests and diseases  which will help protect the stability and health of fruits and vegetables in this country   We increase research on specialty crops to prevent the spread of plant based viruses      to some  the farm bill may seem an abstraction  removed from the pulse of every day life   But this is not the case   The farm bill touches the lives of million of Americans  and no where is this more evident than in the nutrition title of the farm bill   In the nutrition sections of this bill  we strengthen Americas commitment to fighting hunger and promoting sound health and nutrition   By strengthening food assistance to low income Americans  the bill that is before us will help millions of Americans who currently live in the shadow of hunger   Because of the assistance that this bill provides  millions of Americans will put food on their tables  will be better able to afford child care so that they can enter the workforce  will be able to save modest sums for retirements and for the education of their children   And because of this bill  millions of low income children in school throughout America  will be introduced  some perhaps for the first time  to fresh fruits and vegetables that science tells us are critical to sound health and the prevention of diet related chronic disease   This energy title will help farmers and rural communities across the country to join a major transition in which our agricultural sector supplies clean biofuels and renewable energy for all of America   It gives farmers a chance to add biomass crops to their farming operations  with federal support to protect against the financial risks associated with this transition   It supports rural communities with their development of biorefineries for production of biofuels and bioproducts   It also helps farmers and ranchers and rural small businesses who want to improve their own energy systems through grants and loan guarantees for energy efficiency improvements and renewable energy systems   And  it emphasizes a particular opportunity  help for farmers and communities to install livestock manure to energy facilities that address environmental and odor problems while utilizing a valuable energy resource   It will make investments in research that will complement and enhance rural energy production opportunities    Agricultural and forest lands accounts for 69 percent of all land in the United State s   This means that farmers  ranchers and forest land owners are the first line of defense for our environment   They are Americas first conservationists   The Conservation title of the farm bill gives them the tools they need for voluntary efforts to conserve soil  to protect water and air quality  and to increase wildlife habitat on their land  and maintain and improve our nations natural resources for future generations   In this bill  we make it a priority to help farmers who are serious about getting into organic production  and we help them overcome the challenges of transitioning into this industry   For instance  we include  80 million over five years for research into organic production and marketing   We included  5 million for price  yield and overall data collection  the industry has grown so quickly that  right now  this important market information is not being adequately captured    We also removed the 5 percent surcharge arbitrarily charged to organic producers that want to reduce their risk by getting crop insurance  And we make the EQIP program more universally available for farmers to transition into organic agriculture while adopting sound conservation practices   In this bill we set aside a specific amount of funding under Title II for non emergency  development assistance projects   The creation of this safe box is intended to send a strong message that it is not acceptable for USAID to use non emergency program funding as the piggy bank to raid if regular appropriations for Title II emergency programs are inadequate         the trade title also gives USAID authority for a pilot program to conduct local or regional cash purchase of food   For the last few years  the President has requested authority to use up to 25 percent of Title II funds for local or regional cash purchase  but I think this concept needs careful testing before we consider adopting it on a larger scale   I also want to make clear that I see local cash purchase as a complement to donation of U S  commodities  not as a substitute   Too often  farmers can and want to expand production of foods to be sold locally  but they face difficulties finding markets   Larger retail outlets want consistent and abundant quantity  which is something a small farmer cant always provide   This bill seeks to solve this problem by fostering new opportunities for farmers to band together  and by providing funding through the value added development grant program as well as loans through the Business and Industry Loan program   The aim is to make it possible for farmers and others to aggregate or distribute locally grown foods from many small farms  and to market their products to larger retail stores   The Agriculture Committee has responsibility for crafting public policies that support not only farmers but all our citizens who live in small towns and rural communities   Rural America confronts unique challenges because of its low population density  the limited capacity of local governments  and other special circumstances   In recent years  we have come to appreciate that agriculture and rural development are closely intertwined and have a common fate   And we need to go forward with a policy framework that supports both our farms and our rural economy   The research title will increase competitive grant opportunities for basic and applied agricultural research  and strengthen the research  extension and education programs administered by USDA through land grant institutions   The largest obstacles to farm entry for a beginning farmer and rancher are access to credit and land   Since 1990  a portion funding in the Farm Service Agency loan programs have been reserved for beginning farmers and ranchers   This bill expands the credit opportunities for beginning farmers by increasing the funding set aside in the Farm Service Agency loan programs and increasing the direct farm ownership and operating loan limit for the first time in over two decades   Socially disadvantaged farmers face many of the same challenges beginning farmers do   In recognition of this  the bill increases opportunities for socially disadvantaged farmers by authorizing wider participation in FSA loan programs   I am proud of the fact that this is the first farm bill ever to include a livestock title dedicated to the needs of livestock  poultry and egg producers  and aimed at promoting animal health and expanding market opportunities   Let me mention that  at the urging of Senator Durbin  the bill requires the creation of a Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission   This commission would be responsible for reviewing the nations food safety system and making recommendations on how best to modernize the current structure   Over the last year  weve had outbreaks of E  coli contamination in bagged spinach and lettuce and numerous recalls of very large quantities of meat and meat products   Weve had repeated cases of contaminated food  everything from peanut butter to seafood to hamburger   So the work of this new Congressional Bipartisan Food Safety Commission will be both timely and urgent       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
