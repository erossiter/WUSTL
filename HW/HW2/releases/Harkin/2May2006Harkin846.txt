        Today the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Health and Human Services made clear the essential steps industry must take to ensure the health of our nation  s children   I have long advocated for stricter guidelines on junk food marketing directed at our kids   And I pleased that today  s report makes similar recommendations for industry  to improve marketing standards and strengthen enforcement of these critical limits                    Current efforts at industry self regulation  through the Children  s Advertising Review Unit  are completely inadequate   CARU has long failed to protect kids from the rampant junk food marketing targeted at them   I am also pleased that the Administration is encouraging food companies to adopt minimum nutrition standards for the foods marketed to kids   Meaningful nutrition standards are essential to effective industry self regulation              I am disappointed that the report makes only recommendations  without imposing any requirements on an industry largely out of control   If industry fails at the task of self regulation  stronger government action will be necessary   Parents are sick and tired of food companies undermining their rules and their values   And frankly  children are literally becoming sick from the skyrocketing rates of obesity   With the health of our children and our society at stake  all sectors of society must do their part   schools  parents  the government  and the food and marketing industries                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
