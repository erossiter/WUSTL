     In my 20 years in the Senate  I have never before opposed an Iowan for an appointment  regardless of their political affiliation or philosophy   But I cannot support this nominee            By his own admission  Thomas Dorr setup his farm operations in a manner which evaded the law and then knowingly misrepresented this arrangement to the government               What is worse  it appears that additional money  perhaps more than  70 000  is still owed to USDA   Both Mr  Dorr and the Administration consistently and steadfastly refuse to provide Congress with any documentation to clear this very serious matter up            Today  after four years of questioning and examination of this nomination  he finally acknowledged and apologized for these actions   This eleventh hour apology and public admission of wrong doing may be significant  but that is not enough to reward him with a top job at USDA                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
