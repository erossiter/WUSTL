       WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  announced today that he secured  6 5 million to support law enforcement and combat crime and drug abuse in Iowa   This funding was included in the FY 2006 Commerce  Justice  and Science  CJS  Appropriations Bill   The bill must be signed by the President before it becomes law                 These funds are absolutely critical to Iowa  s ability to combat meth and prevent crime     Harkin said    Meth continues to plague Iowa  and while Iowa law enforcement has taken some successful steps to reduce this drug  s supply and demand  it is still too readily available  I am pleased that Congress has repudiated the President  s ill conceived efforts to eliminate local law enforcement assistance programs and instead continues to fund many of these vital programs                 Details of the funding are below              REGIONAL METH LAB TASK FORCES    1 3 million   These task forces help make inroads into the growing clandestine meth lab problem   The funding allows two separate 18 county law enforcement teams to work together with the state Drug Narcotics Enforcement team to apprehend the most significant meth manufacturers and importers   Harkin established these multi county drug task forces in 2002                 IOWA TANKS A LOCK METH INITIATIVE     300 000   This funding will be used to continue a Harkin project that makes it more difficult for meth producers to steal anhydrous ammonia  a key ingredient in the meth cocktail   Harkin started this project in 2002  and so far 51 Iowa counties have successfully been provided with nurse tank locks  with another 20 counties in progress   A recent analysis found that the locked counties saw a four percent drop in clandestine labs compared to a 113 percent increase in the amount of clandestine labs in unlocked counties   This funding will provide locks for an additional 20 counties bringing the total to 90 locked counties                JAIL TREATMENT PILOT PROJECT     800 000   This program will support jail based meth treatment in Polk  Scott and Woodbury counties where meth abuse is high   The program provides drug treatment services for early  non violent offenders before they reach the state prison system and engage in more violent offenses              COMMUNITY JUVENILE INTERVENTION     800 000   The funding will pay for locally designed programs to increase the number of juveniles providing community service  strengthen the partnerships between juvenile court officers and schools  improve the availability and results of juvenile drug courts and provide more restitution to victims              LEGAL HEALTH AID PILOT PROJECT     300 000   The direct links between medical care and legal problems for low income Americans have for the most part been unaddressed   This funding would allow the creation of a two year collaborative pilot program between Iowa Legal Aid and the Iowa Nebraska Primary Care Association   The program will seek to reduce escalating health care costs by providing a legal referral to address underlying legal issues in cases of domestic violence  nutrition and federal benefits  guardianship and elder abuse                DRUG ENDANGERED CHILDREN     400 000   The Drug Endangered Children  DEC  program is a statewide effort to create rapid response teams to leverage the resources of the criminal justice system  human services  juvenile court and public health system in identifying and caring for the children of substance abusing caregivers  particularly meth abusing caregivers   This funding will allow teams to be created in three to four additional locations across the state                   MIDWEST FORENSICS RESOURCE CENTER  IOWA STATE UNIVERSITY    1 150 000   The Midwest Forensics Resource Center  MFRC  works to improve the availability  quantity  and quality of forensics training in rural areas  crime laboratory performance  the practice of forensics sciences through research and development projects and university education in the forensics sciences    SIOUX CITY REGIONAL TRAINING CENTER    1 000 000   For training of law enforcement officers in Sioux City               IOWA METH DEMAND DIVERSION AND REDUCTION    50 000                REGIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TRAINING CENTER AT IOWA CENTRAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE    300 000             IOWA CREATIVE VISIONS  DES MOINES     50 000   Creative Visions seeks to empower high risk youth and young adults by giving them alternatives to their current lifestyles through jobs  education and support services            URBAN DREAMS  DES MOINES     50 000   Urban Dreams is working with the City of Des Moines  Polk County  the State of Iowa  United Way  and Drake to provide human service programs including information and referral  ex offender support and youth recreational opportunities             Unfortunately  the bill includes a significant cut to two national law enforcement and drug fighting programs   The Byrne Justice Assistance Grant program was cut by  200 million and the COPS program was cut by  120 million  Byrne Grants help state and local governments support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime  including law enforcement programs  prosecution and court programs  prevention and education programs  corrections and community corrections programs  drug treatment programs and planning  evaluation  and technology improvement programs   Harkin was a leader in defeating the President  s FY 2006 budget proposal to eliminate all funding for the Byrne grant program             The COPS program provides law enforcement agencies with an array of community policing training and technical assistance resources  Many police chiefs  sheriffs and criminal justice experts have credited community policing    a strategy that uses partnerships between law enforcement officers and the people they serve    with the reduction in violent crime over the past seven years  Harkin helped to develop the COPS program under the 1994 Crime Bill             The bill does provide  63 5 million for the COPS Meth program  an  11 7 million increase from last year  Harkin has also been a longtime supporter of COPS Meth program  which has been crucial in our fight against methamphetamine
