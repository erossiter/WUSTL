 WASHINGTON  DC  Senator Tom Harkin announced today that he has received a commitment from other influential senators to address low Medicaid reimbursement rates affecting eight Iowa hospitals  These mid sized hospitals are being inadequately reimbursed for providing care to Medicare patients  The current reimbursement structure has caused some of these facilities to struggle to keep their doors open        Every Iowan deserves access to quality healthcare and community hospitals are key to providing that access  said Harkin  No hospital should be penalized simply because of its size and location  I am glad to have raised awareness of this issue and am committed to solving this problem       During negotiations on legislation to extend the Medicare program  Harkin raised the issue with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus  D MT  and ranking member Chuck Grassley  R IA  and received a written commitment from both to address the issue  The fix would likely be included in a Medicare reform package that will be crafted early next year by the Senate Finance Committee        Current Medicaid policy reimburses these hospitals at only 60 percent of the cost of providing care to Iowa seniors  That is ridiculous  said Harkin  These facilities are essential to giving our seniors access to high quality healthcare in their own hometowns  and I intend to make sure they can continue to do so       Iowa hospitals affected by unfair Medicaid reimbursement rates include          Grinnell Regional Medical Center  Grinnell        Keokuk Area Hospital  Keokuk        Fort Madison Community Hospital  Fort Madison        Unity Health System  Muscatine        Skiff Medical Center  Newton        St  Anthony Regional Hospital  Carroll        Spencer Municipal Hospital  Spencer        Lakes Regional Health Care  Spirit Lake                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
