      WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter to the Department of Transportation  s Surface Transportation Board  STB   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  urged the Board to maintain oversight and ensure steps are taken to reduce difficulties related to shipping coal through Iowa by rail on the Dakota  Minnesota and Eastern Railroad DM  While STB requires their review of an environmental assessment to identify potential community impacts before starting coal shipments  the DM has petitioned to waive this requirement for its subsidiary  the Iowa  Chicago and Eastern Railroad  IC    Harkin called on the STB to reject this waiver                 There  s no good reason why we shouldn  t have proper oversight by the Surface Transportation Board   We must be able to assess potential problems this could create for affected communities and determine how to minimize them before shipping coal in Iowa on the DM lines     Harkin said     There  s plenty of time to identify what reasonable steps can be taken to avoid any problems for citizens in Dubuque  Mason City and other Iowa towns where DM is looking to ship coal   The Board needs to treat the Iowa case just as they did Minnesota and South Dakota where improvements like overpasses are being created to reduce the burden caused by coal trains                We appreciate Senator Harkin s support on this critical issue for Dubuque     said Dubuque Mayor Roy Buol     Increased coal train traffic through our community could negatively impact all that we have accomplished in recent years on our riverfront and limit our plans for continued development in that area   We are also very concerned about the public safety issues related to increased train traffic through the heart of Dubuque  especially emergency vehicle access to all parts of our community              A number of Iowa communities could face significant traffic delays  noise and other difficulties from as a result of increased coal shipments traveling though their area   The Iowa Department of Transportation  as well as a number of local governments  has expressed opposition to DM  s waiver request   While the DM has reached out to Iowa communities  plans to mitigate environmental risk have not progressed   DM does not expect to begin shipping of coal until 2009                                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
