          I thank Senators Kohl and Hatch for holding this hearing on enforcement of antitrust laws   It is an issue that deserves a lot of attention because it is very important to independent producers and rural America  Consolidation and vertical integration of the packing and processing industries continue to increase  limiting producer market options and their ability to compete in a fair marketplace                                  Currently in the United States  the top four firms control 50 percent of hog production and 64 percent of hog processing   In cattle procurement  the top four firms control 84 percent of cattle slaughter                             With so few buyers left  a handful of companies can more easily exert market power and require take it or leave it contracts forcing producers to make a fundamental decision  sign the contract and go along with unfair practices  or just simply walk away from their family farm and find another occupation                          There are a number of ways to address a heavily consolidated and vertically integrated marketplace  most notably  not allowing anti competitive mergers to occur   Congress enacted the Sherman and Clayton Acts to protect consumers and producers against concentrated power and leverage   The Department of Justice is charged with enforcing these laws   But history shows that the Department is not committed to preventing  or altering industry mergers and acquisitions that lessen competition                               In recent years  the Department of Justice allowed Smithfield Foods to acquire the Farmland Foods pork division  thereby eliminating an entire buyer of hogs in Iowa     Smithfield s market share in pork processing increased from 20 to 26 percent   Last fall  Smithfield announced its intentions to acquire Premium Standard Farms  which could push Smithfield s market share in pork processing to over 30 percent   Although this acquisition is still under review by the Department  I cannot emphasize enough that there be a thorough review and that the effects on producers  not just consumers be carefully evaluated                           As the former Ranking Democratic Member and now Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  I am fully aware of how detrimental lax enforcement of laws designed to protect producers from unfair and anti competitive practices can have on the marketplace   Just last year  a report by USDA s Inspector General  which I commissioned  found widespread inaction  efforts to block investigations of unfair and anti competitive conduct  and even efforts to cook the books to give the appearance of actual enforcement by the Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration at the Department of Agriculture                              This year  the Agriculture Committee will be crafting a new farm bill and I look forward to working with the Judiciary Committee to protect producers from unfair and anti competitive practices   Most notably  the producer impacts from a merger or acquisition must be properly evaluated by the Department of Justice before it blesses such a transaction                                 Recently  I introduced the  Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2007   which will serve as the basis for developing a competition package in the new farm bill   This legislation will strengthen the Agricultural Fair Practices Act and clarify and improve enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act                           Again  I appreciate Senators Kohl and Hatch for holding this much needed hearing today and look forward to working with the committee as the farm bill process starts to unfold to protect producers from unfair and anti competitive practices                                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
