 WASHINGTON D C   In a letter to President George W  Bush today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   and a bipartisan group of members of Congress  called on him to correct the eligibility for Montgomery GI education benefits for the First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry  1 34th BCT   Upon soldiers return from serving one the longest deployments of the Iraq war  approximately half of the 1 34th BCT  including over 1 200 members from Iowa  Minnesota  New Jersey  North Dakota  Idaho  and Wisconsin  were told they were not eligible for the education benefits  In order to receive educational benefits  members of the National Guard must serve 730 days in active duty  While the members of this brigade exceeded that requirement  their orders misstated that they served only 729 days  thus preventing these soldiers from collecting their already earned education benefits   The brave men and women of the 1st Battalion served as part of the longest continuous deployment of the Iraq war  spending nearly two years in active duty and 17 months in Iraq  To claim now that they did not spend enough time deployed to qualify for education benefits is absurd on its face  said Harkin  These service members honorably performed their duties and it is long overdue for President Bush to stand up and fix this problem   Senator Harkin also co sponsored S  2139  The National Guard and Reserve Educational Benefits Fairness Act  which was introduced by Senator Amy Klobuchar  D MN   This bill would provide educational benefits to members of the National Guard based on the length of their actual Active Duty service  rather than based on the service dates printed on their orders  This bill would eliminate the 730 day order requirement for members of the Selected Reserve  and would make soldiers mobilized to Active Duty for 20 consecutive months after September 11  2001  who served at least 12 months in a theater of operations  eligible for benefits   A copy of the letter is below   October 16  2007    The Honorable George W  Bush  President  The White House  Washington  D C  20500  Dear President Bush   We write today to request your assistance in resolving a matter of great inequity affecting some of the finest members of our nations armed forces  We respectfully request that you take corrective action regarding a disparity relative to eligibility for Montgomery GI education benefits for the First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry   The First Brigade Combat Team of the 34th Infantry recently returned from an active duty tour in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom  OIF   This unit  known as the Red Bulls  has a history of excellence and bravery that dates back to the Civil War  Just as their comrades who served before them  the members of the 1 34th performed magnificently in their duties in the Middle East consistent with the highest tradition of armed services   Their deployment kept them in Iraq 30 days longer than any other unit serving as a part of OIF  During their time  they drove over 4 500 round trip convoy missions logging 2 2 million miles of convoys in Iraq  In other areas they fought al Qaida and provided critical security to our military bases  saving countless lives of their comrades in arms   Approximately half of the 1 34th BCT  including over 1 200 members from Minnesota  Iowa  New Jersey  North Dakota  Idaho  Wisconsin  Kansas  and Nebraska  have realized that despite their extended service  they are not eligible for the education benefits they deserve  Because of an inexplicable difference in their active duty orders  soldiers who were deployed for the same amount of time to Iraq as many of their comrades are not able to claim Chapter 30 education benefits  In many of the cases  their orders reflect 729 days of service when 730 is the necessary number   Many of us have been in touch with Secretary of the Army Peter Geren about the issue but unfortunately the Secretary does not have the authority to amend these orders to reflect the true service of these troops  The issue has been referred to the Army Board for Correction of Military Records  but the board has disallowed these affected servicemembers from applying as a group   delaying their prospects for success and jeopardizing their ability to enroll in the 2008 spring semester at colleges and universities across the country   Because of their extended service and the extreme circumstances involved in their particular case  we ask that you take action  including the issuance of an Executive Order if necessary  to grant the members of the 1 34th Chapter 30 Active Duty GI Bill education benefits immediately  These troops and their families deserve nothing less   Sincerely   Senators     Representatives       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
