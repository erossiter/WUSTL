         WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter to President Bush  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today urged the President to stop undercutting America  s renewable fuels industry   In recent weeks  President Bush has praised renewable fuels as a way to wean the United States off its dangerous and costly dependence on foreign oil   Over the same period  he has proposed suspending the ethanol tariff to encourage greater imports of ethanol from Brazil and elsewhere and giving Clean Air waivers for refiners to avoid using cleaner burning ethanol   These proposals send mixed signals to the biofuels industry and promise to undermine domestic ethanol and biodiesel production   The letter is signed by a group of Democrats including Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Dick Durbin  D IL   Tim Johnson  D SD  and Barack Obama  D IL                     The President cannot have it both ways   We  ve now heard the President tout ethanol as a solution to America  s energy problems and at the very same time  undercut it by encouraging foreign subsidized ethanol imports     said Harkin     We cannot substitute our dependence on foreign oil for dependence on foreign ethanol   America needs to focus on meeting our own energy needs by boosting home grown biofuels production                   Harkin  s letter notes two main concerns about President Bush  s recent comments relating to ethanol   The President has urged the end of tariffs imposed on foreign ethanol   Since refiners receive tax incentives for blending ethanol  lifting the tariff would  in effect  subsidize foreign production of ethanol  much of which is already subsidized in its country of origin   The President has also proposed waivers for refiners to avoid meeting Clean Air act standards   Since ethanol is used as a fuel additive that helps refiners meet Clean Air Act standards  these waivers would increase air pollutants and undercut the ethanol industry                  It  s unfortunate and misguided the President has chosen to blame the ethanol industry for rising gas prices   The rapidly expanding ethanol industry is adding to our nation  s supply of fuel while making our air cleaner     said Harkin     The President  s Clean Air waivers are a lose lose proposition for America  s air quality and our ability to produce energy here at home                   The letter also notes that the President  s budget fails to live up to what he signed into law through the energy bill to boost development of biofuels made from traditional sources like corn and soybeans as well as from corn stalks  wood chips  switchgrass and other sources  cellulosic ethanol    The Bush Administration fiscal year 2007 budget provides less than half the amount called for in the energy bill to support this cause            Text of the letter is below          May 9  2006            The Honorable George W  Bush      President of the United States      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW      Washington  DC 20500         Dear Mr  President          We are greatly concerned about your sending mixed messages to the American people  the renewable fuels industry and Congress with respect to the promotion of domestic biofuels   As you know  the country is mired in a gas price crisis  and imports of petroleum are going up  not down   The Energy Information Administration of the U S  Department of Energy currently projects we will import as much as 70 percent of our petroleum needs by 2030          This is not the time to call into question the role that home grown renewable fuels can play in reducing prices at the pump and our dangerous dependence on foreign oil   We welcome your statements in support of ethanol and biofuels  but we disagree with your suggestion to an audience of renewable fuels advocates last month that ethanol is partly responsible for the run up in gasoline prices   In fact  ethanol makes up a fraction of the cost of a gallon of gasoline  the majority of which is the international price of crude oil  now hovering in the  70 75 per barrel range   In fact  if not for the increasing supply of ethanol in the marketplace  prices would be even higher              To the extent the phase out of MTBE may contribute to higher gasoline prices in some cases  that situation developed because the petroleum industry insisted on continuing to use MTBE  despite its known environmental risks  instead of making an orderly transition to ethanol much sooner   Now that those companies have finally realized that Congress is not going to exempt them from liability for MTBE  s environmental damages  they are switching to ethanol   That is not the fault of the ethanol industry   Hence we see no justification for waiving air quality standards  as you have suggested  simply because the petroleum industry has thus far favored MTBE and disfavored ethanol          Last week you called for repealing the tariff on imported ethanol  with the expectation that the United States would thus import more ethanol and bring down gasoline prices   This would be a serious mistake that would undermine a carefully targeted U S  tax incentive promoting the growth and development of our domestic renewable fuels industry   All the tariff does is offset the tax credit  so that it only goes to domestically produced ethanol   Without the tariff  our U S  tax incentive would help support ethanol production in foreign countries   Our focus must be on building energy security through domestically produced renewable fuels          In any case  ethanol imports are neither necessary nor a practical response to current gasoline prices   We have sufficient ethanol production here at home  and it is expanding every day   The Renewable Fuels Association estimates that 500 million gallons of additional production capacity will be on line by early July of this year   That is enough to replace MTBE and to supply already existing ethanol markets   Meanwhile  there is no ready supply of foreign ethanol to be shipped to the United States   The other major ethanol producer  Brazil  recently lowered the mandated ethanol content of its national fuel portfolio from 25 percent to 20 percent because it is short of ethanol   Last year  the United States imported only 80 million gallons of ethanol from Caribbean countries  well short of the 270 million they are allowed to ship us tariff free under the Caribbean Basin Initiative  CBI              We also welcomed the call in your State of the Union speech earlier this year for increased federal investment to produce greater supplies of domestic ethanol   We want to work with you to make this investment a reality  but your Fiscal Year 2007  FY07  budget proposes less than half the funding for biomass energy research and development authorized in the energy bill you signed into law last year   What  s worse  where your budget does call for increased funding  it comes from reductions in other renewable energy and energy efficiency initiatives   We urge you to reconsider your budget proposal and submit a revised budget request with adequate funding for these initiatives in light of the current energy crisis          Your Administration  s recent actions cannot be reconciled with the stated goals of your energy program   We urge you to abandon your focus on providing incentives to foreign countries to ship ethanol into the United States  to uphold air quality standards and to work with us to expand domestic renewable fuels production            Sincerely          Senators Tom Harkin  Byron Dorgan  Dick Durbin  Tim Johnson  Barack Obama  D IL
