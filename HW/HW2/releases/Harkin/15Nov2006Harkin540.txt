      Washington  D C     On the heels of new USDA data revealing that food insecurity declined in 2005  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called for increased efforts to build on the success and promote economic security among working Americans and those of meager means   The USDA report  Household Food Security in the United States  2005  is part of an annual analysis undertaken by USDA that estimates national and state rates of hunger and food insecurity  or situations in which families skip meals or reduce variety in their diets due to lack of resources            After five consecutive years of increasing food security  it is a welcome change to see that the number of food insecure Americans fell by nearly three million in 2005     said Harkin     Certainly this is evidence that hunger and food insecurity are not intractable problems   The solution is within reach   But much more must be done to ensure that all Americans can put food on their tables             Among the findings of the USDA report are the following          Between 2004 and 2005  food insecurity in America decreased from 38 2 million to 35 1 million   However  the number of Americans experiencing food insecurity is still over 4 million higher than its most recent low of 31 million in 1999   Between 2004 and 2005  the rates of household food insecurity dropped from 11 9 percent to 11 percent  but remains above the most recent low of 10 1 percent in 1999         Despite changes in overall food insecurity  the rate of very low food security remained unchanged at 3 9 percent of households   Households with very low food security are families who experienced hunger or reduced their food intake during the year         Certain groups continue to disproportionately experience hunger and food insecurity  including female headed households  30 8 percent   Hispanic families  17 9 percent   and African American families  22 4 percent             In this land of plenty it  s shocking to realize that 35 million Americans continue to struggle with food insecurity   I  m convinced we can and must do better     said Harkin     We can start by strengthening federal food assistance programs   But we must also increase the minimum wage and ensure that our tax policy benefits all Americans              Senator Tom Harkin is the Ranking Democratic Member of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  where he has been a long time proponent of federal food assistance programs for low income Americans  such as the Food Stamp Program  National School Lunch Program  and the WIC Program   Harkin has also advocated and played a key role in crafting numerous legislative proposals to ensure program integrity and sound management of federal food assistance programs                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
