      President Bush has proposed creating private Social Security accounts and cutting benefits by one third or more  even for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts   Workers could invest two thirds of their Social Security contribution in stocks and bonds  but those returns could not make up for the deep benefit cuts and would be subject to the whims of Wall Street            Even many supporters of the president  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved          WHO          Senator Tom Harkin         WHAT        Fix It  Don  t Nix It Social Security Forum          WHEN               9 45 AM                           Saturday  May 14         WHERE     Area Education Agency 267             3712 Cedar Heights Drive              Cedar Falls                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
