     WASHINGTON  DC    U S  Senators Chuck Grassley  R IA  and Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation that will extend the Livestock Price Reporting Act by one year  The Livestock Price Reporting Act requires packers  processors  and importers to provide critical price  contracting  supply and demand information to the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA   which uses the information to create price reports for livestock producers   The base price for many livestock contracts are established directly from reports resulting from the Livestock Price Reporting Act    The law is set to expire at the end of the month              Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting levels the playing field for farmers by giving them the information they need to make sound decisions in livestock markets     Harkin said                We  ve heard from enough livestock producers to know that there can be improvement to this important law     Grassley said     Waiting until the Government Accountability Office report is completed so we can make appropriate adjustments to the legislation just makes sense                 Last year  Harkin and Grassley requested a Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation into the accuracy of reported prices by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA     There have been several concerns regarding administration of the program ranging from late filed reports by packers  whether negotiated purchases are being portrayed correctly in price reports  and inadequate oversight at USDA to ensure compliance and enforcement of the law   The bill introduced today by Harkin and Grassley would continue the program over the next year while allowing time to identify weaknesses in the existing law and incorporate recommendations once GAO has competed its report   The report is expected to be completed in December   The House Agriculture Committee has already approved a bill that will extend the law for five years   The House and Senate will need to work out differences to pass a final bill reauthorizing the Livestock Price Reporting Act              Iowa  s livestock producers have made it abundantly clear that there is no reason to move forward without substantive review and improvement to the current program     Grassley said     We should take the opportunity to improve this legislation and not push forward without the recommendations from the GAO                It would be a mistake to provide a long term extension of the law before GAO has had time to finish its work     said Harkin     If there are problems with the law  then Congress has a responsibility to producers to fix it  and to do so next year  as our bill envisions              Grassley and Harkin pushed for the creation of the law in 1999 to help improve competition and market transparency for livestock producers                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
