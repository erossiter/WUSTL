           I am pleased that Congress passed the Presidential Coin Act  which honors past presidents  increases use of the  1 coin and provides an economic boost to the Cedar Rapids area     Harkin said    Not only will this increase jobs in the area  it will promote the history of U S Presidents                Under the bill  four  1 coins will be issued each year starting in 2007 that will bear the image of deceased Presidents in chronological order   The legislation also encourages increased usage of the coins through federal government  transit system and other programs   It would also create four different images for the penny honoring the 200th anniversary of President Lincoln  s birth in 2009                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
