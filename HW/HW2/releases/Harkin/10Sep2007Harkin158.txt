 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued the following statement   Today  General Petraeus once again came to Capitol Hill to ask Congress to prolong our involvement in Iraqs civil war  His assessment of the situation in Iraq was positive  but not independent  The simple fact is that asking General Petraeus to evaluate the surge he has overseen in Iraq is like asking a college student to grade his own term paper   In 2004  when General Petraeus was charged with training Iraqi security forces  he made a similar positive assessment of the situation in Iraq in a Washington Post op ed  He said then that Iraqi forces were stepping forward  leading their country and that they showed a determination and desire to accept the full burden of security tasks for Iraq  That was nearly three long years ago and we have come to find out differently  Most importantly  since the Generals encouraging news in 2004  we have lost nearly 2 700 more American troops in this conflict   The Bush Administration and Senate Republicans have continually asked the American people to wait until September to evaluate the effectiveness of the surge that began last January  Well  September has come and the situation in Iraq is the same  the Iraqi government has still failed to make progress towards reconciliation and our troops are still policing a civil war that requires a political  not a military  solution   Tomorrow will mark the sixth anniversary of September 11  a day on which barbarity and hatred came to our nations shores and was met by heroism and bravery to make all Americans proud  This anniversary is a stark reminder of why we must combat terror as effectively as possible   The simple truth is that America cannot be as safe as it should be when our troops remain mired in a civil war in Iraq that has no foreseeable end  It is time to pursue a different strategy and redeploy our troops  It is unwise and it is immoral to ask our brave young men and women to continue putting their lives on the line when the Iraqi government cannot do the most basic work necessary to bring their country together   Evidence from the recently released GAO Report and the National Intelligence Estimate overwhelmingly show that the Iraqi government has failed to make political progress  the very thing which this latest surge was supposed to enable them to do  Our brave troops professionalism  capability  and courage are unparalleled  However  our outstanding troops cannot end Iraqs civil war  Only Iraqs government can do that and they so far have refused to take the actions needed to do so   Congress must take the necessary steps to require the Bush Administration to redeploy our troops so that we can pursue a smarter campaign against the terrorists who threaten us       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
