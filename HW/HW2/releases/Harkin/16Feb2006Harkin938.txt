    Washington  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation to improve competition in livestock markets and fairness in the production and sale of agricultural commodities    The   Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2006     proposes a series of changes in response to the failure by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to prevent unfair  manipulative and anti competitive behavior prohibited under the Packers and Stockyards Act   This bill will also strengthen the ability of producers to succeed in cases involving unfair and manipulative practices by packers and provide needed protections for producers that use agricultural contracts               Economic concentration is like the narrow point of an hourglass   On one side  farmers are paid less than they should  and on the other side consumers have to pay more     Harkin said     The livestock and poultry industry has changed dramatically in the past fifteen years making it all the more critical that there be increased enforcement of bad actors in the marketplace              The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  has resisted investigating violations of existing laws by the meat industry   Recently  a USDA Inspector General  s report commissioned by Harkin detailed widespread inaction at the Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA  in enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act   The report detailed actions by management to prevent employees from conducting investigations into complaints of anti competitive behavior and efforts to cover up the lack of enforcement through inflating the reported number of investigations    The report also makes clear the lack of attention by high level USDA officials to oversee and manage GIPSA to ensure enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act             We  ve witnessed a widespread failure by USDA in enforcing existing producer protections     Harkin said     We need to get rid of extra layers of bureaucracy and allow competition issues to be in the forefront  rather than swept under the rug as they currently are             Harkin  s bill would              Reorganize USDA to establish an Office of Special Counsel whose sole responsibility will be to investigate and prosecute violations on competition matters   Currently  the Deputy Administrator at GIPSA oversees the Packers and Stockyards program and has the responsibility of enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act  GIPSA personnel responsible for investigating violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act would be transferred to The Office of Special Counsel   The Special Counsel would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate   This position will also serve as a liaison between the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission          Make the following amendments to the Packers and Stockyards Act               Strengthen Producer Protections by making it easier for them to prove unfair actions by packers without additional burdens of having to prove adverse affects on competition   For example  recent court decisions such as London vs  Fieldale Farms have ruled that in order for producers to succeed in cases involving unfair actions they must prove how it adversely affects competition for their region    These rulings will now complicate USDA  s ability to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act              Strengthen USDA  s authority in enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act over the poultry industry and make it more in line with livestock   Currently  it is illegal for poultry integrators to engage in unfair or anti competitive practices  but the enforcement section of the law to prosecute violations was left out many years ago           Make the following changes to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act                 Prohibits unfair or deceptive practices by a person that affects the marketing  receiving  purchasing  sale or contracting of agricultural commodities                 Provides needed contract protections to ensure that the contract clearly spells out what is required of the producer   Harkin  s bill would require giving the producer at least 3 days to review or cancel the contract   Harkin  s bill would prevent confidentiality clauses so that producers are free to share the contract with family members or a lawyer to help them decide whether or not they should sign it   The legislation would also protect producers from having their contracts prematurely terminated if they have made a sizable capital investment   The bill also prevents mandatory arbitration so that producers are not prevented from going to the courts to speak out against unfair actions by companies                 Prevent discrimination against producers belonging to an organization or cooperative by removing a disclaimer clause allowing processors  handlers  or contractors to refuse to do business with producers just because they belong to such organizations          The livestock industry has changed dramatically in the past 15 years with many producers now relying on contracts with packers to conduct business   As of 2004  only four firms control 84 percent of the procurement of cattle and four firms control 64 percent of the procurement of hogs   Economists have stated that when four firms control over 40 percent of the industry  marketplace competitiveness begins to decline   With fewer buyers of livestock and poultry  producers have significantly fewer choices  if any  with whom they conduct business and are forced to sign contracts to remain in the industry   This decreases competitiveness not only for agricultural producers but will ultimately cause increased prices for consumers as well   Harkin  s proposal would modernize and strengthen laws such as the Packers and Stockyards Act of 1921 and the Agricultural Fair Practices Act of 1967 to account for the dramatic market changes in the agricultural industry and ensure individual producers can compete in these markets   Further information compiled by Senator Harkin  s Senate Agriculture Committee staff can be viewed at  http
