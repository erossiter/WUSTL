           Fighting meth requires a comprehensive  nationwide approach     said Harkin     A dramatic reduction of meth labs is already occurring in Iowa   We need a federal law because we want to see a drop in labs in every state and we want to see it soon   Iowa  s law is the best in the country and has been a tremendous success but it is only a only a matter of time before we see meth labs in Iowa using pseudoephedrine bought in Illinois and other neighboring states                Since the legislation was introduced earlier this year  Harkin has successfully worked with his Senate colleagues to strengthen the measure  and most significantly to guarantee that Iowa  s law will remain in effect and not be weakened by any federal provisions   Harkin also worked to strengthen the federal bill by getting the following changes made                         Covers all pseudoephedrine products including liquid                        Limits the cumulative amount of pseudoephedrine purchased per month to 7 5 grams                       Allows limited sale of pseudoephedrine in airports in a way that mirrors Iowa  s retail exception              Methamphetamine is perhaps the most deadly  fiercely addictive and rapidly spreading drug the United States has known   During the past decade  while law enforcement officers continue to bust record numbers of clandestine labs  meth use in communities has increased by as much as 300 percent   The continuing proliferation of methamphetamine production continues to put a severe strain on federal and local entities                Meth continues to plague Iowa destroying lives  families and entire communities     said Harkin     This critical legislation will help provide Iowa  s law enforcement officers with the tools they need to fight meth across the state and keep Iowans drug free                 Fighting meth requires a comprehensive approach designed to assist states  local law enforcement and prosecutors to crack down on cooks and traffickers of meth while enhancing community education and awareness and treatment options for those addicted to this dangerous drug   Harkin has been a leader in Congress pushing to strengthen local law enforcement and substance abuse programs  In Iowa  51 kg of meth were seized and approximately 1 400 labs were discovered in 2004   In 2003  1240 meth labs were discovered                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
