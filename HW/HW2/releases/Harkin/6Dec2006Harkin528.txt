      WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued the following statement regarding the new report released by the Iraq Study Group            I am pleased that the United States Institute of Peace hosted the Iraq Study Group  The ISG spent nine months delving into the hard questions of our policy in Iraq and the group  s report reflects many of the points the Senate Democrats stated in a letter to President Bush in late June 2006  It is my sincere hope that this is the end of failed stay the course rhetoric and the beginning of a real solution to bringing our troops home            The findings are an indictment of the President  s failed policies in the Middle East  The report clearly acknowledges that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating  The report rightfully calls for a new and enhanced diplomatic effort in the region to include dialogue with Iran and Syria  additional focus on Afghanistan  and a renewed and sustained commitment by the U S  to a comprehensive approach to the Arab Israeli conflict  Additionally  the ISG reinforces the vital need for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own political destiny            Unfortunately the President has previously rejected talking to Iran and Syria  He has resisted linking the Iraq war to the Palestinian issue  He has also resisted punishing Iraqis for not making progress on the issue of security  The President has shown his talk of new ideas is simply that  It  s my sincere hope that this report can persuade the President that a dramatic change is needed in our approach to Iraq            The President owes it to the brave members of the military to find a way out of the mess he  s made  Our troops have preformed brilliantly and accomplished their task  Our troops achieved their goals despite a series of disastrous decisions by their civilian leaders here in Washington  But there is little left our military can do  It is time to bring the troops home and concentrate on finding a political solution to the crisis in Iraq                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
