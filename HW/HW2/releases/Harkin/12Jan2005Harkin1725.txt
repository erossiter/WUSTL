        These actions by the Bush Administration clearly indicate they too see the No Child Left Behind Act as failing to reach the goals it was designed to meet     Harkin said     Why else would journalists be paid to promote it              Earlier this week  it was revealed that conservative pundit and commentator Armstrong Williams was paid  240 000 to promote President Bush  s No Child Left Behind Act on his syndicated radio program and in his syndicated column   This discovery regarding Williams is the latest    and most disturbing    in a series of actions by the Bush Administration to manipulate public opinion through covert propaganda   On May 19  2004  the GAO found that the U S  Department of Health and Human Services  HHS  illegally spent taxpayer funds on covert propaganda by paying Ketchum Incorporated to produce fake news stories promoting the image of the new Medicare law             The administration should immediately establish procedures to prohibit using taxpayer funds for covert propaganda     Harkin said     It is imperative that the Bush administration recovers the money paid to journalist Armstrong Williams and Ketchum public relations firm in return for promoting the No Child Left Behind Act             To address this problem  Harkin also announced plans to introduce legislation that would require federal agencies that purchase advertising to state either in print or in spoken word that the ad was purchased at taxpayer expense  The legislation also requires federal agencies to report its entire advertising budget to Congress   The Government Accounting Office has documented eight instances of covert propaganda at the Office of Drug Control Policy and three instances at HHS            At the very least  this is a misuse of taxpayer dollars for a blatant propaganda effort   The administration should come clean with all such payments and see that this practice is stopped     said Harkin                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
