        Good morning   We have waited a long time for this day to come    too long   We could and should have voted on HR 810 more than a year ago  after it passed in the House with a strong bipartisan majority   We have lost valuable time   More to the point  America  s best medical researchers have lost valuable time                      But  be that as it may  HR 810 is finally being brought to the floor  and we will vote on it tomorrow afternoon   I want to thank Majority Leader Bill Frist for brokering the agreement to make this possible   Most of all  I want to thank all the families and patients who never gave up who kept up the pressure to bring this bill to the floor and who are so eager to see HR 810 sent to the President  s desk tomorrow afternoon   They have kept the faith   And now it is our job to see that they are not disappointed                  Under the unanimous consent agreement  we will debate and vote on three bills  But make no mistake  the only one that really matters is HR 810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   This is the one bill that  at long last  will unleash some of the most exciting and promising biomedical research of modern times                   But it  s not just us members of Congress who are saying that   Last week  Senator Specter and I sent a letter to the National Institutes of Health  asking their top scientists for their thoughts on stem cell research   Every single one of them said that embryonic stem cell research offers enormous potential                   Here  s what Dr  Elias Zerhouni  the director of the National Institute of Health  NIH   said     Embryonic stem cell research holds great promise for treating  curing  and improving our understanding of disease                    And this is from Dr  Elizabeth Nabel  the director of the heart institute    Embryonic stem cell research has vast potential for addressing critical health needs                 These scientists also agree that the research would move faster if the President  s restrictions were lifted   Dr  James Battey  the director of the NIH stem cell task force  wrote     The scientific community would be best served by having a greater number of human embryonic stem cell lines available for study                       And listen to this from Dr  Nora Volkow  director of the drug abuse institute     Access to a wider array of embryonic stem cell lines would definitely increase scientific opportunity and the chances of breakthrough discoveries                    My nephew  Kelly  is one of those people whose hopes depend on stem cell research   He has been a quadriplegic for 27 years  since suffering a spinal cord injury in a tragic accident on an aircraft carrier during his time in the U S  Navy   Kelly  s great hope is that embryonic stem cell research will lead to a breakthrough that might allow him to walk again   Every time I talk to Kelly  he asks me  When is the Senate going to be allowed to vote on HR 810                 Well  after more than a year of prayers and pressure  Kelly and millions of other Americans suffering from disease and paralysis will get their wish   I am optimistic that we have the 60 votes necessary to pass HR 810 tomorrow  and to send it immediately to the President  s desk                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
