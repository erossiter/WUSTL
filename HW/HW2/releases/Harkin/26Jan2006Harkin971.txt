 Photo  Video  or more info available              I am not only concerned that the Siouxland facility is facing consolidation in another state  but also about the flawed process being used     said Harkin     This closing could have a very negative impact on service delivery for Sioux City and I am concerned that the public has not been included in discussions about this closing  We need a solid analysis of the impacts on service and delivery time that includes input from the community before this decision is made   If the analysis shows that delivery service will be delayed in Siouxland or any of the surrounding communities then the closing should not happen                Sioux City is Iowa  s fourth largest city and the local postal center serves its residents and the surrounding area  At the meeting  Harkin raised concerns about the consolidation process  but also about potential service issues and other possible alternatives to consolidation   According the USPS officials  the public will not be notified until after a final decision has been made  with no input from the local community             Harkin also announced today that he has requested that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  conduct a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Eight months later  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing GAO  s recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process               I understand that that the Postal Service is under tremendous pressure to become more efficient and competitive and that consolidation has to be a part of that     said Harkin     But that is no excuse for not conducting consolidation analysis in an open way that allows community input and clearly communicates what they base their decision on   This process got off to a very poor start  and it seems that they have just ignored GAO  s recommendations                You can view a copy of the letter by clicking on the link below          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
