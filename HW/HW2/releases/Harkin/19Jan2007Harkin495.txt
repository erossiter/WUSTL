        This is the 20th hearing that Senator Specter and I have held on human embryonic stem cells  starting back in December 1998  one month after Dr  Jamie Thomson of the University of Wisconsin announced that he had isolated them for the first time   Since that time  I  ve talked to hundreds of patients and their family members about their hopes for this research   I  ve visited laboratories and talked to scientists   I  ve heard from ethicists and religious leaders   And every day  I become more and more convinced that we in Congress need to do all we can to promote this research            Meanwhile  the opponents have become more and more desperate   We saw that earlier this month during the hysteria over Dr  Anthony Atala  s new research on amniotic stem cells   Opponents breathlessly claimed that  on the basis of this one paper  embryonic stem cell research should be abandoned    even though Dr  Atala himself completely disagrees with that conclusion     It is essential    Dr  Atala wrote    that National Institute of Health funded researchers are able to fully pursue embryonic stem cell research as a complement to research into other forms of stem cells              A few days later  the White House released a 60 page polemic against embryonic stem cell research in which it touted research by Kevin Eggan of Harvard  who testified before my subcommittee last year   Here  s what Dr  Eggan wrote in response to that White House report     We are disappointed that the White House Office of Domestic Policy gave us no opportunity to correct the report  s clear misrepresentation of our work      On the contrary  we assert that human embryonic stem cells hold great promise to find new treatments and cures for diseases  and we support      the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act               The House overwhelmingly passed that bill earlier this month  and the Senate will pass it soon   There  s no question about that   The only question is what the President will do when the bill reaches his desk   Most people assume that he  ll veto it   But I  m not so sure              Earlier this month  White House spokeswoman Jeanie Mamo was quoted in a Gannett news story as saying this about stem cell research     The president has said that after careful and thoughtful deliberation with government and outside experts  there was only one moral line he said he would not cross and that is that federal taxpayer dollars should not be used in the destruction of embryos              This is a very interesting statement   Because if it  s true  the President should have no problem signing our bill   S  5 would not allow federal funding to be used for the destruction of embryos   That  s prohibited by the Dickey amendment  which is included every year in the Labor HHS appropriations bill   Our stem cell bill doesn  t have anything to say about the Dickey amendment            We  re only talking about using embryos that are going to be destroyed anyway   Every day  IVF clinics discard embryos that are no longer needed for fertility treatments   All we  re asking is to use stem cells from some of these excess embryos for research that could save people  s lives   No federal tax dollars would be used to derive the stem cells  that work would be done using nonfederal funding              So either this spokeswoman misrepresented the President  s position  in which case I expect she  s been taken out to the woodshed  or the White House just opened the door to signing our bill   I hope it  s the latter   I hope President Bush will listen to the scientists at the NIH and elsewhere who want this research to proceed   Most important  I hope he  ll listen to the millions of Americans who suffer from juvenile diabetes  spinal cord injuries  ALS  Parkinson  s  and cancer  who view stem cell research as their best hope for a treatment or cure            I want to thank all the witnesses who have taken the time to testify before us today   We have an outstanding group of scientists  all of whom I  ve met before at some point over the years   I hadn  t met Lauren Stanford until this morning  but I feel like I know her   Senator Kennedy and I talked about her a lot on the Senate floor last year  and her story helped us pass H R  810                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
