        It is appropriate for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement  ICE  to enforce our immigration laws and to investigate fraudulent identification practices   The individuals engaged in producing these documents appear to be engaged in wide scale fraud that puts law abiding citizens at risk            Enforcing our immigration laws includes detaining people suspected of being in this country illegally   However  the process used to detain individuals in the wake of Tuesday  s raids at the Swift Packing plant has been murky and lacking transparency  Days later it  s still unclear how many people are in custody or who they are                  My staff has and will continue to work to see that individuals detained in the Marshalltown incident are provided due process and access to legal counsel  We are also working to ensure that humanitarian steps are taken to accommodate individuals who have children who would otherwise be left parentless   We are not satisfied with the response that we have received from ICE regarding the treatment of some of those detained  including parents with young children  and are continuing to work with federal officials and members of the Marshalltown community to resolve this              This incident highlights the need for comprehensive reform to our antiquated immigration system  Only when we bring the 12 million illegal workers out of the shadows and into the legal system will both industry and employers benefit  These improvements must include increased security at our borders and a means to legal citizenship for immigrants already in the country  which would include fines  learning English  passing a background check and paying back taxes            It is high time that Congress moves forward and passes a comprehensive overhaul of our immigration system                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
