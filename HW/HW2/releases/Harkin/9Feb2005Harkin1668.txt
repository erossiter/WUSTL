        The Bush administration has imposed unwarranted and unlawful restrictions on food and agricultural trade with Cuba     Harkin said     I am pleased to join with my colleagues in order to remove these obstacles and make sure U S  agricultural producers are able to sell to Cuba under a known set of rules             Harkin has actively sought improved agricultural trade relations with Cuba   Harkin visited the island nation in the spring of 2003             I went to Cuba in the spring of 2003 in part to open the market for Iowa agricultural products  but also to pressure the Castro government to improve their treatment of their own citizens     Harkin said     I believe that we have to fully engage on all fronts to effect change in Cuba   Our policy of heavy trade sanctions for the past 40 years has hurt U S  farmers and businesses but failed to change Cuba   Congress has spoken in favor of trying something else and this administration should stop interfering with food and agriculture sales to Cuba                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
