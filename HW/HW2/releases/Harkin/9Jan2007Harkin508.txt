    Washington DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today joined a bipartisan group of senators in introducing legislation that would end the use of mandatory arbitration clauses in livestock and poultry contracts   These stipulations require that disputes be settled through arbitration  generally conducted by a mediator chosen by the packer or processor  and prevent producers from seeking legal remedy in courts    Large processors often demand mandatory arbitration clauses as a condition of conducting business  which often results in ongoing and unfair treatment for producers and growers   Harkin is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry            Producers or growers who feel they have been subject to breach of contract  fraud or illegal activity should be allowed to pursue their rights and remedies in our courts and not forced into arbitration     said Harkin     I fully intend to include this legislation in the upcoming farm bill             Mandatory arbitration clauses have been a common practice in the poultry industry and are gaining popularity in contracts offered by processors in the livestock industry as well   Under these mandatory arbitration clauses  the producer has to agree that any disputes or disagreements that may later arise will be submitted to an arbitrator for resolution   Producers typically have little or no choice but to acquiesce to such mandatory arbitration clauses in contracts since the contracts are often offered by packers and processors on a take it or leave it basis with no opportunity for two way negotiation   And since producers and growers have usually already invested in buildings and equipment  they must sign contracts with mandatory arbitration clauses or face receiving no birds or livestock to raise for income   Thus  the mandatory arbitration clauses help to strengthen the economic position of packers and processors versus producers            Harkin plans to introduce comprehensive competition legislation that will be the basis of a new competition title for the upcoming farm bill   Removing mandatory arbitration clauses will be one of a number of provisions in that legislation                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
