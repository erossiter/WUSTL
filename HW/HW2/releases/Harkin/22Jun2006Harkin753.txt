   Contact  Maureen Knightly Dave Townsend      June 22  2006            WASHINGTON  D C     In a bipartisan letter to the Bush Administration today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  called on the Bush Administration to help protect the interests of U S  agriculture in the current WTO negotiations   A text of the letter is below            When discussions on the current round of negotiations in the World Trade Organization  WTO  began  there was a broad  bipartisan consensus that our negotiators should focus on producing a good result for U S  agriculture   As this summer  s deadline for agreeing on the outlines of a WTO agreement approaches  we write to express our deep concern about the direction of the negotiations on agriculture   Our support for an agreement depends on achieving a balanced  ambitious outcome in which gains from new market access and the elimination of export subsidies provide net gains for U S  agriculture in relation to reductions in trade distorting domestic support             Last October  the United States put forward an ambitious proposal that included substantial cuts in U S  domestic farm programs if other countries would agree to significantly reduce their tariffs on agricultural products and provide greater access to their markets   Many of the farmers we represent were concerned that the cuts in farm programs would directly reduce their income  while the market access gains were speculative at best   However  your Administration insisted that its offer was conditional  if the market access gains did not materialize  the United States would not agree to a disproportionately ambitious reduction in domestic support                Unfortunately  many of our trading partners continue to call for greater cuts in U S  farm programs  even as they reject any movement toward real improvements in market access   These countries have refused to make significant tariff reductions  and they insist on exceptions for sensitive and special products that will render meaningless the modest tariff reductions they have proposed             It is not only U S  agriculture that stands to gain from reduced tariffs and greater market access in food and agriculture trade   Most economic studies conclude that the majority of benefits of trade agreements in agriculture are generated by significantly cutting tariffs on food and agriculture products   Thus  a failure of the WTO negotiations to achieve an ambitious outcome on market access will hurt not only U S  agriculture but also the global economy and people around the world            It is simply untenable for some of our WTO negotiating partners to suggest the onus is on the United States to accept an unbalanced proposal    one with substantial cuts in our trade distorting support but only minimal gains in access by U S  agriculture to foreign markets    in order to save the Doha Round from their reluctance to make ambitious market access offers   This is not an honest framing of the issue            An unbalanced proposal that asks U S  agriculture and rural communities to give more while getting less in market access is unacceptable   We urge you to direct your negotiators to reject any such proposal and instead insist on an ambitious  balanced result that will level the playing field for U S  agriculture  open foreign markets to U S  agricultural exports  and increase net income prospects for U S  farmers and ranchers                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
