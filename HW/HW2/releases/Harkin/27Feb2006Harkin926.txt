      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that the U S  Postal Service  USPS  will conduct a service audit of the proposed consolidation of Siouxland Mail Processing Operations  USPS is currently conducting a feasibility study to examine the possibility of moving all mail processing operations from Sioux City  Iowa to Sioux Falls  South Dakota  The audit  requested by Harkin  will help determine the impact the potential consolidation would have on the local community            USPS needs to be up front with all its stakeholders in the community     said Harkin     That  s why we need a solid analysis of the impacts on service and delivery time   Unless this is studied  promises of quality service will ring hollow   The community has a stake in this decision and they should be included in the process   If this audit shows that delivery service will deteriorate  then the closing should not happen             This audit is in addition to language Harkin included in the Postal Reform bill that would block USPS from implementing any consolidation study until the Postal Service conducts a transparent study   The provision makes all the analysis of potential service delays and consolidation costs public  and requires that the community be informed about consolidation and be able to provide input into the study process before a decision is made   This means that USPS cannot move mail processing operations from Sioux City  Iowa to Sioux Falls  South Dakota unless it includes public input in the consolidation process   The Postal Reform bill must now be considered by a House Senate Conference Committee   The President must sign the legislation before it becomes law          At Harkin  s request  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  is conducting a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Eight months later after GAO  s original report  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing the recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process          Throughout this process Harkin has repeatedly called on USPS to increase its communication with Siouxland community leaders    In late January  Harkin along with Siouxland area officials  met with Bill Galligan  Senior Vice President for Operations for USPS   However  USPS failed to clearly provide the criteria they used when making consolidation decisions or to provide a clear timeline of when it will make its final decision   Most important of all  local postal customers and businesses have received no explanation of likely service delays and degradations as a result of consolidation                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
