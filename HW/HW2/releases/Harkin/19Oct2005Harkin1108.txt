        American Forces Radio is funded by taxpayers    conservatives  liberals and moderates alike     said Harkin     Unfortunately  it is failing to provide balanced representation of political viewpoints on its airwaves to American service members around the world   Defense officials have been dragging their feet for far too long  and it is time some real action is taken to improve the political imbalance in their programming             Last month  a DOD official notified the syndicate that distributes   The Ed Schultz Show    that AFN Radio would begin airing the first hour of the show on October 17   However  at the last minute  a higher level DOD official abruptly backtracked on this commitment the day the show was set to begin airing   Inclusion of   The Ed Schultz Show    would have been a first  partial step toward achieving balance in political programming on AFN Radio   Unfortunately  DOD officials said they have not yet made any decisions regarding which programming to add to the network             It is unacceptable that more than a year after the Senate passed its resolution  that DOD has not made a greater effort to give a balanced  fair representation of varying political viewpoints on its talk radio service     said Harkin     There is no reason that American service members should receive lengthy right wing commentaries with regularity on American Forces Radio  s talk service  without some balance from competing views as part of that same service             The taxpayer funded AFN Radio broadcasts to American troops and military families stationed in more than 177 countries around the globe  While the schedules for each of AFN Radio  s 33 individually programmed radio stations around the world provide a wide variety of music  sports  and news programming  not one minute of progressive talk radio programming is on the program schedules of these 33 stations   Conservative programming accounts for a cumulative total of 62 hours and 45 minutes of talk radio on AFN Radio  s stations each week            Also signing onto the letter are Senators Byron Dorgan  D ND   Carl Levin  D MI   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Mark Dayton  D MN   Jack Reed  D RI   Barack Obama  D IL   Ron Wyden  D OR   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Christopher Dodd  D CT   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Russ Feingold  D WI   and John Kerry  D MA           A copy of the letter is availible upon request         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
