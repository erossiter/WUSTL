        The pioneering organizer of Earth Day was a fellow Midwesterner  Gaylord Nelson  a U S  Senator from Wisconsin   That Midwestern commonsense commitment to a better environment is certainly alive and well in Iowa  where we have long treasured our beautiful land   We have made a lot of progress in cleaning up our air and water  and saving our soil  wildlife and other resources   Still  many challenges remain              One of our greatest environmental threats lies in our heavy dependence on oil and other fossil fuels   These limited resources will one day run out   They are increasingly costly and imported from foreign countries   And our reliance on fossil fuels makes the United States the world s largest producer of greenhouse gases  a chief cause of global climate change              Iowans are making great strides to supply renewable energy from the American Midwest in place of oil from the Middle East   Producing and using more biodiesel and ethanol in this country is the right place to start   That is exactly what we would do under legislation I recently authored and introduced with the bipartisan backing of 20 other senators   Our Renewable Fuels Standard  or RFS  bill would increase the use of ethanol and biodiesel each year  reaching at least eight billion gallons annually by 2012               Our state of Iowa is also blessed with other large renewable energy sources  such as wind power and biomass  and we are pushing forward to develop them   I m working with a number of my colleagues to strengthen and extend tax incentives to help energy companies  communities  businesses and individuals to produce their own electricity  for instance by erecting a wind turbine  and then sell any extra electricity back to the power company in the area              For generations  Iowa s farmers  landowners and other citizens have been balancing our state s great agricultural productivity with conserving our natural resources and protecting the environment  With their close connection to the land  Iowans are working hard to do more   to conserve soil  enhance water and air quality  increase wildlife habitat  and preserve unique natural areas for future generations              To help the voluntary conservation efforts of farmers and landowners in Iowa and nationwide  we wrote the strongest conservation title ever into the 2002 farm bill   A major new feature is the Conservation Security Program  which I authored to provide financial incentives to farmers who maintain or adopt sound conservation on land in agricultural production   Many more Iowans seek to enroll in these farm bill conservation programs than their funding allows B yet  inexplicably  conservation is high on the list of proposed budget cuts in Washington today              Using more biobased and biodegradable products made from crops grown in Iowa s fields will also help our environment   Examples range from plastics to lubricants to a variety of chemicals   To help drive this market  we wrote in the farm bill a requirement for the federal government to purchase biobased products whenever possible   I m continuing to push USDA to finish its work so all federal agencies  buy bio               We have come a long way in the 35 years since the first Earth Day  and Iowans are pushing to do much more   On Friday  April 22  I encourage everyone to reflect on our environment and to recommit ourselves to honoring the ideals of Earth Day throughout the year               More information about Senator Harkin  s environmental and conservation efforts can be found at www harkin senate gov                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
