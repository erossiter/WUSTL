 WASHINGTON  D C   At a press conference in Des Moines today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  congratulated Iowa law enforcement officials for advancing the fight against meth by completing a statewide lockup of anhydrous ammonia tanks  All 99 Iowa counties have now been provided with tank locks  As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Harkin secured virtually all of the funding for the tank locking effort through the Community Oriented Policing Services Meth Hot Spots program   Today  we are marking a major milestone in the war on meth  Now every county in Iowa has their tanks locked up  making it more difficult for meth producers to steal anhydrous ammonia and make this destructive drug  Harkin said  Locking up these tanks is a simple and inexpensive  yet critical and highly successful step in curbing the production of meth in our state   Harkin started the Iowa tank lock project in 2002  to prevent the theft of anhydrous ammonia  a highly toxic chemical used for fertilizer that is also a key ingredient in the production of methamphetamine  The project began with  200 000 to buy tank locks for the areas with the highest number of meth labs  and has since expanded  allowing Iowa law enforcement officials to secure thousands of tanks at a cost of about  45 00 each   I am proud that through the tank lock project  and enacting the strictest pseudoephedrine control law in the country  the state of Iowa has made some great strides in our struggle against meth  Harkin said  We must continue to come up with new  innovative ways to combat meth so that this drug will no longer ravage Iowa families    In addition to obtaining federal funding for tank locks  Harkin also recently introduced the Methamphetamine Abuse Treatment and Prevention Act  This legislation would make strategic investments in programs that are already showing results in both rural and urban communities  It would remove barriers to treatment and expand access to family  and jail based treatment programs  specifically in underserved areas   In addition to reducing the supply of meth  we also have to invest in treatment and prevention programs that will reduce the demand for this highly addictive drug  Harkin said  By continuing to wage a two front offensive against meth  we can help Iowans overcome their addiction and stomp out this deadly epidemic       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
