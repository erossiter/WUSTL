     I  ve been proud to work with the Chariton Valley RC to promote Iowa  s native switch grass as a source for producing electricity     said Harkin     I strongly believe that switch grass can be to electric power what ethanol is to gasoline            Switchgrass crop requires less tillage  less fertilizer  and less insecticide and herbicide than traditional row crops   It also reduces dependence on fossil fuels    By mixing switchgrass with existing coal at power plants  the   energy crop    can be used to help generate 35 megawatts of electrical power    enough to light some 40 000 homes         This funding will be used to complete installations to the Ottumwa Generating Station that will allow the cofiring of 12 5 tons per hour of biomass  fund work with cooperating farmers to develop biomass supply for future cofire activities  and conduct agronomic  environmental  and market development activities to support biomass production and use          The bill now goes to the House and Senate for final passage                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
