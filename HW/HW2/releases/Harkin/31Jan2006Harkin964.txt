        Like many Americans  I have been deeply saddened and disturbed by the recent tragedies at the Sago and Aracoma mines in West Virginia   The deaths of the 14 miners who lost their lives in these mines are even more tragic because of the possibility that they could have been prevented with some simple and long overdue improvements in mine safety regulations and technology              These tragedies have raised serious questions about mine safety and the effectiveness of the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  under this Administration   Recently  MSHA has suffered from a one percent across the board slash in funding  resulting in a loss of  2 8 million that could have been spent on improved air supply equipment  tracking devices which can pinpoint the exact location of trapped miners  and personal emergency devices which broadcast text messages to miners     MSHA has also recently cut 183 staff positions  lessening critical human resources needed to make MSHA more effective at identifying mine safety violations and enforcing the penalties for those violations                  This pattern of weakening the Mine and Safety Health Administration is counterproductive to making the kind of improvements that will enhance and foster greater mine safety             I also plan to push for expediting the research into two way technology that would allow communication between miners and rescuers above ground as well as improved air supply technology which would prolong the amount of time miners can be in areas where carbon monoxide levels are high   In addition  I believe that fines for safety and health violations should be increased to a level that will force coal companies to correct them quickly              Two hundred eight violations in the course of a year  at least 40  of which were for   serious and substantial    violations  yet the amount of fines levied for these violations amounted to only  24 374  at the time of the accident only  14 471 had been paid  the largest single fine for any one violation was only  440  the specific fine per incidence of having combustible materials was only  60    these are the 2005 numbers on the Sago mine   After a December 2001 accident in an Alabama mine  initial fines of  435 000 were reduced to  3 000   I  m an advocate for increasing fines to levels that would force coal companies to more quickly correct safety and health violations and actually deter lax enforcement of mine safety regulations            In these times  MHSA  too  needs a strong advocate for miners and their safety  not an advocate for industry who seeks to figure out ways to make enforcement of mine safety and health less onerous for the private companies that operate mines              The problems with lax enforcement of mine safety regulations that have recently come to light are by no means confined to that segment of occupational safety and health  In the larger OSHA context  12 800 workers are killed or injured each day on the job   Yet  there are some in Congress proposing legislation that will weaken safety and health protections rather than strengthen them   The sponsors and proponents of this legislation tout them as common sense fixes that will alleviate some regulatory burdens without sacrificing safety and health protections   In fact  enforcement under the Occupational Safety and Health Act is already much weaker than many other safety and health laws  with average penalties of less than  900 for serious violations that pose a substantial risk of death or serious harm   This is baffling to me   Safe working conditions yield fewer injuries and deaths and increase productivity   It makes little sense to fight compliance with and work against safety regulations   OSHA needs an advocate that will have has a hallmark of his leadership  aggressive outreach and education to businesses about how everyone benefits when OSHA regulations are strictly enforced  Again  the administration and the Congress need to be working together to create and increase conditions that will foster better worker safety  public health and environmental safeguards                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
