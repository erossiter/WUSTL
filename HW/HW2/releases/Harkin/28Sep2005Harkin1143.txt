     Some may wonder why this has been such a difficult decision for me   Clearly  Judge Roberts is an individual of great accomplishment   He has an outstanding educational background and keen legal skills   He is a thoughtful  decent  modest person  impressively knowledgeable about Constitutional law and the Court   I have watched much of the Judiciary Committee hearings  I have reviewed briefs and court decisions written by Judge Roberts   I have met with Judge Roberts for more than an hour in my office last week  talking one on one           What I did not find in the hearings  in Judge Roberts   writings  or in our meeting  was a clear indication that Judge Roberts understands the critical role that the courts play in protecting the civil rights of Americans  and in allowing those who have suffered discrimination to be able to seek recourse and affirm their rights in federal court   I was seeking some indication that Judge Roberts understands that the issues that come before the high court cannot always be viewed with cool legal dispassion and detachment  but that the Court and its members play a critical role in protecting the powerless in this country           And this is of grave concern to me  because the individual who fills this Supreme Court vacancy will have the ability to undermine all that we have accomplished thanks to the Americans with Disabilities Act   Judge Roberts   nomination comes at a time when there is a very significant clash occurring between the Supreme Court and the Congress over whether Congress has the authority to require the states to comply with antidiscrimination laws   Unfortunately the law caught at the center of this clash is the ADA           So as I have deliberated on this nomination  the first and foremost question in my mind has been this  What kind of Court would the   Roberts Court   be    Would it be a court that serves as a refuge of last resort for the powerless in our society   Or would it be a Court that will continue down a disturbing path seen in the later years of the Rehnquist Court  a path that limits the ability of Congress to pass legislation that provides meaningful protections to individuals  including the 54 million Americans with disabilities   Unfortunately  after carefully reviewing the record and talking with Judge Roberts  I am unable to conclude that a Roberts Court would guarantee the rights of powerless and those with disabilities           Mr  President  earlier this year we celebrated the 15th Anniversary of passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act   The ADA prohibits discrimination in employment against people with disabilities  and requires that the services and programs of local and State governments be accessible and usable by individuals with disabilities   Since its enactment  the ADA has provided opportunity and access for 54 million Americans with disabilities who  prior to the laws enactment  routinely faced prejudice  discrimination and exclusion in their everyday lives         As members of this body know very well  I was the lead sponsor of the ADA   I championed it because I had seen discrimination against the disabled first hand growing up with my brother Frank  who was deaf   During his childhood  Frank was sent half way across the state to a school for the quote unquote   deaf and dumb     He was told that his career path would be limited  because surely someone who is deaf cannot contribute to society   Throughout his life  Frank experienced active discrimination at the hands of both private individuals and government  and this served to limit the choices before him         And Frank  s experience was by no means unusual  as Congress documented extensively prior to enacting the ADA   As part of writing that bill  we gathered a massive record of blatant discrimination against those with disabilities   We had 25 years of testimony and reports on disability discrimination   Fourteen congressional hearings and 63 field hearings by a special congressional task force were held in the three years prior to passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act   We received boxes loaded with thousands of letters and pieces of testimony gathered in hearings and town hall meetings across the country from people whose lives had been damaged or destroyed by discrimination   We had mark ups in 5 different committees and had over 300 examples of discrimination by states   I know   I was there   I was chairman of the Disability Policy Subcommittee         Yet since enactment of the ADA  the Court has repeatedly questioned whether Congress had the authority to require states to comply with the ADA and  amazingly  whether Congress adequately documented discrimination   In 2000  the Court held that an experienced nurse at a University hospital    who was demoted after being diagnosed with breast cancer because her supervisor did not like being around sick people    was not covered by the ADA because she had the misfortune to work for a state hospital           In contrast  last year  by the narrowest of margins  the Court held that Congress did have the authority to require states to make courthouses accessible  This year  the Court will look at whether a state is required to make a prison accessible   And there is no guarantee that the Court will come to the same result   Instead  we could end up with a crazy patchwork where courthouses are accessible but maybe libraries are not  perhaps prisons are accessible but maybe employment offices are not   When we passed the ADA  we in Congress didn  t forbid employment discrimination against the disabled unless they work for the state   We didn  t say some services must be accessible   But that is what the Court has been saying   Talk about judicial activism           As a result  15 years after passage of the ADA  the rights of those with disabilities still hang in the balance   Those rights will be determined  in a very significant way  by a potential Roberts Court   And  as Chief Justice  John Roberts personally would have a major role in determining whether the balance swings for or against people with disabilities    If Judge Roberts lends his voice to those on the Court who believe in the rights of states over the rights of people  individuals with disabilities in this country will face enormous setbacks         Judge Roberts was asked many questions at his hearing about Congressional power  the ADA and the rights of the disabled   I asked him similar questions in our meeting   Judge Roberts chose not to answer those questions in any significant or revealing detail   Without some greater assurance that he would give deference to the policies passed by the Congress    without assurance that he would be a defender of the ability of the less powerful to go to Court and to have their rights vindicated    I am left guessing and speculating   And that is not good enough         Without clear assurances from him personally  I am left only with Judge Roberts   paper record   It is a record that does not bode well for people seeking to vindicate their rights   In the interest of brevity  let me cite just one example from Judge Roberts   tenure with the Department of Justice  the 1982 case of Board of Education v  Rowley   In the Rowley case  a trial court ruled that federal law required the state to provide a sign language interpreter for an 8 year old student who was deaf  and the 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed that decision   The case then went to the Supreme Court  and the Department of Justice had to decide whether to support the student  and argue in favor of an interpreter  or the local school board  and argue against an interpreter   In a memo to the Attorney General  Judge Roberts said that the lower court decisions amounted to an exercise of   judicial activism     and the lower courts had inappropriately   substituted their own judgment of appropriate educational policy             Mr  President  this was not the language of a lawyer merely representing the views of a client   This was the language of an attorney in a policy making position at the Department of Justice  suggesting that the government should have weighed in against the right of a deaf student to have access to an interpreter under the Education of the Handicapped Act  a predecessor of today  s Individuals with Disabilities Education Act   In other words  Judge Roberts thought that this law    the primary federal law to ensure that students with disabilities have access to the same educational opportunities as all other students    should be interpreted narrowly  rather than broadly   That is not the quality I look for in a Chief Justice   I want in a Chief Justice who brings a passion to the law  who doesn  t lose sight of the real people whose lives and livelihoods are profoundly at stake in the Court  s decisions         Some supporters of Judge Roberts have argued that the Rowley case was more than two decades ago  and Judge Roberts   views on statutory interpretation and on the ability of individuals to protect their rights through the courts may have evolved since then   But how are we in this body to know that  particularly when the White House has failed to provide us with all requested and directly relevant documents   Of greatest interest to me are the decision making memoranda written by Judge Roberts during his tenure as Principal Deputy Solicitor General   Again  in his role as the Principal Deputy Solicitor General    a position that is sometimes referred to as the   Political Deputy      Judge Roberts was not merely representing a client  but was involved in crafting the Department  s legal positions in some of the most important cases in recent years   During his tenure as Principal Deputy  Judge Roberts argued that individuals shouldn  t be allowed to go to court to enforce their rights under the Medicaid statute  that children shouldn  t have access to courts to enforce their rights under the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act  and that courts should take a restrictive view of the remedies available under Title IX and other civil rights laws   Given the decision of the White House to withhold these documents from the Senate  I am forced to draw my conclusions on what I do know           Mr  President  before I conclude with my remarks  I would like to describe an example of one of the   real people   I referenced earlier  a woman by the name of Beverly Jones   Ms  Jones  who testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Judge Roberts   nomination  has been in a wheelchair since a 1984 traffic accident   In 1990    the year we passed the ADA    she completed court reporting school and set out to work as a courtroom stenographer in order to support her family   But what she found as she traveled throughout the state of Tennessee was that she couldn  t get to jobs in a great majority of Tennessee  s courthouses   She was forced to choose between asking complete strangers to carry her into the courthouse or into inaccessible restrooms  or to simply turn down employment opportunities   That is an unacceptable choice for a single mother supporting two kids           Ms  Jones testified to the Committee that she spoke to federal  state and local officials about the problem of inaccessible courtrooms  but her entreaties were met with indifference    until she filed suit   I would like to quote from Ms  Jones   testimony about her experience  because I think it vividly illustrates what is at stake here     The door that I thought had been opened  with passage of the ADA  was still closed and my freedom to live my dream was still a dream  and turning into a nightmare   Nobody took either me or the law seriously until I and others brought a lawsuit           That  Mr  President  is what is at stake today  The right of Ms  Jones  and of 54 million other Americans with disabilities  to live their dreams   And the right of the powerless in our society  the disenfranchised  to turn to the courts to take them seriously   Unfortunately  I am not yet persuaded that a Roberts Court would protect these rights           For this reason  I will be voting no on this nomination   Certainly  I bear no personal animosity whatsoever toward Judge Roberts   Within this body  there are many people on the other side of aisle whom I respect  admire  and value as friends  but I don  t often vote with them because I have a different viewpoint on many issues          I hope that the future will prove me wrong about Judge Roberts    I hope he proves to be a Justice who recognizes that discrimination in this country occurs in many areas  and that Congress has both the authority and the duty to remedy it                       Judge Roberts will have an immediate opportunity to do just that   In its upcoming term  the Supreme Court will hear arguments in a case that will once again examine the question of whether Congress had the authority to order states to make public facilities accessible to those with disabilities           Knowing this  during our meeting  I tried to convey to Judge Roberts how discrimination against people with disabilities was deeply ingrained across the decades and centuries prior to the ADA  I talked with him in detail about how  prior to passage of the ADA  people were institutionalized  segregated  taken from their families  taken from their communities  excluded from school  excluded from educational opportunities  excluded from employment opportunities  excluded from all aspects of daily life    shopping  going to the movies  playing golf  and on and on    simply because of a disability   I explained how people with disabilities were excluded in the same way African Americans were excluded prior to the passage of the Civil Rights Act   I hope that  as Chief Justice  Judge Roberts keeps these things uppermost in him mind and heart   Time will tell                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
