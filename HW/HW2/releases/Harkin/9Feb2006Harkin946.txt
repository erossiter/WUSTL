   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued a   Rural Report Card    on President Bush  s budget cuts to initiatives designed to help rural America   The President  s budget targets rural America  s law enforcement  hospitals  public schools  main street businesses and farms for deep and damaging cuts    These cuts to rural America  s working families would have lasting impacts on the quality of life in small towns  affecting their ability to fight drugs  deliver quality healthcare and have vibrant economies            If budgets are about priorities  rural America clearly doesn  t rank highly on the President  s agenda     said Harkin     Investing in small town communities is investing in a way of life   The President proposes to divert funding from rural America  leaving it behind in health care  fighting crime  farm support  and energy assistance to name a few   Rural America faces big challenges and the President  s solution is to withdraw our investment and hope things work out for the better   The President  s budget puts tax cuts that overwhelmingly go to the nation  s wealthy ahead of America  s small towns and farm economy   I believe these are the wrong choices for rural America and Iowa  s economy             Key areas cut in the Bush budget are as follows          RURAL LAW ENFORCEMENT    The Bush budget would slash or eliminate many programs aimed at bolstering local law enforcement  including the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program  which has been so successful in putting more police officers on our streets   It would eliminate funding for the COPS Meth program  which has been crucial to our fight against meth   And it would eliminate Byrne Justice Assistance Grant funding   This program is has been especially important in Iowa because it funds many drug fighting programs across the state          Iowa is already reeling from cuts to programs in 2005  and 2004   Last year Iowa suffered a 42 percent cut to the Byrne funded drug task forces across state   Cuts to the Byrne program over the last three years have led already to a nearly 58 percent reduction in arrest rates in Iowa               RURAL HEALTHCARE    The President proposes huge cuts in Medicare  Iowa  s Medicare providers already rank at the bottom for Medicare reimbursement and the Bush budget will make the problem even worse for rural hospitals            Rural Health is cut by  133 million or 83    This means that 78 Iowa Hospitals will lose grants from HHS to improve quality and reduce medical errors   Also as a result of this cut  Rural Health Outreach Grants are eliminated which help develop health care delivery systems in underserved  rural areas   Currently these grants serve Iowans in Oskaloosa  Spencer  Harlan  Leon and Marshalltown   The sharp cuts to Rural Health also mean that Iowa will lose funding for defibrillators in rural areas               AGRICULTURE and RURAL DEVELOPMENT    The Bush budget released today would divert federal spending from many important agriculture and rural development initiatives   The President proposes a 22  reduction in USDA funds to help farmers prevent livestock waste and field runoff from affecting rural water quality   It also reduces grants to improve water quality infrastructure by 21  and cuts  1 billion in loans for rural broadband technology    The budget calls for 5  reductions in farm income support at a time when farm income declined by 16  adjusted for inflation last year and farmers must confront continued skyrocketing fuel and fertilizer costs           The budget eliminates funding for the AgrAbility program that helps farmers continue working who are injured through farm accidents or have health problems  The Iowa AgrAbility program serves 150 families with approximately 50 new clients each year   President Bush has zeroed this program out in all of his budgets           RURAL ENERGY    The President  s budget fails to invest necessary resources through the farm bill and energy bill to promote farm based renewable energy and energy efficiency   The President called for developing energy from sources such as corn stalks  wood chips  and switchgrass in his State of the Union address   The President  s  59 million increase in his budget to support biomass research and development falls well short of the  200 million Senator Harkin authorized through the energy bill   The President also talked about bolstering renewable energy like wind and solar power but his budget cuts the farm bill  s renewable energy and energy efficiency grants program by 56    These cuts will mean less wind turbines  less investment in renewable fuels and less in energy efficiency grants to help save farmers much needed money as they face soaring energy bills   Other cuts include zeroing out funding for geothermal energy and a dramatic reduction in funding for weatherization assistance for low income households
