          Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this hearing this morning   Mr  Secretary    it  s good to see you and I look forward to your testimony   And I want to thank you for all the help that you and CDC have given to the Iowa Department of Health during our recent outbreak of mumps   We have appropriated a lot of money to make sure our public health infrastructure is prepared for a pandemic flu or a bioterrorism attack   It is that same infrastructure that is needed to respond to an outbreak of food poisoning or the outbreak of something as simple as mumps                     I would also like to take this opportunity to thank you for approving a Special Exposure Cohort for cold war nuclear weapons workers in Iowa  That decision has made a tremendous difference in people s lives and in their confidence in our government s commitment to them   I hope that you will continue to move forward with these cohorts where the NIOSH scientific advisory Board advises they are needed                    But  Mr  Secretary  you will not be surprised to hear that I am disappointed in your overall fiscal year 2007 budget   All the stories I read about the President  s budget are focusing on numbers   It  s all such an abstraction   But we need to remember that a budget is not an abstraction   It is about people  It  s about priorities   In this new budget  the President is proposing hundreds of billions in new tax cuts  overwhelmingly for the wealthiest people in our society   He is proposing billions of dollars for the war in Iraq                        And how does he make room for those priorities   In the areas of health care and education  the President  s budget cuts programs by over  4 billion   Meanwhile  the President is spending nearly  10 billion a month in Iraq in Afghanistan    I am glad to note that this Senate went on record 73 27 to add  7 billion to the President  s budget for health  education  and training programs   I want to thank our Chairman for his leadership on that issue   I know he would have preferred adding  15 billion but  7 billion would at least bring this bill back to its FY 2005 funding level                The budget would cut funding for 18 of the 19 institutes at the National Institutes of Health   Since World War II  the United States has led the world in biomedical research  in large measure because of smart investments in the National Institutes of Health   Let  s be clear  cutting medical research is not the right decision   It is selling out our future                      The President  s budget proposes to cut the Social Services Block Grant by  500 million  and to completely eliminate the Community Services Block Grant   These are the two biggest discretionary programs for the poor   They are the glue that holds together the human services delivery system for our most needy families   Cutting SSBG and CSBG will not fund the war in Iraq     those cuts would only fund the war for three days or four days                     There are some good things in this budget   I applaud your proposed increase of  181 million for the Community Health Centers   You and I could not agree more on the need to expand the reach of Community Health Centers   It must be noted  however  that the President  s increase in the Community Health Centers is dependent upon deep cuts in health professions training programs  rural health programs  traumatic brain injury programs  Poison Control Centers  the list goes on and on   You and I also agree on the importance of investing in health technology and I support your request for more funding for this initiative                   However  if the allocation for this Subcommittee is based on the President  s budget  we will not be able to fund either of these priorities   It makes no sense to send us a budget that cuts important Congressional priorities and expect the Congress to fund your priorities   We need to work together to do what is best for the American people              Thank you  Mr  Chairman and I look forward to the Secretary  s testimony                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
