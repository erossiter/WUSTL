   WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised Senate passage of his amendment to tighten Section 8 guidelines so that low income Americans receive access to the housing assistance they need   The amendment was included in the Transportation  Treasury  Judiciary  Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill which is expected to pass the Senate later this week   Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee                Section 8 is meant to be a stepping stone for low income Americans to achieve self sufficiency  and we need to get serious about assuring that this goal is realized     said Harkin     I consider it to be an abuse of this important program if people who do not really need help are displacing the many that truly do need it   Unfortunately  big loopholes in this system still exist  and it is past due that we get rid of them                Harkin  s amendment will take into account parental income to determine Section 8 housing eligibility for students unless they are over 24  married  veterans  or have dependents   This is the same criteria students must meet to be declared   independent    for federal financial aid purposes   Additionally  any financial aid received over tuition will be counted as income   In a recent letter to the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   the University of Iowa called for the same changes in HUD  s Section 8 guidelines               Harkin first introduced this legislation last year  after the Des Moines Register reported that a Section 8 loophole allows students  regardless of financial need  to live free of charge or at a greatly reduced price in government housing   Since learning about this loophole  Harkin has repeatedly called on the Bush Administration to take action against abuses in the public housing system which has allowed student athletes receiving scholarships and housing stipends to displace needy Iowans in an Iowa City public housing facility               Although HUD issued revised Section guidelines in August 2005  the changes did little to close the loophole   Subsequently  abuses in the system have continued even though the average waiting period is two years for Iowans who truly need Section 8 housing               Thousands of low income  elderly  and disabled Iowans depend on Section 8 housing to meet their basic needs     said Harkin      I regularly hear from truly needy Iowans desperate for housing and struggling to make ends meet while they wait two years for Section 8  This is just plain wrong  and it  s time we make changes that actually work to help those most in need                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
