                 WASHINGTON   D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today reintroduced major legislation to transform our health care system and reduce health care costs by giving Americans access to better preventive care and consumer information to encourage healthier lifestyles  The HeLP America Act of 2007 provides all sectors   child care centers  schools  workplaces  health care providers and communities   with the incentives and tools they need to reach the goal of making America a healthier place                          Right now  America s health care system is too often a sick care system  Many people do not receive care until they have already developed diabetes  heart disease  and other chronic diseases   Harkin said   It is time to take a proactive approach to health care and give people tools to stop these diseases before they start  By providing people the information and resources they need to live longer  healthier lives  the HeLP America Act will empower people to take care of their health  boosting overall quality of life and lowering our spiraling health care costs                            Chronic diseases such as heart disease  cancer  and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States  and the economic impact is staggering  Seventy five percent of the  1 8 trillion the United States spends healthcare annually is spent on treating chronic diseases  Yet less than five percent of annual health care spending in the United States goes toward chronic disease prevention                               Promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic disease will not be accomplished quickly or simply   said Harkin   Achieving these goals will require a comprehensive approach that  rather than focusing on sickness  encourages wellness and integrates healthy choices into individuals  daily lives                               Harkin has promoted preventive healthcare initiatives throughout his career  including increased access to breast cancer screenings  the school fruit and vegetable pilot program  the Menu Education and Labeling Act  MEAL   and tobacco control  Harkin recently spent time visiting and talking with schools  employers and other community organizations in Iowa and nationwide who are doing innovative things to promote wellness  He also held a hearing in Iowa to learn more about the medical and financial costs of chronic conditions such as obesity  tobacco use and mental illness                           The HeLP America Act consists of the following                           Title I   Federal Government                          More kids across America are suffering from overweight and obesity  Since 1965  there has been a 300 percent increase in the number of children ages 6 11 who are overweight  These conditions will contribute to increases in diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and other chronic conditions and have a negative impact on long term health                        Title I would create a Federal Taskforce on Childhood Obesity   This taskforce would establish coordinated leadership in the Federal effort to prevent and reduce childhood obesity and promote good health and nutrition among American children   This title also instructs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to designate a responsible agency to monitor and regularly report on the progress of the various entities and activities related to the recommendations of the IOM report   Food Marketing to Children and Youth                        Title II  Healthier Kids and Schools                        One goal of the HeLP America Act is to improve the overall wellness of our children by promoting sound nutrition  increasing physical activity  helping diagnosis and prevent mental illness  and providing alternatives to the junk foods that are sold in vending machines and on a la carte menus in schools  Title II will help kids develop good habits by putting fresh fruits and vegetables in school  and taking junk food out  It also takes on the tidal wave of ads in schools and on TV pushing junk foods on our kids  Finally  to promote optimum nutrition for our youngest children  this legislation includes a  baby friendly hospital  initiative for hospitals that promote breastfeeding and expands Early Head Start                       Title III  Healthier Communities and Workplaces                             Title III will assist businesses and communities in offering a range of opportunities for people to start leading healthier lives  Initiatives include providing tax credits to businesses that offer comprehensive programs to promote employee health  expanding research of mental and behavioral health risks  encouraging new road construction that accommodates bicycles and pedestrians  providing grants to train preventive medicine and public health physicians  creating a more  mom friendly  breastfeeding environment in the workplace  and encouraging communities to build playgrounds and create athletic programs for people with disabilities                           Title IV  Responsible Marketing and Consumer Awareness                              Having accurate information about the nutritional value of the food people eat is the first step toward improving overall nutrition  In an effort to increase consumer information and promote a more responsible marketing environment  the HeLP America Act would implement mandatory menu labeling at chain restaurants  and restore the FTC s rulemaking authority to issue restrictions on unfair advertising to children  The bill will also give the FDA authority to reduce smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children                                  Title V  Reimbursement for Prevention Services                             At times  preventative screenings for chronic diseases and mental health disorders  counseling to improve nutrition and physical activity  and treatment for substance abuse and smoking cessation can be cost prohibitive  Title V would provide reimbursements and expand current federal health care programs to pay for more preventative services and counseling  In addition  this legislation requires Medicare to develop a payment methodology for hospitals and chronic care organizations to perform preventive outreach and treatment for chronic diseases before they become fully developed  This change can save Medicare money over the long term                           Title VI    National Health Promotion Trust Fund                               This title creates a trust fund through offsets to pay for new programs in the bill and expands funding for existing prevention programs such as PEP and the CDC Divisions of Nutrition and Physical Activity and Adolescent and School Health                       Title VII  Research                          The last title of the bill promotes expanded research into obesity  specifically on obesity prevention and treatment   It would also fund an Institute of Medicine  IOM  study that will examine and make recommendations regarding various means that could be employed to incorporate physical activity into Head Start and childcare settings  elementary  middle and high school settings  and before and after school programs   Finally it requests GAO to review the FDA classification of sodium as a Generally Recognized as Safe  GRAS  ingredient and asks the IOM to make recommendations on various means that could be employed to reduce dietary sodium intake to recommended levels and food reformulation approaches                                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
