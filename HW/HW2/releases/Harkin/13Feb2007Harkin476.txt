       Typically  when the farm bill is discussed  rural development and the challenges and opportunities facing rural Americans in their communities are not especially high on the list of topics   Yet in reality  the farm bill is the single most important piece of legislation we deal with having a broad focus on rural development                  Despite their unique challenges  rural communities offer many advantages   Ironically  rural America is a wonderful place to live and raise a family  but too often it s a hard place to make a living and support a family   The new farm bill holds much promise for helping rural Americans capitalize on the strengths of their communities to increase economic growth  jobs and the quality of life                    We need to examine the Department of Agriculture s numerous rural development programs to see what is working and what needs improvement   We also need to foster better coordination among various federal agencies  state and local governments  nonprofit and charitable entities  and private individuals and businesses                     One innovation which has already proven its value involves a cluster of communities joining together to identify their strengths and their needs and then to work cooperatively with governments  businesses and educational and non profit entities to carry out a rural development strategic plan   This is a sound approach  and one we should encourage in the new farm bill                 We also ought to consider better focusing USDA rural development assistance toward those communities who have devised a plan to make the most effective use of federal dollars                   The experience thus far shows that certain strategies and federal initiatives hold a lot of promise   For example  adding value to farm commodities and products   whether for energy or a host of other biobased products   helps to increase farm income  rural economic growth and jobs while reducing our dependence on imported oil   The Value Added Agricultural Product Market Development Grants have worked well and should be strengthened                  We also know basic infrastructure is critical to the prospects of any rural community   from electricity to drinking water and waste water treatment to high speed internet access  which has now become a necessity   We put funding in the 2002 farm bill for the specific purpose of funding USDA s backlog of approved applications for water and wastewater programs  and I hope we can achieve a similar objective in this bill                  Quality health care is  of course  also essential  and I commend the administration s proposal to help rural hospitals   I also support Senator Nelson s proposed legislation to help small rural businesses get started and succeed   And we must continue to support cooperatives as they carry on their tradition of improving farm income and rural economic opportunities   We also need to help move more venture capital for investment into rural areas                   Community foundations can also help communities assemble more resources to help themselves   There is a good deal of accumulated capital in rural America  but much of it remains untapped as a source of investment right at home                   I look forward to the testimony of our witnesses and the valuable contributions they can make to our discussion and the crafting of the rural development title of the new farm bill                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
