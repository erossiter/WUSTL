 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation to establish an effective national food safety framework for all fresh produce  The bill comes one year after a large scale outbreak of food borne illness caused by a virulent strain of E  coli in fresh bagged spinach sickened more than 200 people and killed three  Since then  U S  consumers have been bombarded with repeated cases of contaminated food  everything from peanut butter to seafood to pet food  Just this week  there was a recall of a Dole bagged salad product because of E  coli contamination   It seems these fresh produce recalls have become the rule rather than the exception in the United States  and that is unacceptable  said Harkin  It is increasingly clear that the Food and Drug Administration lacks the resources  and the authority  to ensure the safety of the U S  food supply  The American people need to have confidence that their fruits and vegetables are produced and handled in a safe and wholesome manner   The current produce oversight system is a patchwork of state and federal regulations  For example  California and Florida have different mechanisms for certifying the safety of leafy greens and tomatoes  respectively  The Food and Drug Administration  FDA  also has its own mechanisms to ensure the safety of produce  however  an Associated Press report last week noted that establishments that grow and process leafy green produce are inspected only once every 3 9 years   The Fresh Produce Safety Act of 2007 gives FDA the authority to make its current voluntary guidelines mandatory  The bill requires FDA to establish national standards tailored to specific commodities and the risk factors in the environments where each is grown  It also requires stepped up inspections of operations that grow and process fresh produce  such as spinach or lettuce   Other key provisions of the bill include a surveillance system to identify the sources of fresh produce contamination  and a research program to better identify  mitigate  and prevent contamination of produce  The bill would also require rule making to ensure that imported produce has been grown and processed with the same standards that we will have in the U S   Eating fruits and vegetables promotes lower body weight  stronger bones  and lower risk of developing diet related diseases such as diabetes  Harkin continued  In recent years  major efforts and investments have encouraged people to eat these healthful foods  It can only turn people away from healthy eating to have continuous instances of E  coli contamination and fresh produce recalls   The bill was introduced with Senator Herb Kohl as a cosponsor and also has the support of the Center for Science in the Public Interest       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
