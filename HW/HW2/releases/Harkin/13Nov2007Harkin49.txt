 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today voiced his disappointment with President Bushs veto of the Labor  Health and Human Services  Education  and Related Services Appropriations bill  Upon introducing the domestic spending bill in the Senate  Harkin received word that Bush would veto the legislation based on the language advocating for stem cell research and the overall funding level of the bill  In an effort to meet the President half way  Harkin stripped the bill of the stem cell language even though a majority of Americans want to see action on the issue  President Bush vetoed the domestic spending bill this morning     It seems that this President is unwilling to compromise and is determined to provoke a confrontation  Last week  he said he planned to veto this bill because of what he deemed frivolous social spending  as though it pays for Saturday night socials and country club memberships     Well Mr  President  there is nothing frivolous about providing job retraining to workers laid off at Maytag  or home heating assistance to seniors during the coldest winter months  There is nothing frivolous about cancer research and health care programs  Head Start support and college aid     It is time for the Presidents party to take a deep breath  think about the ideals our country was built upon and help us override his serious mistake       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
