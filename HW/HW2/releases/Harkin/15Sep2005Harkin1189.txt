        It is long past due that we focus more on promoting healthier lifestyles  In America we have a sick care system and not a genuine health care system because we fail to focus on prevention     said Harkin     This funding can help Iowa become the leader in the fight against our nation  s super sized health crisis  By giving communities the tools they need to promote healthier lifestyles  I believe we can improve the overall wellness of Iowans and make Iowa a model for the rest of the nation                 Transforming Iowa into a healthy community takes a partnership between government and the community  The Iowa Department of Public Health  s Harkin Wellness Grants provides a golden opportunity for community partners to work together so that Iowans can live healthier lives and our state can become a leader in reducing the human and financial cost of preventable causes of poor health     said Dr  Mary Mincer Hansen  Director of the Iowa Department of Public Health              Recipients of the Harkin Wellness grants include community organizations such as counties  townships or cities  educational agencies and school districts  public health organizations  health care providers  and community based nonprofit organizations   Grantees are required to focus on one or more of four priorities in the HeLP America Act  nutrition  physical activity  mental health  and smoking cessation   Funds will be used for projects such as building bike paths  purchasing fitness equipment  or implementing nutrition education programs for children and adults              Promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic disease will not be accomplished quickly or simply     said Harkin     If we are serious about achieving these goals  then everyone must chip in    parents  schools  communities  and government   I look forward to seeing these programs in action and seeing Iowa become a healthier place to live               In addition to the Harkin Wellness Grants  Harkin also introduced the 2005 Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention  HeLP  America Act   This comprehensive legislation seeks to combat obesity and other preventable chronic conditions   The 2005 HeLP America Act recognizes the challenges of chronic disease and health promotion and provides all sectors   child care centers  schools  workplaces  and communities  with the tools that they need to reach the goal of making America a healthier place        Harkin Wellness Grant Awards                                      Grants    Awarded              County Applicant Title Amount Awarded
