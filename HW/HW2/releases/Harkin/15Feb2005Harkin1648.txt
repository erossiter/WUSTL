        All Americans deserve access to quality  affordable health care   Rural health initiatives should not have to suffer in order to give away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy     said Harkin     This budget does not add up    the president cannot boast of fiscally responsible policies if the only people he expects to be tightening their belts are middle income families  while his tax giveaways to the rich are pushing the country further into debt               Throughout the president  s budget  multiple initiatives that impact Iowans will be cut or eliminated completely  including the Emergency Medical Services for Children  EMSC  Program  Rural Hospital Flexibility Grants  Healthy Community Access Program  HCAP   Rural Access to Emergency Devices  RAED  Grant Program  and Rural Health Outreach Grants            Specific information follows on cuts to health care initiatives that Iowans rely upon            Emergency Medical Services for Children  EMSC     Eliminated        This program improves and enhances the ability of current EMS systems to meet the unique needs of the pediatric patients  0 18 years old  in Iowa   Through a partnership with Iowa Nebraska Kiwanis Foundation  Iowa  s EMSC program provides pediatric specific equipment to basic EMS provider services and training  To date over 213 EMS programs have received assistance to buy pediatric equipment with over 1 400 EMS providers trained   Additionally  the EMSC program helps provide injury prevention programs such as bike helmet safety  child passenger safety seat training  booster seat training  and child identification programs             Katrina Altenhofen  MPH  PS        State Director  Iowa Emergency Medical Services for Children         319 331 2189          Iowa has enjoyed numerous accolades due to this program   One of the most recent successes has come through the partnership of the EMSC program and the Nebraska Iowa Kiwanis foundation   On April 7  2004 I presented the Underwood EMS service with pediatric equipment sponsored by the Kiwanis   At that time they were given a two hour educational lecture on pediatric assessment and utilization of the equipment   Three days later on April 10  2004 a young girl was injured due to a ATV incident the Underwood EMS providers not only had the right equipment but they also had the right education to be able to provide the right care at the right time               Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant    Eliminated        Seventy seven rural hospitals in Iowa will lose funding if this cut is enacted  This program helps small hospitals convert to a more financially viable certification and develop networks to bring health care procedures and professionals to rural America   The Small Rural Hospital Improvement Grants  SHIP   part of the Rural Hospital Flexibility Program  provide rural hospitals with the resources to reduce medical errors  improve the quality of care  and to comply with government regulations    A list of hospitals that have recently received SHIP funds is available upon request            Keith Heuser        CEO  Clarinda Medical Center            712 542 8214          The Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant has been important to small rural hospitals like ours for two reasons   First  it has helped us enhance our quality care  and secondly  the purpose of the program    to offset a lopsided reimbursement system    has helped underfunded rural operations               Amy McDaniel        CFO  Wright Medical Center  Clarion        319 642 5543          We are in our second year of participation in the Rural Hospital Flexibility Grant program  This program has allowed us to provide better quality patient care to the rural communities   We have been able to fund projects that would not normally be implemented due to the tight financial constraints that we face in the rural setting               Fran Zichal         CEO  Central Community Hospital  Elkader        563 245 7000          We have received a number of grants over the past twenty years   This grant was the best at putting the dollars right where they needed to go   It made a difference for our patients and will continue to do so in years to come   We hope Congress reinstates the program                 Karen Bossard        Administrator  Greene County Medical Center  Jefferson        515 386 2114          The Small Rural Hospital Improvement Grant Program  SHIP  has been a very important program for rural hospitals   It has made it possible to prepare for the implementation of HIPAA and to develop programs to prevent medication errors that hospitals may not have developed if the SHIP grant program had not been available   Because of the SHIP grant  Greene County Medical Center has a much more accurate accounting of medications and has reduced the number of medication errors or near misses considerably               Chris Eckhoff         Assistant Administrator  Franklin General Hospital  Hampton         641 456 5000                 Healthy Community Access Program  HCAP     Eliminated        HCAP helps health care providers develop integrated  community wide systems that serve the uninsured and underinsured   The Mercy Foundation in Des Moines received a HCAP grant of  953 000 in 2002   The President of the Mercy Foundation  Wayne King is available to talk to reporters about this important funding  515 247 3248                  Rural Access to Emergency Devices  RAED  Grant Program    77  cut        Almost every county in Iowa received emergency defibrillators as a result of this program   Although many Iowa communities are still in need of this life saving equipment  the President has proposed a 77  cut to the program    A list of Iowa communities that have recently received RAED funds is available upon request            H R    Butch    Gibbs        Humeston  Iowa        641 877 6731          President Bush  s proposed cut in the funding of the Rural Access Grant for Emergency Medical Devices  specifically Automated External Defibrillators  AED   will cause many Americans to die needlessly   My life was saved on April 2  2004  by early CPR and the quick arrival of an AED   That AED was made available to our community  s First Responders by federal funds made available to the state of Iowa   I would not be alive today if it were not for the Rural Access Grant for Emergency Medical Devices  and I was the second person in our small southern Iowa town  population 543  to be saved in the first year this AED was made availed to our first responders                  Bill Fish        Glidden First Responders  Carroll County           712 792 1335          Because of this program  we were able to put defibrillators in each of the school districts and each fire department in Carroll County   This equipment is now available within minutes of all residents of the county  giving everyone access to quality life saving measures  if needed                  Ed Knight        Fire Chief  Boone Fire Department            515 432 3436          We were fortunate to receive an AED for the Department last March  With shrinking budgets always confronting communities  particularly rural communities  this program gets the AED s to areas where they are desperately needed  but not available  To discontinue this program would have a negative impact on rural communities and their citizens                  Todd Jackson        Fire Chief  Creston Fire Department            641 782 5610          Our department received a defibrillator through the Rural Access to Emergency Devices program   We have already saved one life with the equipment   In addition to saving civilian lives  because half of all firefighter fatalities are due to heart attacks while working on emergencies  the equipment gives us comfort that we can also save the lives of firefighters on the job                        Rural Health Outreach Grants    73  cut        This program is designed to encourage the development of new and innovative health care delivery systems and rural communities that lack essential health care services   The

proposed cuts WILL greatly affect our Access 4 program   Because of this grant we have been able to help K 12th grade students who have behavioral health problems in four school districts   This is the poorest county in Iowa and without this grant many children would fall through the cracks and not receive help   We are trying to reach children at an early age and provide prevention and counseling so that these kids can continue on in life and become the best that they can be               Vickie Lewis         Substance Abuse Treatment Unit of Central Iowa  Marshalltown        641

substance abuse education  early intervention  and treatment services for youth in Marshall County  Without these funds  we will be limited to the number of services we can provide as well as limiting
