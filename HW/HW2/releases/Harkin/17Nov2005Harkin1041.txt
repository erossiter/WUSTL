           Today was a victory for students  teachers  doctors  patients  and American families nationwide   The House rejected a bad bill that runs contrary to our national values and priorities                 It cut total health care funding by nearly  900 million    completely eliminating 10 critical health programs  including rural emergency medical services   It reduced total education investments for the first time in a decade  and left the Low Income Energy Assistance Program at last year  s level  despite heating costs that are expected to rise 50 to 70 percent   And to top it all off the Republicans completely eliminated the nearly  8 billion that I put in the bill to finance emergency preparations for an avian flu pandemic                 I hope that today  s actions will be a wake up call to the Republican leadership   They must now to come back to the table and join us in writing a new proposal that addresses the American people  s priorities   We spend  3 billion in Iraq every two weeks   With that same amount of money we could invest in the health  education and safety of our families here at home for the next year                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
