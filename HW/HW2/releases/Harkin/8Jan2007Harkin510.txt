     Deriving stem cells from amniotic fluid is an exciting area of research  and it offers interesting possibilities for treating certain medical conditions  particularly for infants  However  as Dr  Atala himself has emphasized  his paper does not in any way diminish the need to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and enact it into law            The paper offers no evidence that amniotic stem cells have as much potential as embryonic stem cells to differentiate into all other cells in the human body   Therefore  it would be irresponsible from a scientific perspective  and cruel to the millions of Americans who are suffering from diseases like juvenile diabetes  ALS  Parkinson  s and cancer  to abandon efforts to lift the President  s arbitrary restrictions on embryonic stem cell research on the basis of a single new journal article              If we truly want to cure and treat diseases that afflict so many people in this country  our nation  s top scientists should be allowed to pursue stem cell research of all kinds    be it embryonic  adult  or amniotic    as long as they adhere to strict  ethical guidelines              Furthermore  it is important to note that deriving stem cells from amniotic fluid is not a new area of research   Scientists have been studying amniotic stem cells for many years  While Dr  Atala  s research is noteworthy  it does not represent a major breakthrough   In the future  I urge the media to beware of over hyping incremental advances in stem cell research  especially when they are published on the eve of a congressional debate                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
