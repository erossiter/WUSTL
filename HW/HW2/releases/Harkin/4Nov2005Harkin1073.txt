           Our nation is confronted with a childhood obesity epidemic that is getting worse     Harkin said     We must take steps to protect our children  s health and help parents promote good nutrition   Instead  parents are being undermined by the junk food culture that is increasingly promoted to our kids on TV  on the internet and even in their schools                The Harkin provision would require that the FTC submit a report to the Committee by July 1  2006  documenting food industry marketing activities and expenditures targeted toward children and adolescents   The report  should include an analysis of commercial advertising time on television  radio  and in print media  in store marketing  direct payments for preferential shelf placement  events  promotions on packaging  all Internet activities  and product placement in television shows  movies  and video games             The rate of children and adolescents who are overweight has nearly tripled from less than five percent in the 1980s to about 16 percent today   Given the gravity and complexity of the childhood obesity problem in this country  several reports including the recent IOM Preventing Childhood Obesity Report indicate the likely influence food marketing has on children  s diet and overall health              The food industry spent an estimated  10 12 billion last year alone in direct marketing to children    bombarding kids with ads on television and the internet  in movies and magazines  in schools  and through promotional materials such as kids clubs  toys and books   Food companies are increasingly aggressive in marketing unhealthy food to our children through a wide variety of innovative strategies    cartoon tie ins  product placement    advergaming     and cross promotions    with a goal of encouraging children to consume unhealthy products                The current industry efforts to limit junk food marketing directed at children are woefully inadequate     said Harkin    It is my continued hope that industry will develop meaningful  uniform  and system wide set of age appropriate guidelines for marketing junk food to kids                Harkin has been the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children   He is also the author of the 2005 Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention  HeLP  America Act which focuses on prevention and wellness to confront our nation  s rise in chronic disease                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
