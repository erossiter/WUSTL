         At this time of year  many of us remember Charles Dickens   classic tale  A Christmas Carol    the story of Ebenezer Scrooge  who learns the true meaning of the holiday season and opens his heart to those less fortunate than he            Unfortunately  here in the Republican led Congress  life does not imitate art   Ten days before Christmas  Congress is poised to deliver a cruel blow to the most disadvantaged members of our society   And sadly  unlike in Dickens   tale  there is no sign of remorse  no nagging conscience  no change of heart at the end of the day            The Labor HHS appropriations bill funds programs like Head Start  community health centers  special education  and job training    the programs that help the neediest in our communities   Most people who are watching today would probably expect these programs to get an increase this year  or at least be level funded              But that is not the case   Incredibly  the bill before us would cut funding for these programs by  1 4 billion            In education  this bill        Cuts total federal education funding for the first time in a decade    Reduces funding for No Child Left Behind Act programs by 3 percent   780 million   for a total that is  13 1 billion below the authorized level   Provides the smallest increase for Title I in 8 years  for a total that is  9 9 billion below the authorized level   This means denying full Title I services to 120 000 children who are currently eligible to receive them   Freezes the maximum Pell Grant award for the fourth year in a row despite rising tuition costs    Cuts the federal share of the costs of special education for the first time in a decade  and shifts a bigger burden to states and local districts            It  s the same story in health   This bill       Slashes the Bureau of Health Professions by  185 million  making it even harder to recruit qualified health professionals in many parts of the country    Won  t allow a single new community health center competition in fiscal year 2006   Provides the smallest percentage increase to NIH    less than 1 percent    since 1970 and cuts the number of new research grants that NIH will be able to fund    Cuts rural health programs by  137 million   Eliminates 9 vital health care programs including trauma care  rural emergency medical services  health education training centers  the healthy community access program  and geriatric education centers             Here  s a map showing all the States that will lose geriatric education centers  just two weeks before the 78 million baby boomers in this country begin to turn 60  January 2006    In Iowa  we have a center at the University of Iowa School of Medicine that trains physicians  osteopaths  dentists  pharmacists  nurses  chiropractors  and social workers  There  s a big need for this center  because Iowa has the highest proportion of citizens over the age of 85  of any state in the United States   But this bill eliminates it            Now let  s look at labor programs  This bill       Cuts total labor funding by  430 million  or almost 4 percent    Cuts adult job training by  31 million and youth job training by  36 million   Slashes the Employment Service by  89 million  or 11 percent            Furthermore  this bill will literally leave the poorest people in America out in the cold   It provides no additional funding for LIHEAP  the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program   even though fuel costs are skyrocketing              In Iowa  natural gas prices are up 40 percent   Hawkeye Area Community Assistance in Southeast Iowa reports that LIHEAP funds are likely to run out in mid January  one of the coldest months of the year   But this bill fails to keep up with the overwhelming need            Now  you might be thinking   a  1 4 billion cut is pretty bad   But that  s just the start            Congress is getting ready to pass a defense appropriations bill that will include an across the board cut of at least 1 percent against virtually every federal program            One percent might not sound like a lot   But remember that  1 4 billion cut in the Labor HHS bill   Get ready to double it   It turns into a  2 8 billion cut            Here  s what a 1 percent cut would mean for education   It would deny full Title I services to 160 000 children who are currently eligible to receive them   Whatever happened to the idea of leaving no child behind   This bill makes a mockery of that goal               Here  s what a 1 percent cut would mean for medical research   It would slash the number of new grants that NIH could fund by 8 percent  from 9 612 to 8 822   That means 790 potential medical breakthroughs that won  t get tested            I could go on and on  but I won  t            Today is December 15    ten days before Christmas   Throughout much of the world  it  s the season of giving   But here in Congress  it  s the season of taking away    taking away education programs  taking away job training  taking away home heating assistance  taking away rural health programs   And worst of all  taking away hope            We  re saying to the low income families that are working and struggling to pay their heating bills  put food on the table  keep their families together  make it through the winter    Merry Christmas   Hang your stockings   Congress is bringing you a big lump of coal               I don  t understand how anyone can vote for this bill  especially at this time of year            I urge my colleagues in the Senate to defeat it   It  s a terrible bill   The House defeated it once a few weeks ago and passed it by just two votes yesterday              We need to reject this bill and insist that the Republican leadership provide enough funding to write an acceptable bill   They have the power to do it   They run the White House and both houses of Congress   What  s stopping them            If Senators pass this bill  and deliver this cruel present to the poorest people in America ten days before Christmas  it  s on their conscience   But I  m voting no                           Originating Site  Number  Site
