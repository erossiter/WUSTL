        A fully functional national animal identification system is critical for ensuring herd health and maintaining foreign trade     said Harkin     But USDA  s plan is leaving producers in the dark about what it is going to cost them               Harkin previously questioned USDA on this matter in April  when he asked the Department for clarification about who and where the animal identification information would be maintained   In response  the Department stated that the premises information repository and the animal movement tracking database  i e  animal records repository  would be maintained by the Animal Plant and Health Inspection Service  APHIS  at USDA   On August 30 however  USDA reversed course and announced that the animal movement tracking database would be maintained by a private entity   Harkin has called on USDA to justify its abrupt change in policy                USDA wants the animal tracking database to be private but has yet to offer any plan to ensure producer data is secure and not improperly shared or sold by this proposed private entity     said Harkin     Producers need to have confidence that their data is secure for this system to work                 USDA will hold a public meeting tomorrow in Kansas City  Missouri to discuss its proposal   Harkin has urged USDA to hold multiple meetings around the country on its proposal so that producers  stakeholders and members of the public can adequately express their concerns and expectations regarding the animal identification system            In April  USDA issued a draft strategic plan outlining the time frame that the national animal identification system will be fully operational in the United States   By January 2008  USDA will require all premises  areas or farms with livestock or poultry  and individual animals or groups to be identified and registered in the system   The tracking of animal movements will also become mandatory by January 2009              A copy of the letter is available upon request                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
