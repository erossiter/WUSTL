        Scientists are not required to submit their papers to the archive  so it remains to be seen how many will participate  and how quickly   But I will be working with the NIH in the months ahead to make sure this policy works as intended   In the meantime  I urge the NIH to lead the way by requiring its own intramural scientists to release their published manuscripts as soon as possible after they are accepted for publication                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
