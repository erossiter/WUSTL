        No question  the numbers in the CAMR poll are impressive   But  I think everyone here would agree that we hardly need a poll to tell us that the public is just overwhelmingly in favor of embryonic stem cell research   The American people   get it      They understand the incredible promise of this research   They understand that it  s time to lift President Bush  s restrictions and let our top scientists get to work without political interference               What the American people don  t understand is why HR 810 has not come to the Senate floor for a vote               On that score  in addition to the 72 percent who support this research  and the 70 percent who want the Senate to vote on our bill  there is one more relevant number   358   It has been 358 days since the House passed HR 810   For 358 days  Majority Leader Frist has delayed  dithered  and dodged    despite the fact that  last summer  he spoke out courageously in support of the bill   But still  HR 810 languishes in limbo                 Even last week  during the Senate  s much ballyhooed   health week     there was no action on stem cell research  despite the fact that it is the No  1 health research priority of the American people   It  s no wonder why only 22 percent of the American people approve of the job Congress is doing                Well  my patience    and  more importantly  the patience of the American people    has run out                      As I speak  people we love are dying from Parkinson  s and ALS   Children are suffering from juvenile diabetes   People like my nephew Kelly are unable to walk due to spinal cord injuries   These people can  t wait another year   They need hope now                    That  s why we are not going away   We are not going to give up   We will continue to push for a vote on HR 810 before the May 24 anniversary of its passage in the House   And I urge people all across America to send their letters  e mails  and faxes to Senator Frist demanding a vote on this absolutely critical bill                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
