      WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today delivered the following statement on the Senate floor regarding pending immigration reform legislation              For me  the current debate strikes very close to home   Those words at the base of the Statue of Liberty      bring me your tired  your poor  your huddled masses  yearning to breathe free      have profound personal meaning to me                My mother came to America as an immigrant   She was raised in Slovenia  in a house with a dirt floor   She came here as a young woman with no money  no job  limited skills   But she was embraced by this country   She was welcomed into the American family   She was given the opportunity to become a productive citizen and  in turn  to give back so much to her adopted homeland                The fact is  if we go back enough generations  much this same story is repeated in the family history of every member of this body   Save for Native Americans  we are all sons and daughters of immigrants   We remember Franklin Roosevelt  s famous remark to the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1941  he greeted his audience with the words    My fellow immigrants                  The current debate has stirred up strong passions   This is nothing new   Across the centuries  successive waves of immigrants    Germans  Irish  Chinese  Italians  Greeks  and others    have each provoked strong emotions   In every case  Americans eventually rose above their economic fears and ethnic prejudices   We were true to those words of welcome on the Statue of Liberty   And  as a result  America became stronger  richer  and fairer   We are indeed the envy of the world              Today  once again  we are in the midst of a difficult and often emotional national debate about immigration   I am optimistic that we can arrive at a bill that addresses legitimate national security and law enforcement concerns  while also being faithful to our tradition and history as a nation of immigrants   I commend my good friend  the senior Senator from Pennsylvania  Senator Specter  for his skill and leadership in reporting a bipartisan bill from the Judiciary Committee that takes us in the right direction   I strongly support this bill                  My state of Iowa has a long and proud history of welcoming new immigrants   We have a growing immigrant Muslim population from Asia and the Middle East   In fact  Cedar Rapids is home to the oldest mosque in the United States   Our universities and community colleges host thousands of immigrant students    people who share their cultures and experiences  and enrich the higher education experience for all of our students                A quarter century ago  responding to the plight of Vietnamese and Laotian boatpeople  Former Governor Robert D  Ray introduced programs to bring more than 30 000 of these refugees to Iowa   Because of his courageous  humanitarian leadership  thousands of Iowans opened their homes and their hearts to these new immigrants                 More recently  tens of thousands of immigrants have come to Iowa from Latin America and elsewhere   They have come here in search of two things   work and freedom   In most cases  they have found work  the Iowa economy is hungry for immigrants willing to work                But not all of these new immigrants have found freedom   Earlier this month  at United Trinity Methodist Church in Des Moines  I met with a group of new immigrants  some of them undocumented   They told me about the hardships they face   They live in constant fear   They live in the shadows   Many pay taxes and make Social Security payments  but receive nothing in return   They want to become loyal  contributing American citizens and to pursue the American dream   But  instead  they are living an American nightmare of anxiety  exclusion  and exploitation                   It is time for us to find a constructive  positive way to bring these people out of the shadows and into the sunlight   One thing we all agree on is that the current immigration system is broken and needs reform   It is totally out of sync with today  s social and economic realities              It  s time to come up with a just and fair immigration system    one that is true to our values and tradition   And I know that we can come up with a reformed system that is a win win for all of us                To that end  we need three things   One  we need tough  consistent  effective enforcement of reformed immigration laws   Two  we need to enforce sanctions against employers who hire immigrants unauthorized to work   And  three  we need a temporary worker program  with documentation  that gives immigrants a reasonable path to earning full American citizenship   We are not talking  here  about amnesty  which would be wrong   We are talking about a process of earned legalization    giving people a practical way to earn citizenship by working  paying taxes  paying a fine when necessary  and learning English                We need to deal with the reality that is before us  11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants  many of whom have lived here for many years and have children and other family members who are U S  citizens   These people are working and contributing to our prosperity   They may be undocumented   They may be living in the shadows   But make no mistake  they are de facto members of our American economy and society   They are integrated into the fabric of our national life   They are not going away    and  frankly  we would face huge problems if they did   As the U S  Chamber of Commerce said recently    If you kick out 11 5 million to 12 million people  it will bring this economy to a screeching halt                 Let  s acknowledge these realities  and then let  s establish a legal framework within which these immigrants can work  learn English  pass security background checks  pay fines and penalties where necessary  and earn the right eventually to become U S  citizens              At the same time  let  s not delude ourselves with so called solutions that are unworkable  unaffordable  or just plain mean spirited   As a wise person once said   For every complex problem  there is a solution that is simple  clean  and wrong                 For example  the House has passed a bill that calls for criminalizing undocumented immigrants  rounding them up and deporting them  and charging with crimes anyone who might help  including clergy and church members                Does anyone seriously believe that it is feasible to round up 11 million to 12 million undocumented immigrants   Who will conduct this roundup   Are we going to spend the  40 billion it would take to hire a vast army of agents to do it   And even if it were physically possible to round up 12 million people  how could it be done humanely   For example  would we be willing to break up families   Would we deport mothers and dads  but allow their U S  citizen children to stay                    Others advocate that we spend additional tens of billions of dollars to build a 700 mile wall across our southern border   But a wall is not the answer   Over the last decade  we have tripled the number of border patrol agents and quintupled the enforcement budget  but the flow of undocumented immigrants has continued unabated   What  s more  a wall would do nothing to stop the 40 percent of undocumented immigrants    up to 4 million people    who came here legally on visas  but stayed illegally after the visas expired               It  s time to acknowledge why immigrants continue to come across our border  making enormous sacrifices and often risking their lives   They are coming for economic opportunity  to better themselves  and to reunite their families   In other words  they are coming for exactly the same reasons that my mother came to America  to make a better life for herself and her family   The difference is that they are coming  now  as undocumented  illegal immigrants because we have failed to create documented  legal avenues for our economy to get the workers that it needs              We have heard it said that undocumented immigrants drive down wages for American citizens at the low end of the economic scale   According to this argument  undocumented immigrants are so desperate and fearful  that they will work for the minimum wage or less    and they will tolerate harsh  unsafe working conditions   Unfortunately  there is plenty of truth to this argument    and that  s why we need to bring these people out of the shadows   If they are given documentation and legal status  then employers will have to pay them a decent wage and treat them fairly   This will raise the floor    it will raise wages at the bottom rungs of the ladder    and this will benefit all American workers              There is another huge cost and danger to allowing the status quo to continue  The current system has driven undocumented workers deep underground   We are not able to document  track  and control who is within our borders   This is an ideal environment for Al Qaeda and others who aim to penetrate our society               Because of our preoccupation with chasing down undocumented immigrants  we are diverting scarce resources from addressing the real threats to our national security    criminals and terrorists   This needs to change   Instead of spending our law enforcement dollars trying to track down gardeners and dishwashers  let  s focus on those who truly wish to do us harm              Throughout America  s history  the subject of immigration has lent itself to fear mongering  demagoguery  and simplistic  so called solutions   But to our credit    and to America  s great social and economic benefit    we have listened to the better angels of our nature   We have refused to slam the door   We have been true to our tradition as a nation of immigrants              Today  once again  we are challenged to rise above fear and prejudice  and to do the right thing   Legally or illegally  immigrants will continue to come to America  as they have for four centuries   We need smart immigration reform    reform that will protect our borders and crack down on employers who hire those unauthorized to work  while creating a guest worker program that gives immigrants the opportunity for earned legalization and family reunification                 I commend the Judiciary Committee for sending to the floor a bipartisan bill that would accomplish important things   It would bring undocumented immigrants out of the shadows so that we know who they are  where they live  where they are from    and so we can identify any who are a threat to our homeland security   It would allow earned legalization for those who pass security background checks   It will take more than 10 years for an undocumented immigrant to demonstrate that he or she is a person of good standing  and is paying taxes  learning English and has paid necessary fines   These people would not jump ahead of anyone who is already in line for citizenship                This is an excellent starting point   Senator Specter and the Judiciary Committee have done a great service to the Senate   I look forward to actively participating in this debate as we go forward
