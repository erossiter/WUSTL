      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that he will co sponsor the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act  legislation offering an aggressive reform package to reverse Republican excesses and restore the public  s trust in government   Harkin  a longtime proponent of public financing  also called for real changes in campaign finance to truly end the abuses in Washington              From the White House to Congress to K Street  Republicans   organized corruption in Washington has come at a great cost to the American people     said Harkin     Rather than debating legislation written by and for special interests  I believe we must fight for reform  so we can clean up Washington and ensure that America s interests always come first               The cost of Republican corruption is felt by American families every day as they try to heat their homes and send their children to college   While seniors struggle with a confusing and poorly implemented prescription drug program and middle class families desperately try to pay higher bills with lower wages  special interests reap rewards and giveaways   Republicans have created laws that provide a multibillion dollar slush fund for the pharmaceutical industry and allow friends like Halliburton to receive no bid contracts              Some of the key provisions Democrats have proposed to end this abuse include                 A ban on lobbyist gifts  including meals  entertainment and travel to ensure legislation is never traded for perks                 Increasing restrictions on lobbyists so America knows what they are up to                Shutting down schemes like the   K Street Project     so special interests will not rule Washington              Prohibiting   Dead of Night    special interest provisions by requiring conference committee meetings to be open to the public             Harkin  who has long advocated for public financing in federal election campaigns  said that reform should not just end with this proposal and called for additional campaign finance reform                   I have long believed real reform cannot happen until we provide public financing of campaigns and place limits on spending     said Harkin     While this bill is a good first step  we must do more than ban gifts from lobbyists in Washington  If we are really serious about reform  we should be talking about further campaign finance reform                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
