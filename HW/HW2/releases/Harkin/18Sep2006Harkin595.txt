      Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today stated that the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  should thoroughly review Smithfield  s newly announced plan to merge with Premium Standard Farms  PSF   Specifically  Harkin said that DOJ should look into whether or not the merger would violate anti trust laws and what impact the merger would have on pork producers  consumers and hog and pork markets  Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee              The merger agreement announced today involves a very substantial change in the structure  vertical integration and degree of consolidation in the U S  pork industry     said Harkin    It obviously will have significant impacts on both independent hog producers and those who raise hogs under contract               Completion of this merger would increase market consolidation in hog production and processing  potentially hurting the market  s competitiveness   Smithfield is the nation  s largest hog producing and processing firm   Premium Standard Farms is the nation  s second largest hog producer and sixth largest processor  This merger would give Smithfield control of 20 percent of U S  hog production and 31 percent of pork processing            Economists have already stated that when four firms control over 40 percent of a sector  in this case hog slaughter  market competitiveness will decline   Currently  the top four firms in the United States control roughly 50 percent of hog production and over 64 percent of hog processing               This merger once again points to the need for federal limits on packer ownership and captive supplies of livestock     Harkin said    This deal also underscores the critical need for full and effective enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act and for additional federal protections for independent pork producers and those producing under contracts                In February  Harkin introduced the   Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2006   which includes contract protections for independent producers   The bill would ensure a producer has at least three days to review or cancel a production contract after signing it   The legislation would also protect producers from having contracts prematurely terminated if they have made a sizable capital investment   Furthermore  this bill ensures that producers are not prevented from going to the courts to challenge unfair actions in contract arrangements   Harkin is also an original co sponsor of legislation that makes it unlawful for a packer to own  feed  or control livestock intended for slaughter                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
