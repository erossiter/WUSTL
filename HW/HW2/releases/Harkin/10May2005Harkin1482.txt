      The global need for food assistance has risen sharply after the South Asia tsunami late last year as well as continuing crises in the Sudan  Southern Africa and other parts of the world   The  240 million in added food aid funding is only a quarter of the amount the United States Agency for International Development cited as being needed prior to the tsunami            The destruction wrought by the tsunamis is profound     Harkin said     This failure to provide adequate food aid means poor and starving people in some regions will lose out as resources are shifted to disaster response             Harkin has been a long time advocate of keeping commitments to international food aid   Immediately following the tsunami  Harkin  with 42 of his colleagues  wrote a bipartisan letter to President Bush urging that aid to disaster victims not be drawn from funds that would otherwise be used to alleviate hunger and poverty in other parts of the world   The funding levels passed by Congress today will result in money being withdrawn from programs such as initiatives that provide rations of food to mother and infants in Nicaragua  feed children in migrating tribes in Senegal and give access to clean water for villagers in Indonesia            Congress has reversed our nation  s longtime commitment to helping the world  s most vulnerable     said Harkin     We should be moving forcefully to meet international needs  not scaling back   I am deeply disappointed by these funding levels for international food aid                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
