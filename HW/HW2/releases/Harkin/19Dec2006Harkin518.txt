        WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a driving force behind the provision to   The United States India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act  declaring that it shall be the policy of the United States to secure India  s full and active participation in efforts to prevent Iran from acquiring weapons of mass destruction  today released the following statement                       I find it outrageous that the President has repeatedly stated the greatest threat to U S  national security is a nuclear Iran  yet explicitly rejects Congress   declaration that it shall be the official policy of the United States that India will not use its nuclear technology to help develop Iran  s nuclear weapons arsenal                       With his recent signing statement  once again the President has shown he views Congress as a nuisance rather than an equal branch of government under the Constitution                       India has a proven robust relationship with Iran  and as the international community moves forward to deal with  contain   and if necessary   sanction Iran for the continuation of its nuclear activities  we will need greater support from a regional partner like India                       Congress and the Administration agree it is imperative to our national security that we prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons  Yet the President shamelessly brushed aside concrete steps Congress approved to avert that exact scenario                       Iran  s pursuit of nuclear weapons is not only one of the gravest dangers that our country faces  but also has the potential to throw the Middle East into a dangerous nuclear arms race  only adding to regional and global instability                       This signing statement is yet another example of the Administration  s rhetoric saying one thing and its actions doing another                                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
