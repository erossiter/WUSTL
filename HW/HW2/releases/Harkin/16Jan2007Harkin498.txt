       WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing legislation that would make it unlawful for a packer to own  feed  or control livestock  either through a subsidiary or an arrangement that gives the packer operational  managerial  or supervisory control prior to seven days before slaughter  Senator Harkin is Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry                     The livestock marketing system will become dysfunctional if the industry becomes overly vertically integrated     Harkin said    We need some federal limits to how far packing and processing firms can go in controlling all phases of the livestock production and processing industry                   Senator Harkin was instrumental in including a ban on packer ownership in the Senate version of the 2002 farm bill  However  leaders from the House of Representatives flatly refused to consider accepting the packer ownership ban during farm bill conference negotiations             Packers owning or controlling livestock from growing to finishing to slaughter has increased steadily in the last 15 years and has undermined opportunities for independent livestock producers  The top four packers in the U S  directly own roughly 10 percent of fed cattle   Of the various pricing arrangements used by the hog industry  over 20 percent of hogs are packer owned   Hog packers would have 18 months to divest their direct ownership of hogs and packers of all other livestock would need to divest their ownership of livestock by 180 days   The increasing vertical integration will make including a ban on packer ownership even more challenging than in 2002     This legislation would not prohibit pricing methods involving contracts               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
