        Promoting healthy lifestyles and preventing chronic disease will not be accomplished quickly or simply     said Harkin     Achieving these goals will require a comprehensive approach that  rather than focusing on sickness  encourages wellness and integrates healthy choices into individual  s daily lives          Chronic diseases such as heart disease  cancer  and diabetes are the leading causes of death and disability in the United States  and the economic impact is staggering   Seventy five percent of the  1 8 trillion the United States spends healthcare annually is spent on treating chronic diseases   Yet less than five percent of annual health care spending in the United States goes toward chronic disease prevention               The HeLP America Act consists of the following       Title I   Healthier Kids and Schools         More kids across America are suffering from overweight and obesity   Since 1965  there has been a 300 percent increase in the number of children ages 6 11 who are overweight  These conditions will contribute to increases in diabetes  cardiovascular disease  and other chronic conditions and have a negative impact on long term health           One goal of the HeLP America Act is to improve the overall wellness of our children by promoting sound nutrition  increasing physical activity  helping diagnosis and prevent mental illness  and providing alternatives to the junk foods that are sold in vending machines and on a la carte menus in schools   Title I will help kids develop good habits by putting fresh fruits and vegetables in school  and taking junk food out   It also takes on the tidal wave of ads in schools and on TV pushing junk foods on our kids   Finally  to promote optimum nutrition for our youngest children  this legislation expands Early Head Start and includes a   baby friendly hospital    initiative for hospitals that promote breastfeeding                Title II  Healthier Communities and Workplaces         Title II will assist businesses and communities in offering a range of opportunities for people to start leading healthier lives   Initiatives include providing tax credits to businesses that offer comprehensive programs to promote employee health  expanding research of mental and behavioral health risks  encouraging new road construction that accommodates bicycles and pedestrians  providing grants to train preventive medicine and public health physicians  and creating a more   mom friendly    breastfeeding environment in the workplace          Title III   Responsible Marketing and Consumer Awareness         Having accurate information about the nutritional value of the food people eat is the first step toward improving overall nutrition   In an effort to increase consumer information and promote a more responsible marketing environment  the HeLP America Act would implement mandatory menu labeling at chain restaurants  and restore the FTC  s rulemaking authority to issue restrictions on unfair advertising to children   The bill will also give the FDA authority to reduce smoking by preventing tobacco advertising which targets children          Title IV   Reimbursement for Prevention Services         At times  preventative screenings for chronic diseases and mental health disorders  counseling to improve nutrition and physical activity  and treatment for substance abuse and smoking cessation can be cost prohibitive   Title IV would provide reimbursements and expand current federal health care programs to pay for more preventative services and counseling  In addition  this legislation requires Medicare to develop a payment methodology for hospitals and chronic care organizations to perform preventive outreach and treatment for chronic diseases before they become fully developed  This change can save Medicare money over the long term           Harkin has promoted preventive healthcare initiatives throughout his career  including increased access to breast cancer screenings  the school fruit and vegetable pilot program  the Menu Education and Labeling Act  MEAL   and tobacco control   Harkin recently spent time visiting and talking with schools  employers and other community organizations in Iowa and nationwide who are doing innovative things to promote wellness   He also held a hearing in Iowa to learn more about the medical and financial costs of chronic conditions such as obesity  tobacco use and mental illness                        Senator Harkin  s Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention  HeLP  America Act
