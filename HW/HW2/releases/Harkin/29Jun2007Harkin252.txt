 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry Committee  today issued the following statement on the acreage report released this morning by the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA   The survey estimates that 92 9 million acres of corn have been planted nationally this spring   Farmers not only met  but exceeded the expectations in the Prospective Plantings report released just three months ago  The corn acreage announced today is at the highest level in over five decades  This demonstrates even more clearly that farmers will respond to market signals arising from the increased demand for corn and ethanol  And it further confirms that production and usage of biofuels can boost farm income  economic growth and jobs in rural communities while enhancing Americas energy security     This figure should further ease concerns about corn supplies this year to meet feed  food and fuel demands  though we all have to hope for good growing conditions the remainder of the season  Intensified crop production also reminds us of the necessity of sound farm conservation and environmental practices and the greater need for conservation support in the new farm bill   Iowa farmers have traditionally led the nation in producing corn  accounting for more than 2 billion bushels of production in each of the last three years  If normal weather prevails in the 2007 08 crop year  these 13 9 million acres planted by Iowa farmers for grain should yield more than 2 4 billion bushels  based on recent trend yields  The most recent weekly Crop Progress report from USDA indicates that 78 percent of the Iowa corn crop is deemed to be in good or excellent condition thus far  suggesting strong prospects for a bumper Iowa corn crop this year       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
