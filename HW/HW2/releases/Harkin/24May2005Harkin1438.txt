        The House of Representatives today has taken a historic stand on behalf of the millions of Americans who could benefit from the enormous promise of stem cell research   A bipartisan majority rejected the restrictive policies of this Administration and voted to expand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research   In doing so  they have brought new hope to Americans who suffer from diseases like Parkinson  s  juvenile diabetes  and ALS  as well as spinal cord injuries            Senator Specter and I have a bill here in the Senate that is identical to what the House passed tonight   Now it  s up to us in the Senate to pass this same bill  without amendments  so we can send it to the President  s desk as soon as possible   The American people cannot afford to wait any longer for our top scientists to realize the full potential of stem cell research            Regrettably  research has been stymied and slowed under the President  s stem cell policy   It offers only false hope to the millions of people across this country who are suffering from diseases that could be cured or treated through stem cell research   We need a policy that offers true  meaningful hope to these patients and their loved ones            Since August 2001  scientists have made great advances in deriving stem cell lines   Many of the new lines were grown without mouse feeder cells   Shouldn  t our top scientists be studying those lines  instead of being limited to 22 lines that will never be used in humans   We don  t require our astronomers to explore the heavens with 19th century telescopes  and we don  t require our geologists to study the Earth with a tape measure   If we are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research  our biomedical researchers need access to the best stem cell lines available              The House performed a great public service today by passing the Castle DeGette bill   It is time for the Senate to act as well   I urge the Majority Leader to allow a vote on the Specter Harkin Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
