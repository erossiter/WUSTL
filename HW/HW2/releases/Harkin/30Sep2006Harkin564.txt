           I believe that strengthening our border security is a key component to any comprehensive immigration solution and that is why I supported the Secure Fence Act   Strengthening our border  however  is only one piece of the puzzle                    We must look at the entire picture   That means we need to continue to work for comprehensive immigration reform that includes tough border security and enforcement of sanctions against employers who hire undocumented workers   It means that we must address the 40 percent of undocumented immigrants who came here legally  and then overstayed their visas   We must effectively and realistically bring the 12 million illegal immigrants out of the shadows   Until then we cannot effectively secure our borders   It is in our national interest to know who is living and working here   That  s why we need a temporary worker program  with documentation  that gives immigrants a reasonable path to earned legalization by paying fines  learning English  paying back taxes and passing a background check                     When it comes to fixing the broken immigration system  Republicans have focused on one tree and refuse to see the full forest    While strengthening our borders is a start  only a broad approach to immigration will have a true impact on the issue   I am hopeful  that when Congress returns  we can once again address this issue so we can achieve a just and fair immigration system    one that secures our borders and is true to our values and tradition                                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
