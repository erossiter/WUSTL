 WASHINGTON  D C   A Government Accountability Office  GAO  released today shows significant gaps in the Department of Agricultures plans for preventing  responding  and recovering from a widespread highly pathogenic avian influenza  HPAI  outbreak or outbreaks  If not remedied  these shortfalls can seriously hamper efforts to respond to HPAI in the United States  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  said today  Harkin is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  and one of the Senators who requested the report   The recent tuberculosis case illustrates how easily the smallest gap in the system can result in a major public health crisis  said Harkin  We were lucky this time  but what if the next time it is the strain of avian influenza circulating in Asia that has caused the deaths of millions of poultry  If that happens  we must be prepared to contain it at its source  whether in animals or humans  so that it doesnt become either an animal health or public health crisis   The GAO identified problems with incomplete planning at the federal and state levels that can slow response and delay recovery from a highly pathogenic avian influenza outbreak  They include      Lack of coordination between the Departments of Agriculture and Homeland Security to clearly define the roles that each agency will take in the event of a declaration of emergency  major disaster  or incident of national significance caused by highly pathogenic avian influenza      Lack of important components that could facilitate rapid containment of the avian influenza virus in 14 of the 19 state response plans for HPAI reviewed by GAO  States typically lead initial response efforts  and rapid action at this level is critical to limiting the spread of disease  Officials cite the lack of federal criteria for what a state HPAI response plan should include  and the lack of resources and staff at the state level for the gaps      Several unresolved issues remain  such as incomplete information on the location and number of backyard birds  questionable surge capacity at diagnostic laboratories  problems with disposal of diseased carcasses  and insufficient personal protective equipment  including antiviral medication  for workers to depopulate diseased animals and clean facilities  These issues all require USDA to work with states to overcome problems that can arise because of them   We must increase the coordination between agencies and between the federal and state governments so that our rapid response system is ready if and when a widespread outbreak of highly pathogenic avian influenza strikes  continued Harkin  This is not a new threat to this country and  while GAO highlights measures USDA has taken to prepare the country for such a threat  there should be no excuse for failing to have a stronger response system in place    A bipartisan group of senators joined Harkin in requesting the GAO study  They are  Saxby Chambliss  R GA   Joseph Lieberman  I CT   Susan Collins  R ME   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Arlen Specter  R PA   Daniel Akaka  D HI  and Richard Burr  R NC    The GAO made five recommendations that can help address the challenges detailed in the report  GAO 07 652  can be found at        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
