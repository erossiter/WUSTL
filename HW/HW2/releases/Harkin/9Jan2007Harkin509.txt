    Stem cell research is about hope   Hope for people with Lou Gehrig  s disease   Hope for people with Parkinson  s   Hope for people with spinal cord injuries  and diabetes  and cancer               This Congress  we will bring these hopes one giant step closer to reality   I predict that  at long last  we will lift the President  s restrictions on stem cell research and finally give our nation  s best scientists the tools they need to produce treatments and cures                 The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act of 2007 is the exact same bill that both houses of Congress passed last year  with strong  bipartisan majorities                  Regrettably  the President chose to exercise the first    and only    veto of his administration to reject the bill  dashing the hopes of millions of Americans who are suffering from diseases that could one day be treated or cured through stem cell research                 But we  re back  and the voices of hope are stronger than ever   In November  the American people elected many new members of Congress who support stem cell research  and replaced many former members of Congress who oppose this research   As a result  we will pass this bill again this year  and the margins of victory will be even wider                Sadly  some are already predicting that the President will veto it for a second time   I hope they  re wrong   I hope he will respect the will of the American people who spoke so clearly on Election Day                But even if he does veto this bill  we will persist   We will use every legislative means at our disposal to make sure that this bill is enacted into law   And I believe it will happen during this Congress                Now I  d like to say a word about the recent study on amniotic stem cells   This is an exciting area of research  but it  s not a new area of research   Scientists have been studying amniotic stem cells for many years   In fact  Senator Specter and I included report language encouraging NIH to promote this research in our Labor HHS appropriations bill two years ago               While the new study is noteworthy  it does not represent a major breakthrough and should not be described as one   In the future  I urge the media to beware of over hyping incremental advances in stem cell research  especially when they are published on the eve of a congressional debate                Many opponents of our bill are now breathlessly touting this new study as if it makes all other forms of stem cell research irrelevant   The fact is  the new paper offers no evidence that amniotic stem cells have as much potential as embryonic stem cells to differentiate into all other cells in the human body   It would be irresponsible from a scientific perspective  and cruel to the millions of Americans who are suffering from diseases like juvenile diabetes  ALS  Parkinson  s and cancer  to abandon efforts to lift the President  s arbitrary restrictions on embryonic stem cell research on the basis of a single new journal article               If we truly want to cure and treat diseases that afflict so many people in this country  our nation  s top scientists should be allowed to pursue all forms of stem cell research    be it embryonic  adult  cord blood or amniotic                 As the author of the new paper  Dr  Atala himself  has emphasized  his study does not in any way diminish the need to pass the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act and enact it into law   I am confident that we will succeed in that mission          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
