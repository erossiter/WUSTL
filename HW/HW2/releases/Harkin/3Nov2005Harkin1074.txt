       WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today denounced Senate approval of two separate bills that will cut assistance for farmers  rural communities and conservation   This morning  the Senate passed the fiscal year 2006 agriculture appropriations bill and is expected to pass its version of federal budget cuts later today   Both of these bills cut funds previously dedicated to farm bill initiatives and scale back assistance to farmers and rural communities facing soaring energy costs and low crop prices   The budget cuts are part of a broader agenda that will increase the federal budget deficit through a new round of tax giveaways that largely benefit the wealthiest Americans               The Senate today is voting on not one  but two bills cutting assistance to farmers and rural America     said Harkin     That  s what I call a double whammy to rural America   The fiscal train wreck and budget priorities of the Bush Administration and Republican Congress are going to hurt farmers  food consumers  small towns and the environment nationwide                The Senate is expected to vote later today on a budget reconciliation package that cuts agriculture funding by  3 billion dollars   Earlier today  the Senate also approved the annual agriculture appropriations bill which cuts conservation  rural development and agriculture research   The cuts to agriculture are designed to take money away from agriculture to ease passage of another round of tax cuts for America  s wealthiest               Farm conservation is attacked in both bills  Cuts to conservation represent 41 percent of funds cut from agriculture in budget reconciliation  even though conservation is only 22 percent of the agriculture spending dealt with in the bill  Both bills will severely limit the Conservation Security Program  CSP   in which Iowa ranked first nationally in contracts awarded last year  thus ensuring thousands of farmers will be denied enrollment in this program                 These consecutive cuts to agriculture  conservation and rural initiatives clearly demonstrate the misguided priorities of Congress and the Bush Administration     said Harkin     While farmers are dealing with record energy costs  Congress is busy slashing their safety net   Today is not a good day for America  s family farmers             Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry and will oppose both the federal budget and appropriations bills voted on today                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
