               WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today introduced bipartisan legislation to improve students  eating habits and improve children s overall health   The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act would update decades old federal nutrition standards for snack foods sold in school cafeterias alongside the regular school meals  and would apply those standards everywhere on school grounds  including in vending machines and school stores                           We must bring nutrition guidelines for foods sold outside of the cafeteria in line with those required for food sold inside of the cafeteria   said Harkin    School breakfast and lunch programs adhere to strong guidelines  but as soon as students leave the cafeteria  they are inundated with the over promotion of junk food in vending machines and snack bars   This undercuts our investment in school meal programs and steers kids toward a future of obesity and diet related disease   We must update nutritional guidelines across the board                                Current federal regulations limiting the sale of junk food in schools are very narrow and have not been updated in almost 30 years  despite major changes in nutritional science during that time   In addition  though a narrow category of junk foods cannot be sold in certain areas of schools  even the prohibited junk foods can be sold anywhere else on campus    including just outside the cafeteria    at any time                               According to Government Accountability Office  GAO   99 percent of high schools  97 percent of middle schools  and 83 percent of elementary schools have vending machines  school stores  or snack bars   The most common items sold out of school vending machines  school stores  and snack bars include soda and sports drinks  salty snacks  candy  and high fat baked goods                             The Harkin proposal would address both problems by requiring updated nutritional standards for all foods sold at school  and would apply those standards to all foods sold during the school day everywhere on schools grounds                            Increasing scientific evidence shows the risks that poor diet has down the line for children and adolescents   continued Harkin    Thirty years is far too long to allow our nutritional guidelines to remain stagnant   We must address this problem and do what is right for the health of our kids                          The bill was first introduced in the 109th Congress  and since that time has garnered strong support from the scientific and education communities  who are in favor of national nutrition standards   A sampling of the public health and education groups that have endorsed the legislation include                            American Academy of Pediatrics                American Cancer Society                    American Diabetes Association                    American Dietetic Association                         American Federation of Teachers                      American Heart Association                      American Medical Association                       American Public Health Association                       National Association of School Nurses                      National Association of State Boards of Education                      National Education Association                       National Parent Teacher Association                          School Nutrition Association                    Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska joined Harkin in introducing the bill   Other co sponsors include Senator Menendez of New Jersey  Senator Voinovich of Ohio  Senator Cantwell of Washington  Senator Lieberman of Connecticut  Senator Durbin of Illinois  Senator Carper of Delaware  and Senator Schumer of New York   Identical bipartisan legislation is expected to be introduced in the House of Representatives                        Harkin has been the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children   Harkin is the author of the Harkin Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools   He is also the sponsor of the 2005 Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention  HeLP  America Act which focuses on prevention and wellness to confront our nation s rise in chronic disease                                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
