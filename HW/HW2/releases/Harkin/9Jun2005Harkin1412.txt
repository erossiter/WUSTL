        With this bill  we are planting the seeds of a new kind of economy     Harkin said    We must look to crops grown in the United States and less to oil drilled in the Middle East  There is enough biomass in this country for fuel to replace at least one quarter of U S  oil imports  Our country has been hostage to drastic swings in gas prices for too long   With a small investment to get the biobased economy off the ground  we can significantly benefit our national security  our rural economy and the environment               The legislation calls for a slate of initiatives to advance a biobased economy  including            n       Increasing funding for biomass research and development         n       Incentives for the first billion gallons of ethanol made from cellulosic biomass         n       Establishing an assistant secretary position within the United States Department of Agriculture to advance the development of biobased energy and products         n       Extending biobased product procurement requirements to federal government contractors  and the U S  Capitol         n       Providing funds for bioeconomy education and outreach to farmers and consumers           n       Grants to small biobased businesses and regional associations to assist with commercialization and marketing of bioproducts         n       In total  the bill dedicates more than one billion dollars in mandatory funding to develop energy from underutilized resources              This legislation will accelerate the development of high quality fuels and alternatives to other petrochemical products using crops grown in the U S      said Georg Anderl  President of the BIOWA Development Association  a coalition of biobased industries  agricultural producers  investment experts  academics and conservationists working to develop Iowa s bioeconomy    This strategy is vital to our national security  given our unhealthy and unsafe dependence on foreign oil                The bill has been praised by agricultural producers  biobased businesses  environmental groups  and national security experts   The United States generates nearly 300 million tons of biomass a year that is capable of being converted to ethanol  industrial chemicals  lubricants and plastics  which currently are made with petroleum products   Recent evidence suggests that a mature biomass industry would substantially benefit farmers by providing billions of dollars annually to the rural economy   Currently  conversion of some biomass to energy is comparatively costly  but several recent reports that a relatively small investment in improved technology could make biobased fuels and products competitive with petroleum based equivalents within the next ten years                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
