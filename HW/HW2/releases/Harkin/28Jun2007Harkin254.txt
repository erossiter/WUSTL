 America is a nation of immigrants  but we are a nation that believes in controlled immigration  Since the beginning of the debate on how to fix our broken immigration system  I have emphasized three core concerns  strengthening our borders  holding employers accountable if they hire illegal immigrants  and dealing with the 12 million undocumented immigrants in a way that is practical and fair to American workers and taxpayers   In the post 9 11 world  our broken immigration system poses a very real threat to national security  I have supported and continue to support tough  rigorous enforcement of our immigration laws  This years immigration bill added 20 000 new border patrol agents  more unmanned aerial vehicles  cameras and sensors  plus 370 miles of new border fencing  coupled with an additional  4 4 billion in funding to secure the border  measures that are long overdue    At the same time  we need to send a strong message to employers that they will be held accountable for hiring undocumented workers and perpetuating the flow of illegal workers  Until recently  the Bush Administration was extremely lax in enforcing the law  with virtually no worksite enforcement against employers who hire undocumented workers  In fact  in 2004  only three cases were brought against such employers in the entire United States  During the same calendar year  the administration imposed a grand total of only  118 529 in fines for such violations  By contrast  in just the last two years of the Clinton Administration  the government brought 291 cases against employers and imposed  5 9 million in fines  Enforcement efforts must be carried out in an orderly and humane fashion  but we must reverse this practice of turning a blind eye to employers who knowingly break the law    The bill before us does a decent job of addressing these three core concerns  But the bill as a whole  frankly  has evolved into an unworkable mess  and I cannot support it    As the bill has been debated and amended  I have listened closely to Iowans from all walks of life  Their concerns about the flaws in this bill are heartfelt  and most are legitimate  One of their most common criticisms is that the bill fails to address the harsh reality that a large  continuous influx of additional immigrant workers  workers who effectively have no rights and are vulnerable to exploitation  is having a negative impact on American jobs and wages  Iowans have told me that immigrant workers too often are pitted against American workers in a way that drives down wages and benefits  and weakens the bargaining power of all workers  I share these concerns    I voted for an amendment to strike the guest worker program because I believe it would hurt American workers  It would add millions of new immigrants to the workforce  likely driving down wages and benefits for American workers  especially those on the lower rungs of the economic ladder  Jobs in construction  manufacturing and transportation are the backbone of our blue collar middle class  We should not deliberately allow a flood of immigrant labor to depress wages  benefits  and bargaining power in these critical sectors of our economy    Another important aspect of the Senate bill  Title III  which includes the employer verification system  would impact every single employer and every single worker in the United States  Yet the haphazardly designed system in the bill could have devastating consequences  Work authorized individuals  including U S  citizens  could be denied employment because of an error in a government database  and businesses could be denied their workforce  We included these important safeguards and privacy protection measures in last years bill  yet failed to do so in the underlying bill  I consider them essential to a workable and enforceable employer verification system   In addition  the current Senate bill dramatically changes more than 40 years of family based legal immigration by eliminating existing family preferences in favor of well educated  higher income workers  workers who would provide even further competition for American jobs  Under this provision  it is entirely possible that my mother would have been prevented from immigrating to this country  She had little schooling  wasnt very proficient in English and just  17 in her pocket when she came over to the U S   in steerage  to marry a man from her village  But my mother made her home in Iowa  worked hard  and raised six children who all went on to be productive members of society  This change was not in last years bill  and represents a truly radical departure from our legal immigration system  It was made without a single hearing to review its impact  and an effort to sunset the provision in five years  so we could have an opportunity to evaluate its impact on immigrant families and American workers  was not adopted   The failure to pass a bill leaves in place a broken immigration system  The status quo is unacceptable  but this bill does not effectively improve it  Unfortunately  I do not see a realistic path for making sufficient improvements in this gravely flawed bill  I remain committed to working for a comprehensive solution that is fair to American workers and taxpayers  and that offers a practical solution to our nations broken immigration system
