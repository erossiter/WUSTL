    WASHINGTON D C       After a 10 year struggle to boost the lowest wages of American workers  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today applauded the Senate  s passage of a bill to raise the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour  The bill passed 94 3            Raising the minimum wage is a much needed step toward bringing more social and economic justice to our country  This legislation is 10 years overdue and the delay has been unconscionable and unacceptable              Too many hard working Americans are struggling to get by    even though they work 40 hours a week  52 weeks a year  they are condemned to living in poverty   The truth is that 80 percent of workers affected by the proposed increase are adults   Fifty nine percent of workers who earn the minimum wage are women  The average minimum wage worker brings home more than half of their family  s income            We  ve taken a step today toward better compensating many hard working Americans  While it  s been long coming  I applaud the bill  s passage and look forward to the President signing it into law                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
