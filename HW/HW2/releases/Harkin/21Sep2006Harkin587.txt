      WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Chuck Grassley  R IA  today expressed support for the Senate  s passage of H R  3408  legislation that reauthorizes the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act  LMR  until 2010   The Iowa Senators also pledged to continue their push for additional improvements in the LMR system that would address the outstanding needs of producers and incorporate recent recommendations by the Government Accountability Office  GAO    The GAO report  commissioned by Harkin and Grassley  exposed serious flaws in transparency and accuracy throughout the law   Both Senators have received commitments from Agriculture Chairman Saxby Chambliss to address these issues in the next Congress            Passing this bill now ensures producers that the mandatory reporting law is back on the books     said Harkin     However  there is still much room for improvement in the LMR system   I look forward to working with Senator Grassley and Chairman Chambliss to addressing the needs of producers and problems cited by the GAO in the next Congress               While the passage of the bill is not an ideal scenario  it was important that we have mandatory reporting in place instead of relying on the packers to voluntarily report     Grassley said     Senator Harkin and I  along with Senator Chambliss  will be working in the next year to implement the GAO recommendations that are needed to improve the price reporting system  These are necessary improvements that should allow the family farmer to compete on a level playing field             The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act requires packers  processors  and importers to provide critical price  contracting  supply and demand information to USDA  which uses the information to create price reports for livestock producers            Since the legislation authorizing the Livestock Mandatory Reporting program expired last September  the program has been operating on a voluntary basis   While Harkin and Grassley previously opposed passing the House version until last evening while seeking additional legislative reforms to improve the program   Those additional reforms are still being pursued by Senators Harkin and Grassley with a pledge of cooperation from Chairman Chambliss          Senators Chambliss  Harkin and Grassley also sent a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns urging USDA to report its progress in implementing GAO  s recommendations  and to determine what USDA can do administratively    USDA has not yet provided information to Congress detailing what it has done to implement the GAO recommendations                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
