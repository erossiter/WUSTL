   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   is a co sponsor of Senator Chuck Schumer  s  D NY  legislation  which would require a 45 day review of the port deal and that the Department of Treasury and Homeland Security brief Congress on the review  s findings  and give Congress the authority to reject the deal within 30 days of the review  s completion            I have grave concerns about the Bush Administration  s decision to allow Dubai Ports World to assume management and control of some of the nation  s biggest ports   I believe this raises a host of security concerns that have not been adequately addressed   That is why I strongly support efforts in Congress to place a temporary hold on this transfer so that a further investigation can be conducted  and Congress can review these findings before any final decision is made              The Administration  s casual approach on this just underscores that Congress has to be vigilant and exercise oversight of this review              It is not enough for the Bush Administration to say   trust us     The White House failed to conduct the 45 day review required by law  and completely disregarded concerns expressed by the Coast Guard about the national security implications of the deal            More than four years after the September 11th attacks  security at our nation  s seaports remains dramatically underfunded  The American people deserve to know that all necessary steps have been taken to protect homeland security before this deal is allowed to go forward                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
