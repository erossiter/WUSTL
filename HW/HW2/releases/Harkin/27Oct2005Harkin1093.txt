      Harriet Miers withdrawal is an illustration of how much sway the right wing has at the White House and in the Republican Party   From the moment of her nomination  they viciously attacked her  ultimately killing her nomination             The Senate was ready to fairly and openly consider Harriet Miers nomination  and she should have been given that opportunity   Unfortunately  the pressure from the right wing just got to be too much             The President now must put forth a new nominee to replace Justice O  Connor   I hope he will approach this nomination without partisanship  and send forward a mainstream nominee who will impartially protect the rights and freedoms of all Americans                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
