   Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today issued the following statement after a cloture vote on the farm bill failed today in the Senate  The motion would have allowed the bill to proceed in the Senate after almost two weeks on the floor without action     I was deeply disappointed by this mornings vote to block the farm bill  Frankly  I worry that there is a deliberate and orchestrated attempt to derail the farm bill  Indeed  the farm bill is just one car on a much longer train that includes the childrens health insurance bill and most of the appropriations bills  Between Republican filibusters here in the Senate  and President Bushs barrage of vetoes and veto threats  they seem to be setting up a giant train wreck at the end of this session of Congress  Maybe  the President and Congressional Republicans think a train wreck at the end of this Congress is a good idea  But it is not in the best interests of the American people     It is certainly not in the best interests of the millions of Americans who have a stake in this new farm bill  This bill continues and improves farm income protection and promotes new income opportunities for farm and ranch families  with more help to dairy farmers and particularly to specialty crop producers  It boosts economic growth  jobs and the quality of life in our rural communities  It has excellent new initiatives to help restore our national energy security by promoting biofuels and other renewable energy sources and rural energy initiatives  It makes major new investments in helping farmers and ranchers conserve and enhance the resources on their land  to save soil  increase water quality  conserve wetlands and restore wildlife habitat  It will allow low income Americans to put a little more food on the family table  and it will help improve the diets and health of school children with more fruits and vegetables     But  today  all of this is in jeopardy  So I am hopeful  and yet I am realistic that we must continue to fight to get this strong  bipartisan farm bill through the Senate and enacted into law  That fight will continue today  tomorrow and just as long into next month as it takes to get the job done       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
