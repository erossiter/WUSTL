      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   in a letter sent today to South Korean Ambassador Lee Tae Sik  called for the Republic of Korea to establish clear  transparent  and fair rules regarding beef trade  Recent rejections by South Korea of U S  beef shipments have made it clear the country is not following reasonable standards for commercial trade   South Korea has rejected three separate shipments of U S  beef  the most recent one from an Iowa company   Harkin is the incoming Chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee                  The information we have indicates that South Korea  s rejection of these beef shipments was not in keeping with international trade standards     Harkin said    In order to allow trade between the two countries  South Korea must work in good faith with the United States to set clear and reasonable standards that are fair to U S  beef producers and exporters                  The rejection of these three beef shipments shows that South Korea  s standards are too restrictive to allow commercially reasonable trade to resume  Unless South Korea  s government establishes fair guidelines  U S  beef exports are highly unlikely to ever reach the levels that existed before the discovery of the first BSE case in the United States in 2003  when South Korea was the second largest market for U S  beef             While it is unclear why the recent beef shipments were rejected  it has been reported that periosteum  a connective tissue surrounding bone  was detected in some of the packages inspected  along with thinly sliced bone  Under international standards and according to the terms agreed to by the U S  and South Korea  the presence of this connective tissue should have not been a basis for rejection   Senator Harkin also urged the South Korean government to establish a tolerance for bone fragments in beef shipments                A copy of the letter is pasted below                        December 19  2006         His Excellency Lee Tae Sik Ambassador of the Republic of Korea to the United States 2320 Massachusetts Ave  NW Washington  DC 20008          Dear Ambassador Lee             The recent rejection of three separate modest sized shipments of U S  beef to your country confirm that the standards applied by the Republic of Korea under the agreement of September 2006 are too restrictive to allow commercially reasonable trade in beef   The restrictions appear to doom hopes that exports of U S  beef to South Korea would again reach the level of 2003  before the discovery of the first BSE case in the United States              In the most recent rejection  of a shipment of beef from a company located in my state of Iowa  it is not clear what the main rationale is behind the decision   It has been reported that periosteum  a connective tissue surrounding bone  was detected  in some of the packages inspected  along with thinly sliced bone   There is ambiguity whether actual bone fragments were in fact detected in the shipment  or whether the rejection was based only on the presence of periosteum   Under the standards used by the international community in classifying beef as boneless  and under the terms of the September agreement  this tissue is not regarded as part of the bovine skeleton  and its presence should not have been a basis for rejection              Any reasonable resolution of this dispute should clarify the issue of periosteum  as well as establish a workable tolerance for presence of bone fragments in beef shipped from the United States to South Korea  which is the case with trade in boneless beef elsewhere in the world   The Republic of Korea must establish clear and transparent rules   It is not reasonable to reject an entire shipment based merely on the detection of bone fragments within a handful of packages  nor is it acceptable to reject shipments based on the discovery of periosteum   Further  rejection of one shipment by South Korea should not result in a given company being indefinitely suspended from shipping beef to your country without any known standards for gaining eligibility             I urge your government to move quickly to reach a satisfactory resolution to this critical problem   A copy of this letter will also be sent to U S  Agriculture Secretary Johanns and U S  Trade Representative Schwab            Sincerely yours        Tom Harkin         Ranking Democratic Member           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
