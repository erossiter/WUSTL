     We have a Medicaid system in this country that is spending approximately two thirds of its dollars on institutional care and approximately one third on community services  This bill is an important step toward switching those numbers around     said Harkin      It is shameful that our federal dollars are being spent to segregate people  not integrate them          Under this legislation  the Medicaid money paid by states and the federal government would follow the person with a disability from an institution into the community   The Act would provide 100 percent federal reimbursement for the community services that an individual needs during the first year after they move out of a nursing home or similar facility   After that first year  the individual would remain in the community  and states would receive their regular Medicaid match for their services           This bill would allow people with disabilities to have choices that we all take for granted  to live with family and friends  not with strangers  to live in a neighborhood  not a nursing home or institution     Harkin said     Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the consensus that Americans with disabilities should have an equal opportunity to contribute to our communities and participate in our society as full citizens                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
