   WASHINGTON D C     As President Bush visited Des Moines Iowa today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  criticized the Administration for its failed policies and misplaced budget priorities  Harkin noted that while the President has pushed tax breaks for the wealthiest of Americans  his policies have repeatedly failed hard working Iowans on health care  education  veterans   issues and Social Security            President Bush  s misplaced priorities don  t reflect the values of Iowans     Harkin said    His botched policies have sent this country in the wrong direction and it  s high time for a significant course correction             Social Security           Despite the overwhelming opposition to privatizing Social Security  President Bush once again plans to push ahead with his proposal to privatize the program  Harkin has repeatedly urged the President to work on a bipartisan basis to achieve a plan that will both strengthen Social Security and enhance the retirement security of all Americans             There is no excuse to rush into a plan that will cut benefits for America  s seniors  adds trillions to the debt  and does nothing to strengthen the system     said Harkin     The American people didn  t buy what Bush was selling the first time and I am sure they won  t buy it again             Education         In February 2006  the President Bush proposed the largest cut to education in the 26 year history of the Department of Education   His budget would have cut federal education spending by  2 1 billion  It also would have eliminated 42 programs  including all vocational and technical education programs           The President  s most recent budget also substantially under funded the No Child Left Behind Act  cutting out 3 7 million students who are supposed to receive title I services    including about 18 000 in Iowa          For students hoping to finance their higher education  that same budget froze the maximum Pell Grant award at  4 050  the same amount as four years ago  while tuition costs have raised dramatically            The Bush Administration continues to leave behind some of the best and the brightest who can  t afford the skyrocketing cost of education     Harkin said          Health Care         While giving away millions in tax breaks to the wealthy  the Bush Administration sought funding cuts for 17 of the 18 institutes at the National Institutes of Health this year  That would have meant that funds for the National Cancer Institute would drop by  40 million  and funds for the National Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute would drop by  21 million          During the Bush Presidency  the number of uninsured Americans increased to 46 1 million with an additional 1 5 million in 2005 alone  At the same time  fewer Americans are finding health insurance through their employers  For those who can  the average health insurance premium has increased 87  over the last six years            The Republicans have made giveaways to the rich a higher priority than funding life saving medical research and development  or expanding access to critical healthcare coverage     Harkin said          Veterans          For our dedicated veterans who have bravely served their country  the Bush Administration has said thank you with budget proposals that have resulted in higher veterans   health care fees  reduced veterans   health care services and longer benefit wait times          Most notably  the President  s budget this year would have slashed funding by 50 percent for the Brain Injury Center at Walter Reed Army Medical Center  the premier center for treating head injuries  which have become  sadly  the signature wounds of the Iraq war             This is beyond the usual nickel and diming of our returning veterans  It is callous and cruel     Harkin said    Our service men and women who give so much for this country deserve better                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
