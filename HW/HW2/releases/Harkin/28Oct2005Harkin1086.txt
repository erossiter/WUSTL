           The United States has made a proposal  and while the EU  s announcement today is a positive step  they  re going to have to do better to strike a deal on this   For too long  Europe has maintained tariffs and trade distorting payments to farmers that dwarf those of the United States               I am concerned that the EU once again is demanding a high price tag for what appears to be modest improvements in exports for U S  farmers   The EU only vaguely addressed how it will reform high tariffs that now protect many EU products from competition   These unanswered questions are critical in evaluating any proposal from the EU                 I particularly object to their insistence that America change its international food aid   U S  food aid helps millions of impoverished people who do not have access to sufficient food  yet the EU demands that we reform a policy that has been successful and highly beneficial   I call on Ambassador Portman to continue resisting demands to reduce American food aid    this is not time to scale back food assistance for developing countries                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
