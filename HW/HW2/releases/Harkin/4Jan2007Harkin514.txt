      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today will reintroduce the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  S 5   legislation to lift the President  s arbitrary restrictions on stem cell research   The bipartisan measure would allow federal funding for stem cell research using stem cell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in vitro fertilization embryos  regardless of the date they were derived   Harkin will be joined by Majority Leader Harry Reid  D NV   and Senators Arlen Specter  R PA   Ted Kennedy  D MA   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Orrin Hatch  R UT  and Gordon Smith  R OR  in reintroducing the legislation                    Stem cell research offers hope to millions of Americans who suffer from a wide range of diseases     said Harkin     This Congress  we will bring these hopes one giant step closer to reality   At long last  we will lift the President  s restrictions on stem cell research and finally give our nation  s best scientists the tools they need to produce treatments and cures                       Top researchers at the National Institutes of Health  NIH   leading Nobel Prize scientists and countless health and medical leaders have all advocated for the expansion of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research  NIH estimates there are currently 400 stem cell lines worldwide   Because of the President  s arbitrary restrictions  federal funding can only be used to study just 21 of those lines  all of which are contaminated by mouse cells                If we are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research  our scientists need access to the best stem cell lines available     said Harkin     We need a stem cell policy that offers true  meaningful hope   And that  s what S  5 would provide  I believe that in this new Congress  hope will prevail             The bill is the exact same bill introduced today by Representatives Diana DeGette and Mike Castle  H R  3    Both bills are identical to the bill that both houses of Congress passed last year  with strong  bipartisan majorities   The House passed the bill 238 to 194  and the Senate passed it 63 to 37   Regrettably  the President chose to exercise the first    and  so far  the only    veto of his administration to reject the bill              With his veto  the President ignored the will of the American people   He ignored scores of Nobel laureates   He ignored the top scientists at the National Institutes of Health     said Harkin     And so  with one stroke of his pen  he dashed the hopes of millions of Americans who are suffering from diseases that could one day be treated or cured through stem cell research   But we  re back  and the voices of hope are stronger than ever                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
