 WASHINGTON  D C   Late last night  after a long fight  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  ushered the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act of 2007 unanimously through the Senate  For the past two months a Republican Senator placed a hold on the non controversial  heavily bipartisan bill  preventing it from moving forward  With great effort  Harkin was able to convince his colleague to allow the Act through  Congressman Leonard Boswell  D IA  will lead the bill through the House of Representatives for final approval before sending it to the Presidents desk for his signature   The Omvig Act directs the Department of Veterans Affairs  VA  to integrate mental health services into veterans primary care  and step up counseling and other mental health services for returning war veterans  it is named after Joshua Omvig  a soldier from Grundy Center Iowa who took his own life after returning from Iraq   I am heartened to see that after many months of talking about preventing suicide among our veterans  Congress finally took action  The Omvig familys patience and selfless determination in seeing this through so other soldiers and families are protected is truly commendable  This is a matter of honoring the memory of their son Josh  said Harkin  And it is a matter of honoring the service and sacrifice of all our men and women in uniform  It is shockingly evident that our veterans urgently need the screening and counseling that this bill would require   The VA estimates that more than 5 000 veterans take their lives each year  Suicide rates are 35 percent higher for Iraq veterans than for the general population  And the Department of Defense recently reported that the Army is now seeing the highest rate of suicide since the Vietnam War  A study in this Julys issue of Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health found that those who have been in combat are twice as likely to commit suicide as men who have not served in a war   The memories of combat haunt many of our men and women who have served  We must provide the resources and support to prevent the unnecessary deaths of the men and women who have put their lives on the line to defend our nation  said Harkin  I look forward to seeing the President sign this critical bill into law to ensure that programs are in place to meet the needs of veterans       Specifically  the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act       Ensures 24 hour access to mental health care for veterans who are deemed at risk for suicide  including those in rural or geographically remote locations       Provides suicide prevention education and training for all VA staff  contractors  and medical personnel who interact with veterans       Creates a Family Education Program to assist family members and veterans in understanding the readjustment process  signs and symptoms of mental illness  and risk factors for suicide       Implements a Veterans Peer Support Program as an adjunct to mental health services that includes social support and suicide prevention       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
