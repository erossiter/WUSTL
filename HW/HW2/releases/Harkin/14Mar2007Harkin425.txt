                When I voted for the No Child Left Behind Act five years ago  I did so with the understanding that President Bush would work with Congress to provide schools with the resources they need to implement the law   The administration had negotiated closely with Members of Congress on the authorization levels  and I took the President at his word that he would take those levels seriously                              Unfortunately  that hasn t happened   Year after year  the President sends us a budget that comes nowhere close to funding No Child Left Behind at an adequate level                               The numbers have gotten almost laughable   The President s FY08 budget underfunds NCLB by  14 8 billion  for a cumulative shortfall of  70 9 billion since enactment of the law   Funding for Title I alone   the cornerstone of the law   would be shortchanged by  11 1 billion  for a cumulative shortfall of  54 7 billion                                 I fully understand that the authorization levels were estimates   No one knows exactly how much it will cost to enable every child in America to achieve at a proficient level  as the law requires   But it s clear that we in the Federal government have not done our share   We ve put new demands on schools and states   which is fine   but we haven t given them the resources they need to meet those demands                                    In fact  many districts have actually seen their Title I funding decline since Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act   In Iowa  for example  more than half of the districts in the State will receive less Title I funding in FY07 than they did six years ago  in FY01  the year before NCLB was passed   That is not acceptable   We should not be requiring the majority of school districts to make huge improvements in student achievement at the same time we re cutting their funding                                    That s an important point as Congress considers reauthorizing the No Child Left Behind Act this year   Accountability is important  I m all for accountability   But raising student achievement takes more than testing   It also takes money   It takes money to hire good teachers  update the curricula  develop high quality assessments  and make all the other improvements that schools need to leave no child behind   And I assure you   Before I vote to reauthorize No Child Left Behind  I will insist that it s adequately funded                                     The President s budget for FY08 does provide some bright spots   I applaud the proposal to provide  500 million to help turn around schools in need of improvement   That funding is long overdue                                        I also welcome the proposed  1 1 billion increase for Title I   Unfortunately  all the money for both of those increases would come from eliminating dozens of programs that are of high priority to Congress   programs like education technology  arts in education  school counseling  and Byrd Honors Scholarships                                 The administration plays this game every year   Madame Secretary  you know we re not going to zero out Byrd Scholarships  The same goes for school counseling   I created that program  and I m proud I did   We re not going to eliminate it                                 So I have no idea where we ll get  1 1 billion for Title I  without more money than the President has included in his budget                         I hope today s hearing will shed some light on these issues   I ll be particularly interested in three questions                            1  Has the Federal government provided enough funding to implement No Child Left Behind adequately                                   2  Would additional funding help improve student achievement                             3  And if additional funding were available for education  what would be the most effective ways to appropriate it                              Before I introduce our witnesses  I d like to yield to my friend and ranking member  Senator Specter                                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
