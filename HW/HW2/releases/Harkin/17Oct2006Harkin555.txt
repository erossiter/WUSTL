      October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month  but the war on cancer needs to be waged all 12 months during the year   That was the message scores of Iowans delivered along with some 10 000 other Americans at the American Cancer Society  s Celebration on the Hill in Washington earlier this fall   And they had another message for their members of Congress   The proposed cuts in funding for cancer research    for a second year in a row    are unconscionable and unacceptable                  For me  this is personal   I have lost two sisters to breast cancer  one brother to prostate cancer  and another brother to thyroid cancer   I appreciate that hundreds of thousands of other Iowans and their loved ones have also been touched by cancer   This is why I have been an outspoken advocate of robust funding for research at the National Cancer Institute   Between 1998 and 2003  I partnered with Senator Arlen Specter  R PA  to double funding for the National Institutes of Health  NIH   one of the world  s great biomedical research agencies                  We have made tremendous progress in the war against cancer   But  today  proposed budget cuts threaten to take us backward   The President  s budget for fiscal year 2007 would cut funding for the National Cancer Institute by  40 million   That comes on the heels of a  35 million cut in fiscal year 2006   The President  s budget also cuts cancer programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  including reductions to breast and cervical cancer screening programs                 A 40 million cut means that NCI would award 80 fewer new  competing research grants than this year   It means that the United States will say no to 80 potential medical breakthroughs that have gone through the peer review process  received an excellent score  and been deemed worthy of NIH funding   And that is a real shame                   Instead of funding a war on cancer  these proposed budget cuts would fund a retreat in the war on cancer                When cancer survivor Lance Armstrong was in Iowa this summer to ride in RAGBAI  he testified before my Senate field hearing in Ames on cancer research   Lance noted that the war on cancer is not a partisan issue   The war on cancer is everyone  s fight                 President Bush got it right four years ago when he said    In order to win the war on cancer  we must fund the war on cancer       It is time for him    it is time for all of us    to make good on that commitment            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
