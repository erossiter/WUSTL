      In February  Harkin and thirteen other Senators wrote to President Bush asking him to explain how the administration  s Social Security privatization proposals will affect people with disabilities   In response  Social Security Commissioner Jo Anne Barnhart stated that the President has no plans to cut benefits for people currently collecting disability and survivor benefits  but left open the possibility that he would support a reduction in disability and survivor payments for people who may become eligible in the future            Three in ten currently healthy twenty year olds will become disabled at some point in their lives and  as a result  will require financial assistance to survive  The majority of these workers will not have worked long enough to have accumulated enough money in private accounts to meet even their most basic needs     Harkin said     The American people need to know with certainty that the President will not cut these needed benefits             Social Security is critical for the 6 2 million Americans that receive disability benefits  Equally important  people with disabilities rely on all facets of Social Security  including Retirement Insurance when they age out of SSDI  benefits from their parents who have reached retirement age  and Survivor  s Insurance   All the while  Social Security has been able to provide this support at a relatively low cost          The president  s own Social Security Commission  s calculations assume that disability benefits will be cut the same as retirement benefits   Additionally  a General Accounting Office  GAO  report in the 107th Congress found that all Social Security privatization proposals would require cuts to disability payments              President Bush says that he has no current plans to cut disability benefits   And I hope that remains the case   Unfortunately  the president  s Social Security privatization plan leaves a lot of questions as to how people with disabilities will be treated     Harkin said     Before Congress can begin to consider Social Security reform  it is essential to know how people with disabilities will be affected             Other senators that signed onto the letter include  Max Baucus  D MT   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Barbara Boxer  D CA    Maria Cantwell  D WA   Mark Dayton  D MN   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Edward Kennedy  D MA   John Kerry  D MA   Mary Landrieu  D LA   Frank Lautenberg  D NJ   Blanche Lincoln  D AR   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Patty Murray  D WA   Harry Reid  D NV   Ken Salazar  D CO   Paul Sarbanes  D MD   Charles Schumer  D NY   and Ron Wyden  D OR                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
