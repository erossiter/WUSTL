        This is terrible news for our students     Harkin said     Our schools are struggling to improve student achievement and meet the strict requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act  but President Bush and the Republican controlled Congress seem to expect them to work miracles with less and less money               Title I  the cornerstone program of the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB   is a formula grant program designed to help school districts improve their instruction to disadvantaged students  The NCLB established specific funding levels for Title I for every year through 2007  but President Bush and the Republican controlled Congress have repeatedly failed to meet their commitments  In FY 2005  the law authorized  20 5 billion for Title I  but Congress provided just  12 7 billion    a  7 8 billion shortfall                This is just one more example of the huge gap between this Administration  s promises and its actual performance     Harkin said     The outlook is just as bleak for next year  unless Republican members of Congress will join Democrats in seeking more funding for education                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
