         I am also excited that a significant piece of   bioeconomy    legislation that I authored has been accepted into the energy conference report   The provision provides targeted biomass research and development to expand the use of farm based fuels  chemicals and power   It also calls for grants to small biobased businesses to get their products into the market  increases purchases of farm based biobased products by the federal government and will result in an additional one billion gallons of ethanol through federal government support for cutting edge fuels production   Through a coordinated federal effort we can bring down the cost of converting biomass   corn  soy  wheat  switchgrass and others   into effective petroleum substitutes for everyday use in our cars  homes  and businesses              This is a good day for rural America as these provisions will bolster income  and provide new jobs to small communities   It is also a good day for the nation  s energy security since these provisions will help reduce demand for foreign oil by replacing it with home grown renewable fuels and products of all kinds   I hope that we see these very important provisions enacted into law as soon as possible                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
