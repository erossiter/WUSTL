 WASHINTON  D C   Late last night Senator Tom Harkin voted to reauthorize the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  which would provide basic health insurance to 6 6 million children whose parents cannot afford private insurance  but who do not qualify for Medicaid  Iowas program  Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa  HAWK I   has already provided health insurance to nearly 50 000 children and the Harkin supported legislation would cover nearly 15 000 more children over the next five years  Now that this bill has passed the Senate by a vote of 68 31  a joint House and Senate conference committee will meet to merge each chambers legislation before ultimately sending it to the Presidents desk for his signature   However  President Bush has threatened to veto Congress action without presenting a viable alternative  Bush proposed  4 8 billion in additional funding for the program  a staggeringly low amount even to maintain current enrollment levels  According to the Congressional Budget Office  Bushs proposal would cut 1 4 million children and pregnant women from the Childrens Health Insurance Program  Members of the Presidents own party support the Senates strong package which would provide for almost 10 million children   This bill enjoys the strong support of a large number of staunch conservatives here in the Senate and in the other body  and it has no more outspoken champion than my colleague from Iowa  Senator Grassley  said Harkin  It is just incomprehensible to me that President Bush is pledging to veto this bill because it would extend coverage of the Childrens Health Insurance Program to too many children   According to a recent poll  nine in 10 Americans  including 83 percent of self identified Republicans  support expanding the CHIP   Harkin also noted that investing in childrens health care early on will save taxpayer dollars later in life  Expanding this program is not only the right thing to do  it is also the smart  cost effective thing to do  When children get access to preventive and primary care  all kinds of good things happen  Kids get better health outcomes  they stay out of the emergency  they do better in school  said Harkin   For example  when asthmatic children enroll in the program  the frequency of their attacks declines by approximately 60 percent  and the likelihood that they will be hospitalized for the condition declines by more than 70 percent   Harkin will hold media events in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids next week to discuss his efforts to increase funding for the HAWK I program       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
