         WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin today praised the Department of Agriculture decision to begin the 2006 sign up for the Conservation Security Program  CSP  on Feb  13  2006  but expressed disappointment that the number of farmers eligible to participate would be substantially reduced  The program will be implemented on just 60 watersheds  down from the 110 watersheds previously announced for 2006 and far below the 2005 sign up in 220 watersheds nationwide   In Iowa  sign up will continue in the South Skunk and Grant Little Maquoketa but will be discontinued in the Middle Iowa Watershed       A series of Congressional budget caps on funding since the 2002 farm bill have limited the program  s growth and ability to achieve conservation goals              This program plays an important role in promoting conservation on working lands     said Harkin      I appreciate Secretary Johanns   action in moving forward in a timely manner on this   I am however disappointed that the number of watersheds has been reduced by nearly half   It is unfortunate that Congress and the Bush Administration have continually capped and cut funding for the CSP     These misguided budget priorities hit home today as USDA chose to drop the Middle Iowa watershed from the final group  cutting an estimated 2781 farms and over 900 000 acres that would been eligible to enroll in the CSP             Last week  Senator Harkin joined Agriculture Committee Chair Saxby Chambliss in sending a letter to USDA urging that CSP sign up to be announced quickly so farmers could complete the process before spring planting                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
