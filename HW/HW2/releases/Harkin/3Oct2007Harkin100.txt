 WASHINGTON  D C   As part of his ongoing effort to support Iowas first responders  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that four Iowa communities received a total of  275 635 from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   These grants provide Iowa firefighters and paramedics with the resources they need to ensure the safety of Iowa families  Harkin said  I am pleased that this funding will allow Iowas first responders to obtain the equipment and training required to respond to fires and medical emergencies as effectively and efficiently as possible   The AFG Program helps Iowa communities purchase emergency medical service  EMS  and firefighting equipment  improve facilities  and implement health and wellness programs  Fire and EMS departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new ambulances  fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel   Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban EMS and fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural EMS and fire departments  For example  at least 55 percent of the programs funding must go to fire departments that use volunteer firefighters  which ensures that small towns do not have to compete with large cities for funding  Additionally  the program allows smaller communities to contribute less in local funding  These stipulations make it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program   The individual grant awards are as follows  21 406 to the Coggon Fire Department   18 928 to the Johnson County Ambulance Service   97 076 to the Van Horne Firemans Association   138 225 to the Halbur Fire Department      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
