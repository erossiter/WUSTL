 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today again urged President Bush to drop his veto threat and sign into law the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations bill  which funds more than  3 2 million for vital education and health care initiatives for Eastern Iowa  The Senate passed the bill with a bi partisan vote of 56 37  the House will vote on the legislation before sending it to the Presidents desk   As Chair of the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations bill Harkin crafted this bipartisan  fiscally responsible bill to restore funding for crucial health care and education initiatives after years of damaging budget shortfalls  In addition to funding national programs including Head Start  Pell Grants  and medical and cancer research  the measure contains a  250 million increase for the national Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   At a time when energy prices are at an all time high  Iowa families deserve assurances that they will not have to make sacrifices that leave them out in the cold   This bill provides a much needed boost for initiatives that help Central Iowans build a better life for themselves and their families  We have worked within our budget restraints and funded Iowans priorities  programs such as the University of Dubuques nursing program to continue their accredited department and the Putnam Museum of History and Natural Sciences in Davenport for exhibits and community outreach  Harkin said  President Bush stands in the way of progress if he vetoes this bill  and Iowa families will have to pay the price for his mistake       Among the common sense investments contained in this bill is  550 000 for Saint Ambrose University in Davenport for the construction of a Center for Health Sciences Education  Joan Lescinski  CSJ  Ph D   President of St  Ambrose University said that the new Center will improve patient care in eastern Iowa and western Illinois by graduating qualified nurses  occupational therapists and physical therapists to fill shortages at local hospitals and other health care organizations   These federal funds are integral and necessary to completing this project before classes begin in fall 2009  These funds will provide incentives to attract the additional contributions needed to completely fund this project  said Lescinksi    450 000 will go to Loras College in Dubuque to work on a literacy program for the Dubuque Elementary School District   Loras College has a strong commitment to literacy  We have an existing program already which is making great strides in this area  The money we would receive from this pending legislation would enhance these efforts and allow a fuller collaboration with the Dubuque Community Schools  said John Walsh  Senior Development Officer of Loras College  Certainly no issue is more fundamental to the health of our democracy than the assurance that all Americans can read and write   The Barnabus Uplift in Waverly has been approved to receive  425 000 for job training and supportive services  Bishop Stevel Ullestad of the Northeastern Iowa Synod said  Barnabus Uplift is an interfaith social ministry network of Lutherans  Catholics and Muslims  It is designed to create economic opportunity  access to health care  and substance abuse education in order to strengthen the families of Iowa  With this funding we will be able to expand these services to the entire state with emphasis on small towns and core cities   The Ottumwa Regional Health Center is also set to receive  400 000 to help purchase a digital mammography unit  The benefits of digital mammography include reduced examination time and exposure  and more importantly  improved cancer detection among women  especially those under age 50 years  Tom Siemers  President and CEO of Ottumwa Regional  said that the hospital has been working for several months with Harkin and his staff to obtain this funding   This is good news for the residents of southeast Iowa that look to us for such specialized diagnostic capabilities  Siemers said  It is especially good news for our hospital as we continue to be financially constrained by Iowas poor reimbursement formulas  thus limiting our budget for capital purchases  This one piece of technology comes with a price tag of just under half a million dollars   A full list of Eastern Iowa and statewide initiatives that would receive funding in the bill are listed below   DAVENPORT  Figge Foundation  Davenport   300 000 for exhibits  education
