      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised Senate passage of the Postal Reform bill   The legislation included a Harkin provision that would block the U S  Postal Service  USPS  from implementing any consolidation study until the Postal Service conducts a transparent study   The provision makes all the analysis of potential service delays and consolidation costs public  and requires that the community be informed about consolidation and be able to provide input into the study process before a decision is made   This means that USPS cannot move mail processing operations from Sioux City  Iowa to Sioux Falls  South Dakota unless it includes public input in the consolidation process   The Postal Reform bill will now be considered by a House Senate Conference Committee   The President must sign the legislation before it becomes law                    Postal service in the Sioux City area could face a real setback if the Siouxland facility is moved out of state     said Harkin      That is why the Siouxland community deserves the opportunity to voice its concerns about the consolidation process before a final decision is made  not afterwards   A solid analysis on service and delivery time that includes input from the community should be required in the consolidation process   I am pleased this legislation will fix this flawed process                Last week  Harkin along with the Iowa delegation called on Postmaster General John Potter to increase communication between the USPS and Siouxland community leaders    In late January  Harkin along with Siouxland area officials  met with Bill Galligan  Senior Vice President for Operations for USPS   However  USPS failed to clearly provide the criteria they used when making consolidation decisions or to provide a clear timeline of when it will make its final decision   Most important of all  local postal customers and businesses have received no explanation of likely service delays and degradations as a result of consolidation                                  Harkin has also requested that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  conduct a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Eight months later  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing GAO  s recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
