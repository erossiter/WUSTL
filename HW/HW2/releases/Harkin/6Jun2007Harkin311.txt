 Obviously  this case raises grave questions as to how prepared we are as a nation to prevent the spread of a dangerous infectious disease   We did this because we know that public health  both on the federal and local levels  is our first line of defense against new and existing infectious diseases  We did this because we knew the threats we faced from both bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases  for example  SARS or pandemic flu  In the case of pandemic flu  we know that we have to count on our public health system because we will not have a vaccine for months after an outbreak    That is why I am dismayed and concerned that so many things went wrong in this case of drug resistant tuberculosis  This is not the first and will not be the last time that we count on our public health system to keep us safe  Some things went right  The doctor who first diagnosed the TB in the Atlanta man did  indeed  report the case to the local health department  The local health department did respond  and either suggested or directed  I dont know which  the patient not to travel overseas  But then the records get less clear  Clearly  there are gaps in planning on how to control the travel of persons with dangerous infectious diseases  Its as though the issue had never been raised before  We are told that there were legal issues to resolve  But sound planning calls for resolving those issues in advance   The purpose of this hearing is to learn more about what happened in this particular case  and  more importantly  to learn what is being done to prevent something similar from happening again Bear in mind that an incident like this could have happened on a cruise ship  a train  on a busy commuter subway  We need to be planning for these kinds of possibilities  and we need to test those plans to see if they will work in the real world   This hearing will also give us an opportunity to learn more about the growing problem of drug resistant tuberculosis  and other drug resistant infections diseases  and what is begin done and should be done to address those threats       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
