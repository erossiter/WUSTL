          The possibility of a deadly outbreak of avian flu is real  and time is of the essence     Harkin said     The threat of pandemic flu has shed light on the lack of US capacity to produce effective vaccines  antiviral and provide needed investments in our public health infrastructure   We must heed these warning signs  and take the time to invest so that we are prepared throughout the nation and the world                Avian flu  also known as the bird flu  is a virus that to date has primarily been passed from birds to humans   However  experts predict that it is only a matter of time before the virus mutates and will be able to easily spread between humans creating a widespread public health crisis   In a matter of weeks  an outbreak in China  Vietnam or Cambodia could trigger a world wide outbreak facilitated by international travel and globalization  Experts estimate that 90 000 to 300 000 Americans and up to 50 million people worldwide could die if left unprotected during an influenza pandemic             This is one of the biggest threats we face today     said Harkin     A flu pandemic is not a matter of if    but when  We must heed these warning signs  and take the time to invest in our public infrastructure   Instead of always looking into the rear view mirror  we must do all we can to prevent a disaster  like avian flu  before it happens                Harkin has led the fight in Congress to prepare for a possible outbreak of pandemic influenza   In May  Harkin secured funding in the Supplemental Appropriations measure to stockpile antiviral drugs effective against the avian flu               Influenza viruses cause 20 000 to 40 000 deaths in the U S  each year   Many of these could be prevented with increased use of the influenza vaccine             Harkin Avian Flu Preparedness Amendment           Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  will offer a comprehensive proposal to the Labor HHS Appropriations bill to make an unprecedented federal investment to prepare for a potential outbreak of the avian flu   The amendment will provide federal resources where they are most needed  to stockpile vaccines and antiviral drugs  to improve our global surveillance  and to strengthen state and local public health  our first line of defense against an outbreak of avian flu                 Increase stockpiles of antiviral drugs thought to be effective against the current strains of the avian flu   The World Health Organization has recommended that each country stockpile enough antivirals for 40 percent of their population   Though other countries have heeded this warning  the United States currently has only two million doses on hand    enough for one percent of the population   The additional resources would steadily add to the national stockpile  with a goal of accumulating enough antivirals to serve 50 percent of the population    3 1 billion                 Increase our vaccine stockpile and strengthen America  s vaccine infrastructure   These new resources would allow the US to stockpile 120 million doses of an avian flu vaccine over the next two years   In addition  the amendment provides resources to expand research on the effectiveness of existing vaccines  and incentives to expand US vaccine manufacturing capacity  The United States currently does not have the capacity to create enough vaccines here at home   In the event of a pandemic  the US would have to rely on imported vaccines which countries may be unwilling to export     3 3 billion                 Quadruple global surveillance of the avian flu through the Centers for Disease Control to identify and contain the avian flu virus around the world as soon as possible    60 million               Strengthen local and state public health departments and expand emergency preparedness activities to help communities recognize  treat  and quarantine the avian flu virus if it reaches our shores     600 million                 Improve hospital preparedness and surge capacity in anticipation of higher patient levels in case of a pandemic    750 million              New resources for outreach and education efforts to both health care providers and the public    75 million                 Increase surveillance of migratory birds through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   110 million           TOTAL INVESTMENT   7 975 billion                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
