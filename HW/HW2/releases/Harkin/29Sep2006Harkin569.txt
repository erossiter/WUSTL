        Since my days as a pilot with the United States Navy  nothing has been more important to me than protecting the American people and ensuring the security of our country   Today  we are in a war with extremists who want to do grievous harm to America   We all want to fight these extremists and defeat them   We all want to ensure that those who committed or supported acts of terror are brought to justice   The only disagreement is about how best to do this   What is the smartest  most effective way to fight and defeat our enemies                     Unfortunately  as the newly declassified National Intelligence Estimate testifies very clearly  our current course is  in many ways  playing into the hands of the terrorists   It is stirring up virulent anti Americanism around the world   It is drawing new recruits to the jihadists   cause   And it is making America less safe                 We have to do better job   It  s not good enough to be strong and wrong   We need to be strong and smart                   And this is especially true when it comes to our policies on interrogating and trying suspected terrorists   Again  we all want to extract information from these suspects   We all want to try them and  if guilty  punish them   The only disagreement is about how best to do this  What is the smartest  most effective way to interrogate and try suspected terrorists                     There is plenty of evidence that our current course  which clearly includes torturing suspects and imprisoning them without trial  is not working   To take just one case in point  consider the Canadian citizen    whom we now know to be completely innocent    who was arrested by the CIA and sent to Syria for interrogation under torture  Not surprisingly  he told his torturers exactly what they wanted to hear  that he had received terrorist training in Afghanistan   The truth  of course  is that he was never in Afghanistan  had no terrorist ties  and is completely innocent                     The cost to the United States for this miscarriage of justice  in terms of our forfeited reputation and moral standing  has been disastrous    just as the revelations of torture and abuse at Abu Ghraib were disastrous   What  s more  it has endangered our troops in the field    now and in the future    should they fall into the hands of captors who say that they have the right to subject American prisoners to the same torture and abuse                       Again  it  s not enough to be strong and wrong   We need to be strong and smart   We need to be true to 230 years of American jurisprudence  our Constitution  and the humane values that define us as Americans   Regrettably  the bill before us fails this test   And I cannot  in good conscience  support it                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
