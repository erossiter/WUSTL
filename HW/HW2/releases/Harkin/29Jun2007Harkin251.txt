 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued the following statement regarding the Supreme Courts announcement that it will hear two cases on whether Guantanamo Bay detainees can challenge their imprisonment in federal court   Harkin recently introduced legislation requiring the U S  Department of Defense to close the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba and resolve the legal status of at least 385 prisoners currently held there  A number of human rights groups are supporting the Guantanamo Bay Detention Facility Act of 2007  including the American Civil Liberties Union  Amnesty International  Human Rights First and Human Rights Watch   I am pleased that the Supreme Court has now agreed to hear this important case to determine whether Guantanamo Bay detainees can challenge their imprisonment in federal courts   Guantanamo Bay has been the sight of abuses that have cast a stain on our nations character  By continuing to isolate detainees on Guantanamo Bay without bringing charges against them  we have forfeited our moral leadership and hindered our ability to rally support in our fight against terrorism    I will continue to press the Administration to close this facility and resolve the legal status of its detainees  including the transfer of criminal detainees to state of the art  maximum security facilities within the United States  Taking this step is both the smart and the right thing to do  The sooner we close Guantanamo Bay  the sooner American can reclaim its reputation as a human rights leader       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
