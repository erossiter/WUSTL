         There is a lot of talk around Washington about cutting the budget to reign in the Bush Administration  s runaway deficits     Harkin said     We need fiscal responsibility  but the agriculture cuts are part of a budget plan that worsens the deficit   Republicans are paying lip service to the deficit  but their goal is passing more tax breaks for the wealthiest              Harkin offered amendments ensuring that the nation  s largest farms were not given opportunities to avoid budget cuts in a way that is not available to small and medium sized farms   Harkin  s amendments would have ensured federal payment limitations were applied fairly to the country  s largest farms   Those amendments were rejected             Small and medium sized farmers received a blow today with the Senate Agriculture Committee voting to maintain special treatment for the nation  s largest farmers     said Harkin     This plan allows those farmers who already get the most assistance to receive preferential treatment             The budget cuts made to farm and conservation today total  3 billion and come at a time when energy costs are soaring for America  s farmers and businesses   This year alone  USDA estimates that these skyrocketing energy prices will cost farmers nearly  5 billion dollars more than the previous year             This is not the right time to be scaling back our safety net for struggling farmers and rural communities     Harkin said     Farmers who are being hit hardest by record energy costs and slumping commodity prices will sacrifice under this proposal              The Republican proposal also disproportionately targets initiatives assisting farmers in improving water and air quality  decreasing soil erosion and preserving habitat for wildlife   Conservation initiatives  which constitute eight percent of the agriculture budget  constitute 35 percent of the funding cuts in today  s budget bill   The Conservation Security Program  CSP  which Harkin authored in the 2002 farm bill faces a 30 percent reduction in funds over the next five years   This comes on top of over  3 billion in cuts made to CSP over the last two years in other spending legislation            This budget seriously hurts farm conservation initiatives that provide all Americans with an improved environment     Harkin said     There is resounding support around the country for increased farm conservation and this plan flies plainly in the face of what farmers and the public want              Senator Harkin authored provisions of the 2002 farm bill establishing the Conservation Security Program  CSP  to provide financial assistance to farmers for conservation in a way that is not trade distorting and is agreeable to U S  trade partners   The cuts made to the program today will substantially scale back CSP  s expansion and prevent tens of thousands of farmers from enrolling in this program              Cutting CSP at a time when the President has proposed scaling back commodity farm assistance in our WTO negotiations is the wrong step for America  s farmers     Harkin said     CSP offers a way to provide financial assistance to farmers for conservation that is agreeable to our trade partners and provides the public with an improved environment   Now is not the time to be slashing CSP                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
