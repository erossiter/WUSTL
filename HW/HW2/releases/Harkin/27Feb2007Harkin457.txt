   WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today encouraged Iowans who are still without power to go to local shelters to stay warm  It is estimated that just under 100 000 homes still remain without power  Another winter storm is expected to hit Iowa Wednesday  possibly causing more outages             I have been watching the situation in Iowa very closely over the past few days  and I want to make sure that Iowans know resources are available to help them while their power is out   Harkin said   Given the freezing temperatures across much of the state  I hope everyone will take precaution and go to shelters if needed             The Iowa National Guard is currently helping many Iowans  and in some areas they are going door to door to check on people   State officials have expressed concern that some residents are not going to shelters even though they currently lack power              A lack of heat can create life threatening situations  and I want to make sure that all Iowans are as safe as possible during this winter weather   Harkin said   If you are having trouble finding a local shelter  please call one of my offices and we will do our best to help you find the resources you need             The most current list of shelters can be found at http   www bereadyiowa org IowaShelters pdf  which is updated regularly by Iowa Homeland Security and Emergency Management   Harkin has offices in Des Moines  Cedar Rapids  Sioux City  Davenport  Dubuque and Washington D C  Office numbers are as follows                 Des Moines  515 284 4574             Cedar Rapids  319 365 4504                    Davenport  563 322 1338              Dubuque  563 582 2130                 Sioux City  712 252 1550                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
