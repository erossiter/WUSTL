         WASHINGTON D C       Recognizing the dangers smoking can cause pregnant mothers and their children  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation aimed at helping women on Medicaid stop smoking during pregnancy            This is the right thing to do    both for the health of a mother and child  and for the health of our Medicaid budgets     Harkin said    The resources are there  We just need to target them more specifically  and that  s the goal of this legislation             The Smoke Free Mothers and Babies Act of 2006 amends the Social Security Act to encourage states to provide pregnant women enrolled in Medicaid with access to comprehensive tobacco cessation services  The bill offers states an enhanced   federal medical assistance percentage    match under Medicaid to cover tobacco cessation programs for poor pregnant women  The cost of these services would be less than  6 per mother    with the potential to save more than  700 in health care costs per new born            We should be doing more to reduce the dangers to both mothers and their children that come from smoking during pregnancy     Harkin said    I anticipate strong support for the bill and hope to find an appropriate legislative vehicle to attach it to in the remaining months of the 109th Congress             At least one out of every ten pregnant women in the United States smokes  which accounts for over half a million births per year  Studies have found that smoking and exposure to secondhand smoke among pregnant women is a major cause of miscarriage  stillbirths  and sudden infant death syndrome  SIDS           Preventing just one smoking related low birth weight baby can save more than  40 000 in health care expenditures   For every  1 spent on smoking cessation for pregnant women  an estimated  3 in neonatal intensive care costs could be avoided   Such expenditures have a disproportionate impact on Medicaid  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  reports that pregnant women on Medicaid are 2 5 times more likely to smoke than pregnant women not on Medicaid   Smoking attributable neonatal healthcare costs are estimated to be  1 4 billion to  2 billion annually  and such costs for Medicaid total almost  228 million          States this year will collect a record  21 3 billion from the tobacco settlement and tobacco taxes  an increase from  20 billion in FY2005    However  states are spending only 2 6 percent of their tobacco revenue on tobacco prevention and cessation                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
