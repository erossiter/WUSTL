           I  ve heard a lot of frustration from farmers with USDA  s unworkable and unreasonable rules and regulations for CSP     said Harkin     The Department seems determined to prevent the vast majority of farmers from getting assistance for improving their conservation practices                  Among the concerns outlined in the letter sent to Secretary Johanns are the following         USDA prevents most farmers from being eligible for CSP by only allowing only those within selected watershed areas to apply or enroll  Payments for CSP do not adequately reward producers for using environmental friendly farming practices  USDA frustrates and confuses farmers seeking to enroll in CSP through inflexible  nationwide requirements and entry criteria   Harkin called for USDA to allow farmers and ranchers to address local resource and environmental concerns rather than imposing heavy handed and rigid national requirements  CSP excludes most organic and specialty crop producers through a distorted evaluation of soil quality measures  USDA has overstepped its rulemaking authority  failing to follow in good faith the law passed by Congress and signed by the President         The Bush administration and Congressional Leadership have repeatedly targeted CSP for funding cuts     Harkin said     It is no coincidence that the process for enrolling in CSP is one designed to prevent people from even trying to get in               Senator Harkin authored provisions of the 2002 farm bill that established the CSP   Congress intended CSP to provide federal benefits to all farmers and ranchers who carry out sound conservation practices on working lands and also provide assistance to promote further improvements once they are in CSP   Since the farm bill was enacted  Harkin has fought USDA  s unreasonable rules and regulations designed to keep CSP participation low   Both the Bush Administration and Republican Leadership  s budget proposals have sought to cap this program and keep it off limits for most farmers and ranchers   Harkin has opposed the cuts and caps on funding and worked successfully to ensure the Senate version of the fiscal 2006 agriculture spending bill contains no new limitations on CSP funding   The House version of that bill seriously limits CSP funding for fiscal 2006 and would severely limit expansion of CSP to enroll additional producers   The differences in the House and Senate version of the agriculture spending bill will need to be resolved in conference committee            Harkin was joined by Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  in commenting on USDA  s proposed Interim Final Rule   A copy of the letter is available upon request                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
