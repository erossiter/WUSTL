     Over the last week  I have been working hard  and in good faith with Senator Mel Martinez  R FL   Majority Leader Bill Frist  R TN  and Minority Leader Harry Reid  D NV  and others to come up with legislation that would allow federal review of this case   On Thursday  we came up with a bipartisan measure that did just that and many of my Senate Republican and Democratic colleagues deserve praise for their hard and swift work         Unfortunately  the House Republican Leadership refused to take up the bill before sending members home for a two week vacation   We are now giving the House another chance to pass this bipartisan bill         Congressional action in this area should be based on respect for the wishes and dignity of those who are incapacitated   I do not believe there was a need for this to be dragged out in the media yesterday  today and now into the weekend   The House now has another opportunity to act and I hope they will         I would have preferred to address the underlying issue and not just this case   I plan to continue to work with my Senate colleagues on both sides of the aisle to give cases like this an opportunity for further review in federal courts                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
