        Hunger Awareness Day plays an important role in reminding Americans of the reality of hunger in our midst     said Harkin     But this doesn  t have to be the case   With the political will  hunger is a solvable problem   And until we get rid of hunger for good  millions of Americans will commemorate Hunger Awareness Day living under the shadow of hunger themselves          According to the U S  Department of Agriculture  11 2 percent of households  or 36 3 million people were food insecure in 2003  meaning that they were uncertain of having  or unable to obtain  enough food for all household members   Of these  3 5 percent of American households  nearly 10 million Americans  actually experienced hunger because they were unable to afford food   Even more troubling is the fact that food insecurity has risen in recent years   Since 1999 the number of Americans who experience food insecurity has risen by over 5 million people            With food insecurity on the rise in America  I find it deplorable that the Administration and Congress are proposing that we cut vital food assistance for working Americans     said Harkin     At a time when all signs point to increased need  to suggest that we cut federal food assistance programs not only flies in the face of common sense  it flies in the face of our obligation to help our neighbors             The Congressional Budget Resolution passed by Congress this spring calls for  3 billion in cuts to spending under the jurisdiction of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees  much of which is expected to come from federal food assistance programs such as the Food Stamp Program   The President  s budget for fiscal year 2006 also contained cuts to the Food Stamp Program            The Iowa Fiscal Partnership  a joint initiative of the Iowa Policy Project and the Child and Family Policy Center  also marked Hunger Awareness Day by releasing a report on hunger in Iowa entitled Hunger in the Heartland   A Portrait of Need in Northeast Iowa   The full report can be accessed at www iowsfiscal org          Harkin is a long time supporter of federal food assistance program and is the Senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over the federal food assistance programs                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
