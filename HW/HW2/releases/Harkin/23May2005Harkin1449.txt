      In an email to constituents today  Harkin asked Iowans to email and call in their concerns and raise the issues they wish their Senate would spend even a minute  let alone  all night  working on            The nuclear option is not healthy for our democracy  so I will be here with my fellow Democrats to fight to protect our constitutional checks and balances     said Harkin     But while Republicans are threatening to blow up the Senate and stack the courts with radical judges  what about the people  s business   What about all the things that Iowans are worried about   What about health care  education  rising gas prices  and the minimum wage   Unfortunately  the Republican leadership would rather spend all night focused on their quest for absolute power than address the issues that matter to everyday Americans             The Senate will be in session round the clock tonight as Republican leaders push for a vote on the   nuclear option    to eliminate judicial filibusters   By going nuclear  Republicans will break the rules of the Senate to destroy 217 years of constitutional checks and balances  and will strike a severe blow at the bipartisan cooperation that the Senate depends on to address the needs of the American people              My office will be open all night  and my staff and I will be answering the phones to hear your concerns     Harkin wrote in an email today     Maybe you are working a second job  wondering when Congress will finally act to raise the minimum wage   Maybe you are a parent tossing and turning over worries about how you will pay for your child to go to college   Maybe you are thinking about that doctor visit you have been putting off because your family doesn  t have health care coverage   Or maybe you are a farmer getting hit hard by skyrocketing fuel prices             Iowans can call either Harkin  s Des Moines Office at 515 284 4574 or the Washington D C  Office at 202 224 3254 throughout the night to share their concerns with Harkin   People can also email comments through Harkin  s website  www harkin senate gov                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
