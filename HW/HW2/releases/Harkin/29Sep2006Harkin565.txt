         This year  thousands of senior citizens nationwide will fall victim to a bait and switch scheme by the federal government  Many who signed up for Medicare Part D  the new Medicare prescription drug plan  are finding that the drugs they thought were covered aren  t after all  These seniors have reached what many have nicknamed the   doughnut hole     a gap in the plan where coverage ends  Seniors are left with huge prescription drug bills and difficult choices to make          Under the standard Part D plan  each Medicare beneficiary pays a  250 deductible and one quarter of the next  2 000 in prescription drug costs  After that  the next  2 850 in drug costs must be covered at the senior  s expense with no help from the plan  This is called the doughnut hole  or coverage gap  and many seniors weren  t aware of it when the plan was debated in Congress  While plans can vary  most have a coverage gap  To make matters worse  Medicare requires seniors to continue paying monthly premiums on top of their out of pocket costs  even though they receive no benefit while in the coverage gap          Unfortunately  this flaw in the program design has real world consequences  Over three million seniors will fall into the doughnut hole    some with the most serious health conditions  Already  seniors are being told they will be on their own to pay for prescription drug bills that could be well over  1 000 for some expensive drugs  Pushed to the financial limit  many seniors will be forced to go without needed treatment for chronic  debilitating diseases  Conditions that could be kept under control with drugs may then flare up  possibly ending hospitalization and other serious health problems          What is so distressing about the flaws in the Medicare drug plan is that Congress has known about it for years  Although many Members    including myself    spoke out about the giant faults in the plan  nothing was done to fix it  This was one of the key reasons why I did not support the drug bill in 2003          I believe we should change the Medicare prescription drug program and eliminate the coverage gap so that all seniors can afford the drugs they need to stay healthy  I have sponsored legislation  The Medicare Prescription Drug Gap Reduction Act of 2006  with Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and Senator Susan Collins of Maine   that would close the doughnut hole and give the Secretary of Heath and Human Services the power to directly negotiate for the best drug prices  If other government agencies can bargain for better prices for the things they buy  shouldn  t the government be able to bargain for better prescription drug prices as well          Our nation  s seniors deserve an affordable  easy to follow drug plan  not an inconsistent  bait and switch scheme  I am going to do my best to make sure that Congress provides America  s seniors with the fair and comprehensive prescription drug plan they deserve                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
