 WASHINGTON  D C  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  released the following statement today   News of Attorney General Gonzales resignation is long overdue  he has at long last done the right thing and resigned  I opposed his nomination because I believed the man who used his position as White House Counsel to authorize the use of torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay was unfit to serve as the nations highest law enforcement official  Throughout his tenure at the Department of Justice  he has placed blind loyalty to the President ahead of upholding the Constitution and the rule of law  His resignation is the first step toward restoring the credibility of the Department  I urge the President to choose a successor whose first devotion is to the law  and who will respond truthfully to legitimate Congressional oversight       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
