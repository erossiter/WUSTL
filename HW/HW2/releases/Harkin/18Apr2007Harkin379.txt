                     Over the last several months we have heard from a wide range of interested stakeholders to gain their input for writing the next farm bill    Today  we focus on hearing from the representatives of the livestock  poultry and egg industries   Animal agriculture is important to the United States   The Economic Research Service at USDA estimates the value of U S  livestock and poultry production in 2007 will be  125 7 billion   The new farm bill can play a role in this   The farm bill will be critically important for expanding access to conservation programs  developing much needed research on distillers dried grains and for animal diseases  promoting market access  rural development  cellulosic ethanol and ensuring fair and competitive markets   As with any farm bill  there will be many different perspectives on all of these issues  so I look forward to listening and learning from the witnesses here today                                     In the past 15 years  the animal industry has become more consolidated and vertically integrated  basic open fairness and competition in markets have become more the exception than the rule                                  Today  in some regions of the country  there are only a handful of buyers of livestock left and they frequently don t buy off the open market   For some producers  they only have one buyer   This sets up an overly tilted marketing system where producers have difficulty getting bids for their livestock or are forced into take it or leave it contracts with unfair terms   These producers have no where else to go to market their livestock or poultry   And for those producers that speak out against unfair practices or complain  they face retaliation  stop getting bids on the open market or lose their contracts                                       Producers marketing livestock and poultry in consolidated markets are becoming less inclined to comment on what they see going on in the marketplace for fear of retaliation   So  I want to especially thank the witnesses today for providing testimony before the Committee                                       Congress worked to provide fairness in the marketplace before  and it can do it again   In 1921  Congress passed the Packers and Stockyards Act to keep markets fair   The Department of Agriculture has this important authority to enforce the Act   But just last year  in a report by USDA s Inspector General  which I commissioned  found widespread inaction    efforts to block investigations of unfair and anti competitive conduct    and even efforts to cook the books to give the appearance of actual enforcement by the Grain  Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA  at the Department of Agriculture                                     Basic fairness and transparency in the marketplace should be guaranteed in federal law    That is why I introduced the  Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act  to improve USDA s enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act and strengthen the Agricultural Fair Practices Act   It is why I have also worked to improve the Livestock Mandatory Reporting Act  along with other important market reforms                            I look forward to hearing from today s witnesses and working with you all on crafting a forward thinking farm bill                                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
