 Washington  D C   A long time human rights advocate  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today urged the CEO of GAP Incorporated  Glenn Murphy  to immediately work with his industry counterparts to create and implement an industry wide monitoring system for the garment industry in India as a way to ensure that products are not made with abusive and exploitative child labor    GAP Incorporated has taken steps to remove their tainted products  but what we need here is a systematic change in the supply chain so that American consumers can be certain they are buying child slave labor free products  I have worked with the Bangladeshi government and the Nike Corporation to implement similar changes so there is a clear precedent for this action  said Harkin  I urge Gap Incorporated to lead the way in addressing these mistreatments industry wide so that other companies will fall into the GAPs example and fundamentally restructure their supply chain    On Sunday  British newspaper  The Observer  published reports that children as young as ten years old were working in a factory in India subcontracted to make clothes for Gap   The children  some as young as ten years old  were forced to hand stitch blouses in sweatshop conditions for up to 16 hours per day   The shirts were to be sold across the United States and Europe this winter for the holiday shopping season    While Gap Inc  has said the clothing from this factory will not be sold in stores and instead will be destroyed  Harkin believes this isolated action does not solve the larger issues of ending the exploitation of children and rehabilitating child workers so they can lead normal lives    In response to Harkins legislation that would ban the importation of products created through child labor  Bangladesh in 1995 implemented a program that included random inspections and the removal of child laborers  In 1997  at Harkins urging  the Nike Corporation took similar action to establish inspections and move children out of the factories and into schools       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
