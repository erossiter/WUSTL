     In recent decades  our country has made remarkable progress in addressing hunger and malnutrition   Some remember the Field Foundation trips in the late 1960s which found levels of deprivation thought impossible in our land of plenty   Responding to images of anemic children  Congress initiated food assistance programs that have grown into an anti hunger infrastructure which has largely eliminated true hunger in our nation            Food assistance often operates under the radar screen   Like the working families they serve  the nutrition programs operate out of sight and out of mind    However  occasionally  we are reminded of their tremendous value            In August  2005  when Hurricane Katrina came ashore in the Gulf Coast  U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  food assistance brought critical relief to millions of Americans   The Food Stamp Program in particular provided relief to families who had nowhere else to turn  As a result of the gulf hurricanes in 2005  1 8 million households turned to the Food Stamp Program             Will food stamp benefits make whole a family that has lost their entire livelihood   No   But the response served as an important reminder that these are not just programs  they are lifelines            And not just for those struck by disasters   Every day  federal nutrition programs support Americans who live on the margins of our economy    persons with disabilities  children  the elderly  and working families who do not make enough to get by   In fact  50 percent of food stamp recipients are children   Eighty nine percent of food stamp households contained an elderly person  a person with a disability  or a child   And there are twice as many food stamp households with earnings than there are households that receive just TANF benefits            Let  s face up to some common questions  and in some cases myths  about federal food assistance               In the early nineties  we sometimes heard about trafficking  or benefit trading  in the Food Stamp Program   Through the inception of EBT cards and improved monitoring  rates of trafficking have declined remarkably    from almost four cents of every dollar of benefits in the early 1990s to just one cent per dollar today            Rates of erroneous payments were also high in the 1990s  almost 11 percent in 1993   Here too  we worked together on a bipartisan basis to make improvements    resulting in a dramatic improvement   Program error has declined by 40 percent since 1999  to a record low of under 6 percent in 2005   Clearly  additional improvements can be made  but the story thus far is one of very substantial improvement            Today  s committee hearing looks back  but also looks forward   Food insecurity and poor nutrition continue to plague far too many Americans  with certain groups of individuals still facing tremendous obstacles   Experience shows that if a family cannot put food on the table  they have little chance of moving up the economic ladder            This committee must also grapple with the apparent paradox of food insecurity and obesity   How is it that many of the same families who struggle to get by  also seem at greatest risk of becoming overweight and developing diet related chronic diseases              Today  s hearing is an important reminder that the jurisdiction of our Committee    the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry   goes beyond farms and rural landscapes   Through this committee  we can not only reach the lives of tens of millions of Americans  but we can improve them                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
