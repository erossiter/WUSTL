         Good morning   I welcome everyone to this field hearing of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  HHS  and Education   Let me thank the University of Iowa for making this excellent facility available to us  this morning   Given the obvious interest in Lance Armstrong  s testimony  perhaps we should have reserved Kinnick Stadium  this morning   Folks in Iowa have been thrilled to have Lance in our state this week for RAGBRAI   We made him promise not to ride the whole course in just one day                  The focus of this morning  s hearing is to determine where we stand in cancer research and in providing access to quality care for cancer patients   I also want to explore whether we are adequately supporting prevention and screening programs for cancer    now the No  1 cause of death in the United States                 Unfortunately  I am obliged to begin this morning  s hearing by acknowledging a harsh reality   Since the Second World War  the United States as the undisputed leader in biomedical research  with the federal government providing both the vision and funding necessary to maintain that leadership   But  today  our leadership is threatened                   Last week  the President vetoed HR 810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   That decision means that many of America  s top scientists will remain in a straightjacket  unable to move forward in the most promising field of medical research in our time    research that is of very special interest to cancer researchers                   Meanwhile  the President  s budget for fiscal year 2007 would cut funding for the National Cancer Institute by  40 million   That comes on the heels of a  35 million cut in the current fiscal year   The President  s budget also cuts cancer programs at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  including reductions to breast and cervical cancer screening programs  as well as to the survivorship program  which works in collaboration with the Lance Armstrong Foundation                  In our mark up of the Senate Labor HHS bill last week  we were able to cobble together some small increases for NIH and CDC cancer programs   But those increases are far short of where we need to be   And even my friend Senator Arlen Specter  the chairman of the Committee  said the bill represents    and I quote      the disintegration of the appropriate federal role in health  education and worker safety                  The President  s proposed  40 million cut  next year  means that NCI would award 80 fewer new  competing research grants than this year   It means that the United States will say no to 80 potential medical breakthroughs that have gone through the peer review process  received an excellent score  and been deemed worthy of NIH funding   And that is a real shame                  I take a lot of pride in teaming up with Senator Arlen Specter to double funding for NIH between 1998 and 2003   But  today  that achievement seems like ancient history                  In the President  s budget  funding is cut for 18 or 19 Institutes at the National Institutes of Health   As I said  The National Cancer Institute gets cut for the second year in a row               So  today  we are going backward   Instead of funding a war on cancer  the President  s budget would fund a retreat in the war on cancer                      Thirty five years after the National Cancer Act was signed into law  we face a two front war  a war on cancer     and a war on complacency                    And that  s why this hearing    and the testimony of our witnesses    is so important   Because if we are going to win the race against cancer  we need a sustained  relentless  unstoppable commitment to victory   And that attitude is what all of our witnesses  this morning  share in common                  My friend  Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts  waged a successful personal battle against prostate cancer   He has been an outspoken champion of cancer research in the Senate   And I am grateful to him for coming out to Iowa  today                    Lance Armstrong  needs no introduction here in Iowa    not after riding two days in RAGBRAI and speaking to some15 000 people in Newton on Wednesday evening   But let me make this observation about my friend Lance   He won the Tour de France seven times because he had a laser focus and a truly extraordinary will to win   And it is our great good fortune that he has now applied that same laser focus to the fight against cancer   This is Lance  s next big race   He is spending countless hours rallying the American people to win it   And we are all deeply grateful to him for his dedication to this cause                Gary Streit is a native Iowan  and a graduate of Iowa State and the University of Iowa School of College of Law   He is an attorney in Cedar Rapids   Mr  Streit has been an active volunteer for the American Cancer Society for three decades  and chaired the Society  s National Board in 2002 2003   He played a major role in founding the Society  s Cancer Action Network                   Dr  George J  Weiner  is director of the Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center here at the University  and chair of the State of Iowa Comprehensive Cancer Control Consortium   Dr  Weiner earned his undergraduate degree at Johns Hopkins and his medical degree from Ohio State   A faculty member here since 1989  his research focuses on the immunotherapy of leukemia and lymphoma                  Shirley Ruedy is a three time cancer survivor and award winning author of the   Cancer Update   column in the Cedar Rapids Gazette   She is a recipient of the American Cancer Society  s Courage Award  among many other distinctions               I thank all of you for coming  this morning   Let me mention that  toward the end of the hearing  we will have an open mic  and members of the audience will be welcome to pose questions or share their own observations                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
