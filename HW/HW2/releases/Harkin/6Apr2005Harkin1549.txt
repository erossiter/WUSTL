        From the fields to the freeway  Iowans are feeling the pinch caused by soaring energy costs  particularly gasoline     Harkin said     I strongly urge the House Energy and Commerce Committee to adopt an aggressive renewable energy package in the energy legislation before them today   And they should begin with an ambitious Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  that puts the focus on domestic renewable resources and away from foreign sources of oil             Last month  Harkin led a bipartisan effort in the Senate to introduce a RFS that would raise the amount of renewable fuels used in this country to at least eight billion gallons annually by 2012   This RFS is three billion gallons a year higher than last year  s bill and more than two billion gallons a year higher than legislation passed by the Senate Energy and Public Works Committee earlier this year            By turning our focus to home grown  renewable sources of energy  we reduce the cost for energy consumers and provide a spark to rural economies     Harkin said     Specifically  an ambitious RFS like the one we proposed in the Senate would lower the cost of gasoline for drivers  raise the price of commodities grown in our fields  and wean the U S  off of our dependence on expensive foreign oil             Harkin continued    We have to get serious about changing the way we think about energy production   There is only so much oil and other fossil fuels on the planet   We must start turning to cleaner  renewable sources of energy  like ethanol and wind power  and we must do it now             Harkin has been a leader in the push toward a renewable energy future   In addition to sponsoring ambitious RFS legislation  Harkin has also worked to increase the production of electricity through wind power and develop a hydrogen economy   He has also been active in establishing markets for biobased products  such as plastics and lubricants  that can replace traditional petroleum based products and lessen our need for oil and other fossil fuels          For more information on Senator Harkin  s work to promote renewable energy  please visit www harkin senate gov                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
