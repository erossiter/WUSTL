          Our government has to do a better job finding and beefing up areas of weakness in our defenses against foreign disease      Harkin said     This report shows we are still lacking coordination in our efforts to secure particularly vulnerable areas   We  ve seen the devastating consequences that can result from departments of the federal government failing to share information with one another   It  s critical we avoid similar mistakes in securing our border from potentially deadly and costly biological threats   This GAO report and its recommendations should be carried out as quickly as possible                    Currently  DHS and USDA share responsibility for protecting the United States from foreign pests and diseases with USDA responsible for setting inspection policies while DHS is responsible for carrying out most of the inspections   The GAO report found numerous improvements in the combined efforts  including expanded training for identifying potential threats and better access to security information that help identify cargo and passengers likely to pose risks of introducing pests and diseases   However  GAO also identified the following shortfalls                     DHS has not established measures to ensure agricultural specialists are at areas and ports of greatest vulnerability   Specifically  DHS has neglected key pathways of transmission such as commercial aircraft  vessels  and truck cargo                   DHS and USDA are not sharing information such as key policy changes and urgent inspection alerts   Nearly a third of DHS employees responsible for implementing policy changes do not receive regular updates on APHIS policy and over one in five are not receiving urgent inspection alerts in a timely manner   The report concludes that this lack of coordination between agencies   increase the vulnerability of U S  to foreign pests and diseases                     USDA s canine program  also known as the  Beagle Brigade   has deteriorated under DHS management   This program uses canines to assist in inspecting passengers and cargo   Under USDA  the canine program had 140 canine teams  while DHS currently has 80 teams   USDA officials say the proficiency of the canine teams has declined                USDA personnel who remain responsible in preventing illegal entry and distribution of prohibited agricultural trade products that may harbor harmful pests and diseases have experienced difficulty and delays in gaining access to some ports controlled by DHS               Turnover of staff at some ports has caused concern that the number of experienced agricultural inspections specialists is too low                 USDA and DHS budgets are being tapped to pay for inspections that could be paid for through user fees paid by importing industries                   The report is available at http   www gao gov          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
