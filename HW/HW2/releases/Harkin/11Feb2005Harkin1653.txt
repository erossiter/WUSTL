        Businesses and communities across rural Iowa rely  in part  on access to resources such as federal loans and grants  to create jobs and grow the local economy     Harkin said     If the president has his way  however  access to many of these vital resources will be limited or even closed   To be clear  we are not talking about corporate welfare here   We are talking about grants to build new fire stations  loans and grants to develop value added businesses using locally grown crops  and resources that provide rural residents with basic needs such as clean water               Rob Lundquist  a Taylor County  Iowa resident  can attest to the importance of these initiatives to rural Iowa   Mr  Lundquist serves on the Board of Supervisors for Taylor County and as chair of the Board for Southern Iowa  Resource Conservation and Development  RC   serving seven southern Iowa counties  In the past 34 years  the Southern Iowa RC has been working with local organizations to empower them to solve their problems   Examples of such projects in the past five years include encouraging youth entrepreneurship  creating rural water supplies  promoting tourism and developing outdoor recreation  identifying value added crops  and improving rural fire protection   In the president  s budget recently submitted to Congress  Mr  Lundquist would see federal funding that Southern Iowa RC depends on to assist with these projects disappear              As a county supervisor and chairman of an RC  I have seen the benefits from federal rural development funds     Mr  Lundquist said     While providing water and fire protection to rural areas may seem trivial to some in Washington  it is of critical importance to people living in rural Iowa   Whether it is a new rural water system  a new community center  or a new value added business employing local residents  access to these vital rural development funds can mean life or death for many rural Iowa communities               Rural development funding goes to a broad range of projects aimed at growing rural economies and improving the overall quality of life   The president  s budget guts many of these vital initiatives   For instance  the president has previously declared his intention to provide access to broadband technology to all Americans by 2007   But in his budget  the president would cut loan assistance to companies seeking to provide this access to small businesses and rural residents by 34 percent   Cutting funds that provide access to broadband directly undercuts the president  s stated   goal              In addition  the president would cut hundreds of millions of dollars from initiatives that provide the basic services all Americans need   The president  s budget would slash the amount of money available to help rural communities provide clean water to its residents by 24 percent   The president would also take away 30 percent of the funding for grants that help build child care centers and purchase fire trucks   These cuts strike directly at the quality of life rural citizens in Iowa and across the nation enjoy            Numerous rural development programs important to Iowa that are facing large cuts include                         A 24  CUT in grants for rural water and waste water projects   These funds go to the smallest and poorest communities with the worst water problems                          40 million in Rural Business Enterprise grants is eliminated   These grants supply funds to small and emerging rural businesses through support of local government                         A 34  CUT in broadband loan assistance                         A more than 60     24 5 million  reduction in value added grants to farmer owned businesses                         A  79 million reduction in the funding available for the Rural Business Investment Program   The funds are used to leverage venture capital funds in rural areas  a crucial component for the creation of mid sized businesses                        A  59 million CUT in Community Facilities Grant programs   These cuts include         o        Rural Community Development Initiative cut  6 million        o        Community Facility Economic Impact Initiative Grants cut  18 million         o        High Energy Cost Grants cut  28 million        o        A 30 percent  or  7 million  cut in grant program to fund childcare centers  fire trucks and community buildings                       A  24 million CUT in the Rural Housing and Economic Development program   In Iowa  this program has been important in helping rural Iowans realize the dream of home ownership                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
