          Today the House passed an ill conceived bill which puts tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans ahead of fiscal responsibility and needed resources for our most vulnerable citizens   Forty percent of the benefits of this tax bill go to those making over  1 million a year  Seventy eight percent goes to those making over  100 000 a year   This truly is a gross abuse                     Not only will this bill continue toward the path of an exploding federal deficit  it is paired with a measure that slashes crucial programs which support disadvantaged  hardworking American families  The House proposes cutting child support enforcement that will reduce payments by an estimated  24 billion  and hits the poorest of the poor by cutting food assistance and raising health care costs for those that rely on Medicaid                   This is just plain wrong   These choices do not reflect Iowa values   And they don  t reflect the compassion of the American people   The Iowans I talk to are looking for balance  fairness  and shared sacrifice   These tax cuts for the wealthy and deep budget cuts for our most vulnerable citizens will only take us in the wrong direction  I believe that together  America can do better           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
