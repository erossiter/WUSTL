   Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today announced that agreement had been reached on amendments related to the farm bill and that Senate consideration of the bill may resume as soon as tomorrow     The farm bill passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on October 25th and was brought up on the floor November 5th  The bill has not moved since that time due to efforts to pull into floor debate numerous amendments unrelated to agriculture policy that would bog down the farm bill and greatly delay and jeopardize its passage     The farm bill came to the Senate with great momentum  it stayed within pay as you go budgeting  yet provided needed investments to rural America  farming families and the nation  It is a bipartisan measure that passed Committee by voice vote without a single vote voiced against it  And after a month of this bill languishing due to procedural maneuvering  this bill will finally get back on track and bring critical investments to reality  With swift action in the Senate  this bill can pass our chamber by the holiday recess     In coming to this agreement  my colleagues worked in a bipartisan manner and negotiated in good faith  a manner similar to the original crafting of this important measure       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
