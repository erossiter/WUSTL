      WASHINGTON D C      Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today released the following statement regarding the proposed consolidation of the Sioux City Mail Processing Facility            The citizens of Western Iowa have unfairly been kept in the dark about the future of the Sioux City Mail Processing Facility  receiving no updates on the fate of the plant or its workers  But one fact remains clear  closing this plant is a bad decision            Since I first learned about the possibility of shuttering this facility  I have fought to make sure mail service in the region does not suffer   That means seeing that the jobs of Siouxland area workers who ensure that delivery is smooth and efficient are preserved            I  ve stopped the closing of the Sioux City plant in two separate pieces of legislation this year  the Postal Reform bill and the Treasury  and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations bill but until one of these bills is signed by the President  this facility is still at risk            The Postal Service continues to refuse to allow the community to have real input into the consolidation process  has failed to explain what efficiencies could be gained from moving mail to South Dakota  and has refused to guarantee that service would not suffer            I continue to fight this effort on all fronts  I have previously asked the Inspector General and the GAO to investigate this matter and I am confident that they will find the consolidation process flawed and unfair            People depend on reliable  dependable mail service  I will fight hard to stop USPS from moving forward with its plan until I am satisfied there will not be an adverse affect on the people of Siouxland                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
