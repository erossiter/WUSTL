                     Washington  D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today co sponsored legislation requiring employers to respect their workers  choice to join a union  The Employee Free Choice Act would also provide valuable protections for workers who are subject to employer retaliation for their support of a union                                 This is truly one of the most important things that we can do to give people a fair playing field in their workplace   said Harkin   This bill is about raising wages for everyone  When productivity rises  everyone should see their fair share of that gain  but in the past several years  workers have not gotten their share of the profits they helped create  They deserve representation                                  This bill will allow workers to choose whether they want to form a union through majority sign up or through a longer election process outlined in the National Labor Relations Act  NLRA   However  the protracted NLRA process can be threatening and intimidating to many employees since employers can campaign against those working to form a union in the workplace  The Employee Free Choice Act would protect workers from undue pressures from employers in the organizing context                                  The bill does not establish a new election process or eliminate secret ballots  It simply requires employers to honor employee choice  Under current laws  a company gets to decide whether it will recognize a majority sign up vote  Under the Employee Free Choice Act  employees may decide                                In addition  the act will increase penalties for employers who illegally punish employees for trying to form a union  It will also create an arbitration process to aid in writing a first contract after a new union is established  if workers and management cannot reach consensus in a timely manner                               It is very difficult for an individual to stand up to their employer and negotiate the best possible terms of employment   said Harkin   Not everyone is an executive who can get a special deal for themselves  Most people can only get a benefit if all of their coworkers get it  People need to be able to bargain collectively                                 Unionized workers earn 30 percent more than their non union counterparts  They average more vacation time  are more likely to have health insurance  disability insurance  and are far more likely to have a secure defined benefit pension                                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
