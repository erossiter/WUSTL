        True to form  President Bush has once again targeted the very conservation programs he praised when signing the 2002 farm bill     Harkin said     Those words ring hollow as once again this administration seeks to undermine farmers   efforts to be better stewards of the land               Harkin continued    Much attention has been given to the president  s proposal to cap federal payments to mega corporate farms   I have long supported such limits  but remain skeptical that Congress will actually go along with such a plan   If the agriculture budget is cut  the cuts will most likely come out of other USDA initiatives   Unfortunately  when that happens  conservation is always first on the list               Agricultural producers strive to be good stewards of the environment   They rely on it for a living   Yet  this budget  as have previous budgets  is trying to take the legs out from under farmers   conservation efforts   John Sellers knows about the benefits conservation programs provide   Mr  Sellers is a District Soil Commissioner in Wayne County and is active in conservation initiatives in southern Iowa              As a conservationist  I know that Iowa  s farmers and ranchers know how to retain topsoil  improve water quality and be general good stewards of the land     Mr  Sellers said     But  unfortunately  they cannot all afford to do this work on their own   They rely  in part  on assistance from the federal government to continue and expand their conservation efforts   Cutting this critical funding means these farmers will be less capable to improve water quality in their area  retain topsoil  or create wildlife habitat   And when that happens  we all lose               For instance  the president  s budget cuts funding for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  which helps crop and livestock producers adopt conservation practices and install structures to better manage manure   The president  however  would limit EQIP funding available to help producers be better environmental stewards   His budget slashes one sixth  or  200 million  from EQIP even while the need for these funds greatly outstrips those available             The president is also once again seeking to cap and limit the Conservation Security Program  CSP    This initiative was included in the 2002 farm bill to help agricultural producers across the country implement or continue conservation practices on land in production   The CSP was part of the conservation title in the farm bill  which President Bush praised   However  this budget  as well as previous budgets and rules implementing the program  severely limits the scope  and ultimately  the benefits of this program   The CSP has already been seriously damaged by the White House backed move to siphon some  3 billion away for disaster payments           Now  for 2006  President Bush is seeking to slash funding for the program by 40   meaning CSP will continue to be severely limited and available to only a few producers in a selected number of watersheds   This was not what was written in the farm bill            Those conservation initiatives on the cutting block include            A 40    182 million  CUT in the Conservation Security Program     Slashing 1 6 of funding available for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP       210 million CUT in Watershed Rehabilitation      25 6 million CUT in Resource Conservation and Development  RC    This program assists State and local governments and local nonprofit organizations in rural areas with planning and development   The president  s budget proposes to eliminate funding for 189 of 375 current projects   A 30    25 million  CUT in the Wildlife Habitat Incentives Program  WHIP      A 16     16 million  CUT in the Farm and Ranch Lands Protection Program  FRPP    This program helps local governments and nonprofit organizations obtain conservation easements to protect agricultural lands and keep them in agriculture                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
