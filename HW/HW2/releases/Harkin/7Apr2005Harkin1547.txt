        The President  s risky privatization scheme is not about strengthening social security  it is about shrinking it     said Harkin     I want to work with President Bush to preserve and protect Social Security  but I want to do it right   That  s why I want to reach all 99 counties so I can hear what all Iowans have on their mind about Social Security             President Bush  s privatization commission has proposed creating private Social Security accounts that would cut benefits by one third or more  even for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts   Workers could invest two thirds of their Social Security contribution in stocks and bonds  but those returns could not make up for the deep benefit cuts and would be subject to the whims of Wall Street           Even many supporters of the President  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years  much of that from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved  In addition  the recent Social Security Trustees report confirmed that Social Security is on solid financial ground for years to come            The President  s privatization plan would also jeopardize Social Security disability benefits  which are a lifeline to more than six million Americans   For many  that disability benefit check is 100 percent of their income   But the President  s privatization commission strongly indicated that disability benefits would be cut the same as retirement benefits            I hope that after the President finishes his campaign to privatize Social Security  he will realize that the math simply does not work and that he has not thought this through     said Harkin     I hope that he will sit down with Congress to come up with a reasonable  bipartisan plan for strengthening Social Security             Attached is an initial schedule for Harkin  s Fix It  Don  t Nix It Social Security tour  Additional dates and locations will be added throughout as they are scheduled                         Harkin Fix It  Don  t Nix Social Security Events         April 23 Cedar Rapids  Davenport  and Mason City Locations and Times TBD         April 24  Des Moines Location and Time TBD         Harkin Fix It  Don  t Nix It Social Security       Staff Mobile Office Tour      Additional events will be added on a rolling basis   Please contact Senator Harkin  s Office at 202 224 3254 for additional information          April 12       12 00 p m      Wartburg College  Waverly  IA         12 30 p m      Simpson College  Indianola  IA                                             April 14         10 00 a m      Hawkeye Community College  Waterloo  IA         April 15         10 00 a m      Southwestern Community College  Creston  IA         April 18          10 00 a m      DMACC Carroll Campus  Carroll  IA         April 19          10 00 a m      DMACC Newton Campus  Newton  IA      10 00 a m      Iowa Lakes Community College Estherville Campus  Estherville  IA      1 00 p m       Iowa Lakes Community College Emmetsburg Campus  Emmetsburg  IA         April 20          1 00 p m       Eastern Iowa Community College         April 21         10 00 a m      Western Iowa Tech Community College  Sioux City  IA       10 00 a m      Kirkwood Community College  Iowa City  IA                                             April 26         10 00 a m      University of Dubuque  Dubuque  IA         April 29          10 00 a m      Iowa Central Community College  Webster City  IA                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
