        My friends  we  ve got our work cut out for us   Let me read you the first paragraph of an article by Ann Svensen  editor of FamilyEducation com   She writes    The schoolyards in Atlanta  Georgia  are quiet this morning    no children running  talking  or laughing    and they  re going to stay that way   Almost 10 years ago  the district eliminated recess from its school day   Since then  all new Atlanta elementary schools have been built without playgrounds   The superintendent of schools in Atlanta told The New York Times  We are intent on improving academic performance   You don  t do that by having kids hanging on the monkey bars              Now  there  s no reason to pick on Atlanta alone   Nationwide  these days  only eight percent of elementary schools provide daily physical education or its equivalent for all students              Meanwhile  according to the Government Accountability Office  the vast majority of our schools    including 83 percent of elementary schools  97 percent of middle schools  and 99 percent of high schools    allow so called   competitive food sources    mostly vending machines selling sugary sodas  candy  and junk food              Think about a child purchasing a 20 ounce Coca Cola during the school day   That  s equivalent to 15 teaspoons of sugar   Would any parent in their right mind send their child to school with a snack of 15 teaspoons of sugar             Now  believe it or not  I didn  t come here  this morning  to depress you   To the contrary  my message to you is that we are making progress when it comes to children  s health              One program that is starting small but has enormous potential is the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program  which I initiated in the 2002 farm bill   I started this program with just a hunch   I didn  t believe the prevailing wisdom    that kids won  t eat high quality fresh fruits and vegetables if they are readily available   I  ve always believed that one of the reasons kids do not eat fresh fruits and vegetables is because they don  t have the opportunity to do so   So I figured  let  s give them an opportunity and see what happens           So in the 2002 farm bill  we provided fresh fruits and vegetables to a little over 100 schools in four states and one Indian reservation   And you know what   My hunch turned out to be correct   Not only did the kids  the teachers  the principals  even parents love the program  but before long  we had other states saying that they wanted the program too              The 2004 child nutrition bill expanded the Fruit and Vegetable Program to an additional four states and two more Indian reservations   And this year  s Senate agriculture appropriations bill  passed last week  adds two more states  for a total of at least 10   This is modest progress  but we  re heading in the right direction   My goal is to expand this program so that every state in the country can participate in the Fruit and Vegetable Program   Over time  with your help  I think that we can accomplish this goal                Meanwhile  under terms of the Child Nutrition and WIC Act reauthorization  by July 1  2006    next summer    every school that participates in the school lunch or school breakfast program must have a local wellness policy in place   Schools will have to set targets for nutrition education and physical activity   And they  ll be required to set nutrition standards for all foods sold in school  including in vending machines  a la carte lines  and school stores             These local wellness policies could be the real sleeper success story of last year  s child nutrition reauthorization   Local wellness policies have the potential to transform the way schools promote child health              But the success or failure of these school wellness policies is going to depend on implementation and leadership   It  s going to depend on the energy  activism  and outspokenness of people in their local communities   In short  it  s going to depend upon people like you   Between now and July  I hope that you will be working with your own schools district to enact common sense local wellness policies that protect the health and nutrition of our nation  s children            However  the onus should not be entirely on local people   We need a more active federal government in setting guidance for public schools   To that end  I am sponsoring the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2005   Among other things  this bill would update nutrition standards for all foods sold in schools   Currently  under 30 year old USDA standards  it  s just fine for schools to sell ice cream  Oreos  Snickers candy bars  donuts  and all kinds of other junk foods   Obviously  it  s time to update USDA standards based on all that we have learned about nutrition and obesity over the last three decades              In addition  my bill would close the giant loophole that says  USDA can set standards for foods sold in the lunchroom  but cannot set standards for foods sold elsewhere on campus  including right outside the cafeteria   This loophole is a disaster   It means USDA spends nearly  9 billion a year on nutritious breakfasts and lunches  but this is undermined      sabotaged   is a better word    by the pervasive sale of junk food and sugary sodas elsewhere on campus   That  s a loophole you can drive a Pepsi delivery truck through   and we need to close it            But  my friends  I  m not just here to preach   I need your help    I need you to encourage your local Representatives and Senators to support expanding the Fruit and Vegetable Program  and to co sponsor my legislation  the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act   I  ve talked with many of my colleagues about both of these   They agree with what I  m trying to accomplish   But they need to hear from their constituents   They need activists like you to help them to understand just how vital it is that we improve our kid  s health and nutrition at school   So tell them to bring the Fruit and Vegetable Program to their own state  and to support    ideally  to cosponsor    the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act of 2005            We need to return to the days when our public schools were special places commercial free zones that fed our children nutritious food  and saw to it that recess and PE were a part of every school day         Schools should be a sanctuary  not just another marketplace hawking junk food and sugary sodas   I understand the pressures of fundraising in schools  but should we sell out our children  s health to raise  10 000 or  20 000 a year in a given school   Of course  not              Instead of selling out to the commercial culture  schools should be modeling an alternative culture that puts children and their wellbeing as the highest priority and the highest value              You know  late in her life  Jackie Kennedy said a very wise thing   She said that   If you botch raising your children  nothing else you do in life matters very much     I fear that  in so many respects  we are botching the raising of our children in the United States              We are exposing our kids to a barrage of messages and influences that are just plain toxic    not just unhealthy foods  but ultra violent video games and TV shows  sexual images in music videos  and much more   We are exploiting our children   We are pouring acid on their innocence   And  very often  this is being done to make money            It  s not just children  s wellbeing and parental authority that are being trampled on   It  s also the values and standards of a decent society              And we    each and every one of us    have a responsibility to reverse this destructive course   Yes  it is time for individual responsibility   But it is also time for government responsibility and corporate responsibility              We all need to do the right thing    and the place to start is right in our public schools            So let me close by simply saying thank you   Thank you for your activism  your concern  and your commitment to our children   You are fighting a good fight  an important fight   And I pledge to continue supporting your efforts every way I can
