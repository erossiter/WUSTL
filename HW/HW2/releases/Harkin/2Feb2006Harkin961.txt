      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  will consider a petition requesting that former Ames Laboratory workers who have cancer from uranium exposure be added to a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  making them automatically eligible for compensation            This is positive first step for the workers and families who handled incredibly dangerous materials in the earliest days of the cold war and developed cancer as a result of their work at the Ames Lab     Harkin said     We owe these workers a great debt for their contribution to our national security   Many suffered devastating illnesses as a result of exposure to radioactive materials before we fully understood the risks             In 2000 Harkin sponsored and Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  which established a compensation program for former nuclear workers   Since then work has been underway to reconstruct radiation doses for workers across the country and to determine if workers who subsequently developed cancer and other illnesses likely developed the cancer as a result of radiation exposure          In cases where the exposure levels for a group of workers cannot be accurately documented  Congress gave NIOSH and the NIOSH Advisory Board on Worker and Radiation Health the authority to add the workers to a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC    Workers included within a SEC are entitled to receive  150 000 in automatic compensation if they developed one of 22 specified cancers   Groups of workers from Burlington  Iowa  Kentucky  Ohio  Alaska  and Tennessee have already been designated as SECs           The NIOSH Advisory Board on Worker and Radiation Health consultants will now examine whether it is possible to accurately reconstruct and estimate the level of the workers   radiation exposure   If the Board determines that it is not possible to accurately reconstruct the workers doses based on the remaining records  then they will vote to designate this group of workers as a Special Exposure Cohort            In 2005 after years of effort by former workers  advocates and government officials  former Iowa Army Ammunition Plant workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers were included in an SEC   Approximately two thirds of the eligible families have received this funding                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
