                  WASHINGTON  D C    A day after the House of Representatives passed a resolution disapproving of President Bush s plans to escalate the war in Iraq  Senate Republicans continued stall tactics and once again blocked this important debate in the Senate   Senator Harkin  D IA  released the following statement in response to the Senate s repeated inaction                            For the second time in less than a month  Senate Republicans had a choice   Instead of choosing what the American people deserve  they decided to shirk responsibility and block debate once again   We as Senators have a duty to debate this escalation and these stall tactics are unacceptable and deeply disturbing                              Escalation is not a way forward  it is a way deeper into a tragic quagmire  This is not in our national interest   It is not in the interest of the long suffering Iraqi people   And it certainly is not in the interest of our troops  who will remain in the crossfire of a vicious civil war                                The American people have called for a new direction in Iraq  Yesterday  the House of Representatives in a bipartisan vote expressed the disapproval of this escalation   It s extremely disheartening that Senate Republicans could not follow this lead  and instead chose to rubber stamp the President s escalation plan                                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
