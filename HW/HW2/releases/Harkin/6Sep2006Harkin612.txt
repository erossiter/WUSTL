   WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education  today said new breakthroughs in stem cell research  including those announced recently by Advanced Cell Technologies  should not end Congressional efforts to pass legislation that would expand federal funding for this field of study            One thing is clear     Harkin said    This new technique  even if it proves successful  does not in any way diminish the need to pass H R  810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  which the President vetoed in July             Nineteen researchers at the National Institutes of Health  NIH   leading Nobel Prize scientists and countless health and medical leaders have all advocated for the expansion of federal funding for embryonic stem cell research  NIH estimates there are currently 400 stem cell lines worldwide   Because of the President  s arbitrary restrictions  federal funding can only be used to study just 21 of those lines  all of which are contaminated by mouse cells  Harkin  together with Senator Arlen Specter  R PA   has promised to reintroduce the legislation when the 110th Congress convenes in January            We will continue to make expansion of embryonic stem cell research a priority in the next Congress     Harkin said    This fight does not end with the President  s veto             Titled   Recent Controversies in Stem Cell Research     the subcommittee meeting included testimony from Dr  James Battey  Chairman  NIH Stem Cell Task Force  Dr  Robert Lanza  Advanced Cell Technologies  Dr  Kevin Eggan  Harvard University  and Dr  Ronald Green  Dartmouth College          Harkin  s complete opening statement from today  s hearing is included below               Thank you  Chairman Specter  for holding this hearing today   There  s been a lot of confusion about the recent announcement that scientists have derived stem cell lines from individual blastomeres  and I hope this hearing will help set some things straight            The confusion is regrettable  and I believe it could have been avoided if people had acted more responsibly            First  I want to applaud ACT for breaking new ground on the derivation of stem cells   This company showed for the first time that a stem cell line could be derived from a single human blastomere  and that  s an interesting development              However  ACT should have made it clearer from the start that none of the embryos discussed in the Nature paper survived the experiment   ACT created the impression that it had done something that may be possible in theory  but it hasn  t actually accomplished            Second  the journal Nature made things worse by putting out a press release that promoted that false impression            And third  the media overhyped this announcement  portraying it as the silver bullet that will solve everyone  s ethical questions about stem cell research   That is just wishful thinking             What we need to do now is step back  examine what it was that ACT really accomplished  and discuss what it means for the future of stem cell research            But one thing is clear   This new technique  even if IT proves successful  does not in any way diminish the need to pass HR 810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  which the President vetoed in July              The NIH estimates that there are 400 stem cell lines worldwide   Right now  because of the President  s arbitrary restrictions  federal funding can be used to study just 21 of those lines  all of which are contaminated by mouse cells              Even if the method described by ACT actually works  it will still take years for it to produce a substantial number of new lines   Those will be years in which people continue to die of Parkinson  s disease  ALS  diabetes  cancer  and dozens of other diseases that could one day be treated or cured by stem cell research   We shouldn  t make the mistake of holding out all our hope for new  unproven methods of deriving stem cells  when we have hundreds of lines that already exist   Scientists need access to more lines now    not years from now            Again  Mr  Chairman  I want to thank you for holding this hearing  and I look forward to the testimony from our witnesses                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
