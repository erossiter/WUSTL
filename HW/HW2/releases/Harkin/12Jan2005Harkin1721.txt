       The local wellness policies included in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 were  in my mind  a tremendous success and one that I am proud to have been a part of   Thank you to everyone who played a role in getting this provision  indeed  the entire bill passed   I see that both Denise Forte with Congressman Miller and Kate Houston with Congressman Boehner are here this morning   They both worked extremely hard on this bill and I want to thank them for their work on this particular provision as well             To those who aren  t familiar with the provision  it  s really quite simple   It basically requires schools that participate in the School Lunch and School Breakfast programs to establish school wellness policies that include goals for nutrition education and physical activity  and which also include nutritional guidelines for the sale and availability of all foods on a school campus             The legislation doesn  t stipulate what kinds of standards schools should adopt in formulating their local wellness policies   The legislation gives schools the express authority to make these decisions and set the standards themselves   But the Child Nutrition legislation does say that this is something that schools should put some thought and effort into    The legislation entrusts our schools  parents  and health professional in local communities with the power and with a well deserved responsibility to tend to our children  s health and their nutrition and schools               There are numerous examples of what communities have been doing on their own to institute policies just like those required in the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act   The bill seeks to gives additional communities the tools to accelerate the development of such school wellness policies and to empower them to replicate them across the country             The local wellness policies included in the Child Nutrition bill last summer represent a consensus and bipartisan approach that is also consistent with the desires of schools to set guidelines that are consistent with local needs and conditions           I am hopeful that the local wellness policies will work   In my opinion  this provision of the Child Nutrition bill has the potential to transform the way our kids eat at school     But whether or not this occurs really depends largely upon the efforts of you  the stakeholders             If USDA and stakeholders groups are energetic about working with schools to draft policies that are sensible and protective of child health without being onerous and burdensome  I expect that parents and schools around the country will respond enthusiastically and that the final result of the local wellness policies will be that our kids will eat much healthier diets when they are at school             On the other hand  if we don  t work diligently to translate the federal requirements into local policies  the local wellness policies may be a bust   I am hopeful though that the local wellness policies will be successful   Members on both sides of the aisle believe that  properly implemented  they will succeed and that  as a result  our children will eat better at school             Of course  there are other options available to us if the local wellness policies aren  t successful   Congress has looked at a number of different alternatives in the past and could easily return to those if necessary  However  I am hopeful though that the local wellness policies that we enacted last summer will  with your help  be a tremendous success   I hope that I can not only count on your help  but can also count on you to tell me how I can be your partner   I will remain engaged on issues related to child and school nutrition and am always looking for suggestions as to how I can do my job better and help you to do yours     I do want to briefly mention one tool that I think will be helpful to schools in setting appropriate standards for the availability of foods at schools   In the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2005  I was able to authorize and fund a study under which the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences will make recommendations regarding what kinds of foods are appropriate for children to purchase and consume at school   It  s no secret that some people oppose this study   I know that some people in the food industry are very opposed to such a study   They are opposed to guidelines that are based on the latest science on child nutrition and development               But in fact  we already know what that science says   People can quibble over it and they can split hairs  but in general  the science is pretty clear that our kids are taking in too many calories and they aren  t getting enough nutrients   They are eating too much junk food and not enough fruits and vegetables             You can pick up any parent off the street and ask them if a 20 ounce soda  a candy bar  and a bag of nacho chips are a nutritious breakfast for a growing child   9 out of 10 will tell you that it isn  t   Is there anyone in the room that would really dispute that with a straight face   I don  t think so             It  s not that kids  and adults  can  t enjoy foods like these from time to time   It  s just that they shouldn  t be a replacement for a balanced breakfast or lunch when kids are at school   Moms and dads are some of the best scientists around and we should follow their wisdom when we care for their kids at school   Whether they articulate it or not  moms and dads understand this science   Students from schools that did not offer a la carte foods consume more fruits and vegetables than do children in schools that have a la carte programs             In another study  when kids gained access to foods other than through the School Lunch Program  they consumed 33 percent less fruit  42 percent less vegetables  and 35 percent less milk   Poor eating habits early in life  at school and elsewhere  lay the foundation for chronic disease and premature death at a later age   Cancer  heart disease  and osteoporosis are just a few of the many diseases associated with poor diet            So these claims that junk food at school doesn  t hurt kids are themselves junk   They are dangerous to our children  s health             Nonetheless  the IOM study will bring together the best scientists  nutritionists  and child development experts and will give us the gold standard scientific study regarding what our kids eat at school   I expect that it will settle  once and for all  any lingering doubt about what our kids should be eating at school   And it will also give schools a helpful tool and a set of standards to guide their own efforts if they choose to adopt or use them in anyway             I  m not suggesting at this point in time that whatever standards the IOM arrives at should be mandated or that schools should be required to adopt them  but I do think that it will be helpful for schools to have a roadmap or a template that can guide their efforts   It  s true that schools have to respond to local conditions   The local wellness policies contained in the Child Nutrition bill give schools plenty of flexibility to formulate policies that are appropriate to these conditions             But on the other hand  it  s also true that the developmental and nutritional needs of children do not vary by locale   Kids in Indianola  Iowa have the same developmental needs as kids in Tallahassee  FL             Finally  I  d like to close by extending my thanks once again to all of you for your help in bringing us to this point that we find ourselves today and also urge your continued effort
