 I am disappointed that Senate Republicans blocked a vote that would have allowed the Senate to conduct an official vote of no confidence in Attorney General Gonzales  The Attorney General has shown time and time again that he has no respect for the rule of law or the system of justice  Time after time  he has abdicated his responsibility to uphold justice in favor of pursuing partisan ends  Such behavior leaves no doubt that he is not fit to run the Department of Justice   The Department of Justice plays a crucial role in safeguarding our democracy and should be an independent agency immune to partisan pressure and dedicated to upholding the law  The Department of Justice should have a leader who can be trusted  Attorney General Gonzales has repeatedly shown he cannot be trusted  Today Senate Republicans decided to stand with the President in refusing to acknowledge that new leadership is needed at the Department of Justice   It is past time for the Attorney General to do the right thing and resign  Only then will we be able to more forward and restore the American publics confidence in the Department of Justice       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
