     I am deeply disappointed by Whirlpool  s decision to cut thousands of Iowa jobs in Newton  This will hit the community very hard   Maytag has been an integral part of the Iowa economy for many years  and its workers are second to none   I believe Whirlpool failed to acknowledge the quality workforce Iowa has to offer and is cutting many valuable jobs in our state            When Maytag announced their plans to sell the company  I was deeply concerned that this could lead to loss of jobs in our state   Though many of us worked to protect Iowa jobs and highlight the benefits of maintaining Maytag  s Iowa facilities and workforce  unfortunately today  those concerns were realized   Now we will work together to ensure that the affected workers and their families will get the assistance and training they need to get back to work as soon as possible                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
