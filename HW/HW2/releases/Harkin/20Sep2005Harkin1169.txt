                   I welcome the two top U S  officials who are entrusted by the President with these negotiations   I would particularly like to thank the Chairman for making sure that we have a chance to hear about the potential problems facing U S  food aid programs in the negotiations from Mr Viso from World Vision on the second panel                        I am on record in support of U S  objectives in the agricultural negotiations of the Doha Round  because it would be better for everyone concerned if we could agree multilaterally to open markets more broadly  eliminate export subsidies  and reduce the use of trade distorting support for farmers   At the G 8 summit in July and again last week in New York  President Bush spoke of eliminating all forms of agricultural subsidies   I would ask the U S  Trade Representative or the Agriculture Secretary to clarify what the President meant  because by the definition of some international bodies  his comments would mean giving up every dollar spent to support food and agriculture  including agricultural research and extension  rural development activities  and food stamps   I believe we should reserve the right to assist agriculture and rural America in non trade distorting ways  such as through conservation programs like the Conservation Security Program and rural economic initiatives                        In July 2004  WTO members reached an agreement that set the broad outlines of what needs to be done to reform agricultural policy worldwide   However  the document contained few concrete numbers that specified the scope of reform   Countries intended to hammer out a consensus over the numbers in the months that followed   In reality  there is a tremendous amount of work to be done  and WTO officials and countries   trade negotiators are now scrambling to find some common ground                         We need to know what the Administration plans to do to break this deadlock   Will the Administration give up countercyclical payments  or will they fight for language in the final agreement that would allow us to report those payments in the blue box under an expanded definition   What does the Administration plan to give up            As I said earlier  U S  agriculture has an enormous stake in a successful outcome in the Doha Round  which could offer significant opportunity to expand trade in the markets of the other 147 members of the WTO   According to the UN  s Food and       Agriculture Organization  world agricultural trade was valued at more than  520 billion in 2003   However  we need to be aware of the fact that the outcome is likely to be much less far reaching than we would have seen with the adoption of the original U S  proposal offered in 2002            There is one specific issue that I would like to raise in this hearing  a matter I also raised in my meeting last week with EU Agriculture Commissioner Fischer Boel   I believe that we need to strongly resist EU proposals in the WTO to convert all U S  food aid to cash  except in emergency situations   The U S  government has helped more than 3 4 billion people with its food aid programs over the last half century  and part of the success of U S  food aid programs stem from the broad support they enjoy here in the United States   While I agree that there may be some room for disciplines on food aid  the EU  s proposal is unnecessarily draconian   We do not want to harm people in developing countries in the name of trade policy reform                        This Round has seen the emergence of developing countries as important players in the negotiations     We are no longer in a situation where a handful of big countries like the U S   EU  and Japan can decide the terms of the agriculture agreement  which clearly has complicated matters   I acknowledge that the EU has made big strides in reforming its agricultural policies  and believe that there may be more common ground between us on key issues than it currently appears   Improving market access continues to be a hang up in the negotiations  however  for both developing countries and developed countries like the EU and Japan                        While expanding trade is not an antidote for all that ails U S  agriculture  it is important that we continue to fight for freer and fairer trade   I want to work with my colleagues on the Senate Agriculture Committee to do all we can to help the Doha process regain its momentum and reach a favorable conclusion                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
