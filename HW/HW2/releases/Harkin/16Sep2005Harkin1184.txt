     Today  s settlement was evidently reached because federal court rulings raised very serious doubts that the Iowa packer ownership ban would be upheld under the U S  Constitution   The settlement illustrates the severe limits on state laws designed to control the rapid consolidation and vertical integration in pork production and other types of agriculture           That is why I continue to push the U S  Departments of Agriculture and Justice to step up enforcement of the federal Packers and Stockyards Act and antitrust laws   Federal enforcement of these laws has been virtually nonexistent in recent years           It is essential that Congress enacts new federal legislation combating economic concentration in the food and agriculture sector   Along with Senator Grassley  I have introduced legislation several times to establish a federal ban on packer ownership and feeding of livestock   We won Senate approval of that ban in the 2002 farm bill  but in conference leaders of the House of Representatives made it clear there would be no farm bill if the packer ownership ban were included         Harkin also introduced legislation that would provide new protections to producers in contract arrangements with packers   The legislation would have extended many of the protective terms included in the Smithfield settlement announced today to all producers and packers in the nation         In October 2004  Senator Harkin released a Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee Democratic staff report detailing the detrimental affects that vertical integration and consolidation in the livestock industry poses to independent farmers   This report can be obtained by going to Senator Harkin  s website www harkin gov  and clicking on agriculture   The report is titled    Economic Concentration and Structural Change in the Food and Agriculture Sector  Trends  Consequences and Policy Option                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
