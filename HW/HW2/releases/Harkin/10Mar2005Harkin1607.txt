        These budget proposals reflect badly misplaced priorities and a basic misunderstanding of the serious challenges facing farm families and rural communities     Harkin said     We stayed within the budget when we wrote the 2002 farm bill  and in fact the farm programs have saved over  15 billion from what was projected   Agriculture and rural programs should get credit for this fiscal responsibility and should not be forced to give up progress made in the 2002 farm bill               Harkin continued    I find it very interesting that the Senate Budget Committee  chaired by a senator from the Northeast  seeks to mitigate some of the cuts the president proposed   Conversely  the House Budget Committee  chaired by someone from a state where agriculture and rural communities are vital  fell in line with president and is seeking disproportionate cuts that seriously jeopardize agriculture  rural development  conservation and nutrition programs   I have long said that a budget is more than numbers on a piece of paper   A budget is about priorities   And our priorities should be looking out for rural communities  farm families  and those who need nutritional assistance   Whether Congress as whole shares these priorities remains to be seen               The House Budget Committee proposal largely mirrors President Bush  s desire to more than  1 billion a year on average from agriculture and nutrition programs   The Senate Budget Committee  s proposal  while less drastic than the House  would still undermine the progress made in the 2002 farm bill and leave rural Americans behind   These budget proposals defer decisions on what specific cuts may be made to which programs  but the history of budget decisions by the present administration and Congressional leadership shows that conservation  rural economic development  agricultural research and renewable energy initiatives are seriously threatened along with farm and nutrition programs                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
