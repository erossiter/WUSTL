        Under this method  scientists take a 2 day old embryo that has 8 cells  extract one  called a blastomere   and then stimulate that blastomere to begin dividing   After a few days  scientists can use it to derive stem cells   The supposed advantage of this method is that the original embryo isn  t destroyed            I  m intrigued by this method   It seems worth pursuing   But we need to be clear about one thing as we listen to today  s testimony   There  s only one reason why this method has suddenly become so popular at the White House   They want to use it to defeat HR 810  the stem cell bill that passed the House by an overwhelming  bipartisan majority  and is identical to the bill that Senator Specter and I introduced in the Senate            Here  s the White House strategy   They  re trying to convince Senators that instead of supporting HR 810  we should pin all our hopes on this blastomere method  or other so called   ethical alternatives     They figure that if they can pull enough Senators off of HR 810  that will keep us from getting the 60 we need to stop a filibuster              Now  I could respect that position if blastomere extraction showed as much promise as our current method for deriving stem cells   But so far  it doesn  t   The method we  re discussing today hasn  t been published in a single scientific journal   It hasn  t even cleared the peer review process   What  s more  it  s only been tried in mice   We  re a long way from proving it works with human embryos            I could also respect the White House  s position if blastomere extraction didn  t raise any ethical issues   But again  that  s not the case   We have no idea what the long term effects are of removing a cell from a 2 day old human embryo   Here  s what Leon Kass  the chairman of the President  s Council on Bioethics  said about this method     Blastomere extraction from living embryos  we found unacceptable ethically in humans because we do not believe that one should impose risks on living embryos destined to become children for the sake of getting stem cells for research               There  s another problem with this method   It would violate the Dickey amendment  which is included every year in the Labor HHS appropriations bill   The Dickey amendment states that no federal funds may be used for research in which human embryos are subjected to risk of injury   Unless Congress removes this amendment  which is extremely unlikely  this method of deriving human stem cell lines will be off limits to federal scientists                   Now let  s look at another method that has suddenly gained a lot of support among opponents of stem cell research   This one is called altered nuclear transfer   In this method  scientists would create a new kind of cloned human embryo that  s never been seen before   They  d remove a critical gene  so the embryo    or whatever you call this new thing    could never turn into a fetus  but scientists could use it to derive stem cells              So let me get this straight   The conservatives accuse supporters of HR 810 of being immoral because we want to use embryos that would otherwise be discarded to help people with juvenile diabetes  Parkinson  s  and spinal cord injuries   But they think it  s perfectly OK to create a new kind of Frankenstein human embryo that  s genetically engineered to die   The hypocrisy here is indefensible            Are alternative methods for deriving stem cells worth examining   Absolutely   I support any ethical means to improve the lives of human beings who are suffering   In fact  Senator Specter and I have included language in our appropriations bill urging NIH to support research on derivation methods that don  t involve the destruction of a human embryo            But meanwhile  people we love are dying from Parkinson  s and ALS   Children are suffering from juvenile diabetes   People are losing the ability to walk due to spinal cord injuries   They don  t have 10 years to wait and see if these alternative methods pan out   They need help now            So I look forward to hearing more about blastomere extraction and the other alternative methods   But they are no substitute for passing HR 810 in the Senate                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
