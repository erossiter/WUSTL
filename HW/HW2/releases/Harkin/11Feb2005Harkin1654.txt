      Harkin was instrumental in developing an industry wide protocol in 2001 which aimed to eliminate forced child labor in processing cocoa beans in West Africa   The Harkin Engel Protocol  signed by various stakeholders in the chocolate trade including the chocolate industry  required that chocolate companies implement an industry wide voluntary certification system to give a public accounting of labor practices in the cocoa growing countries by July 1  2005   Industry representatives recently informed Harkin that they will be unable to meet this deadline            We have done our best to accommodate the chocolate companies     Harkin said     We preferred a two year deadline for the creation of an industry wide certification regime   But we agreed to the companies   request for four years   We have cajoled  negotiated  held meetings  and conducted endless conversations with the various stakeholders   But the time for talk has passed   Children are suffering   The industry must make clear when and if it intends to live up to its commitments             The Harkin Engel Protocol responded to numerous reports of child and slave labor conditions in the cocoa industry in West Africa  particularly in the Ivory Coast  West Africa is one of the biggest cocoa producing regions in the world  with 43  of the world  s coca beans coming from the Ivory Coast alone  There are more than 600 000 small farms producing cocoa beans in the Ivory Coast  many in the remote parts of the country  Local human rights activists in the Ivory Coast estimate that as many as 90  of cocoa farms use forced child labor             This Valentine  s Day  I am going to buy my wife flowers instead of chocolate  The chocolate companies have the leverage and clout to stop this suffering  But if corporate responsibility is lacking  Congress will be obliged to act   I look forward to the day sometime soon that I will buy chocolate with a clear conscience     said Harkin         30          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
