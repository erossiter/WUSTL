        I commend Kraft Foods for their decision to limit advertising of some unhealthy foods to children   It is a positive step that demonstrates that doing business and doing the right thing for the health of children are not mutually exclusive   I hope many more companies will follow Kraft  s lead and practice more responsible marketing directed at children              end             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
