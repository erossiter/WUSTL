        Later this morning  you  ll be fanning out across Capitol Hill to make your case for more aggressive ALS research   I just want to tell you how important it is that you  re here   You remind us that ALS is not about statistics  it is about the suffering of real human beings   And it makes all the difference in the world for you to bring that message here  today  in person            Your presence could not come at a more crucial time   It has been six decades since Lou Gehrig died  but we still have only one FDA approved drug to treat this disease  and that drug only extends survival by a few months   This is unacceptable   Five thousand Americans are diagnosed with ALS each year   And for some reason    no one knows why    our military veterans are especially susceptible to this disease   We have a responsibility to do more to find an effective treatment and cure            Regrettably  the administration has taken a hard line against one of the most promising avenues of research    stem cells   Scientists tell me that ALS is exactly the kind of disease that could benefit from stem cell research   They  ve already figured out how to direct stem cells to develop into motor neurons   If they could solve that next critical step    replacing motor neurons that have died off in a person with ALS    then we could be looking at a cure            Instead  the administration has put a choke hold on research by limiting the number of stem cell lines that federally funded scientists can study   We were initially told that more than 70 lines would be eligible for federally funded research  today  there are just 21  and all of them are contaminated with mouse feeder cells  meaning there  s almost no chance they  ll ever be used for human therapies            That  s why Senator Specter and I have introduced legislation to expand the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research   The House will vote on this measure sometime in May  so I hope you  ll lobby hard for stem cell research in your Hill meetings today            In the meantime  I was pleased to learn that NIH is supporting five clinical trials on ALS that are either ongoing or about to start   That  s more than we  ve ever had before   So these are clearly more hopeful times for ALS  and I look forward to hearing more about these trials this morning            I want to join Senator Shelby in welcoming an outstanding group of witnesses   In particular  I want to recognize Rob Borsellino  a columnist for the Des Moines Register   Rob has an intensely loyal following all across Iowa    and I  m one of his biggest fans   It came as a blow to all of us when Rob announced in his column earlier this year that he has ALS   Since then  he has been writing and speaking about this disease with his customary humor and grace   And I thank you  Rob  for coming to talk with us in person today                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
