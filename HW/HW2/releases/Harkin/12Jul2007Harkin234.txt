 Washington  DC  U S  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Dianne Feinstein  D CA  have filed an amendment to the 2008 Defense Authorization Bill requiring President Bush to close the Department of Defense detention facility at Guantanamo Bay  Cuba  within one year    The amendment provides the Administration the flexibility to choose how and where to try the detainees  either in military proceedings or in the federal courts  and in which high security facilities to house them   The amendment is co sponsored by Senators Christopher Dodd  D CT   Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Sherrod Brown  D OH   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI   Barack Obama  D IL   and Richard Durbin  D IL    There is currently more than enough bed space  at high security military and federal civilian prisons  to accommodate the Guantanamo detainees within the territorial United States   There are currently about 375 individuals held at Guantanamo  About 80 of them have been cleared for release  according to the Defense Department  The Administration has stated that it intends to bring charges against no more than 60 to 80 of the remaining detainees  Fourteen high valuedetainees were transferred to Guantanamo last summer from CIA black sites  and another such detainee was sent to Guantanamo from CIA custody since then   There is sufficient bed space at two military prisons to house Guantanamo detainees  according to the Pentagon  The facilities with current space available are   In addition  there are 579 beds available at two high security federal civilian prisons  according to the U S  Bureau of Prisons  These facilities are   The amendment is similar to earlier bills by Senators Harkin and Feinstein to close Guantanamo  and specifically requires the President to report on implementation of the legislation within three months of passage    The situation at Guantanamo is personal for me  said Senator Harkin  As a young staffer on the Hill  I helped to expose the tiger cages at Con Son Island  where Viet Cong and North Vietnamese prisoners  as well as civilian opponents of the war  were being held incommunicado  tortured and killed with the full knowledge and sanction of the U S  government  I believe there are disturbing parallels between what transpired on Con Son Island nearly four decades ago and what has happened at Guantanamo in recent years   In both cases  prisons were deliberately set up on remote islands to limit scrutiny and restrict access  In both cases  detainees were not classified as prisoners of war  expressly to deny them the protections of the Geneva Conventions  In both cases  detainees were deprived of any right to due process  judicial review  or a fair trial  And in both cases  when the mistreatment of detainees was exposed  the United States was accused of hypocrisy  of betraying its most sacred values and violating international law  Now is the time to reclaim Americas moral authority and close the prison at Guantanamo Bay   The Guantanamo Bay detention facility has done tremendous damage to Americas reputation around the world  This facility represents a failed experiment by the Bush Administration to create a new legal system operating outside established U S  and international law  This is unworthy of this great nation  Senator Feinstein said    Summary  The amendment filed by Senators Feinstein and Harkin requires that  within one year of the date of enactment   In addition  the amendment requires that  three months after enactment of this bill  the President shall submit a report to Congress describing plans for closing the Guantanamo facility and transferring detainees  It also requires that the President shall keep Congress currently informed of steps taken to implement the legislation    History   The Bush Administration began using the Guantanamo Bay facility in January 2002  four months after the September 11  2001 terrorist attacks against the United States and on the heels of Operation Enduring Freedom in Afghanistan   About 750 individuals  most of whom were suspected of being either Taliban fighters or al Qaeda irregulars  have been sent to Guantanamo Bay  There are roughly 375 there today   Through much of Guantanamo Bays operation  the Bush Administration asserted that detainees were not subject to protections under the Geneva Conventions  a position likely to make American troops captured on the battlefield face abuse from our enemies  The U S  Supreme Court ruled in 2006 that the Administration must follow the Geneva Conventions   Following is a brief chronology of the Guantanamo Bay detention facility and related court action       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
