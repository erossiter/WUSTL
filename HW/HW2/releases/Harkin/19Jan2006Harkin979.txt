        In the upcoming weeks  the Senate will vote on the nomination of Samuel Alito to replace Justice O  Connor on the United States Supreme Court                Of all the issues that we consider in the Senate  perhaps no issue raises such deep and fundamental questions as the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice   The issues that come before the Supreme Court are not abstract legal concepts   Rather  they involve the very values that define who we are as a nation   They ask us to think about what kind of society we want to be   I believe strongly that we want to be a society that strives for justice  that protects that powerless  that provides meaningful protections to workers  and that allows those who have suffered discrimination to seek recourse and affirm their rights in federal court   I believe that a nominee to the Supreme Court needs more than sterling legal qualifications   He or she must possess a true passion for justice  and an understanding that the law cannot be viewed with cool  legal dispassion  but with the acknowledgement of its role in molding a fairer and more just society   And he or she must understand and believe in the critical role that federal courts play in protecting the civil rights of all Americans  including the 54 million Americans who live every day with a disability   A thorough review of Judge Alito  s record and of the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing has convinced me that he falls far short of that measure   I intend to oppose this nomination               As all of you know  I was the lead sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act  which Congress passed in response unfair discrimination and prejudice against people with disabilities   I championed the ADA because I had seen discrimination against the disabled first hand growing up with my brother Frank  who was deaf   Yet despite Frank  s experiences  and similar documented experiences of millions of Americans with disabilities  the Court has repeatedly questioned whether Congress had the authority to pass the ADA   These challenges leave the future of the ADA  and the basic rights that many Iowans take for granted   in question   To put a fine point on it  the ADA is at the mercy of the Supreme Court                 Many of the most recent decisions related to the ADA have been decided by the narrowest of margins   So a future Justice Alito will have significant impact on how future cases are decided   Determining one  s future actions is a little like looking into a crystal ball  so I must rely on his past record to determine how he will handle these critical issues in the future                  Based on his record  I am gravely concerned that Judge Alito does not believe the Congress has the authority to protect the fundamental rights of all Americans   Take for example  a 2000 case where he ruled that Congress lacked the authority to pass the Family and Medical Leave Act  a law that allows Americans and working Iowans to take unpaid leave from work to care for a newborn child or tend to a family illness   Based on this decision  I am concerned about how he would rule on cases regarding Congressional authority to pass the ADA                     Judge Alito consistently favors the rights of states over the rights of people   One such example of this philosophy is evident in a 1995 case   The 3rd Circuit ruled that people with disabilities should be allowed to live in the community  and not warehoused in institutions   whenever possible   Judge Alito argued that the 3rd Circuit should reconsider that decision                   These cases provide a clear window into Judge Alito  s judicial philosophy   He has an extremely restrictive view of Congress  s power to enact laws to protect workers  to protect public safety  and to protect victims of discrimination   If Judge Alito is confirmed  many of the core protections provided to people with disabilities under the ADA and other laws could simply disappear   Consider some recent narrowly decided Supreme Court decisions             In 1999  a 6 3 Supreme Court majority held that institutionalizing people with disabilities was a form of discrimination   O  Connor sided with the disability community   But times have changed   Justice Roberts has replaced Justice Rehnquist   And Judge Alito seeks to replace Justice O  Connor   Given Judge Alito  s history on a similar case  the votes might have been different   And years of progress toward equal rights  might have been erased               Similarly in 2004  a 5 4 decision established that state courthouses were subject to the ADA   Justice O  Connor voted with majority to ensure that courthouses are accessible to people with disabilities   If   Justice Alito    had been on the bench instead of Justice O  Connor  would the decision have been the same   Given his record on Congressional authority  it would be foolish to think it would              The new Supreme Court Justice will have a tremendous impact on our society   The decisions before the Court will determine whether we are true to our fundamental national values of fairness and justice for all    Given Judge Alito  s history  record and testimony  I do not feel confident that those future decisions will take us in the right direction                           Originating Site  Number  Site
