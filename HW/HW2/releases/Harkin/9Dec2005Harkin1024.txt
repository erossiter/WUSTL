             In the past  USDA  s Rural Utilities Service helped bring electricity and telephone service to rural America  and now the Department of Agriculture needs to assist rural communities in obtaining broadband technology     Harkin said     Instead  USDA has mired the delivery of rural broadband assistance in red tape and excessive financial requirements   The incoming Administrator has pledged to me that he will take action to address these problems   USDA needs to embrace its proud tradition of doing what  s necessary to ensure rural America is not left behind in technological advances                  Harkin outlined a number of concerns about USDA implementation of the broadband loan program   Currently  USDA imposes excessive cash on hand requirements that work to defeat the purpose of the program   This makes many small businesses and rural communities ineligible for the loans   This cash requirement means that only firms or communities who already have enough capital to purchase broadband technology can qualify for USDA loans  while those who cannot afford this without any assistance are automatically denied because they lack money   Harkin also outlined the unnecessarily burdensome application process which is costly  time consuming and complicated  Harkin  s letter noted that Mr  Andrew acknowledged concerns about the broadband loan program  s operation during his confirmation hearing in November and pledged to work for improvements so it can operate more effectively                 A copy of Senator Harkin  s letter follows           December 9  2005            The Honorable James M  Andrew      Administrator      Rural Utilities Service      United States Department of Agriculture      1400 Independence Avenue  SW      Washington  DC 20250         Dear Mr  Andrew          I appreciate your comments on the broadband program during your nomination hearing   Now that you have been on the job for a short period  I wanted to write to you about several specific thoughts I have concerning improving the structure and operations of the Broadband Loan Program so it can better serve Rural America   As you know  there has been considerable concern about how the program was initially operated but  I believe  with some changes  the program could be considerably improved            In general  the Rural Utilities Service  RUS  should use the methods it has developed over its history to manage risk by working closely with borrowers and applicants   RUS should not take unreasonable risks  but if the goal is to avoid all risk  the mission to greatly improve broadband availability to rural areas cannot be accomplished          I believe the revised program should contain the following specifics            Financial Requirements         The key item that has hurt many companies is the requirement that the applicant have one year of operating cash in the bank   Early in the program  this requirement was applied as a condition of loan approval and now is a requirement for drawing funds   RUS is telling applicants that they could not include expected revenues in the one year operating cash requirement   If an applicant has operated on a cash flow positive basis for at least two consecutive years  the requirement is waived   Ironically  the regulation makes it easier for the agency to lend money to a start up company with no operational experience or customers than it would to a young company which has invested in its network  won customers and is on the pathway to positive cash flow   Of course  what is important is that companies have sufficient resources to be able to successfully run their business and pay back the loan   The agency should take into account existing and reasonably projected revenues in meeting cash requirements such as expected accounts payable from existing subscribers   There could be a scaled approach  which requires cash from start up companies  cash plus reasonable reliable revenues from operating companies  and no cash from operating companies with sufficient revenues and equity to be able to repay the loan          Under the RUS loan contract and mortgage  the agency maintains very significant and continuing authority to manage risk   Loan funds are advanced as a project is deployed  not in one lump sum   The agency controls when and if loan funds can be advanced            Applying for a Loan          As you know  the RUS telecommunications program has a two step application process   Prospective borrowers submit a letter of inquiry explaining their intended service  territory and technology to the agency   The agency then reviews and assigns a field staffer to work with the applicant on the project   The Broadband Loan Program requires applicants to put an entire application together  which under RUS rules has expensive market research  competitive analysis  engineering  publication and financial costs associated with it   While agency staff members are available to discuss applications in progress  they do not make commitments on anything until everything is done   Applicants are then required to   bet the farm    on an application which can take months to analyze and then results  as the statistics show  in a rejection   The agency should consider a two step process which gives applicants more certainty and confidence that if specific conditions are met a loan would be made   Perhaps a broadband pre application process with some financial disclosure could designate approved service areas and outline the specific financial requirements for loan approval   This would give applicants the ability to raise additional capital to leverage an RUS loan          The Cost of Applying         The RUS Broadband Loan Program regulations require applicants to incur significant expenses in preparing an application   Sound engineering  market analysis  competitive analysis  and accounting are all part of a good business plan   The agency also has internal benchmarks it uses to determine the reasonableness of a business plan   A more cooperative and consultative process between applicant and agency might allow an applicant to avoid incurring heavy research costs   For example  if an applicant can demonstrate a successful business plan with modest market share or market penetration  then more informal measurements of the market could be accepted rather than require a full scale market survey          Staffing         At this precise moment  the low numbers of pending loan applications do not appear to be stretching the agency  s resources   In implementing the Broadband Loan Program  the agency determined to set up a separate broadband unit  rather than disburse applications among the then existing telecomm regional   area    staff   In the early days of the program  this created a nearly unbearable crunch for the broadband division as it tried to dig out of an avalanche of applications   Interestingly  at the moment of the Broadband Loan Program  s greatest work load  the rest of the telecomm program was experiencing a light work load          The workload of the broadband division should be closely monitored and the Administrator and Assistant Administrator should be encouraged to utilize talent across the telecomm program  and indeed across the agency and rural development to assist in the timely processing of loans          Customer Service         A previous RUS Administrator in the early 90s  Wally Beyer  instituted a staff instruction which required staff assigned to loan applications to have at least a monthly communication with applicants about the progress of their application and a specific report of what the agency needed to complete its review   That practice has been abandoned   Applicants can go for months without hearing from the agency   The broadband program at times assumed an adversarial approach to applicants   It needs to work more cooperatively with applicants  much the way it did in the early days of its rural electrification and rural telecommunications programs             Processing Time         The broadband world operates on internet time  not government time   The applicant mentioned in the November 29  2005 New York Times story was able to secure private sector financing covering part of their needs in about six weeks after waiting over a year for RUS financing   I am told that RUS financing would have allowed for considerably increased market penetration   The agency needs to move faster on applications   To do that it needs to increase communications between borrower and lender          The most important reform is perhaps the most difficult to implement   Simply put  the agency must embrace its mission   That mission is to make it possible for the private sector and communities to deploy broadband   Unfortunately  the Broadband Loan Program seemed to define its mission as   not making a bad loan              In conclusion  RUS knows how to bring infrastructure to places it would not otherwise go   It is hard to imagine a more risky population than depression era farmers or post war rural telephone companies   We are proud that RUS overcame that risk by rolling up its sleeves and working with those who wanted to bring needed services to underserved communities   As a result  the agency has an excellent repayment record and has helped those very depression era rural residents and their successors build almost half of the electric infrastructure in the United States and deliver some of the highest quality telecommunications services in the nation            Managing  rather than avoiding risk is a more demanding activity   It takes skill  trust and judgment   The RUS staff is among the most dedicated in government   Most want to be challenged   All take great pride in the way they have changed lives   Fear is now clouding their vision            As a new Administrator  but one very experienced in the culture of the RUS you have the opportunity to make the Broadband Loan Program succeed  not just in making prudent loans but in fact deploying broadband   Empower your staff to think and operate creatively and work cooperatively with applicants            I appreciate your working on this crucial program for Rural America          Sincerely                Tom Harkin
