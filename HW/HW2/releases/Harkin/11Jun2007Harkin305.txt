 I am disappointed by the Supreme Courts ruling that home health care workers are not entitled to overtime under the Fair Labor Standards Act  In 1974  when Congress amended the Fair Labor Standards Act  its main aim was to add its protections to workers  While it is true that the law  by subsequent regulation  excluded workers who were companions for seniors and people with disabilities  I do not believe that definition was intended to encompass modern home health care workers  Home health workers are critically important caretakers whose care and devotion means freedom and independence for so many   Home care workers are incredibly valuable resources for our nations seniors and people with disabilities  Quality home care helps people to maintain independence and their ability to live and participate in the community  and fair pay helps attract a quality workforce  I intend to work with advocates for seniors and people with disabilities in the coming weeks to see what legislative changes may be needed to ensure a continued high quality workforce       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
