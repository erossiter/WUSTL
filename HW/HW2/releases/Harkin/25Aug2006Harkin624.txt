   Any picture of Iowa should include highly productive agriculture  liveable rural communities and beautiful land   That  s why what  s usually called   the farm bill    is so critically important to all of us Iowans   With the current farm bill expiring next year  I want Iowans to share their views with me as we work to write the next one          We heard a lot of good recommendations last month in Ankeny at a field hearing of the U S  Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  of which I am the ranking Democratic member   It was an honor to be the committee  s chairman when we enacted the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  and I  m pleased it has gotten generally good reviews in rural America                    We now must look to the future with a bold and creative vision for agriculture and rural communities    one that builds new opportunities and promotes farm profitability  economic growth and jobs  that enhances our environment  and that improves the quality of life in rural areas and for all Americans          One point comes through loudly and clearly   the current programs are doing far too little to help create opportunities for young people in agriculture and other businesses in local communities   We also need stronger federal laws to ensure fair  open and competitive markets for both independent producers and those with contract arrangements                          A key improvement we made in the 2002 farm bill was restoring a   countercyclical    element  which had been taken away in the Freedom to Farm bill   It makes sense to provide farmers more help when commodity prices are low while costing taxpayers less when prices are higher   Some witnesses at the Ankeny hearing called for a revenue based income protection system  since payments pegged only to commodity prices don  t respond to lost crop production          There is consistent  widespread support among farmers and all Iowans for greater federal investment in agricultural conservation    to enhance water and air quality  reduce soil erosion and increase wildlife habitat  particularly on land in production   Many of the hearing witnesses called for restoring the Conservation Security Program  CSP     an innovative new system of conservation incentive payments    so it can operate as a fully funded national program    just as it was enacted in the 2002 farm bill            Witnesses at our Ankeny hearing also backed stronger support for farm based renewable energy  rural economic development and food and agriculture research   In the 2002 farm bill  we adopted the first ever energy title  which has boosted ethanol  biodiesel and wind power  along with biobased products and energy efficiency   We also dedicated funds to rural water and wastewater  broadband  and investment capital  adding value to farm commodities and research           I  m proud of the progress we made in 2002  working in a bipartisan  cooperative fashion  to promote conservation  rural development  farm based renewable energy and food and agriculture research   Inexplicably  it is these forward looking  innovative initiatives that have suffered the most from later budget cutbacks by Congress and the administration   So we first have to repair this damage and then build upon the foundation we laid in 2002          As work on a new farm bill continues  I hope you will share your ideas and comments with me   You can contact me by letter  telephone or by e mail through my Senate website     http   harkin senate gov    Your ideas and suggestions are tremendously valuable to me and they are always welcome            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
