        High natural gas prices are placing an increasingly heavy burden on farmers  fertilizer companies and many others in agriculture     Harkin said     As the Energy and Natural Resources Committee considers a comprehensive energy policy  it is critical they address soaring and volatile natural gas prices in a commonsense and effective manner               The Harkin Roberts letter notes that natural gas now accounts for 90 percent of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer production   In addition  rising U S  natural gas prices have caused U S  nitrogen fertilizer production costs to jump from about  80 a ton during the 1990 s to over  300 a ton last year  despite substantial improvements in efficiency by the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry   The result is that 30 percent of the nitrogen fertilizer production in this country has moved overseas  with much more at risk of moving overseas in the near future            Farmers are already doing much to reduce natural gas consumption by aggressively pursuing renewable energy development  by improving energy efficiency  and adopting best management practices to optimize fertilizer use   Since 1980  U S  farmers have increased nitrogen use efficiency by 35 percent while boosting corn yields by 40 percent   Still  most major field crops depend on nitrogen based fertilizers to sustain crop yields              Rising natural gas prices threaten the livelihoods of farmers  and farm suppliers  and threaten to destabilize U S  and world markets     Harkin said     We need a comprehensive  environmentally sound approach to bring supply in line with demand and bring the cost of natural gas under control               Harkin has been a leader in trying to bring natural gas prices under control and has authored and introduced legislation to increase the use of renewable sources of energy to supplement natural gas supplies  particularly for electricity production   Harkin has pushed for a long term extension of the wind production tax credit  PTC  and for an ambitious national renewable fuels standard  RFS  to promote the use of ethanol and biodiesel   For more information on Senator Harkin  s efforts to

    The Honorable Pete Domenici        The Honorable Jeff Bingaman        United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources        364 Dirksen Senate Building        Washington  DC            RE   Comprehensive Energy Policy  Natural Gas and Agriculture           Dear Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Bingaman            Thank you for the leadership you both have shown in addressing the challenge of soaring natural gas prices in the United States  The natural gas conference you hosted in January brought much needed attention to the critical imbalance between supply and demand of natural gas in this country            In addition to the testimony at the natural gas conference  we urge you to consider the threat that this imbalance poses to our nation  s farmers and the U S  agricultural economy  Agricultural producers are especially hard hit by high natural gas prices  and with the increasing dependence of electric power generation on natural gas  rising gas prices increase already high electricity bills for farmers   Farmers depend on natural gas for food processing  irrigation  crop drying  heating of farm buildings and homes  and especially for production of nitrogen based fertilizers such as ammonia and urea            Natural gas now accounts for 90 percent of the cost of nitrogen fertilizer production  Rising natural gas prices have caused U S  nitrogen fertilizer production costs to jump from just over  80 per ton in the 1990s to over  300 a ton last year  despite substantial improvement in efficiency by the domestic nitrogen fertilizer industry   As a result  nearly 30 percent of the nitrogen fertilizer production in this country has moved overseas  with another two to four million tons of U S  production capacity at risk of closing in the next two years              The current trend means that the United States and its farmers are increasingly dependent on foreign sources of nitrogen fertilizer   More than half of U S  nitrogen fertilizer production is now outsourced to such countries as Trinidad  Saudi Arabia  Indonesia  Oman  Qatar  Russia and Venezuela  where natural gas is cheaper   Yet fertilizer costs continue to climb  The cost of ammonia to U S  farmers has increased 80 percent since 1999  threatening their already slim margins            Farmers are doing their part to reduce natural gas consumption by installing renewable energy and energy efficiency systems  and by adopting best management practices to optimize fertilizer use   Since 1980  U S  farmers have increased nitrogen use efficiency by 35 percent while boosting corn yields by 40 percent   Nevertheless  most major field crops grown in this country depend on nitrogen based fertilizers to sustain crop yields              Unless future U S  energy policy helps to bring natural gas supply in line with demand  this troubling shift in fertilizer sourcing and cost will only get worse   Rising  volatile natural gas prices threaten the livelihood of U S  farmers and farm suppliers  and destabilize U S  and world markets   This country needs a balanced  comprehensive natural gas policy that ensures the viability of U S  agriculture for years to come             We urge you to take our concerns into account as you work on a bipartisan basis to formulate energy legislation for the 109th Congress   Thank you            Sincerely
