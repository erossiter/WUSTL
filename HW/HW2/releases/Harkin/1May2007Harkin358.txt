               Today our hearing focuses on the conservation title of the farm bill   We have two distinguished panels of witnesses   I particularly want to express my gratitude to Governor Jim Doyle of Wisconsin for his appearance here today  representing the Midwestern Governors Association   The states are partners in delivering conservation assistance  and the conservation needs of agriculture vary widely from state to state  and even from farm to farm   I also want to thank our colleagues  Senator Ben Cardin of Maryland  and Robert Menendez of New Jersey  for their participation here today                          While this hearing focuses on the conservation title  the committee has already heard views from many witnesses on conservation  in our recent series of hearings on livestock and commodities  and in many of our field hearings   That s appropriate  because increasingly agricultural producers integrate conservation of soil  water  air and wildlife into their production practices   to the betterment of the environment  and in many instances  to their bottom line                           By and large  the message I have heard from these previous hearings is that farmers want us to provide the tools they need to most effectively farm their land   They want programs that help them do better conservation on the land producing food  fiber and fuel for America and the world   The current demand for commodities such as corn only increases the need for effective conservation programs  as land that was seen as marginal is brought into production to meet that demand                          There is an increasing demand for conservation assistance  yet the funding available in the conservation title is not enough to deal with the needs that exist now and those that will continue in the future                         For instance  the Wetland Reserve Program has reached its cap and has no ongoing baseline   Just maintaining the current program over the next 5 years will cost an estimated  1 952 billion   The Grassland Reserve Program also has no ongoing baseline                              The biggest hit to the programs  however  has been the cuts made to the Conservation Security Program   Long term caps  imposed both by the Appropriations Committee and this Committee  have cut the program by some  4 billion through 2015  when the caps expire   But the damage to the program  due to budget scoring rules  has been far larger than  4 billion   The damage that these cuts have imposed on the program will be difficult for the program to recover from  even if the  4 billion is restored   Just to maintain the status quo in conservation will demand considerably more money for this title                          I look forward to hearing the testimony of these distinguished panels of witnesses                                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
