            Mr  Chairman  I want to thank you for holding this hearing today on agriculture conservation programs  As chair of this committee while we wrote the 2002 farm bill  I worked with President Bush and with you  Mr  Chairman  on the House side to greatly expand programs for conservation  particularly on working lands   We all have reason to be proud of the bill we wrote then                    I  m particularly pleased to have James Andrew of Jefferson  Iowa on the panel   As a committed steward of his land  Mr  Andrew has been a leader in agricultural conservation   Mr  Andrew has spoken to groups including the USDA  s farm policy forum about his experience with the Conservation Security Program                 Mr  Chairman  the long term goal for agricultural conservation needs to be an integrated set of voluntary conservation tools    land retirement  cost share  incentives for stewardship and better practices    that allow producers to maximize their environmental performance on every acre  while they maximize their productivity and profitability                 The commodity programs have always paid producers for what crops they grow and how much they produce   With the WTO and increasing trade pressure for farmers to receive   green payments     we need to pay farmers for how they grow   That means we need to compensate producers when they sacrifice productivity in favor of conservation  by  for instance  cutting hay later in the season to prevent harm to nesting birds   And we need to be equitable  allowing producers that have voluntarily taken steps toward better stewardship to receive stewardship and maintenance payments  just as those who needed incentives and resources to adopt the same practices                 Most of conservation spending in earlier years was for land retirement through the Conservation Reserve Program    a vitally important program that provides critical protection to highly erodable land  and has been vital in protecting important wildlife habitat  such as the prairie pothole region  But land retirement is only part of the answer to the conservation question   The most important change in the last farm bill was the increasing emphasis on conservation on working land   The greatest opportunity for conservation gain is on land that is producing America  s food  fiber  and increasingly  our renewable energy   But since 2002  caps on the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP  and draconian caps on the Conservation Security Program  CSP  have prevented these programs from having the broad impact they were intended to have                     The CSP was conceived as a broad program  open to all agriculture producers  to reward and incentivize good conservation practices on working land   The program was intended to be open to producers at all levels of conservation achievement  nationwide  and recognizing the diverse conservation practices in different regions and crops   Unfortunately  that vision was not implemented                     Congress has put significant caps on CSP funding  year by year  culminating in a cap included in the budget reconciliation bill so tight that the program may no longer have capacity to sign up new watersheds after 2007  USDA  s implementation has resulted in the vast majority of agricultural producers not having had even a single opportunity to sign up for this program   There has been a concerted effort to stifle this program as an effective force to reward and encourage agricultural conservation   Of 2264 total watersheds in the US  only 298    a little more than 13     have even had CSP offered in the three years the program has been in operation                       I agree with Chief Knight  who has said that   the Conservation Security Program is the future      Much of the difficulty the program faces has been caused by the severe spending caps  and while I disagree with many of the NRCS  s decisions in implementing the program  I give the agency credit for correcting some of their earlier missteps by making the program work better for farmers and ranchers   But we must do more to ensure that this innovative program achieves its potential                 Mr  Chairman  agricultural conservation holds the promise of better stewardship of our agricultural land  and cleaner water and air and more wildlife for everyone   I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today  and thank you again for holding this hearing                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
