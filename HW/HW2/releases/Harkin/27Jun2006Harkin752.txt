        The best thing that can be said about the bill we  re discussing today  S  2754  is that it does no harm   It doesn  t do any good  but it doesn  t do any harm   Otherwise  every activity that  s authorized in this bill is something that NIH can already do              In other words  whether this bill becomes law or whether it fails will have absolutely no impact on the progress of stem cell research            There is one danger to this bill  however   Some opponents of embryonic stem cell research want to use it as a decoy   They  re trying to convince people that they should oppose HR 810 and support this bill instead            That would be a tragic blunder   This bill touts the value of alternative methods of deriving stem cells    not one of which has ever been shown to work in humans   Some haven  t even worked in animals   Right now  they  re just theories   Maybe one day  10 years from now  one of these methods will pan out   But maybe not            Are these methods worth examining   Absolutely   I support any ethical means to improve the lives of human beings who are suffering   In fact  Senator Specter and I included language in our appropriations bill last year urging NIH to support research on derivation methods that don  t involve the destruction of a human embryo            But meanwhile  people we love are dying from Parkinson  s and ALS   Children are suffering from juvenile diabetes   People are losing the ability to walk due to spinal cord injuries   They don  t have 10 years to wait and see if these alternative methods pan out   They need help now            And that  s why our focus needs to be on passing HR 810  not on this bill                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
