                      I am proud to be a part of this important hearing on the wage gap between men and women   It is unbelievable to me that  more than 40 years after passing the Equal Pay Act and the Civil Rights Act  women are still making only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes   We are supposed to be comforted by the fact that the wage gap is shrinking   But  according to the Economic Policy Institute  this is not because women are making more  it is because men are making less                              The Iowa Workforce Development agency has been looking at data for all the jobs in my state   It has found that  across all industries  women are only making 61 8 percent of what men make   In only two industries are they making more than men   in Forestry and Logging and in Transit and Ground Passenger Transportation                           There are various spurious reasons given that women make less than men  such as women self selecting lower paid jobs or having less education   However  I believe that women are making less because we are not properly enforcing current law  and because we do not value jobs we traditionally view as  women s jobs  as we value those we think of as  men s jobs    Why is a housekeeper worth less than a janitor  a parking meter reader worth less than an electrical meter reader  or a social worker worth less than a probation officer                           Without question  we need to do a better job of enforcing the law that requires equal pay for equal work   and we need to stiffen the penalties for violations   That s why I support Senator Clinton s Paycheck Fairness Act  which would help give women the tools they need to identify and confront discrimination head on                         But we also need to be doing more to make sure women are not steered into lower paying job categories   That s why  yesterday  I reintroduced the Fair Pay Act   My bill amends the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex  race or national origin   Most importantly  it requires each individual employer to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill  effort  responsibility and working conditions                              This is strictly about equality and parity   Today  millions of female dominated jobs   for example  social workers  teachers  child care workers  and nurses   are  equivalent  in skills  effort  responsibility and working conditions to similar jobs dominated by men   But the female dominated jobs pay significantly less    According to the American Association of University Women  a typical college educated woman earns  46 000 per year while her male classmates end up making an average of  62 000   That s a difference of  16 000 per year   think for just a moment about what you would do with an extra  16 000 next year                               If you want to read about women living with this kind of discrimination  Evelyn Murphy has a collection of personal stories on her WAGE project website   One such story really outlines the long term problem of gender discrimination   A 53 year old woman wrote                            I started working as a clerk at Bell Telephone Company in 1970 right out of high school  I was making  79 a week  At the time it wasn t bad money  but the guys outside were making  150 a week  and getting time and a half for working overtime                                  Even though her most recent wage has improved  she will be retiring with much less money than her male counterparts because she didn t have as much to invest in savings over the years   And since women tend to live longer after retirement  that exacerbates these inequalities                            My bill would also prohibit companies from reducing other employees  wages to achieve pay equity   It also requires public disclosure of employer job categories and their pay scales  without requiring specific information on individual employees   Moreover  it would allow payment of differential wages under a seniority system  a merit system  or a system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production                             Some say we don t need any more laws  market forces will take care of the wage gap   But  experience shows that there are some injustices that market forces cannot rectify   That is why we passed the Equal Pay Act  the Civil Rights Acts  the Family Medical Leave Act  and the Americans with Disabilities Act                            Mr  Chairman  I d like to share with you the story of a woman from my state named Angie   She was employed as a field office manager at a temp firm   The employees  there  were not allowed to talk about pay with their coworkers   Only inadvertently did she discover that a male office manager at a similar branch  who had less education and experience  was earning more than she was   In this case  the story ended happily   She cited this information in negotiations with her employer  and she was able to get a raise   But the experience left her feeling bewildered and betrayed   And this ultimately led her to quit her job                               I think there is a two fold lesson in this story   The first lesson is that  if we give women information about what their male colleagues are getting  they can negotiate a better deal for themselves in the workplace   The second lesson is that pay discrimination is a harsh reality in the workplace  and it is not only unfair  it is also demoralizing   Individual women should not have to do battle in order to win equal pay   We need more inclusive national laws to make equal pay for equal work a basic standard   and a legal right   in the American workplace                                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
