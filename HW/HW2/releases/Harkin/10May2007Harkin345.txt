            WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  introduced legislation today that offers a comprehensive plan for dealing with the meth crisis in the United States  The Methamphetamine Abuse Treatment and Prevention Act would make strategic investments in programs that are already showing results in both rural and urban communities                             Not only is there a high rate of use of meth in rural areas  the meth epidemic continues to spread across the country and devastate entire families   said Harkin    But  we continue to have hope  because we know that with the proper treatment  meth users can recover and lead productive lives                             Harkin will talk with law enforcement and prevention and treatment advocates in Des Moines and Cedar Rapids on Saturday  May 12 about this new bill and his other efforts to advance the fight against meth                             Meth has been found to be more addictive than crack cocaine or heroin   Nearly 12 million Americans have used methamphetamine  and the number of users increased 72 percent over the past decade   More than 50 percent of meth users started before they turned 18                                 Law enforcement officers across Iowa have told me that prevention and treatment are the keys to stopping this epidemic   said Harkin   Every dollar spent on substance abuse saves taxpayers seven dollars   mostly through lowering the social costs of crime and health care costs   This bill is designed to realize those savings by promoting a comprehensive approach to meth treatment                                 The Harkin bill would remove barriers to treatment and expand access to family  and jail based treatment programs  specifically in underserved areas                            Substance abuse by parents is the culprit in some 70 percent of child welfare spending  yet only 10 percent of child welfare agencies report that they can find substance abuse programs for mothers and children  The Harkin bill would boost family based treatment services  including programs that offer alternatives to incarceration for addicted parents                               The bill would also provide alternatives to jail or detention for non violent juveniles and adults  Nearly 80 percent of jail inmates have had a substance abuse problem  Offering treatment as an alternative to incarceration prevents recidivism and cycling through the criminal justice system                            The Methamphetamine Abuse Treatment and Prevention Act would also provide transitional services for addicts trying to start a new life   Studies have shown that these services are critical to long term abstinence and recovery                           Specifically  the Harkin Bill includes the following provisions                       Family based treatment                          Parental substance abuse is the culprit in at least 70 percent of all child welfare spending  yet only 10 percent of child welfare agencies report that they can successfully find substance abuse programs for mothers and children   Comprehensive treatment specifically for parents can assist them in recovering and providing a safe and nurturing environment for their children  To promote this  the bill                      Provides critical resources for adolescent and family based treatment services with grant programs through Department of Health and Human Services                      Provides grants for states to offer family based treatment for parents as an alternative to jail or detention                        Builds on the innovative work conducted in juvenile courts around the country by authorizing funds for the integrated handling of infant and toddler abuse and neglect cases                              Treatment based alternatives to jail or detention                           Nearly 80 percent of those in jail have been identified as having a substance abuse problem and one third of inmates reported being under the influence at the time of their offense   To prevent recidivism and cycling through the criminal justice system  the bill                           Provides grants for states through the Department of Justice to offer treatment services for nonviolent adults and juveniles as an alternative to jail and detention                      Transitional services                       Assisting with the social  educational  vocational  housing  and mental health needs strengthens treatment programs  supports those in recovery  and ensures long term abstinence  To promote these vital transitional services  the bill                         Creates grant programs administered through the Department of Health and Human Services to provide transitional  community based recovery support services to address educational  vocational  and mental health services for families transitioning out of treatment    Provides for recovery based housing grant programs administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development                         Removing Barriers to Treatment                     Of the 22 million people in need of treatment for substance addiction  less than 3 million are able to get help  both due to lack of access to treatment beds and shortages of treatment staff  especially in rural areas   To help reduce these barriers  the bill                    Provide scholarships to individuals agreeing to offer substance abuse treatment services in rural or underserved areas                   Amend the Institutes for Mental Disease  IMD  exclusion criteria so facilities with less than 32 beds can receive Medicaid reimbursement for services                       Prevention and Research                        Youth are starting to use meth in greater numbers  and more than 50 percent of meth users started before age 18  Given the highly addictive nature of meth  prevention is crucial to stopping this epidemic  The bill provides grant funding for methamphetamine prevention and evaluation efforts                            Creates a helpline for parents and family members and an on line Parent Resource Center to provide live support and guidance on finding intervention and treatment resources                                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
