        This October  as we observe National Disability Employment Awareness Month  it is time to celebrate the very real progress we have made in opening doors of opportunity   But it is also time to acknowledge that at a time when a majority of people with disabilities are not employed  we still have a long way to go to ensure equal opportunity for all Americans   Individuals with disabilities represent one of the largest untapped pools of skills and talents in our country                  Discrimination and negative stereotypes are not just wrong  they are also bad for business   They stand in the way of employers   hiring the best qualified person for a given job    which often is a person with a disability   And they can hurt the bottom line   Bear in mind that  in the United States  some 50 million consumers with disabilities control more than  175 billion in discretionary income and are more likely to support businesses where they feel welcome  Having employees with disabilities    along with accessible stores  products and services    sends a message to customers with disabilities that their business is appreciated                 So here are some things employers can do to ensure individuals with disabilities equal access to employment opportunities               Increase the pool of qualified job applicants by recruiting broadly and advertising in publications and places frequented by people with disabilities     Make sure that job applicants with disabilities receive full and fair consideration    and not just for jobs that conform to stereotypes about people with disabilities    Make reasonable accommodations for employees with disabilities   Often this costs very little or nothing  and resources are available to assist employers in making these accommodations                       If you would like to step up your outreach to current or potential employees with disabilities  you should contact Iowa Vocational Rehabilitation Services at 515 281 4140  Assistance in figuring out accommodations for employees with disabilities is available through the  and the   These organizations have advisers who understand disability issues  and who can help you with accommodation methods  devices  and strategies          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
