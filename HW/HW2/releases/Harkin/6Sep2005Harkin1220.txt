     WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today delivered the following remarks on the Senate floor in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina                The entire nation continues to be focused on the millions of Americans who have been devastated and displaced by Hurricane Katrina   My heart and prayers go out to the individuals and families who have had to endure so much over the last eight days    first the natural disaster of Katrina  and then the unnatural disaster of the delayed and deeply flawed relief effort              Last week  I was in Afghanistan and Pakistan    among other things  meeting with members of the Iowa National Guard who are training units of the new Afghan army   I will have more to report about that trip in coming days   But I wanted to take advantage of this first opportunity to speak publicly about the events surrounding Hurricane Katrina              There is no question that FEMA has failed  and  more broadly  the federal government has failed the people of the Gulf Coast   In other parts of the country that are vulnerable to similar natural disasters or terrorist attacks  Americans are saying    There but for the grace of God  go I    or my city      So it is important that those responsible for this systemic failure be held accountable   And plans and procedures must be put in place to avoid any recurrence of this failure   I will not be the only Senator demanding hearings and rigorous oversight by Congress in the weeks ahead              But  today  we must focus on the immediate and longer term human needs of the people of the Gulf Coast   As ranking member of the Agriculture Committee and of the Labor HHS subcommittee of Appropriations  I will do my part to see that we provide maximum resources for relief and recovery efforts across the Gulf Coast region   For instance  we need to make sure that USDA is able to meet the food needs of the victims  and to assist hard hit agriculture producers   We will also need to extend emergency Medicaid benefits to hundreds of thousands of victims    I intend to work closely with Senators and officials from Louisiana  Mississippi  and Alabama to ensure that their needs are fully met                Indeed  in recent days my staff has been meeting with Senator Landrieu  s staff to share the experience and expertise we gained in wake of widespread flooding in Iowa and back in 1993   At that time  I co chaired a task force    along with Senator Kit Bond of Missouri  whose state was devastated by the same flooding    to identify the types of assistance that would be needed  as well as the best ways to secure that assistance here in Congress as well as in the Executive Branch   I hope that our past experience can provide a roadmap for officials who are responding to this latest disaster                Some of the needed assistance is obvious  beginning with food  shelter  and health care for the victims   But much more will be needed in the months and years ahead  including grants to individuals  loans to small businesses to get them back on their feet  buyouts of homes in frequently flooded areas  funding for community redevelopment  and on and on   As we learned back in 1993  there are other  less obvious forms of assistance that are also critically important  including psychological counseling for people who lost loved ones or who were traumatized by the disaster              I want to salute Governor Tom Vilsack of my State of Iowa for leading a robust response to Katrina   He has ordered our state government to prepare for the potential relocation of up to 5 000 people from the Gulf Coast region  they will be given shelter and assistance in communities all across my state   Gov  Vilsack has also directed the Iowa Department of Public Health to deploy a 30 member team of doctors  nurses  and other health professionals to southeast Louisiana              I say to my fellow Iowans    to all my fellow Americans    our prayers for the victims are important   But  as President Kennedy said   God s work on earth must truly be our own    Each and every one of us can make a difference for the victims of this disaster   There are dozens of organizations  including the Red Cross and the Salvation Army  that are in urgent need of donations and assistance              At times like this  we are reminded that we truly are one American family   And families look out for one another   I have no doubt that people all across this country will continue to open their hearts and be as generous as possible in the days  weeks  and months ahead   Likewise  this Congress will be generous   We will do whatever it takes to help the people of New Orleans and the Gulf Coast put their lives and communities back together                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
