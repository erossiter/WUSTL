                     Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today called for an audit of the nation s food safety system    In a letter to the Inspectors General of the Departments of Agriculture and Health and Human Services   the two agencies charged with monitoring the nation s food and feed supply   Harkin requested the two offices combine efforts for this comprehensive evaluation   He cited the need for the report   the rising number of widespread food contamination events   including the  finding of melamine in pet food which has now been linked to the  human food supply  and media reports out Monday stating the FDA knew for years about contamination problems both at the plant that produced peanut butter adulterated with Salmonella and in the fields that produced the leafy green produce that caused hundreds of food borne illness cases of E  coli O157 H7 late last year                                   From human food borne illnesses linked to spinach  tomatoes  and peanut butter  to kidney failure in companion animals caused by the chemical melamine in pet food  the breakdowns in our nation s food and feed safety system are impacting consumers and producers alike   said Harkin     We must have a comprehensive assessment of the food safety system to learn how we can better protect the United States food supply   I am asking the Inspectors General to evaluate how much oversight the agencies conduct on imported food products  how the agencies are implementing our nation s food safety standards  the adequacy of the response to recent cases of food adulteration  and whether the agencies have the resources and authorities needed to enforce standards throughout the food chain   This evaluation is needed now more than ever to determine how to remedy breakdowns in the system                              The full text of the letter follows                              April 25  2007        The Honorable Daniel  Levinson                                                 Inspector General                                                                        Department of Health and Human Services                                  330 Independence Avenue  S W                                                   Washington  D C  20201                                                                      The Honorable Phyllis Fong                 Inspector General                 Department of Agriculture                12th and Independence Avenue  S W                  Washington  D C                  Room 117 W                                                                                 Washington  D C  20250                            Dear Mr  Levinson and Ms  Fong                           I am concerned about the marked increase in cases of adulteration of food over the past six months   From human food borne illness cases caused by microbial pathogens in spinach  tomatoes  and peanut butter  to kidney failure in companion animals caused by the chemical melamine in pet food  the widespread effects of these events are alarming                                          The most recent developments surrounding the melamine discovery in pet food are especially worrisome   Melamine was found in wheat gluten and rice protein concentrate imported from China and used as ingredients in pet food here in the United States   On April 20  the Food and Drug Administration s chief veterinarian  Dr  Steven Sundlof  suggested in his public statements that the chemical may have been added to the pet food ingredients intentionally by manufacturing establishments in China to artificially boost apparent protein content of products  therefore increasing the price they would receive   On the same day  reports surfaced that a farm in California fed its hogs the recalled pet food  and that the resulting food products produced had entered the human food supply                          Taken together  all of the recent recalls of human and pet food raise serious questions about protocols in place now at FDA that are supposed to prevent and respond to contamination of our nation s food and feed supply   The Department of Agriculture  USDA  also ensures the safety of our nation s food supply  and  while the safety of the food products it regulates have not experienced the same level of problems recently  it would be appropriate to include the Department in a comprehensive audit of our nation s food safety system    I also request that you evaluate the adequacy of the response to recent cases of food adulteration   Your offices should also evaluate the following issues and make recommendations on how enforcement or performance in each issue area can be improved                         1    Equivalency   Countries that would like to export food to the United States are required by law to produce that food with food safety standards and inspections that are equivalent to those implemented and enforced by USDA and FDA                  a        How is equivalency determined by FDA and USDA                            b       How frequently do FDA and USDA personnel evaluate or audit companies that export products to the United States                     c        Is the protocol for determining equivalency adequate to ensure feed and food products are safe for American consumers                                2    Imports   The pet food recall has highlighted the problems our nation faces with increasing imports and the inability of U S  food safety agencies to keep up with the number and variety of foods coming in from foreign countries   The possible intentional aspect of the recent pet food contamination also brings up many questions about whether the United States has the resources to detect the adulteration of imported food or feed                              a        Are imported food and feed currently sampled for chemicals and microbial pathogens to verify whether foreign countries are enforcing safety standards equivalent to those in the United States   If not  why not  and are there reasons such a sampling regimen should not or could not be implemented to avoid future incidents                        3    Inspections   Media reports and consumer groups cite declining inspections and audits of food establishments even as the number of domestic food producing establishments and foreign food imports increase in number                           a        How often are facilities that produce meat  poultry and food products inspected or audited   How does the frequency compare to 10 years ago   What is the volume of products inspected by FDA and USDA each year                            b       Are the number of inspections and audits that facilities receive adequate to ensure a safe food and feed supply                            c        How frequently do FDA and USDA evaluate on farm food safety practices                         d       Do FDA and USDA have adequate funding required to improve the frequency of inspections                               4    Pet food recall   It is reported that a portion of the recently recalled pet food was fed to hogs in a farming operation in California   These animals were slaughtered and used to produce food for human consumption  when the discovery was made  a recall was implemented to recover the human food products                         a        When pet food is recalled  what procedures does FDA have to prevent other animals  especially food animals  from being fed the product  Does FDA issue a feed alert warning to producers not to use recalled pet food in animal feed                             b       Did FDA or USDA conduct any testing for melamine in human food immediately after the finding in pet food ingredients           5    Timeline   Reports from FDA have surfaced indicating that the agency knew about the presence of microbial pathogens in peanut butter and leafy greens for many years  but took no steps to address these problems                      a        Was FDA s response adequate measures following its initial findings of pathogens in the food supply to ensure the food product was safe from adulteration   If not  what  procedures should have been taken                            6    Response   FDA and USDA have procedures in place to respond to the discovery of adulterated food and feed                         a        After each discovery of suspected adulterated food in the past 12 months  what has been the adequacy of each agency s response procedures                           7    Coordination   During the recent high profile cases of food adulteration  has there been adequate coordination between FDA and USDA in response and prevention                             8    Funding   Is funding adequate at FDA and USDA to undertake the number of inspections and audits that should be taking place to maintain a safe food supply                               9    Authorities   In any respect does either FDA or USDA lack legal authority it requires to implement and enforce food safety standards throughout the feed and food chain  from the farm on through food processing establishments  and including imported food and feed                             It is imperative that these issues be evaluated immediately  not only for our domestically produced food and feed supply  but especially in light of our increasing imports from countries  such as China in the most recent case  which unfortunately may not have in place the same food safety standards as the United States                         I appreciate your help in evaluating how the agencies have handled these incidents and threats to the safety of our food and feed supplies   Please contact Adela Ramos on my staff at  202  224 6917 should you have any further questions
