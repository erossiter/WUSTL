 WASHINGTON  D C  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  made the following remarks today during the presentation of the Congressional Gold Medal to Iowa native Dr  Norman Borlaug   Madam Speaker  President Bush  Majority Leader Reid  Dr  Borlaug  and distinguished guests    Iowans are a humble people  But we are very  very proud of the long line of Iowans who have been extraordinary leaders in bringing food to a hungry world  people like Herbert Hoover  Henry C  Wallace  Henry A  Wallace  and  first and foremost  Dr  Norman Borlaug    When I think of Dr  Borlaugs achievements  I am reminded of those famous words in the Book of Proverbs  Where there is no vision  the people perish  More than a half century ago  Dr  Borlaug surveyed a world where starvation and malnourishment were rampant  And he had a vision  a vision of a Green Revolution    Because of that vision and because of Dr  Borlaugs tireless commitment to that vision  the people did not perish  Upwards of one billion lives have been saved across the world    Not bad for a farm boy from Cresco  Iowa  Not bad for a kid who began his education in a one room rural schoolhouse   I think of Dr  Borlaug and the other three living Americans who won the Nobel Prize for Peace  Elie Wiesel  Henry Kissinger  and Jimmy Carter  All extraordinary individuals  But none of their accomplishments can match the impact of Dr  Borlaug  which is just staggering in its dimension    Many in this room see Norman Borlaug as a great scientist  a great agronomist  a great humanitarian  I see a great persuader  a man who  time and again  overcame political and cultural challenges in order to spread his revolution first in Asia  then in South America  and now in Africa   The good news is that Dr  Borlaug is still going strong  still curious and creative  still full of dreams for changing the world  And we wish him every success    Dr  Borlaug  you are a great American and a true son of Iowa  We honor you  and we thank you       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
