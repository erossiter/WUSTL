        It is critical we restore beef and cattle trade with our trading partners  but we must do it right   Unfortunately  USDA  s rule is flawed in several respects that need to be addressed   To our new Secretary of Agriculture  s credit  he swiftly recognized at least one of these significant shortcomings  and delayed USDA  s proposal to allow shipment of Canadian beef from cattle over 30 months of age into the U S   USDA  s ill considered approach would have resulted in significant economic hardships for many U S  beef packers  particularly those that slaughter culled dairy cows as their primary business   Secretary Johanns recognized this  and I commend him for his quick response              Further recognizing the shortcomings of USDA  s rule  the U S  District Court for the District of Montana has granted the Ranchers Cattlemen Action Legal Fund  United Stockgrowers of America  s  R CALF  request for a preliminary injunction barring USDA  s minimal risk rule from taking effect   This is the second time that USDA has lost in court on this issue            While we still await the judge  s rationale for this decision  I believe the unfortunate reality here is that USDA has largely dug its own hole by failing to follow U S  legal procedure and scientific guidelines in its rule for further reopening U S  markets to Canadian cattle and beef    Sadly  it is U S  producers and processors that bear the brunt of USDA  s failings               I have been concerned that USDA  s final minimal risk rule strays from the World Animal Health Organization  s  OIE  scientific guidelines in important respects              Specifically  USDA has crafted minimal risk criteria that are weaker than OIE standards specify   For instance  USDA  s rule does not spell out what is required to have an effective ruminant to ruminant feed ban  an effective BSE surveillance plan  or require a compulsory reporting and investigation system   In fact  USDA seems to have purposefully dropped elements of the OIE guidelines that might have required the U S  to classify Canada as a moderate risk country for BSE instead of minimal risk            At an Agriculture Committee hearing on these issues  USDA attempted to explain these discrepancies by stating that there are redundancies among the several types of measures against BSE  and therefore if a country is weaker in one measure it might compensate in another measure   However  in the case of Canada  USDA has failed to set forth what measures Canada might be stronger in that warrant allowing slippage in others                 I am fully aware that these concerns about Canada are relevant to our own systems here in the United States for preventing and detecting the incidence of BSE   Since we first discovered BSE in this country  I have questioned the efficacy of both our restrictions on feeding ruminant byproducts and our BSE surveillance plan   I do not believe there are grave problems that threaten human health   But I do believe there are areas where we need improvement  such as enforcement of our own feed rules and the effectiveness of our surveillance efforts             Ultimately  we need to come to a common agreement with our beef and cattle trading partners regarding an acceptable framework for classifying a country  s risk of BSE   If USDA designates a minimal risk region for trading that does not stand up to the scientific principles that are established by OIE  we will hinder those efforts to reopen markets            It is a sadly ironic footnote to this debate that  were USDA to correct the deficiencies in its rule  it would not prevent any of the Canadian cattle or beef products that USDA has proposed to allow from entering the United States   It would simply necessitate that some additional safeguards be put into place            Unfortunately  USDA has turned a deaf ear to these valid concerns about the rule  and that is why we find ourselves here today   I hope USDA is listening to today  s debate and will take these concerns more seriously   Our objective here today is not to shut down trade indefinitely  but rather to obtain the needed changes in the rule to facilitate the restoration of safe trade in cattle and beef products with countries that have experienced BSE   And that includes reopening now closed markets for U S  beef exports             I urge my colleagues to approve this resolution                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
