    WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   the ranking Democrat on the Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations Subcommittee  made the following statement today at a hearing on the Sago Mine Disaster and Mine Safety               Thank you  Mr  Chairman  and thank you for hosting this hearing   I want to also thank Senator Byrd for requesting this hearing                     Over the years  I have listened to Senator Byrd speak eloquently about the mining communities of West Virginia   I know that there is no greater advocate for the families of miners  no more dedicated a public servant to the people of West Virginia than Senator Robert C  Byrd   So I thank him today for requesting this hearing  but also for the dedication I know he will show in the weeks to come  as everyone struggles to find answers   I know he will continue to hold the focus of Congress on this important matter and for that  we should all be grateful               Although I am far from the first  I offer my sincere condolences to the families of the fallen miners  Thomas P  Anderson  Alva Martin Bennett  Jim Bennett  Jerry Groves  George Hamner Jr   Terry Helms  Jesse L  Jones  David Lewis  Martin Toler  Fred Ware Jr   Jack Weaver  and Marshall Winans   And now the grieving begins again for Don Israel Bragg and Ellery Hatfield  whose bodies were found on Saturday in the Logan County fire   As the son of a coal miner myself  your families remain in my thoughts and prayers along with a heartfelt wish that Randall McCloy continue to heal                  I realize that the Sago investigation is not yet complete and I expect a new investigation to begin on the fire in Aracoma Mine   Still  I think it is important that we in Congress address this situation swiftly   While the investigations continue  miners are risking their lives to go down into the mines  and families are silently praying every second their loved ones are below ground   We owe it to them to do everything in our power to make a dangerous occupation as safe as humanly possible             The Mine Safety Health Administration is the agency we rely on to keep miners safe   Period   The mission of the agency is not to increase coal production    we trust the marketplace to do that   The mission of MSHA is to ensure that miners are safe   The purpose of this hearing is to ask if MSHA is fulfilling that mission to the very best of their ability                 To that end  I want to know if we are adequately enforcing the Mine Safety Health Act   I want to know if 1960  s era technology is truly the best we can offer miners today   I want to know if this country has enough mine rescue teams and if they are close enough to reach trapped miners in time  The question I pose to all of the witnesses is simply  Have we done everything in our power to keep miners safe              With that  I yield to my distinguished colleague  Senator Byrd of West Virginia            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
