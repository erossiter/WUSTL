 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced on the Senate floor his opposition to the nomination of Attorney General nominee Judge Michael Mukasey  Among other reasons  Harkin was most disappointed with Mukaseys refusal to denounce torturous practices such as waterboarding and electric shocks  and his failure to recommend closing the Guantanamo Bay detention facility  even though Republican officials like former Secretary of State Colin Powell and Defense Secretary Robert Gates have agreed it should be shut down      Over the last six years  this Administration has shown it believes it can ignore the law  can eavesdrop on Americans without a warrant  and can indefinitely detain citizens without access to counsel or judicial review said Harkin  Unfortunately  on these fundamental issues  Judge Mukasey has expressed a troubling view of unchecked executive power that make him unfit to be an objective check on the power of the Bush Administration      Senator Tom Harkins AS PREPARED statement follows      Mr  President  despite the many positive attributes of Judge Mukasey  I cannot support his nomination for Attorney General   The next Attorney General must be more than a capable steward of the Department of Justice  Given this Administrations disdain for the rule of law  it is imperative that the next Attorney General be a strong and independent voice for a return to the very basic principle that we are a government of laws and not of men  Regrettably  I do not believe that Judge Mukasey will be that voice   Over the last six years  this Administration  supported by faulty legal opinions from the Justice Department  has claimed that it can ignore acts of Congress  This President has argued that despite the fact that since 1978 the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act has been the law of the land  he has the authority to eavesdrop on American citizens without a warrant or court review  This Administration believes that it can seize American citizens on American soil  and indefinitely detain them without charges  without providing the accused access to counsel  or without judicial review  The President believes he can utilize interrogation techniques long considered immoral  ineffective and illegal  regardless of the laws and treaties Congress has approved   As Justice Sandra Day OConnor wrote  however   a  state of war is not a blank check for the President when it comes to the rights of the nations citizens  At a time when this nation needs an Attorney General who will stand up for the rule of law  Judge Mukasey has expressed a troubling view of unchecked executive power  For example  Judge Mukasey asserted that the President can violate Congressional statutes where the President claims broad authority to defend the nation  Judge Mukasey has refused to answer whether he believes American citizens detained by the President have the right to habeas corpus  a right that goes back to the Magna Carta almost 800 years   Like many of my colleagues  moreover  I am deeply troubled by Judge Mukaseys well known refusal to assert that waterboarding  a practice which simulates death by real drowning  is illegal  Sadly  he also refused to answer that other terrible practices which this Administration has used are illegal  These include electrical shocks  beatings  the use of dogs  forcing prisoners to stand naked  and induced hypothermia   Let there be no misunderstanding  whether waterboarding is illegal is not a difficult question  Simply because this Administration believes it has the inherent authority to ignore the law and has consistently distorted the meaning of the word torture does not mean that Congress has not made clear that practices like waterboarding are prohibited   The Senate has repeatedly made clear  going back at least to the Senates ratification of the Geneva Convention in 1955  that torture is a violation of our highest values and is simply not permitted  In 2005  the Senate adopted the McCain amendment  by a vote of 90 9  That amendment reaffirmed that cruel  degrading or inhumane treatment of detainees was prohibited  Last year  the Military Commissions Act  which I opposed because it eliminated the right of habeas corpus  again expressly made clear that the President is bound by the prohibitions against cruel  inhuman and degrading treatment of prisoners   Nor can there be any question that waterboarding  a horrific practice going back to the Spanish Inquisition  is prohibited  As Senator McCain has described it  it is a very exquisite torture  Rear Admiral John Hutson  former Judge Advocate General of the Navy  has testified that other than  perhaps the rack and thumbscrews  water boarding is the most iconic example of torture in history  He added   i t has been repudiated for centuries  Going back to the Spanish American War and including World War II  the U S  military has brought charges against those who practice this terrible technique  In adopting the Military Commission Act  many Senators made quite clear that interrogation techniques like waterboarding are illegal and constitute grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions   Given the law  it is disappointing that an esteemed judge with the highest reputation in our legal community would not unequivacably state that of course waterboarding is both torture and illegal  It was not a difficult question and a question any serious candidate for attorney general should answer   I am also greatly troubled by Judge Mukaseys refusal to commit to recommend to the President that the detention center at Guantanamo Bay be closed  Judge Mukasey has acknowledged that there are substantial problems with Guantanamo  both problems of reality and problems of perceptions  If he truly believes that  it is troubling that he was not willing to join Secretary of Defense Gates and former Secretary of State Powell in recommending that it be closed   Issues like torture and Guantanamo Bay are personal for me  I have seen first hand the terrible damage to our reputation and our war efforts that result when we do not live up to our highest principles  In 1970  as a staff assistant to a committee in the House of Representatives  I traveled to Vietnam  There  I saw  and brought back photographs of the so called tiger cages at Con Son Island  off the coast of Vietnam  where Viet Cong and some North Vietnamese prisoners  were held  incommunicado  tortured and killed  with the full knowledge  support  and sanction of the United States  all in clear violation of the Geneva Convention   I saw then the damage to done our reputation  And  I am seeing the same damage done today by this Administration  Practices that certainly rise to the level of torture  as well as the continued operation at the detention center at Guantanamo Bay  which I have introduced legislation to close  have hurt our ability to wage an effective fight against the terrorists who attacked us on September 11  2001  They are used in our enemys recruiting efforts and are used by those who wish ill will to our brave soldiers  We need an attorney general who is committed to bringing an end to these stains on our nations honor  and I am  sadly  not convinced Judge Mukasey is that person   Mr  President  the lawlessness in the Executive Branch must end  Because I cannot be confident  however  that Judge Mukasey will provide the necessary check on the excesses of the Administration  I regrettably cannot support this nomination
