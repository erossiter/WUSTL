        We can do a much better job in protecting Americans from the dangers of contaminated or unsafe meat  poultry and other foods      Harkin said     Part of the problem is that USDA and FDA don  t have the tools they need to enforce basic food safety standards   This bill would change that               Specifically  the bill would do the following            Mandatory Recall  USDA and FDA do not presently have the authority to order unsafe meat  poultry and other foods off the market   It must negotiate each recall   This bill gives the Secretary of Agriculture and the FDA Administrator the authority to mandate a recall if a company fails to voluntarily recall unsafe or contaminated food    While most companies willingly comply with a recall request  the negotiation of a recall can take  time and there have been unjustified delays   To assure that recalls are swift and complete  and that all relevant parties are notified  the USDA and FDA must be able to set the terms of a recall when a company is reluctant to pull unsafe products off the shelves               Civil Penalties  The Secretary of Agriculture currently has authority to levy fines for violations of the Pecan Promotion Act  and for laws that protect circus animals  but not for violations of food safety laws  The only power the Secretary currently has is to withdraw inspection and shut down the plant  putting workers who are not at fault out of work  This drastic remedy is very seldom resorted to  even in the face of serious violations   Harkin  s bill provides authority to USDA and FDA to set a scale of civil penalties appropriate to the severity of the violation   Civil penalties can be applied more quickly than criminal penalties  and are more appropriate for certain violations in the food inspection and safety system   Harkin  s bill would allow civil penalties to be tailored to fit repeated and willful violations of food safety laws               Many times a violation is not bad enough to require shutting a plant down or seizing its product     Harkin said     We have companies out there with long histories of repeated violations and we should penalize these repeat offenders  This bill allows for such common sense penalties               Mandatory Notification  The bill would require all plants  companies  and distributors throughout the food processing system to notify USDA and FDA if they have reason to believe that meat  poultry or other food products are contaminated                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
