                  WASHINGTON D C    In a letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  called on the U S  State Department to allow Government Accountability Office  GAO  staff members to spend up to six months in Baghdad to conduct oversight of the United States Government s reconstruction efforts in Iraq  Twenty one Democratic Senators joined Harkin in sending the letter  which specifically expressed serious concern about reports the agency has refused to grant GAO officials the access necessary to monitor how reconstruction funding is being spent                              Congress did not write a blank check for spending in Iraq   Harkin said   We need to know funds are being used appropriately  which is what the GAO will do  Such access is essential to ending the misuse of taxpayer funds that have been repeatedly documented in Iraq                            Pointing to reports of rampant waste  fraud  and abuse  both in the Iraqi ministries and among U S  contractors  the Senators said  GAO s longer term presence in Baghdad is essential to providing Congress with direct and continuing oversight over U S  programs and activities                           Although the State Department has facilitated several short term  two  and three weeks  visits for GAO teams in the past  the agency s longer term presence in Baghdad is essential to providing Congress with direct and continuing oversight over U S  programs and activities                           American taxpayers are currently being asked to spend approximately  3 240 every second and  280 million per day in Iraq   Accordingly  it is imperative that GAO be given the access it needs to serve as the eyes and ears of the United States Congress as we continue our efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces  provide these forces with a more robust logistics capability  build Iraqi ministry capacity  and restore essential services such as water and electricity   wrote the lawmakers                           The GAO is charged by Congress with investigating the programs and expenditures of the federal government  Congress relies on the agency to monitor and report on U S  efforts in Iraq  and has called upon GAO to brief members on these critical issues and testify at multiple hearings                             To date  the U S  Congress has appropriated approximately  379 billion for Iraq operations  By comparison  the U S  spent approximately  205 billion in World War I  in inflation adjusted dollars                   The complete text of the letter is pasted below                          March 12  2007                    The Honorable Condoleezza Rice                   Secretary of State                 Department of State                2201 C Street NW             Washington  DC 20520                 Dear Madam Secretary                     We are writing to express our concern about reports that the Department of State is impeding the ability of the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to conduct effective oversight of the United States Government s reconstruction efforts in Iraq   Specifically  we are told that the State Department has refused to grant GAO the access the agency needs to effectively monitor how reconstruction funding is being spent   Such access is essential to ending the misuse of taxpayer funds that have been repeatedly documented in Iraq   We ask that you give this matter your prompt attention                       As you know  since 2003 the United States Congress has appropriated billions of dollars to stabilize and rebuild Iraq   Unfortunately  there have been numerous reports that large amounts of this funding have been stolen or squandered   Special Inspector General for Iraq  Stuart Bowen  testified earlier this year that  waste  fraud  and abuse are rampant both in the Iraqi ministries and among U S  contractors                        The Government Accountability Office is the agency charged by Congress with investigating the programs and expenditures of the federal government   The Congress relies on GAO to monitor and report on U S  efforts in Iraq  and has called upon GAO to brief members on these critical issues and testify at multiple hearings   To help Congress better monitor the expenditure of these funds  GAO has been negotiating with the Departments of State and Defense the details of establishing a steady oversight presence in Baghdad    Specifically  GAO has requested State and DOD approval  country clearance  for three auditors to be allowed on a rotating basis to spend up to 6 months in Baghdad   We have been recently informed that the Department of Defense has approved GAO s request                           Unfortunately  we have been informed that the State Department has not yet granted this request for country clearance   Although the departments of Defense and State have facilitated several short term  2 3 week  visits for GAO teams in the past  GAO s longer term presence in Baghdad is essential to providing Congress with direct and continuing oversight over U S  programs and activities                             American taxpayers are currently being asked to spend approximately  3 240 every second and  280 million per day in Iraq   Accordingly  it is imperative that GAO be given the access it needs to serve as the eyes and ears of the United States Congress as we continue our efforts to train and equip Iraqi security forces  provide these forces with a more robust logistics capability  build Iraqi ministry capacity  and restore essential services such as water and electricity                            We appreciate your attention to this matter and look forward to your timely response                       Sincerely                                                Tom Harkin                                                                              United States Senator
