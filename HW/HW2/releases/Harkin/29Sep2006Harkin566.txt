         WASHINGTON  D C     Continuing his efforts to reduce America  s dependence on foreign oil  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  along with Senator Richard Lugar  R IA  today introduced legislation that would direct the U S  Department of Energy to study the feasibility of transporting ethanol by pipeline from the Midwest to the East and West coasts  where demand is growing          Given the increasing ethanol demand  there may be economic benefits to transporting ethanol through dedicated pipelines  However  such a dedicated system could take a decade or more to build   Therefore it is important to study the issue and begin the planning process now  As ranking member of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry Committee  Harkin has led the Senate  s efforts to boost ethanol and bio fuels production            With the ethanol production and demand both on the rise  we need an accurate and fair analysis of the potential to distribute ethanol around the country by pipeline     said Harkin    We continue to hear comments that it can  t but done efficiently  but it is happening right now in Brazil  The goal of this bill is to examine the issue and get all the facts on the table             Creating a dedicated pipeline system could enable Iowa  s ethanol producers to deliver their products to states with a growing demand  like California  New York  and Pennsylvania  at a lower cost  Ethanol use has increased by more than 20 percent annually over the past several years and a number of studies estimate that ethanol could account for 20 to 30 percent or more of America  s transportation fuel in the future            Developing ways to increase the availability and use of ethanol nationwide will decrease American  s dangerous dependence on foreign oil  give a boost to the rural economy and improve environmental quality     Harkin added          Harkin has been a longtime advocate of expanding production of ethanol and other farm based renewable fuels   Harkin was instrumental in establishing a renewable fuels standard  RFS  through last year  s energy bill which ensures that 7 5 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel will be produced and used annually by 2012   More recently  Harkin introduced The Biofuels Security Act  a comprehensive plan to increase production and use of biofuels  The legislation would require that nearly every new vehicle sold in the United States be flex fuel within 10 years  establish a new  more aggressive RFS and provide for expanded E 85 fueling infrastructure                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
