 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today joined a bipartisan group of Senators in introducing legislation to reverse a controversial Supreme Court ruling that narrowed employee rights to sue over employment discrimination  Specifically  the Fair Pay Restoration Act addresses the Supreme Courts decision in Ledbetter vs  Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co  that Lilly M  Ledbetter  a supervisor at the Goodyear Tire plant  could not sue for pay discrimination because she did not file her claim within 180 days of her pay being set   The Supreme Courts recent ruling in the Ledbetter case ignored the realities of the workplace and placed illogical restrictions on womens ability to fight for the pay they deserve  This legislation will ensure that the Supreme Courts mistake does not hinder women from fighting for fair compensation  Harkin said  Given the fact that women still earn only 77 cents for every dollar a man makes  it is imperative that women have the right to challenge their employers for fair pay   The legislation clarifies the Civil Rights Acts statute requiring cases be filed within 180 days after the alleged unlawful employment practice occurred  Specifically  the bill classifies each pay check in which an employee is unfairly paid as a new act of discrimination  Therefore  employees would have 180 days after their last pay check in which to sue for fair compensation  Given the secrecy of pay scales in the workplace  this clarification is crucial to ensuring employees right to petition for fair compensation does not expire before they have the opportunity to discover they are being discriminated against   Senators Joe Biden  D DE   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Chris Dodd  D CT   Dick Durbin  D IL   Diane Feinstein  D CA   John Kerry  D MA   Patrick Leahy  D DE   Claire McCaskill  D MO   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Patty Murray  D WA   Barack Obama  D IL   Jack Reed  D RI   Bernie Sanders  I VT   Olympia Snowe  R ME   Arlen Specter  R PA   Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Sheldon Whitehouse  D RI  also co sponsored this legislation   A long time champion of fair pay for women  Harkin also recently introduced the Fair Pay Act  This legislation would address the historic pattern of undervaluing and underpaying so called womens jobs  The bill requires the disclosure of pay scales and rates for all job categories at a company  without personally identifying information  This would make it easier for a woman to learn of pay discrimination closer to the date she begins working for an organization  enhancing her ability to advocate for better pay       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
