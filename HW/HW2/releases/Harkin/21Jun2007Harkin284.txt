 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today detailed some of his priorities for the rural development title of the 2007 farm bill in his weekly press call with agriculture reporters  Following is the text of his opening remarks   Yesterday  the Washington Post ran the latest in a series of articles spotlighting inequities in the distribution of funds under USDAs farm commodity and other programs  The story profiled the extremely poor community of Shelby  Mississippi  where most of the residents are African American  This community desperately needs funds for rural economic development  But while the surrounding county has received  200 million in crop subsidies over the last five years  almost all of it going to very large farms  it received just a tiny fraction of that amount in USDA Rural Development grants   This is a deeply disturbing story  And it demonstrates exactly why we need a more balanced  reform minded farm bill that meets the broader needs of rural America  Bear in mind that the farm bill is the single most important piece of legislation for improving the quality of life and economic vitality of our rural communities  I remind you that the full title of the current farm bill is the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002   Today  in Iowa and elsewhere  rural communities face enormous challenges  In many places  the loss of population and jobs has created a negative cycle that feeds on itself  In the new farm bill  we have a real opportunity to help reverse this negative dynamic    First and foremost  ramping up production of biofuels and other alternative energy sources will continue to be a major shot in the arm to the rural economy  We can also do much more   We need to continue the value added product development grants  These grants have been very successful in encouraging rural business ventures to add value to farm commodities and products  whether for energy or for a whole host of other products    Likewise  we need a strong venture capital program to jump start investment in new  job creating enterprises in rural communities   I want to provide some  500 million for a new Rural Collaborative Investment Program  which will support clusters of communities that come together to plan and implement regional economic development strategies   I propose to expand broadband access not just to rural towns but also into the countryside  In the 21st century  high speed internet access is a basic  essential utility  Farmers and others need it to do business  Students in rural America need it to do their homework and connect to the rest of the world  So  just as we made a commitment to rural electrification in the 1930s  today we need a commitment to connecting rural America to the internet   Rural America also needs better access to other amenities and necessities that people in cities take for granted  The farm bill needs to offer loans and grants to encourage the construction of new day care facilities for children  and assisted living facilities for seniors  We need to give rural hospitals assistance in purchasing modern equipment  We need to assist rural communities in improving infrastructure  including electricity  clean drinking water  and wastewater treatment    Currently  there are some  2 billion in outstanding applications for water and wastewater improvements  I propose to provide enough funding in the farm bill to cut the number of unfunded applications in half   The bottom line  In the rural development title and in all the other titles  we need a forward looking  reform farm bill  not a farm bill that is looking in the rear view mirror  And  in the Senate  we are well on our way to doing that        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
