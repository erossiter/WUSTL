                  WASHINGTON  D C    In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today urged USDA to modify its federal crop insurance program so that farmers do not miss deadlines during weather or other similar emergencies   Last week  farmers across Iowa and other parts of rural America struggled to meet the sales deadline for the federal program after winter storms caused power outages and hampered travel   Harkin is the Chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry Committee                         It is unfair that farmers already reeling from tough winter storms then had to scramble to gather enough information to make coverage decisions in time to meet the deadline   said Harkin                               After hearing from farmers  Harkin s office contacted USDA s Risk Management Agency  RMA  to request an extension of the sales deadline of a few weeks for counties affected by the storms   Harkin s office was told the agency did not have the authority to extend the date                                   USDA should have the authority to extend the sales deadline in circumstances like these and should provide information on this program in enough time for farmers to plan for the year ahead   said Harkin    I ask the USDA to work with us to modify the federal crop insurance program so that we can avoid these problems next year                                 The letter is pasted below                        Dear Mr  Secretary                              The severe snowstorms that raced through the Midwest a few weeks ago magnified a problem in the crop insurance program which can and should be addressed in some way by this time next year                          Power outages and the inability to travel raised questions whether agents and policyholders would be able to complete their decisions on crop insurance coverage prior to the March 15th sales closing date                                    The potential seriousness of this disruption was compounded by the fact that price information for the crop insurance revenue policies was released to private crop insurance companies  agents  and farmers only in early March   so farmers did not have the full information needed to make their decisions until late in the process   One Iowa agent estimated that as of late February  95 percent of his customers had not yet finalized their crop insurance plans for 2007                                 In the wake of the storms  my staff  along with the Iowa Secretary of Agriculture Bill Northey  asked the Administrator of USDA s Risk Management Agency  RMA   Mr  Eldon Gould  to extend the sales closing date in affected counties by a few weeks   We were informed that he did not believe he had the authority to do so under current law   Fortunately  in this instance  I understand that power was restored and the roads were cleared quickly enough for farmers and agents to meet the March 15th deadline                                       RMA should take steps to avoid similar problems in the future   For example  RMA could release price election information on revenue policies earlier in the cycle  thus giving farmers more time to make decisions ahead of the sales closing date   Another option would be to modify the Federal Crop Insurance Act to allow you and future Secretaries of Agriculture to extend the sales closing date under exigent circumstances  perhaps when a given county is declared a disaster area by competent authorities within two weeks before that date for reasons of adverse weather                                         I welcome your views on potential administrative or legislative changes  with the hope that we can act to help farmers in emergency situations but still protect the integrity of the federal crop insurance program   Please direct questions to Stephanie Mercier of the Committee staff  at 224 0014                     Sincerely                       Tom Harkin                       Chairman                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
