 We have known for a long time that this Administration has contempt for the Constitution and the rule of law  but todays action by the President to intervene to save a high ranking member of his Administration  who was found by a jury to have broken the law and obstructed justice  on behalf of the Vice President  is a new low  It shows that this President believes there is one set of rules for his friends  and another set for everyone else   The actions of Scooter Libby that led to this conviction were undertaken to attack critics who dared to speak the truth about the Administrations lies to build the case for the war in Iraq  With his decision today  the President has shown that he stands squarely behind those actions   The American people believe that government officials should be held to a higher standard  President Bush believes that his cronies should be held to no standard at all       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
