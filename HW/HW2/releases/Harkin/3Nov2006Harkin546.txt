        Thanks to the efforts of human services workers like those in Dubuque County  some of the worst effects of a challenging economy have been blunted     said Harkin     But challenges remain  Since 2000  rates of hunger and food insecurity in the U S  have increased dramatically  With nearly 40 million Americans experiencing food insecurity each year  federal assistance programs are more important than ever to promote family economic security  The work of local human services offices like Dubuque County are at the forefront of this effort and play a vital role in helping families deal with difficult economic conditions  I commend the Dubuque County Department of Human Services for their outstanding contribution             Despite local efforts and federal food assistance programs  national hunger rates continue to rise  due in part to a lackluster economy for those at lower  and middle class income levels  Hunger and food insecurity data for the United States is compiled annually by the U S  Department of Agriculture and shows that from 1999 to 2004  the most recent year for which data is available  the number of Americans experiencing food insecurity increased by approximately 7 million individuals  from 31 million to 38 2 million  This includes 13 9 million children  or nearly one fifth of all children  and over 24 million adults  The report also indicates African American and Hispanic families are disproportionately affected  with food insecurity approximately double the national average in such households          Harkin is the ranking Democratic on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry and a long time advocate for federal food assistance programs  including the Food Stamp Program  the WIC Program  and the National School Lunch Program  among others                                                                                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
