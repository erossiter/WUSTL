        Today  the House sponsors have come to the Senate to symbolically pass the baton to Senator Specter and me and the other cosponsors of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   It is our job to carry this bill in the last leg of the race   We accept the challenge and responsibility   And we intend to win this race     Harkin said     Make no mistake  for millions of Americans with potentially curable or treatable diseases    including Parkinson  s  juvenile diabetes  and ALS    this is a race   They can  t wait any longer for our top scientists to realize the full potential of stem cell research             The Specter Harkin Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is designed to expand the current federal funding policy for stem cell research   The legislation would allow federal funding for stem cell research using stem cell lines derived under strict ethical requirements from excess in vitro fertilization embryos  regardless of the date they were derived          All 22 stem cell lines currently available under the President  s policy are contaminated with mouse cells  making them dangerous to use in humans  Since August 2001  scientists have made great advances in deriving stem cell lines   Many of the new lines were grown without mouse feeder cells   None of the additional lines would require the creation of new embryos   Instead  these lines could be derived from any of the more than 400 000 embryos that are left over from fertility treatments    embryos that would otherwise be discarded              We don  t require our astronomers to explore the heavens with 19th century telescopes  and we don  t require our geologists to study the Earth with a tape measure   If we are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research  our biomedical researchers need access to the best stem cell lines available     Harkin said     The President  s approach is not a way forward  it is a dead end   It offers only false hope to people with potentially curable or treatable diseases   We need a policy that offers real hope to these patients and their loved ones   Our task in the Senate is to pass the exact same bill as the House  without amendments  so we can send it to the President  s desk without delay             Other original co sponsors of the legislation include   Orrin Hatch  R UT   Dianne Feinstein  D CA   Gordon H  Smith  R OR   and Edward M  Kennedy  D MA                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
