            I would like to welcome everyone here this morning for a hearing on global health   We have a distinguished panel of witnesses from the Department of Health and Human Services  headed of course by Secretary Michael Leavitt                           Senator Inouye  D HI  once said that the Defense Subcommittee is the one that defends America  but it is this Subcommittee that defines America   I believe that s true not only within our own country  but throughout the world   When this Subcommittee funds programs to end child labor abroad  or fight diseases overseas  or improve health conditions in developing countries  it shows the world the best side of America                        In no case is that clearer than global health   For the last few years  this Subcommittee has taken the lead on funding to prevent and prepare for a possible pandemic influenza   Since 2005  we have appropriated over  6 billion to upgrade our nation s public health system  deploy epidemiologists around the world  and develop a credible vaccine supply                         But this Subcommittee was engaged in global health long before H5N1 flu came onto the scene   In the last five years  Senator Specter and I have worked to fund efforts to prepare against SARS  severe acute respiratory syndrome   bioterrorism and smallpox   This Subcommittee also appropriates money every year to the Global Fund to Fight AIDS  TB and Malaria                             When we fight diseases abroad  we are  of course  protecting our own country as well   After all  it only takes one person on a plane to bring a deadly disease from halfway across the world to within our own borders                        But global health is about much more than protecting Americans from deadly diseases   It s also about providing basic public health infrastructure for developing nations  and training researchers and epidemiologists to strengthen the health systems in those countries   And it is about working collaboratively on studies that can benefit people all over the world                      I want to describe just one example of a great global partnership that this Subcommittee was very involved in  the US China Collaborative on folic acid                      The idea was hatched by a Chinese scientist  Dr  Li Zhu  who was visiting Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  headquarters in 1987   At the time  research suggested that folic acid could help prevent birth defects such as spina bifida  but no large scale studies had been conducted   For a variety of reasons  Dr  Li Zhu thought China would be a good place to test the theory                        This Subcommittee began funding the collaborative in 1992  and data collection ended in 1996   Thanks to this study  we now know that taking folic acid during pregnancy can reduce neural tube birth defects like spina bifida by up to 70 percent   As a result  the FDA ruled in 1996 that breads  cereals  and other appropriate foods must be fortified with folic acid  and the incidence of spina bifida has dropped dramatically                               That study formed the foundation of the US China partnership in health   Chinese officials were so impressed with the work of our CDC that they named their own public health department  China CDC    That partnership is now expanding into avian flu surveillance  respiratory illness and occupational injury rates   It is a true success story                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
