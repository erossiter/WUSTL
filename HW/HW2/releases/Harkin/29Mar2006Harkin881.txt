        Maytag has been an integral part of the Iowa economy for many years  and its workers are second to none   I am disappointed in the Justice Department  s decision because I am concerned  as I have been from the beginning of this process  that this takeover could mean the loss of many jobs in our state   It is my hope that Whirlpool will commit itself to maintaining Maytag  s existing Iowa facilities and workforce   To that end  I will work with Whirlpool executives  the Iowa Department of Economic Development  and local community and labor leaders to ensure an easy transition and to protect Iowa jobs                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
