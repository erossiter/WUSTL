 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today issued the following statement on a new report released by the American Beverage Association  The School Beverage Guidelines Progress Report 2006 2007 is the initial report on implementation of voluntary nutrition standards adopted by major beverage companies which call for industry to provide to schools beverage options that are lower in calories and smaller in size         Harkin is one of the Senate sponsors of The Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act  a bill that would update decades old federal nutrition standards for snack foods and beverages sold in school cafeterias alongside the regular school meals  and would apply those standards everywhere on school grounds  including in vending machines and school stores      Some progress has been made in reducing the number of sugary beverages available to children in our nations schools  which will no doubt help efforts to reduce childhood obesity and promote child health  But this progress was made by a voluntary agreement with the industry from a starting point of near universal availability of sugary beverages in our schools  We therefore have a considerable ways to go  With critical needs for childhood health and nutrition  I remain convinced that the most effective way to get healthier foods and beverages into our schools is through mandatory national standards enacted by Congress      This progress report shows that about two thirds of the drinks offered for sale in high schools still contain considerable amounts of sugar and calories from sodas  sports drinks and mid calorie beverage  Clearly  much  more must be done to ensure that that our schools do all that they can to ensure sound nutrition among our children  My bill would do just that and I intend to seek passage of the legislation before the end of this Congress       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
