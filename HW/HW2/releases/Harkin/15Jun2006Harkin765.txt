         WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised the recommendation of a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH  Advisory Board to speed compensation for former Ames Lab workers who have cancer from radiation exposure   The board recommended that workers from 1942 to 1954 be added to a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  making them automatically eligible for compensation            This is a great step for the workers and families who handled incredibly dangerous materials in the earliest days of the cold war and developed cancer as a result of their work at the Ames Lab     Harkin said     We owe these workers a great debt for their contribution to our national security   Many suffered devastating illnesses as a result of exposure to radioactive materials before we fully understood the risks             In 2000 Harkin sponsored and Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  which established a compensation program for former nuclear workers   Since then work has been underway to reconstruct radiation doses for workers across the country and to determine if workers who subsequently developed cancer and other illnesses likely developed the cancer as a result of radiation exposure          In cases where the exposure levels for a group of workers cannot be accurately documented  Congress gave NIOSH and the NIOSH Advisory Board on Worker and Radiation Health the authority to add the workers to a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC    Workers included within a SEC are entitled to receive  150 000 in automatic compensation if they developed one of 22 specified cancers   Groups of workers from Burlington  Iowa  Kentucky  Ohio  Alaska  and Tennessee have already been designated as SECs           With this announcement  the Secretary of Health and Human Services  HHS  will now have 30 days to act  and following that approval  Congress has 30 days to act   If no actions are taken to block NIOSH  s recommendation  then the workers will be officially included in the SEC             I urge Health and Human Services Secretary Mike Leavitt to act quickly in sending this recommendation to Congress     said Harkin     We owe these workers and their families no less             In 2005 after years of effort by former workers  advocates and government officials  former Iowa Army Ammunition Plant workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers were included in an SEC   Approximately two thirds of the eligible families have received this funding                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
