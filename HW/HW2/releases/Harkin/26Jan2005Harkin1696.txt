        I am very concerned about Dr  Rice  s role as the marketer of the inflated evidence leading up to what was called a pre emptive war in Iraq   The Administration gave the impression to the American people that Iraq posed an imminent threat to the US and the world  often based on worst case scenarios and poor intelligence  which later proved to be untrue            I have experienced first hand in my travels the loss of U S  credibility worldwide which alienated many of our democratic friends and allies   Dr  Rice  s elevation to Secretary of State will send the wrong signal regarding our future diplomacy efforts and American interests                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
