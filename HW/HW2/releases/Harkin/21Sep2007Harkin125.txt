 WASHINGTON  D C  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised Congress final approval of the Food and Drug Administration  FDA  Revitalization Act  S 1082   which reauthorizes important programs to expedite the approval of prescription drugs and medical devices  In addition  the bill improves FDAs ability to perform post market surveillance of drugs to prevent unsafe drugs from remaining on the market  President Bush is expected to sign this bill into law soon   The bill includes language proposed by Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Senator Pat Roberts  R KS  ensuring patients have adequate information when making prescription drug choices  The Roberts  Harkin Amendment improves direct to consumer  DTC  advertising by requiring a fair balance of disclosures in DTC ads regarding the risks and benefits of prescription drugs   Every day consumers are bombarded by drug advertisements that playup the benefits of certain medications and gloss over critical risks consumers need to know about to make the best decisions for their health  said Harkin  The Roberts Harkin Amendment will help the FDA and drug companies provide better information about the positive and negative effects of medications so consumers can make informed choices about their health care  not choices based on a movie star endorsement or a slick advertising pitch   Currently  the FDA requires drug companies to only disclose the most important risks in a major statement in the audio portion of television and radio advertisements  Drug companies must also provide other places for consumers to find a list of all the risks associated with the drug  including internet sites  toll free numbers  referral to health care providers  and print ads   Harkin expressed concern that the statements about risks and benefits were often lost in the creative content of the ads  and not stated in a fair and balanced manner   When slick advertisements skim over the potentially dangerous side effects of certain prescription drugs  Americans health is put at risk Harkin said  By requiring drug companies to place equal emphasis on the benefits and risks associated with certain prescription drugs  Congress is empowering consumers to make better  more informed decisions about their health   The FDA Revitalization Act now requires a drugs major statement relating to side effects  contra indications  and effectiveness that is included in every TV and radio ad to be stated in a clear  conspicuous  and neutral manner  This will help to clarify that the major statement about risks and benefits is paramount and that the creative portion of the ad must not distract from it   Harkins amendment also addresses the effect DTC ads have on the rising costs of health care  In 1996   791 million was spent on DTC ads  By 2003  that number had risen to  3 2 billion  The latest data from the General Accounting Office  GAO  indicates that the drug industry spent  4 2 billion on DTC ads in 2005   Most of this money was spent for promotion of only 50 brand name drugs  And  as the GAO found  these drugs are most often for chronic conditions  not for cancer or life threatening illnesses  Other studies have shown that advertising increases utilization of drugs  particularly for newer  more expensive drugs  even if older drugs will work for an individual  This helps to explain why the GAO also found that DTC advertising increases prescription drug spending and utilization   The drug industrys drive to maximize profits is clearly leading to ads that push the most expensive medicines  even when older alternatives are every bit as effective  Harkin said  Given our nations soaring health care costs  we need to ensure drug companies are forthcoming in their advertisements so that consumers can decide how to manage their health in a cost effective manner       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
