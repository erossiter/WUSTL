        We must realize meth abuse is not only a state problem  but a national problem that is threatening communities across the country     Harkin said     It is destroying lives and taking a tremendous toll on families  especially in Iowa   We must dedicate the time and resources to getting this problem under control and we must do it now               Meth is one of the most addictive and rapidly spreading drugs the United States has ever known   The destruction it leaves in its path    human  financial  and environmental    is staggering   That is why Harkin has worked to successfully secure several federal grants for meth abuse and treatment in Iowa   For the past three years  the Iowa Department of Public Health has received  400 000 a year for meth abuse prevention and  500 000 a year to treat adult meth users   In addition  Harkin has fought to increase funding for the National Institute on Drug Abuse  which conducts research on meth s effects on the brain            Harkin has also been a steadfast supporter of the COPS Meth program  which has been crucial in our fight against methamphetamine  and the Byrne Grants that fund many drug fighting programs across the state   Harkin has also worked to secure funding for the Tanks A locks program that allows local county sheriffs to place a special lock on anhydrous ammonia tanks  preventing their theft and reducing the meth labs in the areas where the tanks are locked   Anhydrous ammonia is a key ingredient in meth              We are making strides in our fight against meth  but much work still remains     Harkin said     We must continue to provide resources for treatment of meth addictions as well as providing law enforcement officials with the tools they need to shut down meth labs across the country   We cannot afford to rest on our laurels or even take backwards steps   The people pushing meth will not rest and we cannot either               Harkin was pleased to welcome Ms  Sickels as a witness at the hearing   Ms  Sickels was a former   A    student who nearly lost everything to her meth addiction   Fortunately  Sickels was able to turn her life around and is now a chemical dependency counselor for a meth research program at Iowa Lutheran Hospital in Des Moines   A more detailed bio of Vicki follows            In addition  a complete copy of Senator Harkin  s opening remarks are attached and can be viewed at www harkin senate gov                                 FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                                                Contact   Allison Dobson  Maureen Knightly           Remarks by Senator Tom Harkin  D IA         At the Senate Labor HHS Appropriations Hearing        on Meth Abuse and Treatment        April 21  2005           As Prepared for Delivery             Our topic this morning is methamphetamine abuse   As all of you know  my home state has been hit particularly hard by this epidemic   Iowa ranks 4th among all states in the percentage of residents who are admitted to treatment centers because of meth   That  s not a statistic we  re very happy about   We  re accustomed to seeing Iowa at the top of many national lists  but not when it comes to drug abuse              Fortunately  Iowa is responding   The state recently passed the toughest law in the nation for limiting consumer access to pseudoephedrine  one of the key ingredients for making meth   Thanks to grants from SAMHSA  the Iowa Department of Public Health is pioneering innovating strategies for preventing and treating meth abuse   And Des Moines is one of five sites participating in NIDA  s Methamphetamine Clinical Trials Group  which is studying the use of medication and group therapy in meth treatment              Iowa is not alone in struggling with meth abuse   Sixteen States now have higher treatment admission rates for meth than for cocaine and heroin   And recently we  ve heard disturbing reports that meth is moving to big cities on the East Coast  where the drug has been linked to the spread of HIV              Certainly  law enforcement has a critical role to play in curbing meth abuse  and I strongly support efforts to crack down on the people who are making and selling this drug   But even if we shut down every home based lab and threw every dealer into jail  we  d still have a meth problem in this country   And it won  t go away until we do a better job of preventing people from using meth in the first place and giving addicts the treatment they need to kick the habit for good              That  s where this hearing comes in   SAMHSA and NIDA  two agencies funded in the Labor HHS bill  are our most important federal resources for preventing and meth abuse   We have to make sure they get the appropriation levels they need to address this problem              Meth is destroying lives  filling our prisons  and taking mothers away from their children   We need to stop this epidemic  and we need to do it now               We  re fortunate to have an outstanding panel of witnesses to discuss this issue with us this morning   I  ll introduce them all shortly  but I want to offer a special welcome to Vicki Sickels from Des Moines  who will give us a first hand account of what it  s like to struggle with an addiction to meth   Vicki  thank you for taking the time to fly out here and share your story   You  re really what this hearing is all about                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
