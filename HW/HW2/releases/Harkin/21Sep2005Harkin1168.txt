        It is critical to address head on the hardships high energy prices are causing for American families  farmers and businesses     said Harkin     This plan focuses on curbing dramatic and painful energy price swings in the future and helping Americans get a fair price at the pump             American consumers and the U S  economy are especially vulnerable to supply disruptions  in part because of a heavy reliance on foreign sources of oil   Gasoline prices in some parts of the country soared to nearly six dollars a gallon following Hurricane Katrina and remain high with hurricane season continuing and further disruptions possible   The proposal cosponsored by Harkin would help protect consumers from drastic swings in prices like those witnessed over the past month   Among other things  the measure                        Allows the President to declare a temporary national energy emergency when oil or petroleum supplies are threatened or being disrupted  making price gouging punishable through federal penalties                    Requires the President to initiate a national response plan to prepare the country against future domestic or global petroleum supply disruptions                     Creates a new statutory ban on manipulative practices in wholesale petroleum markets and provides new civil and criminal penalties for companies found to engage in manipulation of gasoline markets          Harkin has long advocated using domestic sources for fuel such as ethanol and biodiesel to make the United States more energy self sufficient and less dependent on foreign sources of oil while providing additional revenue to farmers and rural areas            To really address the root causes of sharp gasoline spikes  we must take more action to stimulate domestic production of ethanol and biodiesel     Harkin said     If we increase energy production from the fields of the Midwest instead of the oil fields of the Middle East  the effects of future unforeseen events will be easier to withstand for the American economy                                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
