        Pension loss horror stories are emerging more and more     said Harkin     However  when this happens employees often feel like they have nowhere to turn   I would like to know why  when employees in Olean sought help from the Department of Labor  they were simply left out in the cold             To date  these employees have not received any response to their inquiries from DOL   Harkin requested that Chao submit a timeline detailing what DOL has done to respond to these inquiries and when she expects her department to respond            Citing the Olean Halliburton case  Harkin recently re introduced two pieces of legislation to protect the pension rights of American workers   The first bill would create and Office of Pension Participant Advocacy in DOL to help workers navigate through complicated pension laws and also help workers   understand their rights   The second piece of legislation will close a loophole in pension law that allows employers to get out of paying employees their share of early retirement if their division of a company is sold          Harkin Pension Legislation         Office of Pension Participant Advocacy Legislation         Individual pension plans are complex  as are the laws that govern them   Currently  multiple federal agencies share jurisdiction over pension law   This office would be a place for workers to call that would not only help them navigate the complicated laws about pensions  but also help them understand their own rights   Additionally  this office can serve as a watch dog for harmful employer practices and loopholes that need to be called to the attention of Congress and the administration          Specifically  this office would actively seek out information and suggestions on pension policies and on federal agencies which affect pension participants  evaluate the efforts of federal agencies  businesses and industry to assist pension participants  identify significant problems faced by employees and retirees  make annual recommendations documenting significant pension problems and recommending legislative and regulatory solutions  and examine existing pension plans and determine the extent to which current law serves pensioners in those plans           Mergers and Acquisitions Loophole Legislation         This legislation will prevent workers from losing a large chunk of their pension when they work for a company that sells their division   Current law states that if a company wants to amend their pension plan  they have to give workers the share of their early retirement subsidy that they have already earned   However  a company does not have to do that if your division is bought and sold    even if the workers are in the same building  sitting at the same desk  and doing the same job the whole time   This bill would require that companies must follow the same rules about applying credits toward pension under mergers and acquisitions that they do under any other kind of pension plan amendment            Harkin has led the charge in pension participant protection when companies switch from traditional pensions to hybrid plans like cash balance   He has also successfully worked to improve disclosure to participants who are offered a choice between a lump sum and a regular annuity at retirement   Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HeLP  Committee                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
