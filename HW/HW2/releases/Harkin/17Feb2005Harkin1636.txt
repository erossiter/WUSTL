    As Prepared for Delivery       Thank you  Dr  Harmon  ACPM president   for that kind introduction         You know  the newspapers are full of stories about skyrocketing health care costs       rising rates of obesity       out of control Medicare and Medicaid costs  and on and on  But is it any wonder we are in this mess  Let  s face it  in America today we don  t have a health care system  we have a sick care system  We wait until people become obese  develop chronic diseases  or become disabled    and then we spend untold hundreds of billions annually to try to make them better         And that  s why I have looked forward so much to meeting with you this morning  Because you people   get it     You understand that  in America  we need to fundamentally redirect our focus toward wellness  disease prevention  exercise  good nutrition  and staying out of the hospital in the first place         But  so often here in Washington  when I advocate this position  I run into a brick wall  In federal health care programs  virtually all the priorities and incentives    and most of the interest groups    are slanted toward treating people after they get sick         Case in point  The Administration recently proposed spending more than  3 billion a year implanting cardiac defibrillators into Medicare patients  Yes  this is amazing technology  It  s a good thing to make this procedure available  But imagine if I proposed spending  3 billion a year on walking and bike paths  smoking cessation programs  diet and nutrition counseling  and other things to prevent heart disease  Most of my colleagues in Congress would say    Harkin  that  s just pie in the sky            Well  it  s not pie in the sky  It  s down to earth common sense  America  s health care system is in crisis precisely because we systematically neglect wellness and prevention  I mean  just look at the newspaper           The Washington Post recently reported that the Bush administration is considering getting rid of the tax deduction for employer provided health insurance  The administration  s reasoning is that if more people are paying their own health insurance costs  they  ll choose low option plans  and they  ll forego discretionary medical services    you know  things like annual physicals and cancer screenings           Another story not long ago noted that Ontario this year surpassed Michigan as the largest producer of automobiles in North America  Why did this happen  A big reason is that Canada is attractive to automakers because of its nationalized health care system  By contrast General Motors in the U S  spends roughly  1 500 per vehicle on health care costs           And one more recent story  The Hardee  s fast food chain recently unveiled its new Monster Thickburger  This death defying sandwich consists of two one third pound slabs of beef  four strips of bacon  three slices of cheese  and mayonnaise on a buttered sesame seed bun  What the menu at Hardee  s does not tell you is that the Monster Thickburger clocks in at 1 400 calories and 107 grams of fat         Now  these are just three unrelated stories  But they speak volumes about the mess we are in  Health care costs are out of control    hurting the competitiveness of American businesses  and driving up the number of people without insurance  Medicare and Medicaid costs are eating the federal budget alive  Restaurants are super sizing their meals  Americans are super sizing their bodies         We can  t go on like this  We are choking our economy  We are exploding the federal budget  And we are  literally  killing ourselves         Consider the obesity epidemic  Some 65 percent of our population is now overweight or obese  Obesity now contributes to the death of more than 360 000 Americans a year  The incidence of childhood obesity is now at epidemic levels  Alarm bells are going off all over the place  But our government has done virtually nothing         In fact  we are going backwards  Just look at the budget that President Bush proposed last week  As usual  it proposes hundreds of billions of spending on sick care    treating people after they get sick         Meanwhile  the President proposes a 10 percent cut in funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC    the one agency whose entire mission is wellness and prevention         He proposes to zero out funding for the preventive health block grant  This is a major source of funding for health promotion activities in the United States  And the White House wants to get rid of it         The President also proposed that we eliminate funding for the VERB program This program  which is run by CDC  encourages young people ages 9  13 to be physically active every day  But the President wants to end it         And one more thing  Medicare currently spends about  7 billion to reimburse teaching hospitals for programs that prepare doctors in various fields of specialization  One of the few specialties that do not receive funding is    you guessed it    preventive medicine  I want to work with you to get rid of this restriction  so we can get more preventive doctors in the field         You know  someone once defined insanity as doing the same old thing  over and over again  and expecting a different result  Well  our current health care approach is  by definition  insane  We continue to spend hundreds of billions on pills  surgery  treatments  and disability  We are cutting or eliminating programs designed to keep people fit and well    and out of the hospital  And we wonder why health care costs are skyrocketing         The President is barnstorming the country  trying to persuade people that Social Security is going to go bankrupt  But let  s put this in perspective  Over the next 75 years  the shortfall in Social Security is  3 7 trillion  Meanwhile  the shortfall in Medicare is estimated at  17 trillion  And the shortfall in the President  s prescription drug program  alone  is  8 1 trillion         And it  s not only the federal budget that is being eaten alive by health care costs  It is also state budgets  It is family budgets  And it is corporate budgets         Look at the numbers  Some 75 percent of health care costs in the United States are accounted for by chronic conditions and diseases    many of which are preventable  Last year  nationally  we spent more than  100 billion on obesity alone  Medicare and Medicaid picked up almost half of that tab         This is unwise  It is uneconomic  And  as we now know  it is totally unsustainable  If we are going to control Medicare and Medicaid costs    and private sector health care costs  as well    we need a radical change of course  We need a fundamental paradigm shift toward preventing disease  promoting good nutrition  and encouraging fitness and wellness  This will be good for the physical health of the American people  And it will be good for the fiscal health of government  corporate  and family budgets         Here  this morning  I  m preaching to the choir  And what  s wrong with preaching to the choir  I like it  And the choir likes it  And when it comes to wellness and prevention  ACPM is not just any choir  you  re like the Mormon Tabernacle Choir         But in other quarters  there is fierce resistance to my message  The pushback  in a nutshell  goes like this    We don  t want a nanny government  Good health is a matter of individual responsibility            Well  I believe strongly in personal responsibility  I believe that people should take charge of their own health  But I also believe in corporate responsibility  community responsibility  and government responsibility  And I make no bones about it  It is past time for the federal government to step up to the plate in a very robust way         To that end  as many of you know  I have introduced the HeLP America Act  otherwise known as the Healthier Lifestyles and Prevention Act  This legislation takes a comprehensive approach to wellness and prevention  It provides tools and incentives to schools  employers  and communities  It aims to create better nutrition  physical activity and mental health opportunities for kids in schools  It gives the Federal Trade Commission authority to regulate unfair marketing to children  It provides incentives to build bike paths and safe sidewalks  It requires nutrition labeling on menus in chain restaurants  And it does much  much more         As I said  the HeLP America Act is comprehensive  It is ambitious  And it is only at the beginning of a long legislative process  But I am confident that    over time    we can build a bipartisan consensus to move the federal government in this direction         We have already made progress  Several elements of the HeLP Act passed late last year  For example           We secured  440 million for research at the National Institutes of Health into the causes and cures of obesity           We got more than  50 million in grants to states to fund programs to address nutrition  physical activity  and obesity           We secured some  114 million for tobacco prevention and cessation activities at CDC           And we expanded the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program         These are positive steps forward  But  to be honest  they are only baby steps  Meanwhile  powerful forces are mobilizing against me  For example  just last month  three giant food companies    General Mills  Kellogg  and Kraft Foods    joined with the advertising industry to create a new lobbying group with one aim  to preserve their ability to advertise and market junk food to children with almost no restrictions         So  my friends  I will not be coy about my reasons for speaking to you  this morning  Frankly  I need you  I appreciate you advocacy for preventive medicine back home in your communities  in academia  and with private businesses  But  today  I am appealing to ACPM as an organization       and to you as individuals         to become even more outspoken in your advocacy here in Washington         The College  s members have tremendous expertise  As researchers and leaders in the health promotion field  it is important for Senators and Representatives to hear your side of the story         Frankly  I hope that the next time ACPM convenes here in Washington  you will include a legislative focus  What many associations do is this  They set aside an afternoon or morning for members to fan out on Capitol Hill and visit their members of Congress         This would be a terrific opportunity for each of you to become advocates for wellness and prevention legislation  And if you want to speak up for my HeLP America Act  that will be just great         So thank you my friends  Thank you for the important work that you do in preventive medicine    and for supporting my work in the Senate  Have a great conference  And next time you are in town  I look forward to seeing all of you up on Capitol Hill                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
