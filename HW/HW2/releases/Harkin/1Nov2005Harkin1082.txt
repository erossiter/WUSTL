            For months  I have been asking the Administration for their plan to address a pandemic outbreak of the avian flu   I am pleased the President has finally announced this plan and is focusing on this very real threat                  The President today said that he will ask Congress to provide funding for this effort   Fortunately  the Senate has already acted   Last week  the Senate passed my proposal that addresses precisely the same issues that the President called for in his speech this morning   It provides resources to stockpile antiviral drugs for 50 percent of the population  improves our ability to produce and stockpile vaccines  doubles global surveillance to prevent or slow the spread of the disease from other countries to the United States  and invests in our state and local public health infrastructure  the first line of defense if avian flu reaches our shores   These funds could be available immediately               A flu pandemic is not a matter of if    but when  Instead of always looking into the rear view mirror  we must do all we can to prevent a disaster  like avian flu  before it happens   The time for planning has passed    what we need now is action   HHS Secretary Leavitt  Dr  Gerberding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Dr  Fauci of the National Institutes of Health will testify before Senator Specter and me at a Senate Labor HHS Appropriations subcommittee hearing tomorrow morning   I am looking forward to the opportunity to learn more about the Administration  s plan                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
