      FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE                            ONTACT  Dave Townsend   Allison Dobson              Tomorrow  Iowans will join millions of others around the world in celebrating Earth Day and promoting a cleaner and healthier environment   While we  ve seen real progress since the first Earth Day in 1970  we continue to face some very serious environmental challenges                    No one understands better than Iowans how important it is to care for our environment  Central to Iowa  s heritage is a strong connection to the land   We know our agricultural abundance depends on conserving our natural resources and appreciate that a healthy environment is essential to the many outdoor pursuits we treasure    from hunting and fishing to hiking  boating or bird watching   Yet often our farmers often cannot afford the conservation and environmental practices that are needed   That  s why we need to increase cost share and incentive payments for agricultural conservation  Washington can do much more to help farmers preserve natural resources  and I intend to continue fighting for America  s agricultural conservation efforts                  Iowa is also at the forefront of the trend towards renewable sources of energy  which promise tremendous environmental benefits   Iowa  s prairie winds are now generating clean  renewable electricity  Our state is the leader in ethanol and biodiesel production   In addition to our energy production  there is tremendous potential for using environmentally friendly farm based material to make nearly any product now made from petroleum   These bio based products have the potential to greatly enhance the environment and our energy security                We have taken big strides since that first Earth Day 36 years ago  but we still have a lot of work ahead of us   I applaud all the Iowans who continue to recommit themselves to conserving and protecting our resources and environment for future generations all 365 days of the year                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
