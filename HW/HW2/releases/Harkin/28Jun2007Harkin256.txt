 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  introduced legislation today to protect Americans pensions and ensure workers receive the retirement benefits they are entitled to  The Restoring Pension Promises to Workers Act of 2007 would restore basic fairness to Americas pension system by forcing corporations that provide lavish executive pension arrangements to also provide a guaranteed  defined benefit plan for the rest of their employees  The bill would also enact a number of other reforms to help ensure Americans pensions will be there for them when they retire  including protecting benefits for employees when companies merge or change ownership   More and more companies  even those with a healthy bottom line  are telling workers they can no longer afford to provide them with the benefits they had been promised  said Harkin  But at a time when employees retirement security is anything but secure  things are looking rosy in the corporate board room  where our nations corporate elite make sure that they have pensions  higher incomes and other benefits so generous that Midas would have been embarrassed  This is just plain wrong   Despite rising corporate profits in recent years  many workers have had their pensions frozen  Many employers have convinced workers that they cannot afford pensions  while awarding top executives very lucrative non pension benefits that function as pensions previously did  Harkins bill would ensure that employers who can afford gold plated pensions for executives also provide a pension for the workers who generated the profits in the first place   In addition  the legislation would     Create an Office of Pension Participant Advocacy  Within the Department of Labor  this office would be a resource for people who are affected by shortcomings in federal private pension laws  The advocate could call for clarifications of current law and share participant complaints with Congress  The advocate would also consult with participant advocate groups  companies  and other federal entities that work with pensions to develop policy recommendations to share with the Secretary and Congress  The advocate would also provide technical assistance to plan sponsors about their obligations to participants     Prohibit elimination of accrued benefits during mergers and acquisitions  This provision would eliminate an arcane legal loophole that has allowed companies who change ownership to revoke employees pension benefits  For example  the sale of a Halliburton subsidiary to another company caused many of the employees to lose up to half the value of their expected pensions  even though the workers were doing the exact same jobs they had done previously  According to press accounts  the loss in pension benefits amounted to  25 million     Shield workers from mistakes made by pension administrators  Mistakes are often made in calculating pension payments  sometimes resulting in overpayments to beneficiaries  Current law allows the pension plan to sue a participant for any and all overpayments years after the payments were made  even after the individual has retired  Harkins bill would prevent a participant from paying for the plans mistake if it would cause a significant hardship to the individual  It would also provide a 3 year statute of limitations on suits for overpayment     Protect retired workers from cuts to their pension benefits  This provision would prevent plans from cutting benefits for people who retired before the cutbacks were adopted by the plan       Provide protection for female workers  This provision would protect pensions for surviving spouses of deceased federal employees  and former spouses of federal employees       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
