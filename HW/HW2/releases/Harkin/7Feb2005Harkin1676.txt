        This budget is all about broken promises  harmful cuts  and cunning deceptions     said Harkin     Rural health initiatives and education should not have to suffer in order to give away hundreds of billions of dollars in tax cuts to the wealthy   This budget does not add up    the president cannot boast of fiscally responsible policies if the only people he expects to be tightening their belts are middle income families  while his tax giveaways to the rich are pushing the country further into debt          Bush Cuts Education for First Time in a Decade         Overall  the President  s budget makes deep cuts in education for the first time in 10 years  at a time when schools are struggling to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act   The President  s budget eliminates funding for education technology  state grants to keep schools safe and drug free  school counselors  alcohol abuse reduction  and dozens of other education initiatives   Additionally  the President  s much ballyhooed  1 5 billion High School Initiative is more than offset by  2 1 billion in cuts to similar education initiatives            The president eliminates  2 1 billion for high schools  replaces it with  1 5 billion  and calls it an   initiative     That is exactly the kind of help our schools can do without     Harkin said     This is just one more example of the huge gap between this Administration  s promises and its actions             Head Start      The President  s Head Start proposal will cut off services to 25 000 poor children   Head Start currently serves only about half of eligible preschoolers and three percent of children eligible for Early Head Start              Head Start provides millions of children in communities across America with essential education and health services to ensure that they have the skills to succeed when they start school  Harkin said     If we truly want to leave no child behind  we shouldn  t be cutting the number of poor children receiving Head Start services             Pell Grants      Harkin commended the president for beginning to address the inadequate funding of Pell Grants for disadvantaged students  but called on him to live up to a pledge made during his first presidential campaign and raise the maximum Pell Grant award to at least  5 100   The current maximum Pell Grant award is  4 050             Bush Slashes Health Initiatives and Research         The president  s budget provides woefully inadequate resources for health initiatives and research   The president slashes funding for rural health initiatives by 80 percent and health professions training by 64 percent  and eliminates successful block grants for preventative health   Furthermore  the president proposed only a meager 0 5 percent increase for NIH    the smallest for that agency since 1970            Last week in the State of the Union address  the President praised the outstanding work of the NIH   Then he turns around and provides it with inadequate resources     Harkin said     Scientists have just sequenced the human genome   We stand on the threshold of a golden age of medical research and this is clearly the wrong time to skimp on the NIH budget             Community Health Centers         Harkin applauded the president for his proposed  304 million increase for community health centers            Community health centers are the front line in treating underserved families  and I am pleased that President supports bringing these clinics to the poorest areas of the country     Harkin said     I hope that when choosing locations for the new centers  the administration will recognize the unique needs of rural areas                Bush Budget Harms Workers         In the Department of Labor  the President  s budget cuts job training by  333 million  eliminates vocational education funding  and drastically reduces funding for international labor work  cutting the initiative by 87 percent and eliminating the U S  effort to eradicate the worst forms of child labor worldwide            Just last Friday  we learned that unemployment claims are hovering over five percent  job creation is well below the administration  s projections  and the manufacturing sector lost 25 000 jobs in January    the fifth straight month of job losses     Harkin said     It is baffling that the President would respond to this news by proposing cuts to the nation  s job training initiatives                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
