             I voted for the Iraq supplemental funding bill tonight because this legislation addresses critical domestic needs   It increases the minimum wage to  7 25 an hour from  5 15 over the next two years  this is the first increase in more than a decade  and a top priority of the new Democratic majority in Congress   It provides emergency funding for the State Children s Health Insurance program  which will prevent thousands of Iowa children from being cut from the rolls   It provides nearly  1 8 billion for the Department of Veterans Affairs  which will reduce the backlog of benefits claims and ensure that VA facilities are maintained at the highest level   It also provides a much needed boost to agricultural conservation                             Iowans know where I stand on the war in Iraq  so they know I have serious reservations about the bill s lack of a redeployment timetable   I have fought hard for a timetable to extricate our troops from the civil war in Iraq   And I am an original cosponsor of the Feingold Reid bill  which would complete the redeployment by March 31  2008   But because of Republican obstructionism  the practical realities are that we need 60 votes in the Senate to pass any Iraq withdrawal measure  and 67 votes to overcome a presidential veto   We are not there  yet   But we will be back   When we consider the FY 2008 defense authorization and defense appropriations bills this summer  we will have fresh opportunities to set a timetable   As it becomes clearer with each passing day that the President s surge   his insistence on a military solution   is the wrong way to go  I hope that we will pick up the votes we need on the other side of the aisle to prevail                                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
