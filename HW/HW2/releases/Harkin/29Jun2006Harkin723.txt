     I applaud the Majority Leader for working out a deal that will allow the Senate to vote on HR 810  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   The majority of the American people support this bill   The House of Representatives overwhelmingly passed it   A majority of the Senate support it as well   We should have passed the bill long ago   And now  thanks to the agreement worked out today  the Senate will soon get that chance           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
