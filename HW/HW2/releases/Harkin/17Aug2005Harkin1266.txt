        While this is an improvement  it is only a start   While it provides some kids with a reduced number of soft drink selections during the school day  I believe these new policies do not go far enough  particularly at the middle school and high school levels   The proposal still allows middle school children ready access to sweetened drinks with virtually no nutritional value   And high schools students will be unconstrained in their ability to drink unlimited amounts of soft drinks                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
