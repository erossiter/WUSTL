     I appreciated having the opportunity to meet with the EU Trade Commissioner Peter Mandelson today to discuss how countries can find a way to resume World Trade Organization  s  WTO  Doha Round negotiations                  Obviously  the U S  and EU are key players in the World Trade Organization  and the gap between their positions in agricultural negotiations was a significant factor in the suspension of the WTO  s Doha Round talks last July   Mr  Mandelson  s visit to Washington this week is part of his effort to understand and hopefully bridge that gap               There is one thing that I want to make sure that Commissioner Mandelson understands   In its agricultural proposal in 2005  the United States offered to make significant reductions in trade distorting domestic support programs if other countries would make comparable concessions on export subsidies and market access   If adopted as part of a Doha Round Agreement  the proposed cuts in domestic support programs would in fact require Congress to make significant changes in U S  farm programs  So it is essential  and no more than fair  that Europe and other countries reduce their trade barriers to allow U S  agriculture better export opportunities  I clearly conveyed this point to Commissioner Mandelson               A successful Doha Round agreement can be good for the U S  economy and for the rest of the world as well   Most of the global economic gain from the round is expected to come from agricultural liberalization   All the major studies of agricultural trade liberalization indicate that the majority of the benefits are created from reducing high agricultural tariffs  as opposed to lowering domestic supports or eliminating export subsidies   For the Doha Round to succeed  the EU and other countries must step up and offer significant reductions in their tariffs  without insisting on loopholes which would largely negate the effect of those tariff cuts                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
