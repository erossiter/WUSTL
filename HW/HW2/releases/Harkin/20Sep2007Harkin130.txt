 Mike Johanns and I have had a good working relationship  I always found him pleasant to work with and I was very impressed by how involved he was in this farm bill process  Last year in particular he traveled all over the country to hear from farmers and others in rural communities most affected by agriculture and rural policies coming out of Washington  I felt that as Secretary  Mike Johanns had a positive effect on the Conservation Security Program  as well as renewable energy and biobased products   Of course our vital work on the farm bill must go forward  Chuck Connor is a good choice to serve as acting Secretary  I have known him for over 20 years and believe his involvement in this farm bill process will make for a smooth transition       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
