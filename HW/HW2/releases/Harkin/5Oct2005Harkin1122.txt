        I am pleased these brave men and women will receive the essential fire fighting tools they need to keep our communities safe     said Harkin    The equipment  technology and training these grants help to provide are the key to protecting Iowa  s firefighters and our homes and loved ones             The Assistance to Firefighters Grants Program  AFGP  helps Iowa communities purchase firefighting equipment  firefighter health and safety programs  emergency medical services programs  and fire prevention and safety programs  Fire departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel           Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments   It requires that at least 60 percent of the funding must go to volunteer fire departments   This means that towns like Hartwick and Oelwein are not competing against cities like Des Moines or Cedar Rapids   Additionally  the program requires only a 10 percent match in local funding   In today  s economy  this makes it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
