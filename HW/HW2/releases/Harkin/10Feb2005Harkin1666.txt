    On that score  President Bush  s proposed budget for 2006 speaks in the starkest terms    Gone is any pretense of compassionate conservatism   Gone is any pretense of concern for the most needy in our society   Instead  what we see in the budget released by the White House yesterday is an unvarnished message that the far right rules       the gloves are off       and future budgets will reflect traditional hard right priorities          Specifically  the President  s position is that the tax cuts for the very rich must not be touched  in fact  they must be made permanent   Moreover  two additional tax cuts for the very wealthy    tax cuts passed in the 2001 tax bill and effective next year    must also not be touched  Meanwhile  President Bush proposes to slash critical  life supporting programs for veterans  schoolchildren  the sick  the poor  the disabled    the most vulnerable people in our American family        Mr  President  this proposed budget is the antithesis of compassionate conservatism   First of all  it is callous and heartless  not compassionate   Second  it is not conservative  because real conservatism is about fiscal responsibility  living within your means  and balancing budgets          Yes  President Bush still trots out the conservative rhetoric about tightening our belt and making difficult choices in next year  s budget   But he has a double standard   On the one hand  he says that times are tough   We can  t afford to properly fund education for Iowa school kids  health care for our veterans  economic development for our rural communities  or programs to keep police officers on the streets          On the other hand  he says that times are not too tough for yet another tax giveaway bonanza for the wealthiest Americans   Specifically  the budget released yesterday calls for implementation next year of two new tax cuts worth billions of dollars  with more than half of the benefits going to those making  1 million or more         In short  President Bush  s proposed 2006 budget is easy on the rich and privileged    tough on children and the poor   But ordinary working Americans are looking at these proposals and saying    Wait a minute   Those are not our priorities   Those are not our values   That is not our idea of fairness or shared sacrifice       I mean  why should a Wall Street speculator making more than  1 million get yet another big tax cut  while kids in rural Iowa are getting kicked off of Head Start   These are the wrong choices    misplaced priorities   And they reflect bad values    values that are offensive to the basic decency  caring  and fairness of the American people         Let  s be clear about the game that is being played here    only it  s not a game   It is a deadly serious  ideologically driven plan   And the objective of this plan is best expressed by Republican leader Grover Norquist   Our   goal is to cut government in half        to get it down to the size where we can drown it in the bathtub           To that end  over the last four years  President Bush has engineered a fiscal train wreck in Washington    a methodical  purposeful  deliberate train wreck   He has cut taxes by trillions of dollars   He has vastly increased spending on the Pentagon   He has spent hundreds of billions on the war in Iraq   He rammed through an ill conceived prescription drug plan costing a half trillion dollars   He has proposed borrowing more than  4 trillion for his scheme to privatize Social Security    a scheme that does nothing to address the long term shortfall in Social Security          And now he has the gall to point to this fiscal train wreck    his train wreck    and say    The deficits are out of control   But since the tax cuts are untouchable  we have to cut programs for our most needy citizens   We have to cut education   We have to cut health care   We have to cut rural development   We have to cut police officers and firefighters   And on and on     Mr  President  here are just a few of the most egregious cuts in the President  s budget           The budget calls for deep cuts in education for the first time in 10 years  at a time when schools are struggling to meet the requirements of No Child Left Behind   It eliminates funding for education technology  school counselors  alcohol abuse reduction  and dozens of other education initiatives           At a time when U S  workers are fighting for jobs in the global economy  the President  s budget cuts job training by  330 million  and eliminates vocational education funding          The budget would slash  1 6 billion in funding for local police  while eliminating drug task forces and the very successful High Intensity Drug Trafficking Areas program  which has been so helpful in fighting the meth epidemic in Iowa and other states          The budget calls for some two million veterans to pay a new  250 annual fee to receive health care  and it doubles the cost of their prescription drugs          Rural America is singled out for deep cuts    cuts in programs to help family farmers and rural small businesses to survive  cuts in agriculture conservation programs  cuts in clean drinking water for our smallest and poorest towns          The budget slashes funding for key rural health programs by 80 percent   It cuts health professions training by 64 percent  and zeroes out block grants for preventive health             The budget calls for giving states more   flexibility    under Medicaid   But this is nothing but a code word for cuts    cuts of billions of dollars in health care for the poor  the mentally ill  and those with disabilities  Mr  President  these are the wrong choices  the wrong priorities  and the wrong values          I can think of any number of wasteful  unnecessary programs to cut or get rid of   We certainly don  t need the President  s program for manned trips to the Moon and Mars  or the Space Station   We could save countless billions in Medicare by allowing the program to negotiate lower drug prices    as the Veterans  Administration already does  and as almost every other nation does   In addition  we could save billions by deferring deployment of the missile defense system until after it has proved itself capable of shooting down missiles          And why in the world are the President  s tax cuts for the rich untouchable   We are no longer in recession   The President says the economy is strong and creating jobs   During the Clinton years  we created 100 times more jobs per month   and we did it not by cutting taxes but by balancing budgets         Mr  President  when working Americans sit down at the kitchen table to come up with a family budget  they have to balance their budget   Families that are having trouble making ends meet don  t go out and charge  50 000 on their Mastercard  at least not if they are responsible  Likewise  a government budget ought to be a vehicle for making tough choices and imposing self discipline   It ought to be a vehicle for saying    Here is the level of government that we require  and we will raise sufficient revenues to pay  in full  for that level of government       But the budget President Bush sent up yesterday adamantly refuses to impose self discipline   For 2006  the President is demanding a  2 6 trillion government  but he refuses to raise revenue to pay for it   In order to preserve his tax cuts  he simply accepts the fact that we will borrow at least  390 billion    an amount equal to almost the entire Pentagon budget    and pass it on to our children and grandchildren          This is not conservative   And it does not reflect the values of working Americans  who sacrifice every day to balance their own budgets  So  Mr  President  I intend to challenge the President  s priorities   I do not accept his idea that tax cuts for the very rich are untouchable  while essential programs for our most vulnerable citizens are fair game for cuts or zeroing out   It is wrong to put virtually the entire burden of deficit reduction on the backs of our poorest citizens          And I know that many colleagues on both sides of the aisle share my concerns   The President  s budget is deeply disappointing and disturbing   But the President  s job is to propose a budget   It is our job to write and pass a budget   And I appeal to my colleagues   Let us join together to write a budget that is fair       a budget that reflects the essential American values of fairness  shared sacrifice  and compassion toward the most vulnerable          In closing  Mr  President  I note an article from the newspaper titled   Bush Prays for the Poor      The President Bush spoke last Friday at the National Prayer Breakfast   And in his remarks  he reminded the faithful  and I quote    to hear the cry of the poor and the less fortunate           Well  I believe in the power of prayer   I always have   But maybe the President  s prayer is a little misplaced  here   Maybe we ought to be praying for the rich and the privileged   We ought to be praying that those who have been given the most in our society    the biggest homes  the biggest cars  the biggest bank accounts   We should pray that  in their hearts  they will come to understand that what we are doing here is wrong  that showering tax cuts on the wealthy while imposing budget cuts on the poor is not in the best interest of our American family   It is not in the best interest of fairness and decency and compassion          So I would say  let us pray not for the poor  but for those who have been given the most in our economy   Let us pray that they will go to this President and say    Mr  President  we  ve got enough   We want to pay our fair share   We don  t need those new tax cuts coming down next year   Let  s have shared sacrifice in our society        And maybe if those to whom the President listens to the most    the rich and the privileged    maybe if they can get to him with a change of heart  well  then maybe we can change our priorities in this country        So  I repeat  rather than pray for the poor  we ought to be praying that the rich will have a change of heart  that they will talk to this President  talk to the leaders here in Congress  about fairness  and equity and justice for the least in our society        That  s what this budget is all about   It  s not just numbers   It  s about who gets  and who doesn  t   It  s about the kind of country we want to have   It  s about hope    and about who gets the hope         I believe that this budget should be about giving hope to those who have the least  hope for a brighter future   And that  s exactly why I will challenge the priorities laid out by President Bush in his budget          Lastly  Mr  President  I have been disturbed to read the articles in yesterday  s and this morning  s papers about the Republican National Committee  s plan for a sustained  full scale attack on Minority Leader Harry Reid   According to the articles  the Republicans say they are going to   Daschle ize    Senator Reid    in other words  question his character  trash his reputation  and brand him an obstructionist   What happened to President Bush and Senator Frist  s pledge to work together in a new spirit of cooperation          That obstructionist label is especially bogus   We on this side of the aisle are in the minority   We are the loyal opposition   And under the American system of checks and balances  we have a duty  a responsibility  to point out flaws in the proposals of the majority  and to offer constructive alternatives          Mr  President  the last election was very close   There was a mandate to come together in a cooperative spirit and get things accomplished   There was not a mandate for one side to run roughshod over the other   There was not a mandate for the Republican National Committee to trash  to demonize  to drag through the mud the good name of Senator Harry Reid of Nevada  But that is exactly what is happening with this preemptive assault by the RNC           Mr  President  this is wrong   This is not the way we should conduct business across the aisle here in the Senate   I  ve known Harry Reid for the last 30 years  and I can tell you there is no more honorable  decent  and kind human being in this body        Yes  he will act as the leader of the loyal opposition   Yes  he will be tough   We expect him to be tough in making sure that the rights of the minority are preserved   But you can count on Senator Reid to go the extra mile in order to find common ground with the majority  to find opportunities    and there are many    for bipartisan action on the important issues before us          So I would urge Majority Leader Frist  and I would urge President Bush to call of the dogs   Demonizing the Minority Leader is not the way to get things done in the Senate   Having the President of the United States say  We  re going to do things my way and you just follow suit    this is not the way to get things done in the Senate        I am hopeful that the Republican National Committee will reexamine their actions and have a change of heart   I am hopeful that they will back away from the politics of personal destruction   Because if they don  t  it  s going to make it very difficult to get things done around here   I hope that Republican Senators will tell the RNC to back off  to stop this campaign to malign Senator Reid        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
