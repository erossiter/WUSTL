        It is with great sadness that I learned of the death of my friend Dana Reeve   Over the years  I came to know both Dana and Christopher Reeve   I admired them for their courage in the face of adversity  and their determination to make the world a better place    Americans learned a lot from the Reeve family   Christopher gave us a lesson in how to face hardship  Dana gave us a lesson in love and loyalty             Dana and Christopher Reeve expanded access to new treatments and therapies for thousands of paralyzed Americans  and became tireless advocates for medical research   Of course  they wanted a cure for Chris   But they fought for a cure for others as well           After his death  Chris  s work continued full speed ahead because of Dana  s drive and determination  And now  Dana  s work must continue full speed ahead because of our commitment and determination            Ruth and I extend our heartfelt condolences to Dana  s son Will  her stepchildren Matthew and Alexandra and the entire Reeve and Morosini families                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
