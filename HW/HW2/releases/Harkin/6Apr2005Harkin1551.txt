        When I began serving on this Committee in 1985  Chuck Conner was an able professional staff member   Over the years  Senator Lugar and I moved up the ranks  so that when Chuck left his position as Majority Staff Director in 1997  I was the ranking member on the committee            Over those years and during his tenure at the Corn Refiners Association and at the White House  I developed tremendous respect for the talents  abilities and integrity of Chuck Conner              This long history has made me reminisce about some of my early years on the Committee   American agriculture was in the midst of a financial crisis with plunging commodity prices and falling land values   Congress responded with assistance that helped farmers through those difficult years   The Food Security Act of 1985 also broke new ground  so to speak  with ambitious new initiatives to protect highly erodible land and wetlands   Interestingly  it created the position you hold  Special Assistant to the President for Agricultural Trade and Food Aid            Three years ago  as Chairman of this Committee  I worked with Mr  Conner in his capacity as Special Assistant to the President to complete the farm bill   We did not always agree  but by working together  we were able to craft a farm bill that President Bush praised and signed at a White House ceremony            As Deputy Secretary you will take on a larger responsibility to carry out that bill   Much of the implementation has gone well  but several key farm bill initiatives have been delayed and often made unnecessarily complex   On the budget side  we stayed within the budget in writing the farm bill  but since then the president  s budget and appropriations bills have diverted funds from conservation  rural economic development  research and renewable energy   On top of that  the president insisted that disaster assistance had to be offset by drawing funds out of the Conservation Security Program            Now  in that connection  I especially appreciate your comments about the need to keep American agriculture competitive in an environmentally sensitive manner by using incentive based programs on working lands   Let  s not forget  we put that exact policy in the farm bill and funded it    CSP and other programs   The President singled out conservation for special praise when he signed the farm bill   I intend to work with you to make sure that funding for conservation programs like CSP is restored so they can be carried out as they were enacted   The bleeding of funds from the farm bill is damaging and short sighted            We talk of a   farm bill    and the   Agriculture Committee     but nutrition is more than just part of the committee name   We have a history of bipartisan cooperation in our Committee and with the administration in support of domestic and international food and nutrition assistance   The agriculture and nutrition communities understand the   farm food    connection   I am proud to serve on a committee that helps assure that those who need food assistance are able to share in our nation  s abundance            As Deputy Secretary of Agriculture you will need to be a strong advocate for farmers and ranchers  for rural communities and also for those who need assistance to obtain adequate nutrition   You will need to help nurture the initiatives that will take our nation in promising new directions    into bio based products and farm based renewable energy            It has been 20 years since I first had the opportunity to work with Chuck Conner   We still have plenty to do to make rural America the best that it can be and to alleviate hunger here and abroad   As I read in your prepared statement    this Committee continues to accomplish great things through bipartisanship efforts      Chuck  I look forward to working with you in a bipartisan way to meet the challenges facing our nation in agriculture  conservation  rural communities  and nutrition                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
