                         Good Afternoon   The subcommittee has invited a number of distinguished witnesses  this afternoon  to bring us up to date on a very important topic  the status of autism  and of autism research  in the United States  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that one of every 157 children born in the United States this year will be diagnosed with autism   Millions of families are grappling with the profound difficulties of understanding and coping with this disease   My heart goes out  in particular  to parents who go to heroic lengths to assist their autistic children at home  and who fight the daily fight to secure the support services that their children so badly need                            This hearing will look at several key questions                              First  the number of diagnosed cases of autism is on rise  both in the U S  and in other countries   Why is this   Are we simply doing a better job of diagnosing autism  or has there been a real increase in the incidence of this disease                                 Second  what causes autism   Are the causes environmental   Are they genetic   My guess is that it is a combination of the two  but I am eager to hear the views of our witnesses                                   Third  which therapies work best for children with autism   And are parents able to find the services they need for their children  and at what cost   As Dr  Judy Favell points out in her testimony  while doing research on causes and cures is important  people need help now to overcome or lessen the effects of autism                                 And  last  what is the outlook for finding a cure for autism   And what more can the federal government do to help                              We will have two panels of witnesses today   The first panel includes Dr  Julie Gerberding  the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  who will talk about the incidence of autism  and Dr  Thomas Insel  Director of the National Institute of Mental Health  who will bring us up to date on the science and research                                    Our second panel includes Dr  Judy Favell  who has done great work with young children with autism  Marquerite Colston  a parent of a child with autism  who will speak to this issue from the perspective of a parent  Bob Wright  the co founder of Autism Speaks  and Bradley Whitford  former deputy chief of staff to President Jed Bartlett   actually  a very accomplished actor   and an outspoken advocate for children with autism                                                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
