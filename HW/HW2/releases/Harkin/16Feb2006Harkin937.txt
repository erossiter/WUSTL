   WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today expressed concern over an internal White House memo that discusses ways to thwart giving automatic compensation to former nuclear weapons workers who got cancer after being exposed to nuclear materials during the Cold War and the Manhattan Project   In cases where the exposure levels for a group of former nuclear workers cannot be accurately documented  Congress gave the National Institute of Safety and Health  NIOSH  and its Advisory Board on Worker and Radiation Health the authority to add the workers to a Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  which would make them automatically eligible for compensation             They are seeking simple fairness and justice from the government     said Harkin     We owe these workers a great debt for their contribution to our national security   Many suffered devastating illnesses as a result of exposure to radioactive materials before we fully understood the risks             Workers included in a SEC are entitled to receive  150 000 in automatic compensation if they developed one of 22 specified cancers   Groups of workers from Burlington  Iowa  Kentucky  Ohio  Alaska  and Tennessee have already been designated as SECs           The internal White House memo suggests defying the will of Congress by placing major new hurdles in the way of workers who cannot document their radiation exposure 50 years after the fact  including a requirement that the White House sign off on every scientific reason for automatic compensation   The memo actually details a five point agenda to block that compensation in order to save the government money            This is a gross breach of faith     said Harkin     Nuclear workers all across the country have been dragged through years of public hearings and investigations   They have played by the rules  and are closer to finally getting the compensation Congress said they deserve   This is wrong   It is putting bureaucracy before science   It is putting bureaucracy before simple fairness for people who served their country loyally and at great risk               Two weeks ago  Harkin announced that NIOSH will consider the request of former Ames Lab workers to be included in the SEC   In 2005 after years of effort by former workers  advocates and government officials  former Iowa Army Ammunition Plant workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers were included in an SEC   Approximately two thirds of the eligible families have received this funding  While this memo will not affect the group of former IAAP workers who have already been included in the SEC  it could affect the Ames case          In 2000 Harkin sponsored and Congress passed the Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  which established a compensation program for former nuclear workers   Since then work has been underway to reconstruct radiation doses for workers across the country and to determine if workers who subsequently developed cancer and other illnesses likely developed the cancer as a result of radiation exposure               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
