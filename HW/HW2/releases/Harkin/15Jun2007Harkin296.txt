 WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin today urged Congress to support his legislation that would increase resources and support for soldiers and their families in need of mental health services  Harkin pointed to a new report by the Department of Defense Mental Health Task Force examining the mental health needs of military personnel and their families   The report points to significant shortfalls in the delivery of mental health services  Almost 40 percent of service members are in need of mental health services and there is a severe shortage of mental health professionals to serve them  The Task Force urged the Defense Department to ensure that psychological health is recognized as essential to the overall health and performance of our military   Harkin has introduced the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act and the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act  both of which would expand access to mental health and support services for American men and women who serve in uniform  and their families   We need a plan in place  from the frontlines to the bedside  to ensure that our military personnel and veterans are provided with the access to specialized mental health care they deserve  Harkin said  Our care for our soldiers should not only focus on the physical wounds  It must also consider the mental strain these soldiers and families endure  even after the fighting stops      The Task Force recommendations mirror many of the provisions in Harkins legislation  including ensuring improved mental health services for National Guard members  providing training for medical providers to recognize and treat service members in psychological distress  and expanding resources to ensure that that mental health services for veterans are more accessible  which would prevent the risk of suicide   The stress of war is not limited to the battlefield  As our soldiers return home  many have physical and mental scars that make it hard to readjust to civilian life  Harkin said  We have a moral obligation and a responsibility to ensure the men  women and families who so selflessly serve our nation have the resources they need to make a successful transition when they return home    Harkin has also raised concerns about the stigma of mental illness that prevents many from accessing services to treat mental illness and how a shortage of mental health professionals affects children of service members  The task forces recommendations also raised those concerns   Along with Rep  Leonard Boswell  D IA   Harkin introduced The Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act  which was named after a young Iowan who took his own life shortly after returning from Iraq  A recent study found that the risk of suicide among male veterans is double that of the general population   The bill would improve prevention and early detection and help veterans in crisis to prevent the needless deaths of those who have so bravely served our country  Specifically  The Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act would   Along with Rep  Bruce Braley  D IA   Harkin introduced the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act  which would help National Guard members and their families deal with the challenges they face before  during and after military deployments   The legislation is the result of the stepped up role Guard and Reserve members are shouldering in homeland security  and in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan  With many members on their third or even fourth deployment overseas  and with some deployments being stretched out to 16 months  the stress on their families can be quite severe  Guard and Reserve families are particularly vulnerable during this period because they usually don t live near a military base and do not have the same access to typical services as active duty military families   The legislation would expand and strengthen the existing family assistance program to ensure there is adequate professional staff to work with Guard and Reserve families at every point of the deployment cycle   as they prepare for deployment  during the long absence  and during reunification and readjustment  It would also       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
