      Year after year  farmers as well as livestock  dairy and poultry producers in Iowa continue to achieve new heights   So it is fitting that  from March 20 26  we observe National Agriculture Week and take time to celebrate the achievements of farm families in Iowa and across the country            Not a day goes past  it seems  that Iowa  s agricultural economy does not increase its contribution of agricultural products  develop a new use for the crops grown in our fields  implement new practices to preserve our air  water  soil and wildlife habitat  or cross new thresholds in our advance toward energy security   Take a look at the new ethanol plants springing up across the countryside  the biobased products  such as soy lubricants  being produced in Plainfield  or the eagerness of Iowa  s agricultural producers to participate in sound conservation practices  such as those included in the Conservation Security Program  or CSP          We have only just begun to tap the potential of renewable  farm based products   The sky is the limit    and Iowa is leading the way   But to sustain this pace of innovation and growth  we need to keep strong our working relationships at all levels   farmers  private industry  researchers and government                        That is why we must provide resources to research and develop new products  to help create and grow new businesses adding value to Iowa  s crops  and to market such products to the world   In addition  my congressional colleagues and I are working to draft and pass legislation to increase the use of clean  renewable fuels and to promote the use of products not made from a barrel of oil but from a bushel of corn or soybeans          We also must not turn back from the advances we have made in improving conservation efforts   From the Conservation Reserve Program  CRP  to practices on working land  all of Iowa  s agricultural producers are mindful of their impact on our environment and strive to be the best stewards of the land they can be   It is critically important that Congress maintain the resources dedicated to conservation programs  such as the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  or EQIP  the Wetlands Reserve Program  and the CSP          So  during National Agriculture Week  we applaud the farmers and ranchers  and livestock  dairy and poultry producers  whether they are in Iowa or elsewhere across the country  for all they do to improve the quality of life for everyone   This is a tremendously exciting time  and thanks to Iowa  s leadership  the future of agriculture remains very bright         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
