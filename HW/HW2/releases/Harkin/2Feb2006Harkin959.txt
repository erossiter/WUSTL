   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today urged major oil companies to ensure fuels made of high percentage blends of ethanol are more readily available at their branded gas stations nationwide   Harkin was joined by Senator Dick Lugar  R IN  in a letter prompted by reports of agreements that prohibit retail gasoline stations from selling ethanol blends  including E 85  or requiring that ethanol be offered to consumers at separate fuel pump islands away from the branded fuel offerings  Harkin asked that oil companies review and reform any such policies so that ethanol is conveniently offered to motoring consumers at gasoline stations across the country            Drivers want to use ethanol blended fuel  and they should not have to go to great pains to find it     said Harkin     Unfortunately  there appear to be road blocks impeding the sale of ethanol  preventing drivers from finding renewable fuels when filling up at the gas pump             Senator Harkin recently introduced legislation to ensure that within a decade all vehicles sold in the United States are   flex fuel    vehicles    that is  they are able to use regular gasoline or various ethanol blends up to 85 percent ethanol  known as E 85   With consumer demand growing for ethanol as well as flex fuel vehicles  making ethanol more widely available at the gasoline pump is a critical element toward increasing use of this environmentally friendly  cost competitive renewable fuel              By expanding driver access to ethanol  we can significantly decrease our reliance on foreign oil while stimulating demand for home grown ethanol     Harkin said     That  s a great deal for America  s drivers  the rural economy and the environment                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
