     I am pleased to give my support to John Jarvey to be a Federal District Judge for the Southern District of Iowa   John is currently a Magistrate Judge in the Northern District of Iowa  a position he has held for the past 18 years   I had a chance to meet with him last month in Iowa    and Mr  Chairman and members of the Committee    I can tell you that after 18 years    I believe it is time for a promotion                    John Jarvey started his legal career as a clerk to Judge Donald O  Brien  an excellent training ground for a federal judge   In his years as a Magistrate  he has developed an excellent reputation as a fair minded judge with a devotion to the law  and as a strong believer in judicial independence                     Based on the calls and letters received by my offices throughout Iowa  he has earned respect and admiration across the board   In fact  the Chief Judge of the Southern District  Robert Pratt and the Clerk of the Southern District Marjorie Krahn are with us today to demonstrate their support                     In his years as a Magistrate  John Jarvey has devoted a tremendous amount of time and energy to successful mediations  including a difficult tribal dispute in Iowa   He also regularly teaches the trial skills he developed as a federal prosecutor to students at the Drake University and the University of Iowa law schools   And as anyone who has spoken for more than a few minutes to John Jarvey knows  he is also a committed husband and father                  In selecting John Jarvey to be a Federal District Judge  I believe the President has made a very good choice and I look forward to his speedy confirmation                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
