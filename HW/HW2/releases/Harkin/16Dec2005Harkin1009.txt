         Earlier this year  I supported a Senate bill to reauthorize the Patriot Act   That bill made modest  but important changes to the original law to restore oversight to the very broad surveillance powers granted to the government   Unfortunately  all of these provisions were stripped from the final bill the Senate voted on today                    Just this morning  the New York Times reported that the government has secretly eavesdropped on the international phone and e mail conversations of perhaps thousands of people inside the United States without their knowledge  without evidence of criminal or terrorist activity  and without the consent of a judge  This abuse of our Constitutional rights should shock us all  and must be prevented               Judicial review is a critical restraint on unchecked power and an important check on the very broad surveillance powers that the government may use   In view of these new revelations  I am more committed than ever to seeing more judicial oversight included in a Patriot Act reauthorization   We should extend the original Patriot Act for an additional three months while we continue to work for these important changes                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
