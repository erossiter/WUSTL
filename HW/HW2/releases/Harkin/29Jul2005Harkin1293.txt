   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised Senate passage of  legislation expanding environmentally friendly renewable energy and sharply increasing use of home grown energy sources   Harkin successfully pushed to include provisions expanding use of ethanol  biodiesel and wind energy in the final version of the bill   These renewable resources promise an improved outlook for the energy future of America while providing real benefits to Iowa  s economy and the nation  s environment            This bill will provide a boost for farmers  businesses and rural communities in Iowa and across the nation     Harkin said     We have finally taken steps to shift energy production away from the Middle East toward America  s heartland             The energy bill passed by the Senate today includes many provisions that will utilize largely untapped energy sources from rural America   Included in the bill are the following provisions                  Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  of at least 7 5 billion gallons per year  doubling the use of ethanol and biodiesel in the country by 2012   Earlier this year  Harkin authored and introduced legislation  which the original Senate version of the bill adopted  establishing an eight billion gallon standard   The House passed an RFS of five billion gallons a year and energy conferees agreed to a 7 5 billion gallon RFS   The RFS will create roughly 200 000 jobs in rural America  add nearly  200 billion to U S  gross domestic product  and replace about two billion gallons of imported oil   It is estimated that the RFS will expand Iowa  s economy by approximately five percent                  Biobased Products and Fuels  An amendment based on much of Harkin  s National Security and Bioenergy Investment Act of 2005 was successfully included in the energy bill   These portions of the bill provide funding to increase research  development and deployment of biobased fuels  chemicals and power                    Renewable energy production tax credits expanding use of windpower and biodiesel   The wind power Production Tax Credit  PTC  will increase U S  wind power production and create thousands of jobs while generating additional income for rural areas   The energy bill also extends the biodiesel tax credit for three additional years   Also adopted was a Harkin amendment enabling individual members of agricultural cooperatives to receive the PTC   Also included was a Harkin provision providing low interest loans for small businesses and farmers hurt by high energy costs            These measures ensure our farmers and rural businesses can get into the energy business and help meet our nation  s energy needs     Harkin said     That  s good news for our energy security  agriculture  environment and families who need affordable energy             Passage of the energy bill today comes after four years of gridlock over House proposals that would give protection to oil companies from lawsuits resulting from MTBE damage to drinking water supplies   The energy bill passed today does not give companies exemption from MTBE liability              To be sure  there was much more we could have done in this bill to promote clean renewable energy     said Harkin     On balance  however  this is a good bill  and takes important steps to develop home grown energy sources             The energy bill passed by the Senate now heads to the President  s desk  who is expected to sign the measure into law            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
