        Thank you Lee for those kind words   In addition  I want to thank Lee and the International Labor Organization for their determined  relentless work on this issue of child labor   The ILO has been a wonderful partner to me  and I appreciate it                    Today  s report    The End of Child Labor  Within Reach     is a classic case of good news  bad news   But I  m pleased to report that then news  today  is mostly very good indeed                    For the first time  child labor  especially in its worst forms  is in decline across the globe   Between the years 2000 and 2004  the number of child laborers worldwide fell by 11 percent  from 246 million to 218 million                    Even better  the number of children and youth aged 5 17 trapped in hazardous work decreased by 26 percent  declining from 171 million in 2000 to 126 million in 2004   Among younger child laborers  the drop was even sharper at 33 percent                   This is remarkable progress in just four years   time   And looking to the future  the report cautiously predicts that         if the current pace of decline is maintained  and if global efforts to stop child labor continue       we have a real shot at eliminating child labor in its worst forms within 10 years   time                  However  the report makes no bones about the difficult challenges that lie ahead  especially in agriculture  where seven out of 10 child laborers work   I know this first hand from my work trying to end child labor in the cocoa industry   Child labor is deeply entrenched on cocoa plantations in Ivory Coast and elsewhere   But  with the cooperation of the chocolate industry  we are making very real progress                Likewise  in the broader fight against child labor  we are on the right track   And the great work of the ILO  s International Program on the Elimination of Child Labor really vindicates the confidence I have placed in this program   I secured the first federal appropriation for the IPEC program back in 1996   Over the last decade  I  ve secured a total of more than  323 million for IPEC   Clearly  that money has made a real difference in the lives of children   It has given them an opportunity to get an education    and to break the cycle of poverty                   I have been privileged to visit some of the IPEC programs around the world   In 1996  I visited former child laborers who had worked in the garment industry   In Brazil  I visited children who had been sexually exploited and were being rehabilitated   And in August of last year  I visited former child laborers who had worked making carpets in Pakistan  I have seen these successes first hand   It is amazing to hear their stories  and to see the hope in their eyes as they get an education   It is one of the most uplifting experiences of my career               I want to salute the ILO and IPEC for their aggressive approach to combating child labor   Over the last five years  they have worked with more than 30 ILO members states to put in place appropriate  time bound plans to eradicate the worst forms of child labor by the year 2016   Today  s report calls for all member states to adopt time bound action plans by 2008                The report also advocates linking child labor issues to the Millennium Development Goals framework and to ongoing UN programs    which is a terrific idea               Let me close with this thought   Dr  Martin Luther King  Jr   said that   the arc of history is long  but it bends toward justice      I would add  however  that it doesn  t bend all by itself   It takes persistent work by many dedicated individuals                    And it  s going to take more to end the worst forms of child labor by the year 2016  To coin a phrase  it  s going to take the entire global village  working in unison   And it  s going to take continued strong leadership from the ILO and its member states                 It is not enough for governments to ratify ILO conventions and hope that child labor will vanish on its own   It won  t   We need to turn words into deeds               So  again  I want to thank the ILO for its persistence and leadership on this issue   And thank you for producing this excellent report                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
