        If we have learned anything from the recent disasters on the Gulf Coast  it is that we must confidently prepare for disasters before they strike so that we are not left picking up the pieces     said Harkin     The possibility of an avian flu pandemic is very real  It would be worse than SARS  worse than anything else we have seen   I am gravely concerned that this country is woefully unprepared and that time is running out                Avian flu  also known as the bird flu  is a virus that to date has only been passed from birds to humans   However  experts predict that it is only a matter of time before the virus mutates and will be able to easily spread between humans creating a widespread public health crisis   In a matter of weeks  an outbreak in China  Vietnam or Cambodia could trigger a world wide outbreak facilitated by international travel and globalization   Harkin and Reid  s amendment called for a greater investment in our preparedness efforts including increased resources for public health infrastructure  global surveillance and detection  vaccines  and anti viral stockpiles            Specifically  the amendment would provide resources to         Double global surveillance of the avian flu through the Centers for Disease Control to identify and contain the avian flu virus around the world as soon as possible   Restore President Bush  s budget cuts to local and state public health departments and emergency preparedness activities to help communities recognize  treat  and quarantine the avian flu virus if it reaches our shores   The President  s budget cut  122 million from the grants to state and local public health departments for emergency preparedness activities  grants that were first funded by Harkin as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee in 2001 in response to the 9 11 attacks    Increase stockpiles of Tamiflu  the one known antiviral drug to be effective against the current strains of the avian flu   The World Health Organization has recommended that each country stockpile enough Tamiflu for 40 percent of their population   Though other countries have heeded this warning  the United States currently has only two million doses on hand    enough for one percent of the population   The additional resources would steadily add to the national stockpile  with a goal of accumulating enough Tamiflu to serve 50 percent of the population   Build up and strengthen our vaccine infrastructure   The United States currently does not have the capacity to create enough vaccines here at home   In the event of a pandemic  the US would have to rely on imported vaccines which countries may be unwilling to export   Provide new resources for outreach and education efforts to both health care providers and the public                        This is one of the biggest threats we face today     said Harkin     A flu pandemic is not a matter of if    but when  We must heed these warning signs  and take the time to invest in our public infrastructure   Instead of always looking into the read view mirror  we must do all we can to prevent a disaster  like avian flu  before it happens               Influenza viruses cause 20 000 to 40 000 deaths in the U S  each year   Many of these could be prevented with increased use of the influenza vaccine   Experts estimate that 90 000 to 300 000 Americans and up to 50 million people worldwide could die if left unprotected during an influenza pandemic            As a leader in Congress on public health issues  Harkin has pushed aggressively to strengthen the federal government  s focus on wellness and disease prevention   Harkin significantly increased funding for the Centers for Disease Control  bolstered its prevention programs  and authored legislation changing the agency  s name to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention   Along with Senator Arlen Specter  R PA   he doubled funding for the National Institutes of Health over a five year period                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
