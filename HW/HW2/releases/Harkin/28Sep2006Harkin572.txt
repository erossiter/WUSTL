      WASHINGTON D C       As the number of veterans returning from Iraq and Afghanistan continue to rise  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced a strategy to address the growing mental health needs of service members exposed to combat stress           Harkin  s new legislation would direct the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense to engage in a variety of activities to develop a comprehensive plan to improve diagnosis and treatment of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD   The plan would require the VA to create a curriculum and required protocols for training all VA clinicians to better screen for PTSD  It would also oblige the VA to commit additional staff and resources needed to diagnose and treat veterans with PTSD          Nationwide  there are more than 26 million veterans  Iowa is home to almost 266 000 former servicemen and women            We need a plan in place  from the frontlines to the bedside  to ensure that our veterans are provided with the access to specialized mental health care they deserve     Harkin said    Our care for our veterans should not only focus on the physical wounds  It must also consider the mental strain these soldiers bear  even after the fighting stops             While the physical wounds of war are often obvious  the opposite is true for the mental damage servicemen and women suffer in combat  One study shows that about 17  of active duty service members studied who served in Iraq screened positive for anxiety  depression  or PTSD   Another study indicates that this percentage may be growing  This is a number that is roughly comparable to rates of PTSD experienced by veterans of service in the Vietnam War  In the decades since  scientists have learned that quick intervention and ready access to services are keys to ensuring that an acute stress reaction does not become a chronic one  This is one of the goals of Harkin  s legislation            Our military men and women make great sacrifices to protect our country     Harkin said    The least we can do is ensure the comprehensive care they need is readily available             Harkin   legislation would require VA and the Department of Defense to jointly develop a plan for the production of educational information to advise clinicians on state of the art PTSD diagnosis and treatment  The VA would also develop clinical practice guidelines to ensure that clinicians are able to effectively distinguish between diagnoses with similar symptomatology that may manifest as PTSD  Finally  the VA would develop and implement a   model care    plan to integrate mental health and primary care in order to identify   best practices    for treatment of PTSD                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
