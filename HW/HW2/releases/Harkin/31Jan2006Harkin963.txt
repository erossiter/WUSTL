      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  released the following statement after President Bush  s State of the Union Address            If there is one thing we have learned about President Bush and the State of the Union it is that a promise made is a promise broken   The President talks about helping American families one night a year  but delivers only for the special interests the rest of the time                He promised fiscal responsibility   But today we face an  8 trillion dollar debt and record breaking deficit because of massive tax giveaways to the wealthy   He promised a reliable prescription drug benefit for seniors   But today thousands of Iowa seniors are struggling to deal with an overly complex plan while big drug companies rake in record profits              Tonight  the President made more promises to address the needs of America  s working families   He talked about health care   Unfortunately  his proposals benefit big insurance companies and do little to improve the health of individuals  They do nothing for modest income Americans who live paycheck to paycheck and don  t have the extra cash to deposit in a savings account every month   The President talked about reducing our dependence on foreign oil to address rising energy prices   I welcome that sentiment  and I sincerely hope that the President is willing to pay more than lip service to this problem as he has in the past            President Bush also talked tonight about America  s role in the world   The President  s policies have created more hostility toward the United States  and as a result of the Administration  s post war mismanagement Iraq poses a greater terrorist threat than ever before   President Bush once again failed to address this reality  and provided no clear plan to reduce these threats and make America safer   Our troops and the American people deserve better                                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
