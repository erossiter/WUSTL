        IAAP workers truly are unsung heroes of the Cold War  Unfortunately though  they have been treated with callous neglect by the government they loyally served     said Harkin    I am pleased the advisory board voted today to give closure  justice  and immediate compensation to IAAP workers             Once the NIOSH Advisory Board notifies Health and Human Services  HHS  Secretary Mike Leavitt  he will have 30 days to act  and following that Congress has 30 days to act   If no actions are taken to block the board  s recommendation  the cohort will take effect making IAAP workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers automatically eligible to receive  150 000         NIOSH  s Advisory Board unanimously agreed in February to recommend that all former IAAP workers be included in the SEC   However  the board never forwarded its recommendation to HHS   Instead  the advisory board met again this week in Cedar Rapids to review IAAP compensation issues  Harkin called on the board to promptly notify HHS Secretary Mike Leavitt about their decision this time so that former IAAP workers are not subject to any more delays         It is my hope that the NIOSH Advisory Board promptly notifies Secretary Leavitt of this decision so that these workers are not subject to any additional delays     said Harkin     It is long overdue that these workers be recognized for their service and sacrifice             Harkin  s office coordinated the first ever petition requesting that workers be added to the Special Exposure Cohort  SEC  and presented it to NIOSH on June 14  2004   In order to quickly move the IAAP petition  Harkin successfully added an amendment in June 2004 to the Defense Appropriations bill that speeds up efforts to administratively add workers to the cohort if recommended by HHS           IAAP was the   forgotten    nuclear weapons plant until Harkin brought it to the government  s attention after being contacted by Robert Anderson  a constituent and former IAAP worker who has non Hodgkins lymphoma  in 1997   Anderson presented the petition to the board today    Harkin was a Senate sponsor of the original Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 and of a bill to amend it last fall  and he has obtained government funding for health screening of workers at the plant                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
