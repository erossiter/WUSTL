        Mr  Chairman  thank you for calling this hearing this morning    I am concerned that the United States is unprepared for an outbreak    and a subsequent pandemic    of avian flu   We  ve had two major disasters in the last four years    9 11 and Katrina    and the federal government was totally unprepared for both despite warnings   Similarly  we have been warned in no uncertain terms about avian flu   This time  however  we must be prepared              As you know  avian flu    or H5N1    has only passed from bird species to humans  But experts tell us it is only a matter of time before the virus mutates and human to human transmission becomes widespread   An outbreak in China  Vietnam or Cambodia could trigger    within a couple weeks   time    a world wide outbreak facilitated by air travel and the mass movement of people across borders  Indeed  many experts say that it is not a matter of if    but when             Senator Specter and I worked together late last year to make sure that Congress provided funds to address a possible pandemic flu epidemic   We included almost  8 billion in the FY 2006 LHHS bill to address this possible pandemic   Those funds were intended to be used to upgrade state and local capacity  stockpile vaccines and antivirals  increase global surveillance activities  and to expand the domestic production of flu vaccine   Unfortunately  in the end  Congress only provided a little less than  4 billion for pandemic flu preparedness    less than half of what was included in the Senate LHHS bill and more than  3 billon less than requested by the President    One of our witnesses today has said in his written testimony that   this shortfall did not send a positive message to manufacturers about the the certainty and stability of the governments efforts to fully address a public health threat of this magnitude              I was also very disappointed that  while the final bill included immunity protections for vaccine manufacturers  it included no funds to protect those who receive the vaccine and now have no recourse against the manufacturer   Let me say that I favor limited liability protections for manufacturers of vaccines and other countermeasures related to avian flu  as long as compensation is also available to any individuals who suffer as result of their use   What is most disturbing is that this provision was added in the middle of the night after the conference report was signed   The Republican leadership abused their power and added a never before seen immunity protection provision more than six hours after the conference was closed             On a more positive note  we were able to designate  350 million of the funds appropriated to address pandemic flu for upgrading state and local response capacity to a pandemic   The President had only requested  100 million   State and local public health agencies will be on the front lines of both surveillance and disease prevention should an outbreak occur   Mr  Chairman  I am glad to see that you have asked a number of state and local public health       directors to today  s hearings   In particular  I am pleased to see that Dr  Mary Hansen  Director of the Iowa Department of Public Health will be testifying before the Subcommittee this morning    In fact  I will be joining Dr  Hansen and Secretary Leavitt at the flu summit in Des Moines this Friday            I am also pleased to see Dr  Julie Gerberding this morning   The Centers for Disease Control is doing a fine job working in cooperation with the World Health Organization and governments in affected regions to detect the disease and help to stop its spread  Surveillance can alert us to an outbreak  and governments can then take measures to isolate the disease so that widespread infection does not occur             So  again  thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this hearing and I look forward to hearing the testimony                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
