     At this time of year  many of us remember Charles Dickens   classic tale  A Christmas Carol   In the play  the selfish Scrooge comes to understand the true meaning of the holiday season  and opens his heart to the poor Cratchet family and those less fortunate than he              Unfortunately  here in Congress art does not imitate life   Congress is poised to deliver a harsh blow to those least fortunate in our society  but unlike the classic holiday tale  in Republican led Congress there is no remorse  no nagging conscience  and no change of heart at the end of the day               American families are in for quite a Christmas surprise this year   Let  s be clear about what is going on here              Later this week we will be asked to vote on three bills  the Labor HHS Appropriations bill  the Reconciliation package  and a Defense Appropriations bill                The Labor H bill   which funds programs like Head Start  community health centers  education initiatives  and community service programs serving the neediest among us   is cut by  1 5 billion              Skyrocketing fuel costs have caused huge demand for heating assistance   In Iowa  natural gas prices are up 40 percent   Hawkeye Area Community Assistance in Southeast Iowa reports that LIHEAP funds are likely to run out in mid January  one of the coldest months of the year   But this bill fails to keep up with the overwhelming need              And then there is the Reconciliation bill   cuts to food assistance for needy families  child support enforcement  and Medicaid services              And as if that weren  t enough  there  s another thing coming   a Defense spending bill with across the board cuts that will make things even worse              Right before Christmas we say to the poor in this country  we say to the low income families that are working and struggling to pay their heating bills  put food on the table  keep their families together  make it through the winter    Hang your stockings   Congress is coming with three lumps of coal                And why are we doing this   To make room for a new round   that  s right a new round   of tax cuts for the most fortunate   Over 50 percent goes to those making over  1 million   90 percent goes to people making over  100 000 a year              These are the choices   These are the priorities of this Congress   I don  t understand how we can do this  especially at this time of year   You would think our consciences would really bother us   But it is just business as usual around here   America can do better                                  A BILL ONLY THE GRINCH COULD LOVE        The Revised Labor HHS Education         Conference Report           The Senate and House will soon consider the revised FY 2006 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Conference Report   This bill still comes up short in virtually every critical area of need and further evidence that working and middle class families are paying the price for Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans   Overall  the revised conference report cuts labor  education  health care  and human services by  1 5 billion from last year              Health Care            Health care initiatives face  466 million in cuts  including a  249 million cut to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  and deep cuts to programs to improve healthcare access such as Rural Access to Emergency Devices  Maternal and Child Health Block Grants  and training for Health Professionals              The original conference reports slashed rural health programs by  200 million   The House leadership claims that the new conference agreement fixes those cuts   Don  t be fooled   The new conference agreement retains 70 percent of the cuts to rural health programs            Programs such as the Rural Emergency Medical Services and Healthy Communities Access Program are eliminated altogether   As a result of this bill  not one new community health center will be created next year             The bill also includes the smallest percentage increase for the National Institutes of Health  NIH  since 1970  which will hinder promising medical research and disease prevention initiatives            Education           This bill cuts education funding for the first time in a decade   The Department of Education is cut by  59 1 million  and No Child Left Behind Programs are cut by  780 million   There are cuts to Even Start literacy services  Safe and Drug Free Schools  and Technology Grants  and the maximum Pell Grant is frozen for the fourth year in a row even as college costs are skyrocketing   And  for the first time in 10 years  the federal government will slide backwards on its commitment to students with disabilities            Leaving Families Out in the Cold           The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  is frozen at last year s level  despite Department of Energy predictions that many families will see a 50 percent increase in fuel costs this winter        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
