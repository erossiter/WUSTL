 WASHINGTON  D C   As part of his ongoing effort to support Iowas first responders  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that the Boone Fire Department received  21 888 from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   These grants provide Boone firefighters with resources that will help them keep Iowa families safe  Harkin said  I am pleased these brave men and women are receiving the essential firefighting tools they need to effectively respond to emergencies    The AFG Program helps Iowa communities purchase firefighting equipment  improve facilities  and implement health and wellness programs  Fire departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel   Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments  At least 55 percent of the programs funding must go to fire departments that use volunteer firefighters  This means that towns like Boone are not competing against cities like Des Moines  Additionally  the program allows smaller communities to contribute less in local funding  In today s economy  this makes it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
