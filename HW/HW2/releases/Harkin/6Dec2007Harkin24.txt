   Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today issued the following statement on the procedural vote on the farm bill the Senate will take tomorrow  The farm bill passed the Senate Agriculture Committee on October 25th and was brought up on the floor November 5th  The bill has not moved since that time due to Senate Republicans efforts to pull into floor debate numerous amendments unrelated to agriculture policy that would bog down the farm bill and greatly delay and jeopardize its passage  Tomorrows vote marks the second attempt to end procedural wrangling and take action on the bill     The farm bill came to the Senate with great momentum  it stayed within pay as you go budgeting  yet provided needed investments to rural America  farming families and the nation  It is a bipartisan measure that passed Committee by voice vote without a single vote voiced against it  Yet after a month before the Senate  the bill remains deadlocked  The Republican leadership has rejected any deal to allow the farm bill to move forward     So clearly  with just two legislative weeks remaining before the holiday recess  we are heading toward a train wreck  And lets be clear  this train wreck will not be an accident  It has been plotted and planned at the White House  They hope to portray us as a do nothing Congress  And they are very open about trying to rebrand the Republican Party after six years of deficits and out of control spending     Maybe the Presidents political advisors are right  Maybe their train wreck strategy works for them as short term politics  But Ill tell you this for sure  It is irresponsible policy  and it is bad for the country     I take heart from the fact that there are some responsible Republican Senators and Representatives who understand this  They are urging the President and their leadership in Congress to end the deadlock  to negotiate  and to reach reasonable compromises     With goodwill and a spirit of compromise  we can pass a good farm bill before the holidays  This will be good for the country  And the President and his friends might just find that its good politics  too       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
