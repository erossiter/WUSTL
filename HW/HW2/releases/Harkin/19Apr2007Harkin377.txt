                     Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE  today reintroduced legislation to meet the federal government s commitment to fund 40 percent of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA                              Congress approved IDEA in 1975  requiring states to provide an appropriate education to students with special needs  While it committed to providing 40 percent of the funds to meet this requirement  today  federal funding has never exceeded 18 percent  This leaves state governments and local school districts to pick up the tab  many times at the expense of other necessary programs like remedial classes  after school tutoring and summer school                               At a time when state budgets are also being cut  Harkin stressed that this legislation to require full funding is even more urgent                                   Tight state budgets make it even more critical that the federal government live up to its commitment to fully fund IDEA   Harkin said    Any school administrator will tell you that special education costs are stretching school budgets to the limit   making it difficult to provide every child  including students with disabilities  with the quality education they deserve                                The IDEA Full Funding Act would fully fund IDEA in eight years through mandatory annual spending increases each year  until federal funding reaches  41 6 billion in 2015  These new resources will ensure that all children with disabilities receive a free  appropriate public education  By increasing the federal investment in special education  the bill would also free up local and state funds that had previously been used to meet IDEA requirements  This will allow districts in compliance new resources for other important education priorities such as teacher salaries  school construction  and technology improvements  Therefore  as the federal IDEA share grows  local school districts will have increased flexibility for all their education programs                                  This is a win win win bill   Harkin said   With these advance appropriations  students with disabilities will get the public education they have a right to  school districts will be able to provide services without cutting into their general education budgets and in many cases  property taxpayers will get relief                                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
