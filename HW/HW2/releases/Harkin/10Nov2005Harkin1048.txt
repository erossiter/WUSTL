      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation that would ensure all new gasoline powered motor vehicles sold in the United States are able to use fuel blends of up to 85 percent ethanol  E85    At a time when fuel costs are hurting family budgets and businesses nation wide  Harkin  along with Senators Dick Lugar  R IN  and Barack Obama  D IL  introduced the bill to gradually increase the percentage of   flex fuel    vehicles    those able to use regular gasoline or ethanol blends such as E85   Under Harkin  s legislation  within roughly a decade all new motor vehicles sold in the United States would be flex fuel capable  increasing drivers   access to renewable fuels that promise to reduce their fuel costs while lessening America  s dependence on foreign oil   Generally  E85 is significantly less expensive around the country than regular gasoline                 For too long  our country has been dependent on foreign oil  and now America  s drivers are paying the price at the pump     said Harkin     This legislation will free our drivers from relying solely on oil based gas and allow them the choice of using ethanol blends that could be saving families hundreds of dollars if cars were E85 compatible now                  Currently most drivers cannot use fuel blends with high ethanol content in their vehicles since only 2  of American cars are flex fuel capable   The legislation introduced today would require automobile manufacturers to gradually ramp up production of flex fuel vehicles and reward those who exceed minimum requirements for making flex fuel vehicle by giving credits that can be bought and sold among automobile manufacturers   Our heavy reliance on oil for fuel  the majority of which is imported from foreign countries  has left many consumers suffering from quickly rising gasoline costs with little alternative but to absorb those costs   The Harkin legislation introduced today would eventually ensure all drivers have increased choices in buying fuel  helping keep costs down              By expanding driver access to ethanol  we can decrease our reliance on foreign oil while stimulating demand for home grown ethanol     Harkin said     That  s a great deal for America  s drivers  the rural economy and the environment               The legislation introduced today is part of Harkin  s ongoing effort to reduce America  s dependence on oil through increased use of renewable fuels and alternative sources of energy   Harkin was instrumental in including provisions that will double the use of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012  renewable fuels standard  RFS  in the comprehensive energy bill enacted by Congress earlier this year   Harkin has also worked to improve driver access to renewable fuels like E85 by increasing their availability in gas stations nationwide and pushing auto makers to put stickers on vehicle fuel tanks indicating if they are capable of using high ethanol content fuel blends                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
