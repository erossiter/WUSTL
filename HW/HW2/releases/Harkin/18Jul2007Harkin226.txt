 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today applauded a pledge taken by 11 food and beverage companies to focus their advertising to children under age 12 on more nutritious foods  The companies also agreed to restrict advertising using licensed characters to products that meet nutritional standards  The participating companies account for an estimated two thirds of childrens food and beverage television expenditures in 2004   Clearly the momentum is building  and we are finding new allies in our fight against childhood obesity  said Harkin  By agreeing to only advertise and use licensed characters on healthier food choices  these food  beverage and restaurant companies have taken a significant and responsible step forward and shown their commitment to addressing obesity in children  They are also demonstrating that it makes good business sense to provide more nutritious food options and to use their marketing creativity to promote those healthier choices  I join with parents and families across the country today in commending these companies who have such a tremendous impact on what children in America are eating and drinking    The pledges emerged from a Council of Better Business Bureaus Childrens Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative  The companies also voluntarily opened their commitments up to the Better Business Bureaus independent compliance monitoring and reporting  More information about the pledges and the Better Business Bureau initiative can be found at www BBB org   Senator Harkin is the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children  Most recently  he has been working with Senator Sam Brownback  R KS  and others on the FCC Task Force on Media and Childhood Obesity  an innovative public private partnership aimed at combating the clear and present health dangers stemming from poor nutrition and childhood obesity   As I work with Senator Brownback and the FCC Task force to make our recommendations in the upcoming weeks  I hope that media companies can commit to similar responsible initiatives to build on these efforts  said Harkin   With the health of our children at stake  our entire society must do its part and the time to act together is now       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
