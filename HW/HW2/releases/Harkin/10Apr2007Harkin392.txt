                  Today begins 20 hours of Senate debate on a bill to lift the Administration s restrictions on stem cell research  and bring hope to millions of people in this country who are suffering from ALS  juvenile diabetes  Parkinson s  cancer  spinal cord injuries  and so many other devastating diseases and conditions                                 Most Americans probably find it hard to believe we re still arguing about this issue   They understand the power of stem cell research   They ve listened to the scientists   They watched the House and Senate vote overwhelmingly during the last Congress to expand the Administration s policy   Then they went to the polls in November  and more often than not  elected candidates who support stem cell research   So why are we still debating this                              The answer  unfortunately  is simple   President Bush used the first and  so far  only veto of his administration to reject last year s stem cell bill and dash the hopes of millions of Americans  So we re back here once again                                   I want to thank my colleagues in the Senate who have worked with me on this issue  starting with my friend  Arlen Specter   He chaired the very first hearing in Congress on embryonic stem cells  back in December 1998   In all  our Labor  Health and Human Services  and Education Appropriations subcommittee has held 20 hearings on this research since then                               I also want to thank the other Senate leaders on stem cell research   Senator Hatch  Senator Kennedy  Senator Smith  and Senator Feinstein    Counting Senator Specter and myself  there are 3 Republicans and 3 Democrats on that list   This has been a truly bipartisan effort all the way                              And I want to thank Majority Leader Harry Reid for scheduling this debate and making sure it s one of the first issues we vote on in the 110th Congress                                 But most of all  I want to thank all the hundreds of thousands of families and patients who never gave up  who kept up the pressure to bring this bill to the floor  and who are so eager to see S  5 sent to the President s desk   They have kept the faith   And now it is our job to see that they are not disappointed                               Under the unanimous consent agreement  we will debate and vote on two bills   But make no mistake  the only one that really matters is S  5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   This is the one bill that  at long last  will unleash some of the most exciting and promising research of modern times                               As we begin this debate  it s a good time to step back and ask   Why is there so much support for S  5   I have here a letter signed by 525 groups endorsing this bill   patient advocacy groups  health organizations  research universities  scientific societies  religious groups    525 groups in all   They all agree that Congress should pass S  5  Why is that                             Because embryonic stem cell research offers hope   Hope for people with Lou Gehrig s disease   Hope for people with Parkinson s   Hope for people with spinal cord injuries   Hope for people with heart disease   Hope for people with diabetes   Hope for people with cancer                           All told  more than 100 million Americans have diseases that one day could be treated or cured with embryonic stem cell research                              But it s not just us members of Congress who are saying that   No one should take our word alone                           Three weeks ago  Dr  Elias Zerhouni  the director of the National Institutes of Health  appeared before the Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee   I asked him whether scientists would have a better chance of finding new cures and treatments if the Administration s current restrictions on embryonic stem cell research were lifted   Dr  Zerhouni said yes                         Dr  Zerhouni is the federal government s top scientist in the area of medical research   President Bush appointed him to his position as NIH director   So it took great courage on his part to say in public that his boss has it wrong on stem cell research   But he did so because it s the truth                           It is clear today that American science would be better served and the nation would be better served if we let our scientists have access to more cell lines   Dr  Zerhouni said    It is in the best interest of our scientists  our science and our country that we find ways and the nation finds a way to allow the science to go full speed across adult and embryonic stem cells equally                             It s not just NIH scientists who believe this way  of course   Dr  J  Michael Bishop  who won the Nobel Prize in Medicine  wrote recently    The vast majority of the biomedical research community believes that human embryonic stem cells are likely to be the source of key discoveries related to many debilitating diseases                                   I could go on  but you get the picture   Scientists agree   Embryonic stem cell research offers enormous hope for easing human suffering                               Now  some may ask   I thought the Federal Government already supports embryonic stem cell research                               Well  let me try to explain the President s policy   He said that federally funded scientists could conduct research on embryonic stem cells only if the cells had been derived before August 9  2001  at 9 p m   I never quite understood that   Why 9 p m    Why not 9 30   If stem cell research is morally OK at 8 59 p m   why isn t it OK at 9 01   It s totally arbitrary                               But for whatever reason  the President said that only those stem cell lines derived by 9 p m  on August 9  2001  were eligible for federally funded research                            At the time  some of us hoped that the President s policy would work   But it hasn t  and here s why                           When President Bush announced his policy  he said that 78 stem cell lines were eligible for federally funded research   But  today  only 21 of those 78 lines are eligible   and that s not nearly enough to reflect the genetic diversity that scientists need to develop treatments for everyone in the country                            What s more  all 21 lines are contaminated with mouse cells  making it unlikely that they will ever be used in humans                            And many of those lines are becoming unstable  in a sense  one scientist told me  the lines themselves are getting sick   In fact  according to Dr  Elizabeth Nabel  the director of the NIH Heart  Lung  and Blood Institute  only 4 of the 21 federally approved lines are in common use by NIH funded scientists   Only 4   Dr  Jeremy Berg  another NIH director  was a little more generous   he said there are 6 lines in common use                            So  yes  stem cell research is taking place   But our top scientists are working with one arm tied behind their back  because of the President s restrictions   And it s having a chilling impact on scientists who are thinking about entering the field                      According to Dr  Nora Volkow  director of the NIH drug abuse institute  the Administration s policy is discouraging scientists from applying for NIH funding to conduct stem cell research   In a letter to me last year  she wrote    Despite general interest and enthusiasm in the scientific community for embryonic stem cell research  the limited number of available lines has translated into a general lack of research proposals                             So the President s policy is not a way forward  it is a dead end   It offers only false hope to the millions of people across America and the world who are suffering from diseases that could be cured or treated through embryonic stem cell research                                Meanwhile  hundreds of new stem cell lines have been derived since the President s arbitrary deadline of August 9  2001   The NIH estimates that there are about 400 worldwide   Many of those lines are uncontaminated and healthy   But they re totally off limits to federally funded scientists                                       Scientists in many other countries around the world don t face these kinds of arbitrary restrictions   When you talk to researchers in England  for example  our policy makes no sense to them   They can t understand why stem cell lines derived on one date are fine to use  but if they re derived on another date  they re off limits                                   And that s a shame   We don t require astronomers to explore the skies with 19th century telescopes  and we don t tell our geologists to study the Earth with a tape measure   If we are serious about realizing the promise of stem cell research  our scientists need access to the best stem cell lines available                                       Again  don t just take my word for it   Dr  Story Landis runs the stem cell task force at NIH   In January  she appeared before a joint hearing of the HELP Committee and my subcommittee   Senator Kennedy asked her whether scientists are missing out on possible breakthroughs under the Administration s current policy  and this was her answer                                       Yes  we are missing out on possible breakthroughs   From a purely scientific perspective  Federal funding of additional cell lines is necessary to advance the field                               We need a stem cell policy in this country that offers true  meaningful hope to patients and their loved ones   And that s what S  5 would provide                              Under this bill  federally funded researchers could study any stem cell line  regardless of the date that it was derived  as long as strict ethical guidelines are met                                 And I think it s important to run through some of those guidelines   First  the only way a stem cell line could be eligible for federally funded research is if it were derived from an embryo that was otherwise going to be discarded   There are more than 400 000 embryos in the United States that are left over from fertility treatments and are currently sitting frozen in storage   The moms and dads have had all the children they want  and they no longer need any more of their embryos   Most of those embryos will eventually be discarded  it happens every single day at fertility clinics all over the country   All we re saying is  instead of discarding all 400 000 of those leftover embryos  let s allow couples to donate a few of them  if they wish  to create stem cell lines that could cure diseases and save lives                                    So   Throw them away  or use them to ease suffering   It is the second choice  I believe  that is truly moral and truly respectful of human life                                    The second ethical requirement in S  5 is that couples have to provide informed  written consent to donate their embryos   A lot of people don t realize this  but the President s policy is pretty fuzzy on the matter of informed consent   Some of the 21 federally approved lines   especially the ones that come from other countries   don t meet that requirement   So we need to pass S  5 to tighten the ethical guidelines on stem cell research  so there s no question that the embryos were donated properly                              And finally  S  5 prohibits women from being paid to donate their embryos   There is no chance under this bill that women could be exploited to go through the donation process against their will                            In all these respects  S  5 is identical to the stem cell bill that the Senate passed last year  H R  810   But this year s bill has one significant change   It now includes the text of last year s Specter Santorum bill  which passed the Senate unanimously but got tied up in the House and died at the end of the 109th Congress   That bill  which President Bush strongly endorsed  encouraged NIH to pursue alternative ways of deriving stem cells  in addition to our current method                                 As I ve made very clear  I support any ethical means to improve the lives of human beings who are suffering   I believe we should open every door we can in the pursuit of cures   So what we ve done in the new version of S  5 is to combine the two bills that the Senate passed overwhelmingly last year but did not become law   H R  810 and the Specter Santorum bill   By voting for S  5  Senators can show that they support all forms of stem cell research                                       And that s really the key difference between S  5 and S  30  the other bill we ll vote on this week   S  30 puts all its hopes in theories   alternative ways of deriving stem cells that might work  or they might not   At this point  no one knows                              S  30 tells scientists   Don t use any of the 400 existing stem cell lines that have already been derived   Instead  put all your effort into figuring out some new way of deriving stem cells that might take 10 years to pan out  or not at all                                 For example  the proponents of S  30 will talk a lot over the next 2 days about stem cells that could allegedly be derived from  dead embryos    embryos that aren t healthy and have stopped growing   I have to tell you  The idea that we could cure juvenile diabetes and ALS and Parkinson s with something called  dead embryos  doesn t exactly inspire me with a lot of confidence                                   Think about it   If you were treating someone with embryonic stem cells  would you rather use stem cells that came from a healthy embryo  or a dead embryo   The dead embryo died for a reason   There s something wrong with it   Chances are  the stem cells that come from that dead embryo aren t so great  either   So why does anyone think a dead embryo holds the secret to curing juvenile diabetes                           Meanwhile  S  30 reaffirms the President s prohibition against federal research on stem cell lines derived after Aug  9  2001  Therefore  the bill would continue to designate the 400 or so lines that have been derived since that date as off limits to federally funded researchers                         S  5  by contrast  would immediately make those hundreds of new lines eligible for federal research  as long as they were derived under the bill s strict ethical guidelines                            So S  30 might not do any harm   But it doesn t do any good  either   And that s just one more reason why we need to keep our focus on S  5                            If this year s debate goes like last year s  then we can also expect opponents of S  5 to make a lot of unfounded claims about adult stem cells   To repeat  I m all for adult stem cell research   Adult stem cells are being used successfully today in treating several blood related diseases   Our scientists should continue this area of research                           But adult stem cells have their limits   They can t do everything that embryonic stem cells can do                            Again  don t take my word for it   Listen to what Dr  Zerhouni  the nation s highest ranking medical researcher  has to say about adult stem cells                              The presentations about adult stem cells having as much or more potential than embryonic stem cells  in my view  do not hold scientific water   I think they are overstated   I think we do not know at this point where the breakthroughs will come from  My point of view is that all angles in stem cell research should be pursued                             I could not agree more  Mr  President   Most people could not care less which cells are used to develop a cure   they just want a cure                           Karli Borcherding is one of the millions of Americans whose hopes depend on stem cell research   Karli lives in Ankeny  Iowa   I met her last fall   She just celebrated her 12th birthday  and she has type I diabetes   also called juvenile diabetes                              When people have this disease  their body stops making insulin   So they have to inject it  either through needles or a pump                             Here s a picture of Karli with one month s worth of needles   There are 120 of them   Look at those needles  and imagine injecting yourself with them four times a day                              Karli never gets a vacation from juvenile diabetes   It s with her everywhere she goes   at school  home  on field trips and holidays                            She told me   My dream is that one day we will find a cure for juvenile diabetes and I can go back to being just a normal kid                             If adult stem cells could bring Karli a cure  she d gladly take it   But scientists have known about adult stem cells for 40 years  and they still haven t provided the answer for juvenile diabetes                              We cannot keep telling people like Karli   Embryonic stem cells might bring you a cure  but sorry  the Federal government is not interested   We cannot keep telling the millions of Americans who have Parkinson s  and ALS  and cancer  and spinal cord injuries   Sorry  we know that embryonic stem cell research might ease your suffering  but we d rather not do anything about it                              Now is our chance to change that   I urge Senators to think about Karli Borcherding and all the people in their lives who could benefit from stem cell research  and vote yes on S  5                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
