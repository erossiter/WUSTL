         Washington  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today wrote letters to President Bush and the Federal Emergency Management Agency s Acting Director R  David Paulison urging them to expedite requests for federal assistance in response to the winter ice storms that recently hit Iowa  Thousands of homes are still without power almost a week after the storm                          My heart goes out to Iowans who are still without power and who have suffered damage due to these severe winter storms   Harkin said    I urge the Bush Administration to work closely with state and local officials to ensure that federal assistance is immediately made available to all those in need                        Federal assistance will be vital to many Iowa counties who lack resources needed to repair the storm damage   Governor Chet Culver has declared 60 counties state disaster areas and has requested a Presidential Disaster Declaration for the following 46 counties  Benton  Black Hawk  Boone  Bremer  Buchanan  Butler  Calhoun  Cedar   Chickasaw  Clinton  Des Moines  Fayette  Floyd  Franklin  Greene  Grundy  Hamilton   Hardin  Henry  Howard  Humboldt  Iowa  Jackson  Jasper  Jefferson

The Honorable George W  Bush                    President of the United States                       The White House                      Washington  D C  20500                       Dear Mr  President                             Much of the state of Iowa has suffered from damage as a result of a winter ice storm over the weekend of February 23 25  2007   Preliminary damage estimates show abnormally high amounts of debris clean up due to the ice and heavy  wet snow   Thousands of homes are still without power almost a week after the event                      Governor Chet Culver has declared 60 counties a state disaster   It is my understanding that the Governor has asked for federal disaster assistance for 46 of those counties  Benton  Black Hawk  Boone  Bremer  Buchanan  Butler

strongly support Governor Culver s request for a Presidential Disaster Declaration for the counties in Iowa affected by this storm   These counties require federal assistance due to the lack of resources at the local level   The electric power transmission system suffered severe damage and many Rural Electric Cooperatives were greatly impacted by the storm   Additionally  many of these counties are relatively small and cannot easily afford to pay for the cost of the damage to their infrastructure without raising property taxes and putting an undue burden on many who have already suffered a loss   I urge you and your staff to work closely with state and local officials to ensure that federal assistance is made available to all those in need   Thank you for your assistance                       Sincerely                              Tom Harkin             United States Senator                                  March 2  2007                 R  David Paulison  Acting Director
