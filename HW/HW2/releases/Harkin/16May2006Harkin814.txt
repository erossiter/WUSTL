        This ambitious bi partisan legislation will boost production and use of biofuels while reducing our dangerous and costly addiction to foreign oil     Harkin said    With soaring fuel prices  we must take a much more aggressive approach to boosting home grown biofuels   This legislation will increase the use of ethanol and biodiesel in our fuel supply   And it will ensure America  s vehicles can use and America  s drivers can find renewable fuels               Specifics of Harkin  s proposal are as follows                  A bold new RFS  Harkin  s legislation proposes a bold new renewable fuels standard  RFS  that calls for 60 billion gallons of ethanol and biodiesel to be included in the United States motor vehicle fuel supply annually by the year 2030   It calls for boosting ethanol and biodiesel production to 10 billion gallons annually by 2010  30 billion gallons by 2020 and then 60 billion gallons by 2030   This is achievable given the rapid expansion of the biofuels industry  increasing farm yields  the emergence of technology to make ethanol from cellulose  and favorable public policies  Ethanol  for example  has been expanding by approximately 25  annually and Harkin  s proposed RFS would support continued growth of this magnitude into future years   Harkin proposed an 8 billion gallon RFS by 2012 that was adopted last year as part of the Senate version of the energy bill   The House RFS was only 5 billion gallons   The final RFS in the energy bill was 7 5 billion gallons by 2012               Greater Availability of E85 pumps   Harkin  s legislation calls for increasing the number of gasoline stations that carry blends of 85  ethanol  E85    Harkin proposes requiring large oil companies to install E85 pumps at their stations  increasing by five percentage points annually over the next 10 years  resulting in 50  of branded gasoline stations having E85 pumps   This would ensure that approximately 25  percent of all gasoline stations nationwide have E85 pumps available within a decade  The legislation provides tax incentives for installation of E85 pumps  including targeted credits for smaller gasoline stations   The legislation would also ensure oil companies do not discriminate against installation of E85 pumps at their gas stations             Driver Access to flex fuel vehicles  FFV  s    Harkin  s legislation would direct automakers to gradually increase flex fuel vehicle production  increasing in ten percentage point increments annually  until nearly all vehicles sold in the U S  are FFV  s within 10 years   Currently  flex fuel vehicles    those able to use both regular gasoline and blends of up to 85  ethanol  E85     make up only about two percent of vehicles on the road today             We must do much more to increase our use of home grown ethanol and biodiesel     Harkin said     For too long  we  ve depended on importing oil to meet our energy needs   This legislation lays the roadmap to a long term ramp up in domestically produced renewable fuels   We can and we must achieve these aggressive goals to attain national and economic security for America           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
