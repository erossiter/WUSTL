     WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  called for the USDA to take corrective action to fix the distribution formula for the Environmental Quality Incentives Program  EQIP   based on a Government Accountability Office report released today that finds serious problems with the current funding formula  The report points to significant discrepancies in data used to allocate money and a disconnect between the funding formula and the purposes of the program  Harkin is the ranking Member on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee and requested the report from GAO                  USDA  s funding formula shortchanges many states with serious environmental needs related to agriculture     Harkin said    I am asking Secretary Johanns to ensure that the formula fairly addresses the conservation needs of all states  is clearly related to the purposes of the program and is supported by hard data                    EQIP assists agricultural producers who install or adopt agricultural conservation practices  such as planting vegetation along streams  nutrition management and installing animal waste storage facilities  to conserve and improve water  air  and soil  EQIP is a voluntary program managed by the U S  Department of Agriculture  s  USDA  Natural Resources Conservation Service  NRCS   NRCS allocates about  1 billion in financial and technical assistance funds to states annually  About  650 million of the funds are allocated through the general financial assistance formula examined by the GAO  with the rest going to several subprograms               Some of the significant problems identified in the GAO report include                     Statistical analysis in the report shows that the formula is biased in favor of factors   indicative of dryland agriculture and livestock feeding and ranching       Texas receives a disproportionately large share of EQIP funding  nearly 5 times the average of the other states  and 50  more than California  the second ranked state   The formula  s tilt toward a small number of factors may explain this striking bias in funding                       The formula relies upon 10 factors  out of 31  for which NRCS was unable to provide GAO the source of the data used   Yet millions of dollars of federal funds are allocated based on these factors                    In some instances  the NRCS would use the same data in applying two different funding formula factors  overemphasizing these factors relative to others   For instance  NRCS used the same data source to estimate both phosphorous runoff and the runoff of pesticides and nitrogen  despite the fact that these nutrients have different transport mechanisms                   GAO found that USDA is using outdated data in the allocation formula which raises questions whether the formula allocates funds to areas of the country that currently have the greatest environmental needs  since recent changes in a state  s agricultural or environmental status may not be reflected                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
