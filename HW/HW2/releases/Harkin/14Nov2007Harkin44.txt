    WASHINGTON  D C   As part of his ongoing effort to support Iowas first responders  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that the Guttenberg Fire Department received  38 000 from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee     Guttenbergs hardworking firefighters deserve to have the best equipment and training available  Harkin said  These grants help local fire departments with limited funding obtain the resources they need to keep Iowa families safe     The AFG Program helps Iowa communities purchase firefighting equipment  improve facilities  and implement health and wellness programs  Fire departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new ambulances  fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel     Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments  For example  at least 55 percent of the programs funding must go to fire departments that use volunteer firefighters  which ensures that small towns do not have to compete with large cities for funding  Additionally  the program allows smaller communities to contribute less in local funding  These stipulations make it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
