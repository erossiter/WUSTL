            WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today said the new Children  s Food and Beverage Advertising Initiative and revisions to the Self Regulatory Guidelines for Children  s Advertising by the Council of Better Business Bureaus  CBBB  and National Advertising Review Council  NARC  mark progress  but stressed that significant work still remains  Harkin is a long time advocate of improving marketing practices toward children            These steps show that the industry is headed in the right direction in the ongoing battle to combat childhood obesity and surging rates of diabetes in children     Harkin said    But the industry also has a significant way to go and more companies need to join the fight to have a true impact             Under the new guidelines the Children  s Advertising Review Unit  CARU  has expanded oversight authority if advertising targeted to children is found to be   unfair    or   deceptive     The new initiative also aims to gain pledges from companies to commit at least 50 percent of their advertising to children under 12 to promoting improved dietary choices and healthy lifestyles          Harkin pledged to monitor how the initiative is implemented and enforced             If employed successfully  this could be a good first step     Harkin said    But the program leaves companies significant leeway to continue marketing unhealthy foods to kids  And  ultimately  the new initiative is only as good as the enforcement             While supporting the effort  Harkin pointed to other companies  such as Disney Co   that have developed stronger nutritional guidelines to follow when advertising to kids            I encourage more companies to go beyond the 50 percent benchmark and use all of their creativity  resources  and marketing practices to help improve the health of our nation  s children     Harkin said          Harkin added    Ultimately  Congress will examine this issue closely  As the Institute of Medicine urged in its report last year  government has a responsibility to foster the development and promotion of healthful diets and lifestyles for our kids                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
