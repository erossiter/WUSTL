         WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today offered a proposal to break a the log jam of lawsuits against companies that have allegedly bilked the government out of billions of taxpayer dollars through contracting abuses in Iraq and Afghanistan   Currently  the Department of Justice  DOJ  is holding up dozens of whistleblower lawsuits alleging contract fraud in Iraq and Afghanistan   Harkin  s amendment would require that DOJ provide a report to Congress twice a year detailing the resources and action plans it is using to pursue these cases and ensure that they are vigorously prosecuted   The amendment was offered to the Department of Defense reauthorization bill  which is currently being considered by the Senate            Billions of taxpayer dollars continue to be squandered in Iraq and Afghanistan     said Harkin     Courageous whistleblowers  who have come forward often at great personal risk  have been left in a legal limbo because the Justice Department has been sitting on their cases   This amendment will ensure that the Justice Department explains both to Congress and the American people what exactly it is doing to put an end to these abuses             Under the False Claims Act  whistleblowers can bring a case against a company suspected of being involved in fraudulent contracts  In order for the cases to be pursued  the Department of Justice must make a decision to either join the case or put off further action which could allow the government to delay cases indefinitely  To date  the Justice Department has allowed       only one of these lawsuits to move forward and that case ultimately recovered a large amount of fraudulent payments            The Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction has said that nearly  9 billion in funds intended for Iraqi reconstruction has been lost through contracting fraud             The scope of these abuses is both breathtaking and awful for the American taxpayer and Iraqis who are supposed to benefit from these contracts     Harkin said     It  s intolerable that the Administration is allowing its Justice Department to block legitimate legal attempts to bring to justice the bad apples who are abusing the system                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
