        President Bush has wracked up the largest deficits in American history   As a result we may have to make some tough choices  but tough choices have to be fair   This budget does not live up to our values and priorities   Why should a Wall Street banker making over  1 million a year get another tax break  while kids in rural Iowa have to give up their Head Start            What is perhaps most troubling is that this president not only has a double standard when it comes to the sacrifices in this budget  he also seems to have two sets of books   The budget sent to Congress today completely ignores the biggest ticket spending items of all including spending for the war in Iraq   expected to grow by an additional  80 billion next month  the president  s Social Security scheme  which will cost taxpayers  4 trillion in start up costs alone  and his proposal to extend the costly tax cuts for the wealthy  with a  2 trillion price tag   No family writing their annual budget would simply leave out the mortgage payments  grocery bills and college tuition costs for their kids    The president needs to level with the American people about all the obligations we face  but this budget fails to do that                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
