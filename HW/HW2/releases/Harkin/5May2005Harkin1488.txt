        In recent years  Congress has worked hard on a bipartisan basis to improve the integrity of the Food Stamp Program   The new report from the Government Accountability Office shows not only that those efforts are bearing fruit  but that the Food Stamp Program is working better than ever     said Harkin     This report confirms what we knew all along  that significant budgetary savings cannot be squeezed from a program that  in reality  has very low levels of payment inaccuracy             Among the findings of the GAO report were the following           The error rate for the Food Stamp Program has declined by almost one third over the past five years from 9 86 percent in 1999 to a record low of 6 63 percent in 2003   98 percent of households receiving food stamps were eligible for the program   The decline has been widespread and the rate has fallen in 41 states and DC   By reducing the error rate between 1999 and 2003  the Food Stamp Program avoiding paying out some  700 million in erroneous payments in 2003 alone that it would otherwise have paid had the error rates from 1999 remained constant      Of the errors reported in the Food Stamp Program  two thirds are the result of caseworker error  such as failure to act on reported changes in income or making mistakes in applying program rules   while one third are the result of participant error  such as failing to report income changes   In addition  declining error rates in the Food Stamp Program have occurred at a time of rapidly rising participation in the program  showing increased efficiency and targeting of resources      The Food Stamp Program is doing precisely what Congress designed it to do    delivering needed benefits to over 25 million Americans  the vast majority of them children  the elderly  and working families   This is not the time to be cutting the program back and hurting those that benefit from it     said Harkin            The Food Stamp Program error rate represents the combined total of the food stamp overpayment rate as well as the underpayment rate    that is  benefits due to eligible recipients that they did not receive   If the underpayments were subtracted from the overpayments  arguably a more accurate way of measuring total food stamp benefits paid in error  the aggregate food stamp payments overpaid would equal  760 million for fiscal year 2003  just 3 5 percent of total food stamp benefits          Harkin is a long time supporter of federal food assistance program and is the Senior Democrat on the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry  the Senate Committee with jurisdiction over the federal food assistance programs   A copy of the report is attached                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
