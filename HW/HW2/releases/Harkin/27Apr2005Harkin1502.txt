        If the president is truly committed to cleaner burning renewable fuels  you would not know it from his past actions     Harkin said     The proposed cuts to the energy title of the farm bill in the president  s budget show his lack of commitment to renewables   If we want to displace petroleum and make the nation more energy secure  we need a stronger RFS  and I urge the President to support such a measure             Harkin recently introduced a bill with Senator Richard Lugar  R IN  that would mandate a federal RFS of eight billion gallons by 2012   Recently the House passed an energy bill that contained an RFS three billion gallons lower than that proposed in the Harkin Lugar Senate bill   President Bush  in a speech today  outlined energy proposals and noted he supports renewable fuels            The president talked about energy independence today  but has failed to take the necessary steps to make this a reality   If he wants biofuels to be a cornerstone of the nation  s energy policy  we need a larger RFS to stimulate our rural economies and replace foreign oil                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
