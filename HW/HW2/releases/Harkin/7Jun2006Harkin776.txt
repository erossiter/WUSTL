         WASHINGTON  DC    Joining a bipartisan group from around the country  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today backed a proposal which aims to use farm and rural friendly renewable energy sources to achieve 25 percent of the nation  s energy supply by 2025   Specifically  the resolution would help dramatically boost ethanol  biodiesel  wind  solar  and biomas to meet America  s energy needs   This   25X25    goal promises to have broad and far reaching benefits for America  s energy future and rural economy            Increasing our use of renewable energy is good news for America  s energy security  Iowa  s economy and the environment     Harkin said    We must aggressively pursue home grown energy such as ethanol  biodiesel and wind power instead of continuing our addiction to foreign sources of energy             Harkin has been a leader in Congress in boosting renewable energy   As then Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2002  Harkin established the first ever renewable energy title in the farm bill   The energy title calls for boosting grants  loans and other financial assistance for farmers and rural communities to invest in and produce renewable energy such as ethanol  biodiesel  wind power and other value added agriculture   The energy title also directs the federal government to purchase industrial  non food or feed  biobased products identified by USDA as long as they are available  perform well  and are not unreasonably priced             Harkin successfully included provisions into the 2005 energy bill that called for dramatically boosting research  development and deployment of biofuels from a wide array of feedstocks including corn stover  wood chips  switchgrass and other sources  also known as cellulosic ethanol   In addition  he authored a wind power provision allowing farm cooperatives to pass wind production tax credits on to their members              It  s unfortunate that it takes soaring prices at the gasoline pump to change Washington  s thinking on farm based renewable energy     said Harkin     We can and we must move ahead to boost home grown energy and we need to set high benchmarks to achieve   This resolution does just that and I  m optimistic that America can achieve it             In addition  Harkin recently introduced the bi partisan Biofuels Security Act  a comprehensive plan to increase American biofuels production and use   The plan calls for boosting the availability of E85 pumps and flex fuel vehicles  those capable of using E85  while ensuring a greater supply of ethanol and biodiesel is blended into the nation  s fuel supply   Harkin sees biofuels production and use as critical to reducing American dependence on foreign oil                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
