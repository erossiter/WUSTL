        Skyrocketing gasoline prices continue to burden our economy and strain the family budget     Harkin said     Blending more ethanol into our fuel supply could lower these costs immediately   Yet oil companies refuse to budge  Americans deserves to know why oil companies making record profits insist that families pay top dollar at the pump when prices could be reduced by blending more lower priced ethanol into our fuel supply   I intend to find out             Ethanol  a product derived from corn and produced here in the United States  can be blended into gasoline and used in cars for fuel   Domestic production of ethanol is expected to reach four billion gallons this year   And as oil prices have soared  ethanol prices remain comparatively low    By substituting some ethanol for gasoline derived from oil in our national fuel supply  gasoline prices could be reduced  saving families at the pump            In fact  a Consumer Federation study released last week found that U S  consumers could be paying as much as 8 cents a gallon less for gasoline if oil companies used lower priced ethanol rather than higher priced petroleum components   At this rate  blending more ethanol into gasoline could save the typical Iowa family more than  85 at the pump each year          Yet oil companies are deliberately keeping oil supplies tight and prices high  even though domestically produced ethanol supplies are plentiful and have dropped as much as 50 cents per gallon since the beginning of the year   Oil companies  petroleum refiners and distributors continue to refuse to blend more into the fuel supply  preferring to use more oil derived products instead              Oil companies are posting record profits while saying they can  t use ethanol     said Harkin     That  s passing the buck  quite literally  to America  s families and businesses that need reasonably priced gasoline  I urge the administration to investigate why more home grown ethanol is not blended into gasoline even though it costs less             Currently  in the United States about ninety seven percent of our transportation fuel comes from oil  with nearly two thirds of it imported from foreign sources   Harkin recently introduced legislation in the Senate to establish a Renewable Fuels Standard  RFS  that would require oil refiners to blend at least 8 billion gallons of and biodiesel ethanol into motor vehicle fuels a year by 2012    more than doubling current levels   This is the most ambitious proposal currently in Congress                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
