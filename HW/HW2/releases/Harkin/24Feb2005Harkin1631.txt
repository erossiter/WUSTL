        Iowa  s veterans need the Knoxville VA hospital   Closing this facility without adequate planning and review is just plain irresponsible  Harkin said     This closing has the potential to slash access to care for Iowa  s veterans   Before any action is taken  we must ensure that we assess the potential impact on Iowa veterans             In August of 2003  the VA proposed the Capitol Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  program in an attempt to place facilities closer to where veterans live and cut underused and outdated facilities   Although the process was intended to provide a comprehensive review of veterans   health care needs and services  it failed to address the impact of proposed changes on long term care  nursing home care  mental health needs and on those living in rural areas   In May of 2004  the CARES Commission recommended that the Knoxville VA Medical Center  s inpatient facilities be closed              The War on Terrorism and the Iraq War are generating a large new generation of wartime veterans   At this time in our nation  s history  more veterans are in need of health care than ever before     Harkin said     Unfortunately  this closing will deny many Iowa veterans that critical access  and it will disrupt the lives of the elderly long term care patients at the hospital              Harkin also wrote to then secretary Anthony Principi in January of 2005 urging him to keep the Knoxville facility open   In November of 2003  Harkin introduced an amendment to the VA HUD appropriations bill that would stop the department from closing certain VA hospitals  including the Knoxville facility that provides vital health care services to thousands of Iowa veterans   The amendment would have barred any funding from being spent to shut down the hospital or services until the actual impact on veterans that would be affected by these cuts is determined            Harkin is a long time advocate for providing veterans with the high quality health care they deserve   He has fought for increased funding for the VA through the Appropriations Committee and has urged the VA to allocate more funding for its veterans hospitals            A copy of the letter  1 page  follows                                February 24  2005            The Honorable R  James Nicholson      Secretary of Veterans Affairs       810 Vermont Avenue       Washington  DC 20420         Dear Mr  Secretary          Congratulations on your recent confirmation and swearing in as Secretary of the Department of Veteran Affairs   As you are a former soldier and decorated veteran  I am confident you possess the compassion and capacity to understand the issues affecting veterans and to ensure the Department is adept at meeting veterans   needs   I am sure you are aware that the Capitol Asset Realignment for Enhanced Services  CARES  Commission recently recommended that inpatient facilities at the Knoxville  Iowa Veterans Affairs  VA  Medical Center be closed            As an Iowan  I would imagine you would want to increase the access to services that Iowa veterans have   In that regard  I would encourage you to use your authority as Secretary to keep all existing facilities at the Knoxville VA Medical Center operating fully   The CARES process was intended to provide a comprehensive review of veterans   health care needs and services as the Administration sought to realign the VA health care system   Please slow down the process regarding Knoxville  s VA inpatient facilities to allow for a more detailed analysis of the potential impact that closing would have on inpatient care for veterans in Knoxville and surrounding rural communities            Thank you for your assistance on this issue of importance to our veterans          Sincerely                                                                            Tom Harkin                                                                  United States Senate         TH ljm           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
