        Wind power is an increasingly utilized renewable energy source throughout much of rural America  and very notably in Iowa     Harkin said     Unfortunately  too many of our rural citizens still do not enjoy the financial and environmental gains wind power offers   As it stands now  most farmers can collect lease payments for turbines built on their land  This bill will help farmers and others to actually own and operate wind turbines  and to sell electricity commercially themselves               While changes to the tax code can be confusing  Harkin  s bill would do two basic things   First  the bill allows an individual to use the 1 8 cent credit to reduce the tax on all types of income  not just income from the wind facility and comparable investments   Currently  most farmers are unable to utilize the credit fully because the income from wind generated electricity would represent only a small portion of their total income   Second  the bill would allow farmers who are members of a cooperative that owns and operates wind turbines for commercial electricity sales to claim a share of the coop s production tax credit on their own tax returns   Current law prevents co ops from passing the benefit of the tax credit on to their members              It does not make sense to disadvantage farmers wishing to benefit from wind power and provide clean energy to the country     Harkin said     For wind power to reach its full potential  we must allow all those interested to participate in its growth and expansion   Farmers are already realizing the benefits of wind power  ethanol  biodiesel and other biobased products   There is no reason wind power cannot be even more beneficial to both family farmers and broader society               Harkin has long advocated greater production and use renewable sources of energy  such as wind power and biobased fuels   He recently co sponsored legislation to extend the Wind Production Tax Credit through 2010 and led a bipartisan group of 20 senators to offer an ambitious Renewable Fuels Standard to boost ethanol and biodiesel use and cut the U S  dependence on foreign oil   Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
