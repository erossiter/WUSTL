        Many older workers have devoted their lives to a company  only to be repaid with stealth pension benefit cuts     said Harkin     Some unfair cash balance conversions can reduce the benefits of older workers by thousands of dollars a year providing million to the bottom line of companies   These conversions have been used as a way for companies to mask deep cuts in pension benefits to seniors   This is age discrimination and must be stopped             Harkin first took action on this issue in 1999  when it became clear that as some companies converted to cash balance plans  people were working for years without any contribution to their pensions  This practice is called   wear away    and equivalent to age discrimination        Specifically  Harkin  s legislation would prevent the   wear away    of benefits by requiring companies to continue to pay into workers   pensions during a conversion from a traditional pension plan to a cash balance plan  Converting from a traditional pension to a cash balance pension can also be bad for workers because traditional pension benefits increase dramatically toward the end of a workers career  but cash balance plan provide greater benefits toward the beginning of a career  The legislation would also require employers to provide long term and older workers the option to remain with the old pension plan            Let me be clear    I am not opposed to all cash balance plans   Some plan designs can be very good and we should allow those plans to move forward     said Harkin      I am  however  vehemently opposed to unfair cash balance conversions that deplete the retirement savings of older Americans   The retirement security of millions of working Americans is in jeopardy unless we stop unfair plan conversions             Harkin has been a leader in the fight for fair cash balance reform   Through his work in the Senate  Harkin brought national attention to this issue  dramatically raising the profile of this age discriminatory practice   As a result of his efforts  the Treasury department issued a moratorium on allowing conversions to go forward in 1999                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
