      According to an analysis by the governor  s Office of Drug Control Policy  the 26 Iowa counties that received locks for anhydrous ammonia tanks saw a five percent decrease in the number of active meth labs since 2002   In 2002  these counties accounted for 65 percent of all Iowa  s meth labs   Now  these counties account for just 46 percent            Conversely  counties that did not participate in the program saw a 113 percent increase in the number of meth labs since 2002   Without the Tanks A Lock program  Iowa would likely have seen more than 600 additional meth labs in 2004              The success  and thus the necessity  of this program speaks for itself     said Harkin     We have a serious problem in Iowa when it comes to meth  and we have to use all the tools at our disposal to address it   While the Tanks A Lock program is not a silver bullet  it is a vital part or strategy to win this fight against meth               The special locks for anhydrous ammonia tanks cost around  60 each   Since this cost can be prohibitive for individual anhydrous dealers  the program gives local county sheriffs the resources to provide locks to cooperatives   That way  when tanks are picked up by local farmers the locks are already in place            In 2002  Harkin secured funding to start the Tanks A Lock program in Iowa counties hardest hit by the meth epidemic   Since then  Harkin has continued to secure funding  including  300 000 last November to expand the program   In 2004  at least 47 counties will participate in the program   Harkin  s goal is to provide locks for all 99 Iowa counties             We have seen the results this program provides in counties hardes hit by the meth epidemic     Harkin said     We must remain committed to expanding this program to all 99 counties in Iowa   I will continue to work in Washington with Iowa  s state and local governments to ensure they have the resources to keep this program going strong                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
