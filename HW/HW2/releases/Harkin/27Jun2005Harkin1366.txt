        Iowa Veterans devoted their lives to our national security  and they deserve adequate health care     Harkin said     For many Iowa veterans  the VA system is their only access to health care   Our government pledged that it would care for them in their hours of medical need and this is a moral contract we must honor               A January  2005 Pentagon report stated that well over 1 million U S  troops have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past three and one half years   Many of these soldiers have returned home and are beginning to access the VA health care system in record numbers  placing increased demands on an already overburdened agency   Unfortunately  the VA s current shortfall  and larger shortfalls predicted for future years  has confirmed that the Bush Administration has not prudently addressed the budget impacts of these conflicts   Adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in FY 2000                When our service men and women return from combat in Afghanistan and Iraq they are encountering VA facilities that are increasingly overcrowded and understaffed     Harkin said     There is mounting evidence that the VA cannot function under the president  s proposed budgets and needs immediate relief to provide veterans access to quality health care   I hope the President will work with Congress to swiftly address this shortfall               The White House requested an increase of only  111 million for veterans   health care in the 2006 budget   By contrast  in their annual Independent Budget  the four veterans   service organizations estimated that the VA will need a  3 2 billion increase to meet rapidly expanding needs for medical and other services   In January of 2005  Harkin  along with several other Senators  sent a letter to the President asking him to send Congress a budget that fully funds the VA health care system and takes into account the costs of payroll increases and medical inflation  without reliance on increasing out of pocket fees to veterans             A copy of the letter follows                                  June 27  2005           The Honorable George W  Bush        President of the United States of America        The White House        1600 Pennsylvania Avenue NW        Washington  DC 20500            Mr  President            As you prepare for your Tuesday evening address to the nation regarding our efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan  we urge you to take this opportunity to level with the American people about a major cost of these conflicts   the care of our nation s veterans            A January 2005 Pentagon report stated that well over 1 million U S  troops have fought in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 3 and one half years   The Department of Veterans Affairs   VA  annual mid year budget review confirmed that many of these soldiers have returned home and are beginning to access the VA health care system in record numbers  placing increased demands on an already overburdened agency   Many of us saw a looming crisis and sought to take steps that would avert it            With the recent announcement that the VA is facing a shortfall of approximately  1 billion in fiscal year 2005 it seems that our concerns are well founded  Unfortunately  the VA s current shortfall  and larger shortfalls predicted for future years  has confirmed that your Administration has not prudently addressed the budget impacts of these conflicts   We urge you to do so now   Only by confronting this problem head on can we ensure that our veterans receive the support and healthcare they were both promised and deserve              Adjusted for inflation  the VA is spending 25 percent less per patient than it did in fiscal year 2000   Some veterans have to wait over three years to have surgery   And some VA hospitals are only seeing veterans who have more than a 50 percent service connected disability   The evidence that the VA cannot function under your proposed budgets and needs immediate relief to provide veterans access to quality health care continues to mount            War is costly   This is a lesson we all know personally   As Senators we have dealt with legislation authorizing the use of military force  we have worked on spending bills to support our troops  and we have talked to the families of those who have lost loved ones   We also know that failing to provide for the men and women who have sacrificed for our freedom is wrong              In a September 7  2003 speech to the nation you stated   the heaviest burdens in our war on terror fall  as always  on the men and women of our Armed Forces and our intelligence services  They have removed gathering threats to America and our friends  and this nation takes great pride in their incredible achievements  We are grateful for their skill and courage  and for their acts of decency  which have shown America s character to the world  We honor the sacrifice of their families             Mr  President  we urge you to provide the American people with a full accounting of the cost of these conflicts  including the cost of caring for our veterans upon their return home  during your Tuesday evening address   We ask that you directly share with the nation how your administration will make up the VA s current FY 2005 budget shortfall of  1 billion  as well as the looming shortfall projected for the future  And  we stand ready to work with you to pass an emergency spending bill to address this shortfall before the July 4th Congressional recess            Sincerely                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
