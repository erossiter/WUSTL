        I believe we can strengthen Social Security in a bipartisan way with reasonable  moderate steps  but I want to do it right   There is no excuse to rush into a plan that will drive up the debt  and cut benefits for America  s seniors and people with disabilities              Many supporters of the president  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   Even the Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee has said repeatedly that private accounts would do nothing to solve the long term funding gap in Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved            I am especially concerned about the impact the President  s privatization plan would have on people with disabilities  Social Security disability benefits are a lifeline to more than six million Americans   For many  that disability benefit check is 100 percent of their income   But the President  s privatization commission strongly indicated that disability benefits would be cut the same as retirement benefits   That is completely unacceptable             I would like to see a replay of what happened in 1983  the last time we needed to update and strengthen Social Security   A Republican President    President Reagan    worked closely with Democrats in Congress   We made tough choices   And we kept Social Security rock solid   We need that same kind of bipartisan approach this time around            Unfortunately  given the administration  s emphasis on private accounts and reduced benefits  it would seem that this exercise is not about strengthening Social Security  it is about shrinking it and privatizing it   My hope is that the President will think this through    and reconsider   I hope that he  ll sit down with Congress to come up with a reasonable  bipartisan plan that will strengthen and protect Social Security                                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
