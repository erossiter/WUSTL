       Good morning to my Senate colleagues  our witnesses and audience   Today s hearing further highlights the wide diversity of our nation s agricultural production   Last week we heard from a good cross section of animal agriculture   livestock  poultry and eggs   and learned about the challenges producers face in the marketplace   Today we will hear about the issues relating to specialty crops  dairy  organic production  honey and community based food systems             Our hearing covers a wide range of issues  but all are related in several ways   They are all within the scope of matters to be addressed in the farm bill  which we are working to re craft as we speak   And  more importantly  they are related because each is integrally related to our agricultural economy             On our first panel are two important witnesses representing the organic food industry  from the farm to the consumer   The U S  organic industry is growing by some 17 to 20 percent a year  and it represents genuine new opportunity for some who otherwise might be unable to stay in agriculture or get started farming   With this rapid growth in the organic market  the supply of domestically grown organic food often falls well short of the retail demand   We look forward to the recommendations of our witnesses for initiatives that can help those who want to pursue opportunities in organic production   For example  the organic industry is disadvantaged by the lack of essential research and market data collection  which we can address in the next farm bill   Another witness will discuss how the farm bill can help agricultural producers and consumers benefit from the expanding interest in the local marketing of regionally produced food   Community based food projects have the added benefit of helping consumers understand where their food comes from               The U S  honey industry is facing one of the most serious threats ever from Colony Collapse Disorder   The bee losses associated with this disorder are staggering and portend equally grave consequences for the producers of crops that rely on honey bees for pollination   These crops include many specialty crops and alfalfa  so viable honey bee colonies are critically important across our entire food and agriculture sector             Previous farm bills have not generally given a lot of attention to the issues and challenges facing producers of fruits  vegetables  and tree nuts   usually referred to as specialty crops   even though these crops make up nearly a third of cash receipts for U S  farm crops   Americans are consuming more fruits and vegetables per capita than 20 years ago  but still not near the recommended five to ten servings a day   The new farm bill can and should include initiatives to encourage fruit and vegetable consumption and help domestic producers continue to produce  make a profit and succeed in the face of stiff foreign competition              The third panel this morning includes a diverse range of views and recommendations on federal dairy policy   Dairy is an important part of the farm bill  since the most recent annual milk sales figure of some  27 billion makes up about 10 percent of total U S  cash receipts for agricultural commodities   Besides all the other challenges  dairy farm families continually struggle to survive milk prices that fluctuate widely and are often too low to make a profit   In the 2002 farm bill we included a new counter cyclical income protection program for dairy farmers   now dubbed Milk Income Loss Contracts  MILC    which has provided needed assistance to dairy farmers in times of low milk prices               I look forward to hearing from today s witnesses   We have a tremendous challenge ahead of us to craft a sound farm bill that will help improve income  profitability and new opportunities for our nation s agricultural producers   while addressing the variety of additional needs and objectives that demand attention   The farm bill also encompasses the broader economic well being and quality of life of all rural Americans  the interests of consumers and the necessity of protecting and enhancing our natural resources and environment   That is a tall order for one piece of legislation  and so we welcome the advice and recommendations of our witnesses                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
