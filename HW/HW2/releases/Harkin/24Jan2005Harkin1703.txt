        The administration  s overtime regulations are a shameful attack on the 40 hour workweek  purposely designed to strip millions of workers of their right to overtime pay     Harkin said     Despite his talk of working across party lines  the president clearly has been determined to impose anti worker and anti family regulations             Last year  Congress voted six times on a bipartisan basis  in both the House and the Senate  to protect American workers   right to overtime pay    Most recently  Harkin  s legislation included in the 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill to roll back the harmful overtime regulations was stripped in private meetings upon a veto threat by President Bush          In July  an independent report authored by three former DOL officials who worked under Republican and Democratic administrations verified that  with the exception of the salary level adjustment  in every instance where DOL has made substantive changes  they have actually weakened overtime protections and opened the rules to increasing amounts of litigation  the opposite of administration claims   In addition  the Economic Policy Institute  EPI  released a report concluding that at least six million American workers could lose their right to overtime pay under the new overtime regulations             This is not the time to stick working families with a pay cut  which is why Congress has voted six times to repeal Bush administration regulations that would deny up to six million workers their right to overtime     Harkin said     I will do everything in my power to ensure that the overtime rights of American workers are protected   This attack can and must be stopped             Time and a half pay accounts for 25 percent of the total income of those who work overtime   If employers no longer have to pay time and a half for overtime work  they will have an incentive to demand longer hours instead of creating more jobs                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
