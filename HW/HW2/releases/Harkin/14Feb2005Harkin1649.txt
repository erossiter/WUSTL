        We must start relying more heavily on renewable energy as part of our comprehensive energy solution in this country     Harkin said     Part of that solution includes using more renewable fuels like ethanol   And another part of the solution is developing hydrogen powered vehicles and the systems to support them   This project moves us closer to the use of hydrogen as a viable fuel for the future               Ultimately it is believed that hydrogen from ethanol and other renewable sources can form the backbone of a reliable transportation system based on existing fueling stations   Expanded use of this technology would dramatically reduce smog producing pollutants  lessen our dependence on foreign oil  and provide an economic boost to rural America by adding value to agricultural output              Converting ethanol into hydrogen is a smart step for the environment  for our energy security  and for America  s farmers     Harkin said     We have to think creatively in preparing for our energy future  hydrogen offers us that opportunity               The renewable fuels community agrees   Renewable Fuels Association President Bob Dinneen stated   We believe ethanol can play an important role in fueling the future hydrogen economy  Ethanol has been proven to be more efficient and easier to reform into hydrogen than gasoline  And as a domestic  renewable fuel  ethanol used for hydrogen will reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance energy security compared to fossil fuels             Harkin  s bill would seek to accomplish the following goals within three years of enactment of the legislation            Within the first year  build and install an ethanol to hydrogen fueling system and convert 10 internal combustion hybrid electric vehicles to run on hydrogen   Fund the continued operation of the hybrid electric vehicles for the subsequent two years  fueled at the ethanol to hydrogen reformer    Collect emissions and fuel economy data under a variety of operating and weather conditions                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
