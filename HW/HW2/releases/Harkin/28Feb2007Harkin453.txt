             I am happy to convene this hearing in response to a request from Senator Byrd  the Chairman of this Committee                             Senator Byrd has no peer when it comes to improving the health and safety of our Nation s miners   In response to his leadership  our Subcommittee included  302 million in the FY07 Joint Funding Resolution for the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA   This amount is  24 5 million more than MSHA would have gotten without his efforts and  14 million more than the President s Budget request for FY 07                         Last year  Senator Byrd pushed for supplemental appropriations of  25 6 million for MSHA and  10 million for the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health  NIOSH    funding required to hire more coal inspectors and push the development of technologies that can improve the working conditions of miners   In addition  he led the Congress in passing the MINER Act  the most significant piece of mine safety legislation passed in the last 30 years                            Earlier this month  Senator Byrd made an outstanding speech about coal mining on the Senate Floor in which he quoted the great labor leader  John L  Lewis   I wonder if the Chairman is aware that John L  Lewis was born and raised in Iowa  and even worked the mines there                              Not many people are aware that Iowa was a coal producing state in the early 20th century    In fact  my father mined coal there for 23 years  starting around 1910   I ll never forget the stories he told me about how they used to pump air down into the mines  and ride rickety old elevators down the mine before sunrise and come back up after the sun had set   He and his fellow miners would describe the cave ins and other tragic losses of their friends   The bravery of these men really left an impression on me   It s also why I believe we need to do all we can to protect workers who operate in dangerous settings like these                              It has been more than a year since the tragedies at the Sago and Alma Mines   Despite all of the heightened focus on safety after those events  another 33 mining families lost a loved one during the remainder of 2006   That s in addition to the 12 fatalities at Sago and the 2 at the Alma mine in West Virginia   To put that into context  there were 22 mining fatalities in 2005  28 in 2004 and 30 in 2003   So  even after Sago and Alma  we did no better protecting miners                              That has to change   As the son of a coal miner  my heart goes out to these families as does my commitment to find a way to prevent another needless loss of life   When my father started mining coal in Iowa around 1910  there was one fatality for every 257 miners   In 2006  that rate was one death for every 2 537 miners                                    While that is a significant improvement  think about how far we have advanced with technology during that time   There s no reason why we can t communicate safely and effectively with miners underground after an accident  or at least know where they are through some tracking technology  I am disappointed that MSHA has approved only three additional communication and tracking systems since last year   Why is there not a greater sense of urgency about getting this technology tested and approved   Why the delay                                    Also  why haven t coal companies installed better communication systems that are currently available   The National Mining Association s report last year recommended that mines take this step until new technologies are available                               Our hearing today will focus on the actions MSHA and NIOSH have taken to carry out their responsibilities to protect the safety and health of miners   As I have outlined  Congress has taken significant steps to give the Administration the resources and tools it needs to work toward zero fatalities and serious injuries in underground coal mines   The Administration must respond by delivering the kind of results that mining families across the country expect and deserve                                 Before we hear from our witnesses  I would like to recognize Senator Specter for his vital role   As we continue the seamless passing of the gavel  it was under his chairmanship last year that the important supplemental appropriations were enacted   He is a true friend to miners in Pennsylvania and the United States   His legislation was crucial in forging the bipartisan MINER Act  which was passed last June                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
