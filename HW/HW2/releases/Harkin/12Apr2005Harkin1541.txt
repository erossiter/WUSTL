      In his letter  Harkin  the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee  cited concerns about the ability of USDA  s Risk Management Agency to ensure that all farmers  regardless of size or loss history  would be treated equally in sales and service of federal crop insurance policies   Currently  only one small insurance company is authorized to offer the reduced premiums allowed by the PRP   However  just last fall the largest companies offering federal crop insurance submitted proposals to offer their own PRP products   Harkin  s concern is that this flood of new proposals would overwhelm the RMA and lead to inequitable treatment among farmers              I am always in favor of finding ways to reduce the cost of crop insurance for Iowa  s farmers     Harkin said     But too many questions remain about this proposal and its effect on the underlying principles and overall stability of the federal crop insurance program   I am concerned the gaps in this proposed rule are too great for USDA to adequately address these risks               Harkin also raised questions as to whether the proposed rules would permit companies to withdraw from offering crop insurance policies in certain geographical areas or for specific crops if they can enhance profits by focusing on more lucrative areas and crops as a result of the reduced administrative and operating cost reimbursement of PRP products   Harkin noted such cost reduction pressures could lead to fewer federal crop insurance options for tens of thousands of farmers across the country            A copy

Premium Reduction Plan  PRP  Proposed Rule Published in the Federal Register February 24  2005           Dear Mr  Baker                        While in theory I favor the notion of reducing the cost to farmers of crop insurance coverage  I find this entire process fraught with risks to the underlying principles and stability of the federal crop insurance program   Consequently  I question whether rules for PRP can be implemented that adequately address these risks    The gaps in the proposed rule published in the Federal Register did not give me confidence that this could be accomplished                        A principal objective of the Agricultural Risk Protection Act of 2000 was boosting participation in the crop insurance program  especially among small and limited resource farmers   A considerable amount of time  effort and funding was devoted to this purpose   Part of the reason for this special attention is that small scale farmers often grow crops for which coverage does not exist or is not adequate  and it is often not profitable for crop insurance companies and agents to sell to them   Widespread pursuit of PRP approvals by crop insurance companies would endanger the progress made in recent years by making it even less attractive for companies to sell policies to small and even medium sized operations   Such market segmentation would undermine one of the fundamental principles of the program  which is universal access                        The preamble to the proposed rule acknowledges this potential for selective marketing  but the proposed rules itself fails to offer sufficient safeguards against such discrimination   I believe that simply requiring that the PRP products be nominally available to all producers does not preclude the possibility that discriminatory practices and marketing will occur   For example  running a small ad in a local weekly newspaper is one way of meeting such a requirement  but agents or company representatives would still be able to devote personal time only to larger         farmers to solicit their business and provide service on policies   More extensive reporting on how marketing is conducted would need to be done to ensure that  cherry picking   is not going         on  which might well make PRP prohibitively expensive to administer  both for companies and for the Risk Management Agency                        As written  the proposed rule requires that companies offer the PRP product with the same level of discount to farmers in all states that they serve  but they do not appear to preclude companies from dropping states entirely if they determine they cannot operate profitably in those states under the reduced A reimbursement of PRP products   I would expect little or no impact on the coverage provided to farmers in my state of Iowa  at least for major crops  where nearly all companies now operate profitably because of its historically low loss ratios   However  there are currently 12 states which are served by three or fewer crop insurance companies   Cost reduction pressures could result in several additional states with higher loss ratios being dropped by existing companies  thus jeopardizing the quality of the service they now receive and undermining the national character of crop insurance  which is essential for its future                        The alternative approach suggested in the proposed rule  which is to wait to calculate discounts that can be offered for crop insurance policies until the end of the reinsurance year  when savings can be definitively determined  has serious problems   Given farmers   vulnerability to variations in weather  market prices for both inputs and outputs  and currency rate fluctuations  FCIC should not introduce another element of uncertainty by deferring setting the price for their insurance coverage until well after harvest   I also suspect that companies would be reluctant to undertake sales of PRP under this scenario  since they could not use a specific premium discount as a basis for competing against rival companies  at least not definitively                        If these problems cannot be adequately addressed  which seems to be the case  it would be preferable not to implement PRP rules at all rather than run the risk that PRP undermines the delivery of the federal crop insurance program and the fundamental principle of universal access to crop insurance               Sincerely Yours
