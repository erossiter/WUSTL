        I am disappointed that USDA has not stepped up to the plate and committed to reevaluating its plan to reopen the border to Canadian beef and cattle   Critical questions exist about the efficacy of both the Canadian anti BSE effort and our own anti BSE policies   Addressing these concerns has to be a top priority of USDA before more broadly opening the border to Canadian beef and cattle            I am pleased that Chairman Chambliss has committed to holding a hearing in the Senate Agriculture Committee   I look forward to working with him  as well as the new secretary of agriculture  to protect American consumers  our food supply  and our cattle industry                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
