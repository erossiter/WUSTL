           I salute the President for coming forward with a plan to prepare our country for avian flu   Frankly  I wish that we had had this two months or two years ago   As you know  Japan came forward with a national plan back in 1997   So  to put it mildly  we are playing catch up ball             Nonetheless  we now have a plan from the administration   We also have an appropriation here in the Senate of nearly  8 billion  which was included in the amendment I offered last week to the Labor HHS appropriations bill   In conference with the House  we need to finalize funding for this plan   And then we need to get moving  because    as our panelists are very aware    we could be facing a human to human avian flu outbreak next year or next month   We simply don  t know   What we do know is that  right now  we are totally unprepared and totally vulnerable              The President  s plan closely tracks the main points of the amendment we passed last week in the Senate   There are four broad elements                  One  as our first line of defense  we need to dramatically step up international surveillance of avian flu outbreaks overseas              Two  we need to ramp up our vaccine production infrastructure here in the United States              Three  we need to build up stockpiles of vaccines currently believed to be effective against avian flu  as well as anti viral medications              And  four  we need to strengthen our public health infrastructure    federal  state  and local    which  today  is simply not equipped to cope with a major pandemic              Overall  the President  s plan is a good plan   However  I am concerned that it falls short in one absolutely critical area  state and local preparedness   If we have a pandemic  public health departments    and local hospitals    are going to be on the front line   Right now  our hospitals have trouble coping with a busy Saturday night   They would be totally overwhelmed by an avian flu pandemic or  for that matter  a major act of bioterrorism   Even if we had an adequate stock of vaccine  it would go for naught if we lacked the public health infrastructure to deliver it               The President  s budget for fiscal year 2006 proposed to cut  120 million from state public health agencies   It is not sufficient just to restore that funding   We need to make major new investments   We need to hire more public health professionals   At the same time  we need to dramatically increase the surge capacity of hospitals all across the country   For example  most victims of avian flu would need ventilators to help them breathe   Right now there are only 105 000 ventilators in the entire United States  and three quarters of them are already in use on a typical day               So  Mr  Chairman  we have our work cut out for us   We face enormous technical and logistical challenges  and there is absolutely no time to waste   What gives me hope and confidence is that  in the fight against avian flu  we have outstanding  proven field generals in Dr  Gerberding  Dr  Fauci  and Dr  Gellin   And I look forward very much to their testimony  and also to the testimony of the Secretary Leveit  whom I commend for this plan                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
