 The legislation makes needed improvements to the current eligibility standards and benefit formulas in the Food Stamp Program  It would halt the current erosion that is occurring in the value of food stamp benefits as a result of a freeze in the FSPs standard deduction  and encourage low income individuals to save for their futures by increasing the amount of liquid assets they can have  currently set at  2000  and still remain eligible for food stamps    The bill also supports working families by removing the cap on the amount of child care expenses that can be deducted for purposes of benefit calculations  It restores food stamp eligibility for some legal immigrant households  and improves benefits for unemployed childless adults  who are typically one of the poorest groups of people served by the program  Finally  the bill would help reverse the recent trend of decreasing U S  government donations to community food providers by increasing funding for commodity purchases for food banks       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
