          WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to the Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Congressman Leonard Boswell  D IA  today called on the U S  Department of Justice  DOJ  to prevent Whirlpool  s acquisition of Maytag   Specifically  Harkin and Boswell said the acquisition would give Whirlpool an unfair market advantage  and further increase the economic concentration of the appliance industry                  By letting Whirlpool  s acquisition move forward  the Justice Department would be encouraging unfair monopoly like behavior in the appliance industry     said Harkin     This acquisition will be a loss for Iowans  consumers nationwide  and Whirlpool  s competitors   It creates an unfair advantage  and I hope that it will be prevented                  I met with Ralph Hake  Maytag  s CEO  Maytag employees  along with local officials last May to discuss this buy out     said Boswell     Along with the uncertainty of the future of the Newton plant  this proposed buy out may be bad for consumers across Iowa and the country   The Justice Department needs to thoroughly and quickly examine all the issues                     Whirlpool is already the largest producer in the appliance industry  and the Maytag acquisition would give them almost 50 percent of the market share   If the acquisition is approved  Whirlpool  GE and Electrolux would together control 90 percent of the market              Specifically  the acquisition would have a heavy impact on the laundry segment of the appliance industry because a Whirlpool Maytag company would control 70 percent of the market   The letter requests that if the acquisition is approved  the Justice Department at least require that Whirlpool divest Maytag  s washer and dryer department  a very concentrated portion of the industry                A copy of the letter follows          January 12  2006          Honorable Thomas O  Barnett Assistant Attorney General for Antitrust Department of Justice 950 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW Washington  DC  20530            Dear Assistant Attorney General Barnett             We are writing concerning the proposed acquisition of Maytag by Whirlpool   We are very troubled by this proposed arrangement which would greatly increase the market share of the combined company in certain areas   For that reason  we believe that the Department should prevent this acquisition               According to the 1992 joint FTC Justice guidelines for horizontal mergers  we believe it is clear that the appliance industry is indeed a highly concentrated one that would become drastically more concentrated  according to the Herfindahl Hirshman Index  as a result of the Whirlpool acquisition   The increase in concentration is far beyond the level that the guidelines presume would likely create enhanced market power or facilitate its exercise                  Whirlpool is already the largest producer in the market   With the acquisition of Maytag  the combined company would hold almost 50 percent of the market share   This market concentration becomes even more extreme when the other two major appliance manufacturers  GE and Electrolux  are considered   If the Whirlpool acquisition is approved  the newly combined company  GE and Electrolux would together control about 90 percent of the market share                  And  this is an industry that has undergone a number of substantial mergers in recent years   Maytag acquired Magic Chef  Jenn Air and Amana   Whirlpool acquired Kitchen Aid  and Electrolux acquired Frigidaire   At some point  the concentration becomes to extreme for an orderly competitive market   We believe the pending acquisition of Maytag by Whirlpool goes beyond that barrier particularly in the area of washers and dryers                   What is most important is the specific market for particular goods that people actually buy   In the laundry segment  a Whirlpool    Maytag Company would control an excessively dominant 70 percent of the market   It is hard to see how that type of dominance does not place excessive market control into the hands of one company               Even with the large share of this market that is sold at retail by large chain stores  this concentration is extreme   Clearly  a combined Whirlpool would be in a position to create real difficulties for competitors   The increase in concentration is far beyond the level that the guidelines presume would likely create enhanced market power or facilitate its exercise             While we are seeing some movement of foreign firms into this area such as LG and Samsung  their market share is very small   The current domestic players are working to sharply lower costs including off shoring jobs to lower costs   It is not at all clear that the foreign firms will be able to effectively compete and may in fact decide to maximize their efforts in their home markets                     We recommend that the Justice Department prevent the acquisition of Maytag by Whirlpool   If that is not done  at the very least the Department should require that Whirlpool divest the washer and dryer portions of Maytag to a viable purchaser who will have the financial capability and desire to continue to operate that business              We appreciate your consideration of our concerns         Sincerely                                          Tom Harkin                                                       United States Senator             Leonard Boswell        United States Representative
