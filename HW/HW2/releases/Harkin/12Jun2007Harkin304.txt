 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today released the following statement on thefarm subsidy database compiled by the Environmental Working Group  EWG   Harkin was instrumental in writing a provision into the 2002 farm bill that required USDA to develop a database that attributes payments to individuals instead of stopping at the level of corporations and co ops as was the case with previous databases   The new database will show that very big commodity payments are heavily concentrated in the hands of relatively few large scale operators  The current system of payment limitations is being abused and exploited in ways that just cannot be tolerated  The report makes it harder than ever before to defend the status quo and I believe it weakens the position of those who have defended big payments   Reforming this broken system is a matter of basic fairness to the American taxpayer  It is also a matter of recognizing that USDA should not pay out hundreds of thousands of dollars  or even well over a million dollars in cases  to billionaires  These are payments we cant afford  going to people who dont need them  and for what public purpose     Reasonable payment limitations are just common sense reform at a time when our federal budget is deep in the red and we are scraping to find funds in the budget to help family size farmers produce renewable energy and conserve our nations soil  water  and habitat  and to help young people simply get a start in farming  So reform of our commodity programs is about fairness  It is also about thinking anew and addressing our most pressing national priorities  And thats exactly what we intend to do in the new farm bill       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
