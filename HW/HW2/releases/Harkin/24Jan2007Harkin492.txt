     As you all know  the threat of pandemic flu has not abated  It may have fallen briefly from the headlines  but the problem remains  Bird populations across Asia have been infected by the H5N1 strain of avian influenza and the virus has spread as far as Eastern Europe  Hundreds of people have died and it may be only a matter of time before the virus mutates and sustained human to human transmission occurs  If the virus is able to achieve this  millions of people may die worldwide  rivaling the Spanish Influenza outbreak in 1918 1919  The CDC estimates that a   medium level pandemic   could kill over 200 000 Americans and sicken one third of the US population               The President  s original request to combat the pandemic threat was  7 1 billion in 2005  To date  we have appropriated  6 1 billion for pandemic flu preparedness  including  600 million for state and local preparedness  This money has gone to build vaccine capacity  purchase egg based vaccines  accelerate cell based vaccine capability  stockpile anti virals  improve lab capacity at the CDC  and improve surveillance  But there is still more to do            In addition  Congress has given HHS new authority to develop the tools we need to respond to mass casualty events  Last year  we passed  and the President signed into law  the Pandemic and All Hazards Preparedness Act  My good friend Senator Burr led the effort in the HELP Committee and I was proud to work with him on the legislation  Importantly  part of this bill changed the way the government works with the private sector to develop countermeasures to biological threats  including avian flu            Both Congress and the Administration are responding to this threat  But our activities also raise new questions  Are we investing in the right vaccine technology  Should we invest in other capabilities beyond cell and egg based vaccines  Also    How will the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority within HHS change the way we develop vaccines  In addition  are we doing all we can to make sure state and local governments have the ability to respond             To answer these questions we have a distinguished panel joining us today which includes Dr  Julie Gerberding  the Director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  Anthony S  Fauci  M D   the Director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease at the National Institutes of Health  Dr  Gerald W  Parker  the Principal Deputy to the Assistant Secretary  Office of the Assistant Secretary for Preparedness and Response at the Department of Health and Human Services  and Dr  John Treanor  Professor of Medicine  and of Microbiology and Immunology at the University of Rochester   I would like to thank them for joining us today and look forward to their testimony                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
