        Americans with disabilities are deeply concerned   They do not want to wait until a proposal surfaces that reduces their benefits   We need to know with certainty how the president plans to prevent cuts to these needed benefits     Harkin said              Social Security is critical for the 6 2 million Americans that receive disability benefits  and an average healthy 20 year old today has a 30 percent chance of becoming disabled in his or her lifetime   Equally important  people with disabilities rely on all facets of Social Security  including Retirement Insurance when they age out of SSDI  benefits from their parents who have reached retirement age  and Survivor  s Insurance   All the while  Social Security has been able to provide this support at a relatively low cost            Historically the disability  retirement  and survivor programs in Social Security have all used the same formula   If the president plans to apply different formulas to each  there are many difficult policy issues that must be resolved   Before Congress can begin to consider Social Security reform  we believe it is essential to know how people with disabilities will be affected              President Bush says that he has no current plans to cut disability benefits   And I hope that remains the case   Unfortunately  the president  s Social Security privatization plan leaves a lot of questions as to how people with disabilities will be treated     Harkin said     We have no details from the president  and I am deeply concerned that he has not thought this through

PDF of the letter is available upon request                                                                              February 15  2005              President George W  Bush        The White House        Washington  DC 20502           Dear President Bush            Almost fifteen years ago  Congress passed a piece of landmark civil rights legislation    the Americans with Disabilities Act   Your father signed that bill into law   Among other significant achievements of that legislation was a commitment by Congress and the Executive Branch to people with disabilities   We decided that as a matter of public policy  people with disabilities should never be left out of the discussion   They should never be shunted to the side  or considered second class citizens            Mr  President  we have listened carefully to all you have said about changing the Social Security program   We have not heard how you intend to protect people with disabilities   As you know  Social Security is absolutely critical to millions of Americans with disabilities   We are worried that disability insurance is an important aspect of the program that is often left out of the debate   Equally important  people with disabilities rely on all facets of Social Security  including Retirement Insurance when they age out of SSDI   They rely on benefits from their parents who have reached retirement age   They rely on Survivor  s Insurance  which is critical to families affected by disability that lose a breadwinner            We note that in your Commission  s report of December 2001  only two pages were devoted to disability   It says         In the absence of fully developed proposals  the calculations carried out for the Commission and included in the report assume that defined benefits will be changed in similar ways for  both retirement and disability  programs          The Commission says it is not necessarily recommending this  but the proof is in the numbers  All of the Commission s calculations assume that disability benefits will be cut the same as retirement benefits  Without those cuts  the Commission s numbers simply do not add up                 Mr  President  people with disabilities are deeply concerned   They don  t want to wait until a proposal surfaces that leaves their benefits out   We need to know with certainty what your thoughts are on how to prevent cuts to these needed benefits   According to published reports  on February 3  a mother of an adult with disabilities asked you what would happen to her daughter if you created private accounts in Social Security  and you said she would not be affected              We appreciate that expression of reassurance   However  historically the disability  retirement  and survivor programs in social security have all used the same formula   If you plan to apply different formulas to each  there are many difficult policy issues that must be resolved   Before Congress can begin to consider Social Security reform  we believe it is essential to know how people with disabilities will be affected            To that end  we would appreciate your responses to the following questions                     If you plan to preserve the current formula for Disability Insurance  DI   but apply a less generous formula to retirement benefits  does that mean that people who age out of DI and start receiving old age benefits will receive a higher benefit than other old age recipients  or will individuals receiving DI who reach retirement age have their benefits cut dramatically at that time                     If you protect DI benefits  either until retirement or for life  will that mean greater cuts to old age benefits                       Given the number of people with disabilities getting survivor  s benefits  do you have a plan to protect their income if there is a shift in benefit calculations                      What will be the impact on the benefit levels for individuals with disabilities who are receiving benefits based on their parent  s retirement   Will you protect their income as well                       If trillions of additional dollars in transition costs are incurred  do you have a plan in place to protect other needed sources of funding that provide a lifeline for people with disabilities    such as housing programs for people with disabilities and Medicare and Medicaid    in the face of inevitable budget pressures                       How would your proposal affect Supplemental Security Income  SSI  payments                     What if a 30 year old has been diverting funding to a private account  and then becomes disabled           o       Would the benefits be proportionally cut to reflect the diversion of funds to the private account           o       When would this person have access to that account  if at all           o       Such a person will have had far fewer years to save money  and will have to live many more years on that meager savings   Do you expect this account to carry this person through life           o       What about a 65 year old who becomes disabled a few years before becoming eligible for retirement benefits   Will that person  s benefits and personal accounts be treated the same way as the 30 year old                    It has been three years since your Social Security Commission recommended further policy development on the Social Security Disability program   To date  we have not seen any further reports or details   We look forward to receiving detailed information on these critical issues and working with you to truly strengthen Social Security  while protecting people with disabilities               Sincerely                  ______________________________
