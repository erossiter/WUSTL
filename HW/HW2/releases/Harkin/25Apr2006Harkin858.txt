      Washington  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  will today introduce a proposal designed to ensure that federal funding designated for Workforce Investment is used to help people in genuine need  and not to pay exorbitant salaries to program executives   Specifically  the proposal  which will be offered to the emergency Supplemental Appropriations measure  limits compensation to these executives by encouraging states to set maximum compensation levels for individuals employed by programs funded under the Workforce Investment Act  taking into account factors such as the state  s cost of living  compensation levels for comparable state or local government employees  and the size of a state  s job training programs   In cases where a state fails to set a maximum salary  the Harkin amendment would impose a nationwide maximum  equal to the federal Executive Level II salary          The Harkin amendment addresses a gross abuse of federal funds that was exposed  recently  in an audit of the Central Iowa Employment and Training Consortium    CIETC   The audit showed that three executives of this program were paid nearly  1 8 million over the past two and a half years   The CIETC chief executive officer  alone  received almost  800 000 in salary and bonuses over that period of time   This is nearly eight times the salary earned by the Governor of Iowa            We must establish executive compensation caps in WIA funded programs     Harkin said     Over the years  I have fought hard to secure scarce job training funds for my state of Iowa because I know that quality job training provides a ladder of opportunity to many thousands of hard pressed Americans  including individuals with disabilities and people laid off due to plant closings   The Workforce Investment Act programs have been enormously effective    and they have earned broad  bipartisan support    On the one hand  we want the discretion to pay salaries that will attract talented administrators  and we need to keep in mind local cost of living considerations   But it is unacceptable    it is a betrayal    when unethical individuals use scarce WIA funds to pay themselves inflated and totally unjustified salaries and bonuses   While this appears to be an isolated case  current law creates an opening that makes this kind of abuse possible   But by setting a compensation cap  we can prevent this from happening in the future             The Harkin amendment addresses the most egregious abuses at CIETC   A similar salary cap was imposed on officials with the Head Start program in recent years following isolated cases of waste  fraud and abuse   Investigations into the CIETC scandal at the federal and state levels are ongoing   In addition to the amendment offered today  Harkin has asked investigators to report to him at the conclusion of these investigations with recommendations for preventing any repeat of the abuses that occurred at CIETC            30                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
