        Every day a new revelation seems to surface suggesting serious inconsistencies and political interference in the Department of Justice  s case against Big Tobacco  Last week we learned that after years of pursuing the public  s case against Big Tobacco  the government made a sudden change of course and put the tobacco companies   financial interest ahead of the health interests of hundreds of thousands of Americans   Then it was reported that government attorneys pressured their own witnesses to alter their testimony to favor tobacco companies   And today we learn that those same attorneys argued just one month ago for the stricter penalties they later sabotaged              Fortunately  the Justice Department  s Office of Professional Responsibility has opened an investigation into political interference in this case as I and other Senators requested              As evidence of political interference into this case continues to mount  and an investigation of that interference is pursued it should be crystal clear that any and all settlement negotiations must cease until we can be sure the government has the interest of their client  the American people  at heart            The facts are clear  convincing and simple   Big tobacco companies spent decades  and billions of dollars  misleading the American people in order to hook them on a deadly habit that kills 400 000 Americans each and every year   Today  they must face the consequences appropriate to this conduct                    30           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
