the important milestone of these elections and praised our brave men and women in uniform who are making this election possible   In the letter  the senators called on the president to show the leadership that will to make these elections a turning point that will make America safer and allow our troops to begin to come home            The senators wrote that the four months following these elections will be critical in order to forge the necessary political consensus that will allow the political factions in Iraq to finalize the constitution and create a stable government   In making 2006 a successful transition the senators reminded the president that  his   leadership will also be needed to ensure that we leverage the influence of the international community and Iraq  s neighbors to push for a sustainable political compromise  and that we stand up sufficient numbers of capable Iraqi security forces so that our troops can begin standing down      Without the president

and a reasonable schedule to achieve them      They urged the president to use today  s speech to provide that detailed plan that the American people and our troops deserve            The full text of the letter is pasted below             December 14  2005         The President      The White House      Washington  DC 20500         Dear Mr  President          All Americans recognize the historic nature of the elections for a permanent  democratic government in Iraq on Thursday   We salute our courageous men and women in uniform  who are serving proudly in Iraq under enormously difficult circumstances  and whose dedication and sacrifice are making these elections possible            Like you  we hope the elections will proceed peacefully and the Iraqi people will succeed in electing a legitimate government that is capable of uniting the Sunni  Shiite and Kurdish people   We know that successful elections can play an important part in defeating the insurgency and hastening the day when Iraqis can govern themselves without outside assistance          We also know that the work of the Iraqi people to build the kind of Iraq we would all like to see does not end with these elections   It is vital that the Iraqis move more quickly toward inclusive political solutions   The four month period after the Iraqi elections  when the new government will attempt to finalize a Constitution  is perhaps the most critical time for the Iraqis and our troops   That is why 79 members of the Senate  including 41 Republicans  voted last month for an amendment that said    calendar year 2006 should be a period of significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty  with Iraqi security forces taking the lead for the security of a free and sovereign Iraq  thereby creating the conditions for the phased redeployment of United States forces from Iraq      A strong bipartisan majority of the Senate believes Iraqis must now step forward in the months ahead and take the lead in defending and governing their own country            Your leadership will be essential in achieving this objective   As was stated in the bipartisan amendment that passed the Senate    the  Bush  Administration should tell the leaders of all groups and political parties in Iraq that they need to make the compromises necessary to achieve the broad based and sustainable political settlement that is essential for defeating the insurgency in Iraq within the schedule they set for themselves      Your leadership will also be needed to ensure that we leverage the influence of the international community and Iraq  s neighbors to push for a sustainable political compromise  and that we stand up sufficient numbers of capable Iraqi security forces so that our troops can begin standing down            Finally  we also believe that you must engage in a frank and honest dialogue with the American people and our troops about the road ahead in Iraq   As the bipartisan amendment stated    the  Bush  Administration needs to explain to Congress and the American people its strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq      While we appreciate your recent speeches on this issue  we regret that the American people have still not been presented with a plan that identifies the remaining political  economic  and military benchmarks that must be met and a reasonable schedule to achieve them   We hope you will use Wednesday  s speech to finally provide a detailed explanation of your strategy for the successful completion of the mission in Iraq             The window of time to get things right in Iraq may be rapidly closing   The successful completion of our mission is possible only through the hard work of the Iraqi people and the effective leadership of your Administration   We stand ready to work with the Iraqi people and your Administration in the days ahead                                                             Sincerely          Senator Daniel
