 WASHINGTON  D C   As part of his ongoing effort to support Iowa s first responders  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that Iowa Firemens Association in Humboldt received  52 500 from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   These grants provide Humboldt firefighters with resources that will help them keep Iowa families safe  Harkin said  I am pleased these brave men and women are receiving the essential fire fighting tools they need to effectively respond to emergencies    The AFG Program helps Iowa communities purchase firefighting equipment and implement firefighter health and safety programs  emergency medical services programs  and fire prevention and safety programs  Fire departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel   Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments  At least 60 percent of the program s funding must go to volunteer fire departments  This means that towns like Hartwick and Oelwein are not competing against cities like Des Moines or Cedar Rapids  Additionally  the program requires only a 10 percent match in local funding  In today s economy  this makes it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
