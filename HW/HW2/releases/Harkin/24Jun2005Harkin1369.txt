        I commend USDA for listening to the Inspector General and conducting further testing to obtain a clear answer in this case   Fortunately  USDA has decided to change its protocol on testing for mad cow disease   It is clear now  however  that USDA had no established procedure to deal with conflicting test results   This lack of clear direction caused uncertainty for America  s beef and cattle markets  consumers  and our trading partners            The animal  s herd of origin remains unknown until further investigation   I urge the administration to expedite this process            I stress that consumers should have no misgivings about eating beef based on this test result   Thankfully  our safeguards prevented this cow from entering our food supply   The animal was incinerated before it could reach our food                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
