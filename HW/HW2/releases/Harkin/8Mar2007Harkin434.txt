                  WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today issued the following statement on President Bush s trip to Brazil   Renewable energy  specifically ethanol  is expected to be discussed during the visit   Last week  Harkin stressed the importance of increasing our investments in domestic U S  renewable energy at a White House meeting with President Bush                                The U S  and Brazil are the world s top two ethanol producers  so it makes sense for the two countries to work together to break the world s dangerous dependence on imported oil   But our top priority is producing and using renewable fuels right here in the U S   Any focus on U S    Brazil ethanol cooperation must focus on consumption within Central and South American countries that may produce it                               In a White House meeting last week  I joined a bipartisan group of senators who told the president that we would not look favorably on changing our ethanol import policy    Currently  our production capacity and market demands are both growing in tandem   The U S  already imports ethanol from Brazil  despite the existing tariff                                 Therefore  I hope the president s trip results in collaboration on biofuels research and development and the sharing of technological advances and information on ethanol business infrastructure issues  such as ethanol transport by pipeline  and certification and standards for E85 fueling stations and equipment   But I urge the president to resist any efforts to relax the tariffs on imported ethanol   There is no reason to make any change to the treatment of imports at this time and I am hopeful the president maintains this position                                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
