        Parent  s choices about their children  s eating habits are undermined by junk food ads everyday     said Harkin     Although parents may want their kids to eat healthy  they often lose out because Sponge Bob Square Pants  Shrek  and cartoon superheroes entice kids to eat fast food and sugary snacks  The childhood obesity epidemic is real  and the time to act is now             In a letter to the food industry  broadcasters and others  Harkin called for a new meaningful  uniform  and system wide set of age appropriate guidelines for marketing junk food to kids   Self regulation and corporate responsibility would improve child nutrition and health and level the playing field by not penalizing companies that choose to act responsibly when marketing to kids          The food industry spent  10 billion last year alone in direct marketing to children    bombarding kids with ads on television and the internet  in movies and magazines  in schools  and through promotional materials such as kids clubs  toys and books   Food companies are increasingly aggressive in marketing unhealthy food to our children through a wide variety of innovative strategies    cartoon tie ins    advergaming     and cross promotions    with a goal of encouraging children to consume unhealthy products            Harkin will announce legislation that would finally restore the FTC authority to regulate marketing directed at children  This long overdue measure would give the FTC the power to restrict the advertising of junk food to children under age 18   He will also announce a bill that would address the onslaught of junk food marketing to children in schools  giving the U S Secretary of Agriculture the authority to prohibit all junk food advertising in schools where parents are not present             The current industry efforts are woefully inadequate     said Harkin     I sincerely hope that the industry will develop tough and effective marketing guidelines  but when private interests work against the public good like this  government is obliged to act             Harkin is the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children    In addition to his efforts on food marketing  Harkin is the author of the Harkin Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program    now operating in 8 states and on 3 Indian reservations    which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools   He has also proposed legislation to give communities funding for more bike paths and sidewalks and tax credits for employers who implement wellness programs for their employees           A copy of the letter and a list of recipients are attached  three pages total                           Parents vs  Junk Food Marketers      Who should have the power to influence our kids       Over the past two decades  Obesity has doubled among children and tripled among adolescents   During this same period of time food marketing has expanded in both volume and variation into nearly all aspects of kids   lives        The food industry spent  15 billion last year alone in direct marketing to children   bombarding kids with ads on television and the internet   in movies and magazines  and even in schools  and through promotional materials such as kids clubs  toys and books   This largely un checked system promotes junk food and indirectly promotes overeating by tying food sales with children  s favorite cartoon characters and superheroes   Last year  a landmark study conducted by the Institute of Medicine  Preventing Childhood Obesity  concluded that food marketing directed at children likely contributes to the rising rates of childhood obesity   The report recommended stricter industry standards and federal regulation of those standards       Unfortunately  the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  has limited authority to regulate advertising to children   In fact  the FTC has more authority to regulate ads directed to adults than to children   This  despite mounting evidence that marketing to children has a detrimental effect   In fact  the American Psychological Association  APA  found last year that children under the age of nine cannot understand persuasive intent  making advertising to children inherently deceptive   The APA has called for an immediate ban on marketing to children        Parents   choices about their children  s eating habits are undermined by this deluge of advertising    Though parents may want their children to eat a healthy lunch  Sponge Bob Square Pants sits atop Burger King begging kids to eat fast food  Coke ads in schools entice children to purchase a soda instead of milk in the lunch line  and Oreo cookie counting books teach cookie brand loyalty at an early age   Parents and public health groups are calling out for limits to direct marketing to their children   Yet despite mounting pressure on the food industry to reduce junk food marketing directed at kids  most in the industry have done little to address it       In the absence of corporate responsibility  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  is taking steps to limit the amount of junk food marketing to children through federal regulation               In 2004  Senator Harkin secured  1 million in federal funding for a Centers for Disease Control  CDC  study on the impact of food marketing on children  s health   The Institute of Medicine has been commissioned to complete the study  expected out later this year             Senator Harkin will announce two legislative measures to regulate and limit the amount of junk food marketing to children   The first would finally restore the FTC authority to regulate  marketing directed at children  This long overdue measure would give the FTC the power to restrict the advertising of junk food to children under age 18   The second would address the onslaught of junk food marketing to children in schools  giving the US Secretary of Agriculture the authority to prohibit all junk food advertising in schools where parents are not present             Senator Harkin has been the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children   Harkin believes a comprehensive approach that involves parents  schools  communities and the food and advertising industry is needed to teach and encourage healthier habits and address the nation  s obesity epidemic   In addition to his efforts on food marketing  Harkin is the author of the Harkin Fresh Fruit  and Vegetable Program  now operating in 8 states and on 3 Indian reservations  which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools   He has also proposed legislation to give communities funding for more bike paths and sidewalks and tax credits for employers who implement wellness programs for their employees         _________________________________________________      March 16  2005      Stephen W  Sanger      CEO      General Mills  Inc       One General Mills Boulevard      Minneapolis  MN 55426      Dear Mr  Sanger      The diets of American children are a public health crisis of the first order  The U S  Department of Agriculture has found that scarcely any school age children or adolescents meet all scientific recommendations for a sound diet   One consequence is that the United States is facing a childhood obesity epidemic  The Centers for Disease Control reports that fully fifteen percent of U S  children and teenagers are overweight    triple the rate of 35 years ago  and a higher percentage than in any other industrialized country        Unfortunately  the food industry is complicit in this epidemic   The food industry spent  10 billion on marketing to children last year alone  and there is mounting evidence that the deluge of advertising aimed at kids in schools  on television  and elsewhere likely contributes to skyrocketing rates of childhood obesity and related diseases  Food companies are increasingly aggressive in marketing unhealthy food to our children through a wide variety of innovative strategies    cartoon tie ins    advergaming     and cross promotions  with a goal of encouraging children to consume unhealthy products   The American Psychological Association recently recommended restrictions on marketing to children under age eight because they found that young children are unable to discern the difference between persuasion and information   Parents   choices about their children  s eating habits are undermined by this deluge of advertising  and parents and public health groups are calling out for limits to direct marketing to their children       Given the magnitude of the current public health crisis  I write today to urge your swift action in promoting sound nutrition and fighting childhood obesity    Food marketing directed at American children has gone too far  and there is a need for higher standards by the food industry   You in the industry must assess your own child focused marketing and food promotion practices and come to the table to develop substantive marketing guidelines that will be in the best interest of our children  s health   It is imperative that the industry agree on a meaningful  uniform  and system wide set of age appropriate marketing guidelines   This action will level the playing field by not penalizing companies that choose to act responsibly with regard to marketing foods to children   Absent meaningful self regulation and corporate responsibility  I feel strongly that we will need federal regulation  When private interests are working against the public interest  the government has an obligation to act                                                          Just last fall the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences published a report  Preventing Childhood Obesity  Health in the Balance  which concluded that marketing directed at children likely contributes to their obesity  The report recommended a national strategy that places the prevention of childhood obesity as a national public health priority  calling on all sectors of society  including government  communities  schools  parents  and the food  advertisement  and entertainment industries         Some industry stakeholders have recently taken steps to create healthier products for children and to limit their own marketing efforts directed at children   I applaud these efforts   However  there remain significant and concerted efforts to market unhealthy foods to our children   Clearly  the industry can do much more       Today I am announcing two pieces of legislation to regulate the amount of food marketing directed at children   You can vitiate the need for this legislation by coming to the table with others in the industry to develop and implement more responsible guidelines for marketing that are in the best interest of our children  s health   If the industry is willing to make a serious effort toward reform  I believe it would find willing and enthusiastic partners among child health  consumer  and nutrition advocates   I look forward to working with the industry to implement these guidelines without legislation   Please feel free to call me with additional questions or comments                  Sincerely        Tom Harkin United States Senate       TH arm       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
