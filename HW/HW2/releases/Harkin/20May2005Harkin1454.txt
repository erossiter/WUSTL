        Soybean rust has resulted in significant costs to farmers in Brazil and other countries     said Harkin     We cannot afford to take this disease lightly   I urge administration officials to study the GAO report and take swift action to ensure our agricultural community has the resources to fight this potentially costly disease             The GAO study found that the administration had made some progress in preparing to combat the disease   Specifically  USDA has taken important steps to establish a nationwide monitoring and surveillance system to track the spread of the disease  and USDA  s Risk Management Agency appears ready to cover losses from soybean rust for insured farmers   In addition  EPA has quickly approved state authority to allow the application of fungicides important to treating the disease            Unfortunately however  the study also concluded that the administration falls short in several key areas  specifically          Inadequate Monitoring Resources   The GAO survey found that many state agricultural officials felt they did not have adequate resources to monitor the spread of the disease by testing plant samples suspected of rust infection   This shortfall could allow soybean rust to spread undetected  worsening losses from the disease   In January of this year  Senator Harkin asked USDA to designate funds from the Commodity Credit Corporation to track the spread of the soybean rust  which GAO initially estimated would require  5 million   To date  USDA has only invested  1 2 million  diverted from other USDA activities         Farmers Lack Information on Insurance   USDA  s Risk Management Agency  RMA  has indicated that losses from soybean rust will be covered if insured farmers use good farming practices   Unfortunately  GAO found many growers are confused by the vague guidance provided by RMA about how the Agency will determine what qualifies as good farming practices relating to soybean rust   Farmers do not know what they need to do to ensure they will be able to successfully file crop insurance claims if they experience losses from soybean rust         Treatment Shortfalls   The GAO study found that a majority of soybean producing states doubted there would be sufficient fungicide and application equipment to treat outbreaks of soybean rust   This could mean that many farmers will not be able to treat the disease early enough to prevent damage or reduce the spread of soybean rust   In a letter to EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson today  Senator Harkin asked that he work closely with USDA to determine whether the availability of application equipment is a problem for farmers           The administration cannot wait for potentially massive losses to soybean yields to materialize     Harkin said      We have time to make the necessary improvements  and I call on the administration to act immediately to prepare for the possible spread of Asian soybean rust   Soybean crops in Southern states are already approaching the growing stage where plants will be vulnerable to this disease             Asian soybean rust is a fungus that attacks soybeans  and related plant species   and can cause reduced yields by up to 80 percent if not treated with fungicides   The fungus spores are lightweight and can easily be carried by wind over great distances   In Brazil  soybean rust has cost an estimated  1 5 billion to  2 0 billion annually for control measures and in lost yields   Soybean rust arrived in the United States late in the growing season last year  first in the state of Louisiana  and then spreading to eight other states   The disease has been detected again this spring in Georgia            A copy of Senator Harkin  s letters to USDA Secretary Mike Johanns and EPA Administrator Stephen Johnson are attached   The GAO report may be viewed at http   www gao gov                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
