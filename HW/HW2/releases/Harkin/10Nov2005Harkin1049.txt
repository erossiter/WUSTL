      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced the School Energy Crisis Relief Act to provide heating and fuel assistance to the poorest school districts in each state    The legislation would authorize the Secretary of Energy to provide School Energy Grants to school districts that are overburdened with increasing and unexpected energy costs             High energy costs are taking a heavy toll on Iowans throughout the state    from individual checkbooks to the budget of local schools districts     said Harkin     In our poorer school districts  we face the very real prospect of thermostats being lowered to 60 degrees and school children wearing coats in class   And that is just unacceptable                   In Iowa  more than 60 school districts would be eligible for these grants  which are awarded based on the number and percentage of students who qualify for Title I assistance   Eligible districts would include some of our largest cities as well as many smaller districts  especially in rural areas  which have very high transportation costs             The U S  Department of Energy  DOE  has warned that natural gas prices in the Midwest could jump as much as 71 percent   The Iowa Association of School Boards estimates that  this winter  there will be a  40 million shortfall in funding to cover school heating costs   Higher fuel costs for school buses could worsen the shortfall by another  8 million   And because that will come out of the fixed general fund for public education  every additional dollar spent on energy costs will come at the expense of classroom and instructional quality             For example  Charles City expects to spend  140 000 more on fuel this winter   enough to pay the salaries of four teachers   And already this has forced some schools to scale back after school activities because of heating costs and to cut non varsity sports because they lack funding necessary to transport them   Other schools have had to cut back on field trips  put off buying new text books and schools supplies and reduce course offerings in fine arts and academics              Increased funding is essential to help schools meet the demands of skyrocketing energy prices     said Harkin     Schools shouldn  t have to choose between filling the gas tanks of their buses and providing a quality education for our kids                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
