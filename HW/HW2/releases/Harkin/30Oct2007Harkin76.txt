 Washington  D C   In a letter to Chairman of the Global Issues Group  John Claringbould  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Congressman Eliot Engel  D NY   and their colleagues today urged him and his industry colleagues to heed next years deadline in implementing a credible certification and verification program for improved labor practices in Ghana and Ivory Coast   In 2001  Harkin and Engel worked with the chocolate and cocoa industries to develop a framework for the cocoa industry to eliminate the worst forms of child and slave labor in the growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derived products  The Harkin Engel Protocol marked a major first step in having an entire industry  including companies from the United States and Europe  taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of child labor and adult slave labor in its supply chain    These industries have taken important steps in agreeing to the protocol  responsibly addressing abuses in their own sector  said Harkin  Eight years later should be long enough for the industry to turn its words into deeds   It is time for them to act on their promises and have in place adequate transparency and credible verification systems as called for in the protocol    There is no doubt that the chocolate and cocoa industries have made progress in beginning to address child and slave labor  said Engel  But work remains to be done  2008 will be a crucial year for us and we expect to see nothing short of the concrete results that have long been promised    The Harkin Engel Protocol laid out a series of date specific actions  including the development of credible  mutually acceptable  voluntary  industry wide standards of public certification by July 1  2005 to give a public accounting of labor practices in cocoa farming in West Africa  Unfortunately  the 2005 deadline was not met but industry representatives agreed to accelerate their implementation of the protocol to cover at least fifty percent of the cocoa growing areas in Ghana and Ivory Coast by July 1  2008    To ensure compliance with this new deadline  Congress created an oversight body designed to give an impartial assessment of the industrys efforts to implement the protocol   Tulane Universitys Payson Center for International Development and Technology Transfer was chosen to carry out this task through a competitive process by the Department of Labor   Its first report will be made available to Members of Congress and the public tomorrow  October 31  2007    The following members of Congress joined Harkin and Engel in signing todays letter  Senators Christopher Dodd  CT   Herb Kohl  WI   Byron Dorgan  ND  and Congressmen and women Tom Lantos  CA   George Miller  CA   Barney Frank  MA   Jim McGovern  MA   GK Butterfield  NC   Peter DeFazio  OR   Eleanor Holmes Norton  DC   Elijah Cummings  MD   Chaka Fattah  PA   Alcee Hastings  FL   Jesse Jackson Junior  IL   Bobby Rush  IL   Phil Hare  IL   Raul Grijalva  AZ   Jeff Fortenberry  NE   Dave Loebsack  IA   and Mike Honda  CA        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
