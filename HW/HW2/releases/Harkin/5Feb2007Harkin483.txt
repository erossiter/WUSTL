                Today  Senate Republicans voted to block debate on questions we as Senators have a duty to ask   Does the President have a credible plan in Iraq that is worthy of the sacrifices of our brave men and women in the United States Military   Is the President s plan to escalate the war in Iraq in the best interest of the United States   Will the additional troops be sent into combat with proper equipment   The answer to those questions I strongly believe  after nearly four years of incompetence  bungling  and disastrously bad judgment by this administration   is a resounding  no                                              The President s plan to escalate the war is not just deeply disappointing  it is deeply disturbing  Escalation is not a way forward  it is a way deeper into a tragic quagmire   This is not in our national interest   It is not in the interest of the long suffering Iraqi people   And it is certainly not in the interest of our troops  who will be in the crossfire of a vicious civil war                                                An overwhelming majority of the American public have called for a change of course in Iraq   That s why it is deeply disappointing that Senate Republicans refuse to listen  and refuse to even have this debate   Americans deserve to know where each and every member stands on this escalation  and should not have to settle for Republicans providing political cover for President Bush                                                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
