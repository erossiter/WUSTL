         The study  by the Government Accountability Office  found that over 85 percent of 30 year olds  90 percent of 40 year olds  and half of 50 year olds experience deep cuts in their retirement benefits if they are shifted from a traditional pension plan into a cash balance plan without protections from retirement benefit losses that result from the transition               For the 30 year old worker  such a change brings an average benefit cut of  59 per month  40 year old workers lose  188 per month  and 50 year old workers lose  238 per month  Over one third of pension plan participants never vested in the cash balance plan because they did not meet the plan  s five year vesting requirement                 The GAO study  which examined 31 large pension plans and 102 smaller ones matched against over 100 000 participants  did not find a single case in which a cash balance plan provided the same level of retirement benefits that a typical defined benefit plan provided                 Sen  Tom Harkin  D IA   Reps  George Miller  D CA  and Bernie Sanders  I VT  and requested the GAO study last year and released the final report today  The lawmakers said that the study reinforces their view that pension legislation now pending in Congress should include a provision to protect the retirement benefits of workers who are at least 40 years old or who have at least 10 years of experience under cash balance conversions                 I welcome this report   I  ve always said that workers need transition protections when their employer changes the rules in the middle of the game     said Harkin    This independent analysis from the GAO confirms that  without some protections  everyone loses                      House Republicans are pushing pension legislation that is rife with problems  like saying to employers that it  s acceptable for them to cut the retirement benefits of older workers     said Miller  the senior Democrat on the House Education and the Workforce Committee    Workers have made career and financial decisions based upon these benefit promises  and they should not have their retirement plans dashed at the whims of the companies they  ve loyally served                       The GAO report is further proof of the need to stop companies from slashing the pension benefits of older workers through cash balance schemes     said Sanders  who has offered several successful amendments on the House floor against unfair cash balance pension conversions     What was especially surprising about this report is that these cash balance conversions hurt a greater percentage of younger workers than older workers   This flies in the face of the claims of companies that these conversions are better for younger workers   Clearly that is not true and companies that continue to push that line are just not being honest   Cash balance pension plans hurt everyone                    A number of major U S  companies  including IBM and AT  have converted their traditional pension plans into cash balance plans in the last 20 years  The GAO found that  in 70 percent of the cash balance conversions they studied  companies provided at least some measure of protection for workers who had been enrolled in the old system  Roughly half of companies allowed either all of their workers or their older workers to stay in the old plan                 The Senate is working to pass legislation that would allow cash balance plans to exist going forward  as long as they have a strong basic structure that protects worker  s wages   It would also prohibit companies from   wearing away    or eroding the value of the benefits of their older workers  including early retirement benefits  and requires some transition benefits for workers caught in the middle of a conversion                  Traditional pension plans  formally knows as defined benefit plans  guarantee retirees a fixed monthly payment in retirement based on variables like age and years of service to the company  In a cash balance plan  workers generally receive one lump sum payment at retirement or separation from service                The GAO study found that the key reason why workers experience benefit cuts after switching to cash balance plans is that the method for calculating cash balance plan benefits is less generous than the method for calculating benefits in a traditional pension               Harkin  Miller  and Sanders and have introduced legislation that would allow workers who are at least 40 years old or who have been on the job for at least 10 years the option to choose which pension plan works best for them at retirement                 The AARP  the AFL CIO  and the Pension Rights Center have all endorsed the legislation  In the House  the legislation is H R  4052  In the Senate  it is S  1304                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
