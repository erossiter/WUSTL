 Washington  D C   A Government Accountability Office  GAO  study released today found that access to commodity programs and to crop insurance is a key factor motivating producers to plow up range land  The report was requested by Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  and Congressman Collin Peterson  D MN   Chairman of the House Committee on Agriculture  Both Committees are charged with crafting a new farm bill   The GAO found that crop insurance  in particular  is motivating conversion by greatly limiting the risk of producing crops in areas that are marginal as cropland  For example  in the 16 South Dakota counties with the highest rate of conversion  the average net crop insurance payment was more than  13 per acre  nearly twice the payments received in all other counties in the state   We need to have farm policy that protects farmers from the vagaries of economic and weather cycles  but also protects the environment from unintended consequences like encouraging crop production on land that should remain in conserving uses like rangeland  said Chairman Harkin  Today  rising prices for commodities are creating powerful incentives to put marginal acres into crop production  So the need for federal policy to actively promote good conservation on working land is greater than ever   This report confirms what Ive been hearing in the region about the conversion of marginal land into cropland  said Chairman Peterson  The Farm Bill has to balance the demand for land in production with the equally important goals of conservation  and this report points out the need to constantly reevaluate and improve federal policy on these issues   Conversion of grassland with no cropping history disproportionately adds to the cost of federal disaster payments in the state as well  From 1998 through 2004  40 percent of all disaster payments went to the 16 counties with high conversion rates  with the other 50 counties getting the rest  These 16 counties received nearly  200 million in disaster payments in that seven year time period   Between 1982 and 1997  in South Dakota  1 69 million acres of cropland were enrolled in the Conservation Reserve Program and converted to grassland  During the same period  in the same state  1 82 million acres were converted from grassland to cropland   Grassland  and particularly native grassland  is a vital part of the American landscape  The prairie pothole region in the Northern Great Plains is critical nesting and broodrearing habitat for waterfowl  People call the prairie potholes the duck factory  because it is responsible for producing 50 percent of the total number of ducks for eight of the 12 most common species that breed there  However  the grasslands of the plains have been declining  with almost 25 million acres lost between 1982 and 2003  The leading cause has been conversion to cropland   The House passed version of the 2007 farm bill includes and Chairman Harkins proposal for the bill will include a provision that will eliminate the incentive to convert grassland because of government payments   The GAO report Farm Program Payments Are an Important Factor in Landowners Decisions to Convert Grassland to Cropland  GAO 07 1054  will be available after noon EDT on GAOs web site       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
