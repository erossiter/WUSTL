        I am not only concerned that the Siouxland facility is facing consolidation in another state  but also about the flawed process being used     said Harkin     This closing could have a very negative impact on service delivery for Sioux City and I am concerned that the public has not been included in discussions about this closing  We need a solid analysis of the impacts on service and delivery time that includes input from the community before this decision is made   If the analysis shows that delivery service will be delayed in Siouxland or any of the surrounding communities then the closing should not happen             The letter called on USPS to do the following             Complete a service audit of the Siouxland Mail Distribution Center          Provide the estimated annual cost savings of a possible consolidation prior to their final decision          Provide detail of the set of criteria they are using in the consolidation process  and          Provide the local community with the opportunity to review the study and in turn provide a competing study with viable alternatives for consideration before a final decision is reached          Last week  Harkin along with Siouxland area officials  met with Bill Galligan  Senior Vice President for Operations for USPS   However  USPS failed to clearly provide the criteria they used when making consolidation decisions or to provide a clear timeline of when it will make its final decision   Most important of all  local postal customers and businesses have received no explanation of likely service delays and degradations as a result of consolidation          Harkin also included a provision in the Postal Reform bill  which the Senate is currently considering  that would block USPS from implementing any consolidation study until they go back and conduct a transparent  public process that include community input and considers other community alternatives  This Postal Reform bill must still be passed by the House and the Senate          Harkin has also requested that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  conduct a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Eight months later  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing GAO  s recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process          A text of the letter is below              February 2  2006               Mr  John E  Potter      Postmaster General      United States Postal Service      475 L  Enfant Plaza SW Room 10022      Washington  D C   20260 0010         Dear Postmaster General Potter          We are writing to express our concern about the Area Mail Processing review of the Sioux City mail processing operations that is currently underway   While we appreciate your having made Senior Vice President of Operations Bill Galligan available to meet with Senator Harkin  Congressman King  a representative from Senator Grassley  s office  and a delegation of Siouxland community and business leaders on January 26th  2006  many questions remain unanswered            Although this review process is supposed to allow for stakeholder input  Siouxland postal customers  businesses  and concerned citizens have not been included in this review process and as a result have brought numerous concerns to us that have not yet been considered by the Postal Service   We remain extremely concerned that not including this information could taint the final outcome            Despite the meeting  we still lack a clear understanding of the criteria used by the Postal Service in making its mail processing consolidation decisions   Our constituents  who had traveled from Iowa to Washington  were also not given a clear timeline of when to expect a final decision   Perhaps most important of all  our local postal customers and businesses have received no explanation of likely delays and degradations in service that would result from consolidation            As a result we request that            A set of the criteria used by the Postal Service in undertaking its Area Mail Processing process be provided to us             Prior to a final decision  the Postal Service complete a service audit comparable to that being performed in the Las Cruces  New Mexico area  as requested by Senator Harkin and agreed to by Mr  Galligan              the Postal Service provide the local community with the opportunity to review the study and in turn provide a competing study with viable alternatives for consideration before a final decision is reached  as requested by Congressman King  and            Prior to final approval by the Postal Service the following information be made available to the public   the estimated annual cost savings of a consolidation  including the cost of moving the facility  capital investment and transition costs and increased transportation costs  jobs and job changes that might occur as a result of the consolidation  the impact on service for local businesses that rely on the processing center for the quick and efficient delivery of mail  and the impact on individuals who rely on the mail for vital services  such as mail order prescriptions   This information is critical to any real understanding of whether the final proposal is efficient and cost conscious            Thank you for your time and consideration  We look forward to a process that includes increased communication between the Postal Service and Siouxland leaders and stakeholders           If you have any questions or concerns regarding the above requests please contact Beth Stein with Senator Harkin and Paula Steiner with Congressman King   We look forward to your prompt response                 Senator Tom Harkin                                         Congressman Steve King            Senator Charles Grassley
