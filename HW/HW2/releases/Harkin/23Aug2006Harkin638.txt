 Washington  DC    The Government Accountability Office  GAO  today released a new report that further illustrates the cost containment challenges associated with the rapid expansion of WIC only stores in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women  Infants  and Children  WIC       WIC only stores are stores that serve only WIC participants  unlike regular competitive stores which serve WIC and non WIC customers  WIC participants receive the same nutritional benefit through the WIC program regardless of the prices charged by the participating store  Therefore  because WIC only stores serve only WIC participants  they have no motivation to price their goods at levels intended to attract a wide range of customers  thus removing market pressure to price WIC foods at competitive levels   The GAO focused its investigations on California  Texas  and Florida  three states where WIC only stores are most concentrated   In 2004  84 percent of WIC only vendors were concentrated in one of those states  though WIC only vendors were operating in 12 additional states and the District of Columbia   Consistent with prior analyses undertaken by USDA and non governmental organizations  GAO found that the participation of WIC only stores in the WIC program resulted in higher costs to the federal government   In particular  GAO found that if the market share of WIC only vendors had doubled in 2004  that     136 000 fewer low income mothers and young children would have been able to participate in the WIC program  including 62 000 in California  53 000 in Florida  and 21 000 in Texas  or WIC program costs would have increased by approximately  50 million dollars        The report comes after several years of bipartisan Congressional efforts to ensure that costs associated with WIC only stores are consistent with those of regular competitive grocery stores   In 2004  the Child Nutrition and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004  passed unanimously by the Senate and overwhelmingly in the House  included several provisions that required WIC only stores to charge prices consistent with competitive market levels  Recent appropriations bills have included a moratorium on the approval of new WIC only stores pending cost containment measures  currently being implemented across the country    For 30 years  the WIC program has been one of the pillars of our public health infrastructure in the United States   said Senator Tom Harkin    Ensuring the continued vitality of the WIC program depends on sound management  including appropriate cost containment measures   Today s GAO report confirms that Congress acted appropriately in the 2004 Child Nutrition Reauthorization to require WIC only stores to prices their products in a manner consistent with competitive grocery stores       A copy of the full GAO report is available upon request       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
