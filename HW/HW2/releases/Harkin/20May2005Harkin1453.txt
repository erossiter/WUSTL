        This is great news for former IAAP workers suffering from cancer and I thank Secretary Leavitt for his quick action on this issue    These workers have waited years to be compensated for work related illnesses   Their compensation is long overdue and it is high time they receive the help they need   These workers helped protect our nation and deserve nothing less   I will continue fighting for this compensation until the request is finalized                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
