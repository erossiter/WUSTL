       American Forces Radio is funded by taxpayers    conservatives  liberals and moderates alike     Harkin said     Unfortunately  it is failing to provide balanced representation of political viewpoints on its airwaves to American service members around the world            AFR is in violation of its own mandate  which states all political programming shall be characterized by its fairness and balance  While the schedules for each of AFR  s 33 individually programmed radio stations around the world provide a wide variety of music  sports  and news programming  not one minute of progressive talk radio programming is on the program schedules of these 33 stations   Conservative programming accounts for a cumulative total of 62 hours and 45 minutes of talk radio on AFR  s stations each week            Although the DoD mandate is established in an internal DoD directive  there is currently no statutory requirement for AFR programming to be fair and balanced   Harkin  s amendment would make into law AFR  s obligation to provide political programming that is fair and balanced and establish an Office of the Ombudsman   The ombudsman would be appointed by the Secretary of Defense and be completely independent of DoD staff  reporting directly to the Secretary and to Congress   The ombudsman would make suggestions to AFR management regarding ways to correct imbalances and present an annual report to the Secretary of Defense and Congress on whether AFR is satisfying its mandate to provide fair and balanced political programming            There is no reason that American service members should receive lengthy right wing commentaries with regularity on American Forces Radio  s talk service  without some balance from competing views as part of that same service     Harkin said     For the good of its listeners  and to meet its own mandate  American Forces Radio needs to make a greater effort to give a balanced  fair representation of varying political viewpoints on its talk radio service                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
