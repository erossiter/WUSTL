                     WASHINGTON  D C     As part of his advocacy for Americans with disabilities  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  has introduced the  Training for Realtime Writers Act of 2007   This bipartisan legislation  co sponsored by Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA   establishes competitive grants to help educational institutions train realtime writers  There is a growing need for realtime captioners because the Telecommunications Act of 1996 now requires that all new programming be captioned                              Closed captioning is a vital service that provides the hard of hearing with the information they need in their day to day lives   Harkin said   Although the law now requires that all programming be captioned  our nation still faces a serious shortage of captioners  I hope that this legislation will help alleviate that shortage                            Since 2002  Harkin has secured  2 17 million in funding for court reporting and captioning programs in Iowa   More than 28 million Americans  or eight percent of the population  are considered deaf or hard of hearing and require captioning services to participate in mainstream activities  Additionally  The National Institute on Deafness and other Communication Disorders estimates that one in three Americans over the age of 60 have already experienced hearing loss                                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
