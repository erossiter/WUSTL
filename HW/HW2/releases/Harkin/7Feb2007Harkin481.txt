          We are pleased to welcome this morning Secretary of Agriculture Mike Johanns to explain and answer our questions about the administration s proposals for the 2007 farm bill   We also again welcome Deputy Secretary Chuck Conner and Chief Economist Keith Collins  who accompany the Secretary                            We commonly refer to the  farm bill   but in fact that term captures only a fraction of what the legislation is called upon to address   All Americans have a stake in the farm bill   Its scope extends from helping agricultural producers to conserving our natural resources  promoting rural growth and jobs  alleviating hunger and improving nutrition  investing in food and agriculture research   and increasingly  to securing our nation s energy future                          I want to thank Secretary Johanns for making proposals that challenge us to take a new look at issues and problems and to consider new approaches   We have a responsibility to write a new farm bill which looks to the future   not one that clings to the status quo or the past                        We made a good deal of progress in the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  but farm bills are written for a limited number of years for good reason   Agriculture is among the most rapidly changing sectors of our economy  Policies that worked at one time may not be well suited to a new era filled with critical new challenges and opportunities for farm families  rural communities and our entire nation                        A core mission of the farm bill is promoting profitability and income potential in agriculture and a degree of stability and predictability in our nation s food and agriculture system   Americans have come to take for granted a plentiful  wholesome and affordable food supply   And it is in our nation s best interest to continue programs that help agricultural producers survive the vagaries of weather and markets                         We also need a farm bill that looks much further ahead   It must be bold enough and creative enough to prepare for and master challenges and opportunities on the horizon   We are in the midst of revolutionary changes in food and agriculture   most notably in farm based renewable energy   We put an energy title in the 2002 farm bill  and there is broad agreement that energy is perhaps the key driving force in this farm bill   I commend President Bush for his ambitious renewable energy objectives  although I believe his budget lacks the resources needed to achieve them                         I also welcome Secretary Johanns  proposals to increase our investment in agricultural conservation  rural development and research  to help beginning farmers and ranchers and to improve USDA s efforts in promoting nutrition and health and fighting hunger   We must do more in these areas   So my main questions are whether the administration s proposals are strong enough and whether it will back them up with the critical budget resources                         Again  Mr  Secretary  the Committee welcomes you and the valuable contribution of your proposals to our work in writing the new farm bill   I look forward to a good bipartisan working relationship with you and the administration and with my colleagues here in Congress  in drafting and enacting this vitally important legislation                                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
