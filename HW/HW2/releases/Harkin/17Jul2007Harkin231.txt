 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   issued the following statement on a draft modalities agreement released today by Ambassador Crawford Falconer  Chairman of the Committee on Agriculture  Special Session of the World Trade Organization  WTO   Harkin is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry   I applaud Chairman Falconers determination to move agricultural negotiations in the Doha Round forward  but I am not sure that this document achieves that goal    Although the majority of the key figures proposed by Mr  Falconer that would establish the level of reductions required in domestic support  agricultural tariffs  and export subsidies appear in the draft text as ranges  those ranges represent greater reductions in U S  domestic support and lesser gains in market access than were envisioned in the U S  proposal tabled in October 2005  If a final Doha round agreement were to reflect these ranges  it would face a difficult road in being approved by the U S  Congress   U S  negotiators also need to be careful about any changes that might be made to the various categories of programs treated under current WTO rules as non trade distorting or green box  It is essential that our government be able to maintain flexibility in these programs if we are to transition away from trade distorting forms of domestic support as is envisioned in the Doha Round of agricultural negotiations    The lack of progress in the Doha Round over the last year now means that it is very unlikely that the Round will be completed before Congress finishes work on the 2007 farm bill  As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee  I feel obligated to try to ensure that the provisions of the farm bill are consistent with our commitments under existing WTO rules  but not with provisions of a draft text that may or may not be reflected in a final Round agreement  if one is reached at all       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
