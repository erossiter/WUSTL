               Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced the Fair Pay Act of 2007 to address the wage gap for jobs of equal value among men and women  This legislation would address the historic pattern of undervaluing and underpaying so called  women s  jobs  For example  social workers  a female dominated field  are paid less than probation officers  a male dominated field  even though both jobs require similar levels of skill  effort  and responsibility  The Fair Pay Act says that where working conditions are similar  wages should also be similar                                In nearly 10 million American households  the mother is the only breadwinner  These families struggle to pay the rent or make mortgage payments  buy the groceries  cover the medical bills and save for a child s education   Harkin said   We simply must do something about the longtime pattern of wage discrimination  We can start closing the pay gap right now by simply paying women fairly                                  More than 40 years after the passage of the Equal Pay Act  women s wages still lag behind their male counterparts  wages   women make only 77 cents for every dollar that a man makes  The average woman loses an estimated  700 000 over her lifetime due to unequal pay practices                           The average African American woman earns 67 cents for every dollar that a white male earns and Latino women receive only 56 cents per dollar earned by white men                         On April 24th this year  U S  women will finally reach the earnings mark that their male counterparts achieved by December 31st of last year                           The Fair Pay Act of 2007 would                              Amend the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 to prohibit discrimination in the payment of wages on the basis of sex  race or national origin                              Require employers to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill  effort  responsibility and working conditions                            Apply to each company individually and prohibit companies from reducing other employees  wages to achieve pay equity                           Require public disclosure of employer job categories and their pay scales  without requiring specific information on individual employees                             Allow payment of different wages under a seniority system  merit system  or system that measures earnings by quantity or quality of production                              Allow employees who allege discrimination in wage setting based on sex  race or national origin to either file a complaint with the EEOC or go to court                        Right now  women who suspect pay discrimination must file a lawsuit and go into a drawn out legal discovery process to find out whether they make less than the man beside them  With pay statistics readily available  this expensive process could be avoided  The number of lawsuits would surely go down if employees could see up front that they were being treated fairly    Harkin also co sponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act which would take critical steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay  create strong incentives for employers to obey current laws  and strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts                         The following Senators co sponsored the Fair Pay Act of 2007  Edward Kennedy  D MA   Patty Murray  D WA   Barbara Mikulski  D MD   Daniel Akaka  D HI   Russ Feingold  D WI   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Patrick Leahy  D VT   John Kerry  D MA  and Sherrod Brown  D OH                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
