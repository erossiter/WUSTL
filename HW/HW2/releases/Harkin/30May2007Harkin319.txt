         WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued the following statement             I am extremely disappointed with the Supreme Court s verdict in Ledbetter v  Goodyear Tire   Rubber Company   It is astounding to me that in 2007  women still earn 77 cents for every dollar a man makes   This decision further cements a woman s disadvantage in the labor marketplace by ensuring a safe harbor for employers who have paid female workers less than men over a long period of time   basically giving the worst actors a free pass to go on with systemic gender discrimination   It reflects a poor understanding of the real problems with long term pay discrimination   Generally new employees feel less comfortable challenging their salaries  and it is very difficult to determine when pay discrimination begins   Furthermore  a small pay gap tends to widen over time  only becoming noticeable when there is systemic discrimination over a period of years   Today s news underscores the need for tighter legislative restrictions on discrimination against women in the workplace                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
