                  WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Representative Bruce Braley  D IA  today introduced the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act  legislation designed to help National Guard members and their families deal with the challenges they face before  during and after military deployments                            This is a new era for our National Guard and for the Reserves   Their role in defending our national security abroad has significantly increased   said Harkin    In turn  we have an expanded obligation to care for their spouses and children  who are facing tremendous stress  often alone and with no one to turn to for the support they need                                While the recent revelations and investigations at Walter Reed focused on medical care for our troops  military families are often a forgotten group when it comes to receiving mental health care and family support   Braley said    This bill recognizes that National Guard and Reserve families have unmet health and support needs that must be addressed   I learned when I was growing up in Iowa that neighbors help neighbors in need  and this important legislation will provide vital assistance for our military families                              Guard and Reserve members are shouldering a huge share of the combat burden in Iraq and Afghanistan  plus a stepped up role in homeland security   With many members on their third or even fourth deployment overseas  and with some deployments being stretched out to 16 months  the stress on their families can be quite severe   Guard and Reserve families are particularly vulnerable during this period because they usually don t live near a military base and do not have the same access to typical services as active duty military families                                To ensure that there is adequate professional staff to work with Guard and Reserve families and meet their special needs at every point of the deployment cycle   as they prepare for deployment  during the long absence  and during reunification and readjustment   the legislation would expand and strengthen the existing family assistance program   It would also                            Expand the Veterans Affair s  VA  Disabled Transition Assistance program to ensure that family members have access to family counseling and mental health services   Currently  there are few resources for the families of Guard and Reserve members who are wounded or experience mental illness                              Provide outreach to professionals who serve children   including child care providers and teachers   to alert them to the special needs of kids in military families  especially those with a parent deployed in a war zone  Children of deployed service members often react to parental separation with problems at school  behavioral problems  anxiety  or depression                        Ensure that families receive mental health information six months post deployment   Forty one percent of Guard members and Reservists report symptoms of mental illness   including post traumatic stress disorder   within six months of returning home from deployment   Currently  mental health information is distributed to service members when they return from deployment   and often that s it   But symptoms of PTSD may not appear for months after return                                   Because it can be extremely valuable for a military spouse to consult with someone who has gone through a similar experience  the legislation would also create a family to family mentoring program to enable military spouses to serve as peer counselors to other spouses and family members                                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
