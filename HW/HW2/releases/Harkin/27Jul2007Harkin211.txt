 Washington  D C   In response to press reports about the ruling in the Brazil cotton case  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  provided the following comment  This latest action was initiated by the government of Brazil in August 2006  asserting that the U S  government had failed to fully implement the ruling in the case made in March 2005  Senator Harkin is the Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry   On July 27  the World Trade Organization  WTO  provided the interim report of its compliance panel on the case filed by the government of Brazil against the U S  cotton program to the parties involved  the results of which were subsequently leaked  It reportedly upheld many of the claims made by the government of Brazil  finding that the U S  had failed to modify certain aspects of the domestic support for cotton producers  which had been found to violate WTO rules   We will have to see the full report and its reasoning to understand all of its implications  Undoubtedly  it is a matter of concern that our U S  farm programs are continually being questioned in the WTO dispute settlement process  In this case  Brazil evidently will be allowed to retaliate against U S  exports  That is a very serious outcome   It would be far preferable to settle these disputes through careful negotiation instead of WTO litigation  While  of course  the United States needs to defend our programs in the WTO  we also must recognize reality  solve the problems in our programs and move on  It is far more important to prepare for the future so American agriculture can succeed in this new century than to continue fighting losing cases before the WTO       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
