         WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today congratulated Iowa law enforcement officials for making progress in the fight against meth by taking the final steps to complete a statewide lockup of anhydrous ammonia tanks   So far  76 Iowa counties have successfully been provided with tank locks  and the Iowa Office of Drug Control Policy  ODCP  announced this week that the remaining 23 counties will receive locks this year    As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Harkin secured virtually all of the funding for the nearly completed tank locking effort through the Community Oriented Policing Services Meth Hot Spots program               I am pleased that every county in Iowa will soon have their tanks locked up  making it more difficult for meth producers to steal anhydrous ammonia and make this destructive drug     Harkin said     Locking up these tanks is a simple and inexpensive  yet critical and highly successful step in curbing the production of meth in our state             Harkin started the Iowa tank lock project in 2002  to prevent the theft of anhydrous ammonia  a highly toxic chemical used for fertilizer that is also a key ingredient in the production of methamphetamine  The project began with  200 000 to buy tank locks for the areas with the highest number of meth labs  and has since expanded  allowing Iowa law enforcement officials to secure thousands of tanks at a cost of about  45 00 each              I am proud that through the tank lock project  and enacting the strictest pseudoephedrine control law in the country  the state of Iowa has made some great strides in our struggle against meth     Harkin said     Unfortunately  the number of meth labs is again increasing  and therefore we must continue to have strict controls on pseudoephedrine and anhydrous ammonia if we are to win the fight against meth               A recent analysis found that the tank locks are highly effective  counties with locked tanks reported a five percent decrease in clandestine meth labs  compared to a 113 percent increase in the amount of clandestine labs in unlocked counties   According to the ODCP  when the locks are used properly  they have proven to virtually eliminate anhydrous ammonia thefts                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
