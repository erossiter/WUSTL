 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today co sponsored an amendment to establish minimum time periods of rest between deployments for members of the Armed Forces for Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  This new policy  a significant part of a new Iraq strategy being pushed by Senate Democrats  will be offered as an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2008   Specifically  this amendment  authored by Senator Jim Webb  D VA   mandates that if a unit or member of the regular Armed Forces deploys to Iraq or Afghanistan  they will have the same amount of time spent at home or longer before being redeployed  Further  no unit or member of the National Guard or Reserves could be redeployed to Iraq or Afghanistan within three years of their previous deployment  In the event of a national security emergency  the President would be able to waive these limitations by certifying to Congress that redeployment of the unit or member is necessary   It is simply unacceptable that our troops time at home has often been cut short  depriving them of the time they need to recover from combat  complete additional training and spend precious time with their families  said Harkin  This systematic abuse of re deploying our troops with little down time has placed enormous stress on our troops and their families  and has brought our Army to its breaking point  Having an established amount of time between deployments is crucial to protecting our troops mental and physical wellbeing and providing some stability and predictability for military families    Senator Harkin has authored other measures to assist the families of those serving in Iraq and Afghanistan  In March  Harkin introduced the Coming Together for Guard and Reserve Families Act  which would help National Guard members and their families deal with the challenges they face before  during and after military deployments  With many members of the Guard and Reserve on their third or even fourth deployment overseas  and with some deployments being stretched to 16 months  the stress on military families can be severe  Guard and Reserve families are particularly vulnerable during this period because they usually don t live near a military base and do not have the same access to support services as active duty military families   Harkin has also introduced The Joshua Omvig Suicide Prevention Act that would increase awareness of mental illness  the risk factors for suicide  and reduce the stigma of seeking mental health care amongst troops  According to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention s National Violent Death Reporting System  suicide disproportionately affects veterans  In 2004  veterans accounted for over twenty percent of deaths by suicide  yet they only make up ten percent of the general population   We owe it to the brave men and women who serve in uniform to give them time to rehabilitate both physically and mentally after returning from a combat zone  said Harkin       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
