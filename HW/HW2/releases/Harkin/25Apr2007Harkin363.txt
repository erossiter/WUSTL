                 Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today responded to the recommendations on child nutrition issued by the Institute of Medicine  IOM  for science based nutrition standards for foods sold in school venues that are not regulated by federal nutrition standards   such as vending machines  snack bars  and a la carte lines   The release of the IOM guidelines marks the culmination of the most comprehensive scientific investigation of the nutritional quality of foods in school to date                         Harkin was joined by Senator Lisa Murkowski  R AK  and the Center for Science in the Public Interest  CSPI  in a media conference call   The senators discussed the implications of the IOM recommendations for their bipartisan legislation  the Child Nutrition Promotion and School Lunch Protection Act   This bill would update decades old federal nutrition standards for snack foods sold in school cafeterias alongside the regular school meals  and also apply those standards everywhere on school grounds  including in vending machines and school stores                        For more than a decade  now  I have been working to improve child nutrition in our public schools   I have focused on the types of foods we want to encourage and promote and also on the types of foods we want to discourage and limit   But until today  we have lacked comprehensive  rigorous  science based recommendations regarding school nutrition standards for foods sold through vending machines  snack bars  school stores  and other sources                         Today  the Institute of Medicine filled that void   For the first time  we have gold standard recommendations from one of America s most distinguished scientific bodies   And as it turns out  they are also just common sense   promoting fruit and vegetable consumption  and also seeking to reduce excess consumption of calories  fat  and sodium                            These recommendations offer a toolkit for local  state  and federal policymakers who already know that we need to do more   much more   to promote sound child nutrition and prevent childhood obesity                           These new Institute of Medicine recommendations will also boost the momentum behind legislation that Senator Murkowski and I have introduced   Our bill would require USDA to update its antiquated nutrition guidelines and apply them everywhere on school grounds                            USDA currently uses outdated and incoherent nutritional guidelines for school foods   Making matters worse  those guidelines apply only to the school cafeteria during mealtime   Kids need only walk outside of the cafeteria in order to purchase soft drinks  chips  and candy bars   This is a junk food loophole big enough to drive a soda pop delivery truck through                          It s time to close this loophole and I m hopeful our legislation will pass                              Some may ask why federal legislation is needed given the voluntary school nutrition guidelines agreed to by the snack food and beverage industries                             The voluntary guidelines agreed to by the snack food and beverage industries in the past year were a good first step   I applauded them  and believe that they were agreed to in good faith  but they are unenforceable   In addition  the IOM recommendations are stronger than the negotiated guidelines to which the food industry agreed and grounded in science                              The No  1 consideration must be  What is in the best interests of our children   On that score  I am grateful to the Institute of Medicine for giving us scientific clarity about how best to proceed   Now it is our job   in Congress and in corporate America   to do the right thing for America s children                           Copies of the IOM executive summary can be furnished upon request                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
