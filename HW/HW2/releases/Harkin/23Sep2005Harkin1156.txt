        The current system of grain inspections works well and gives foreign customers confidence to buy agricultural products from the United States     said Harkin    It would be a risky proposition to turn our inspection process over to private firms whose business depends on the good favor of the grain companies they are inspecting             Currently  federal law requires USDA  s Federal Grain Inspection Service  FGIS  personnel to weigh  inspect and grade grain for export  The Senate version maintains the FGIS role  while the industry proposal would authorize private companies to take over inspection duties vital to ensuring the accurate weight and quality of U S  grain exports          In 1976  then Representative Harkin played a key role in amending the Grain Standards Act of 1916 which required that USDA personnel inspect grain exports following revelations that private inspection companies were misrepresenting the weight and quality of commodities sold to foreign customers  The scandal resulted in 60 federal indictments and unknown losses of export business for American farmers and businesses           Harkin believes substantially scaling back USDA  s authority and role in the inspection of U S  grain exports would be detrimental to ensuring the integrity and quality of the U S  agriculture export system and the reputation of U S  grain in international markets             When I first came to Congress  I helped repair a system that had failed    Harkin said    America  s farmers should never suffer the consequences of a loss of customer confidence in the quality of U S  grain exports  The federal inspection system in place today assures our foreign customers that what they pay for is what they receive               I especially want to commend and thank Chairman Chambliss for the opportunity to work together to pass this sound and important legislation     Harkin said    I hope the House of Representatives will act quickly and pass this bill in advance of the September 30 expiration of the current Grain Standards Act                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
