      WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called for broad and sweeping changes at the Department of Agriculture  USDA  to remedy failures to enforce laws designed to protect livestock and poultry producers from unfair  deceptive or anti competitive market practices   Today  the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry is considering a recent Harkin commissioned investigation by the USDA Inspector General that found widespread inaction and efforts to cover up this inaction at USDA  s Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA    In response  Harkin has introduced legislation that would reorganize USDA to more aggressively pursue unfair  deceptive and anti competitive market behavior              Failures to protect livestock producers reach all levels of USDA     Harkin said     For over five years  the Department essentially took no action against unfair market practices and high level USDA officials let it happen   We need changes at USDA to better confront bad actors in livestock and poultry markets               Harkin  s bill would reorganize USDA to establish an Office of Special Counsel whose sole responsibility will be to investigate and prosecute violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act and similar laws which protect producers   Currently  the Administrator of GIPSA oversees the Packers and Stockyards program and has the responsibility of enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act  GIPSA personnel responsible for investigating violations of the Packers and Stockyards Act would be transferred to The Office of Special Counsel   The Special Counsel would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate   This position will also serve as a liaison between the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission            Opening statement of Senator Tom Harkin  Ranking Democratic Member  to the Senate Agriculture Committee on USDA  s management and oversight of the Packers and Stockyards Act                   In 1921  Congress passed the Packers and Stockyards Act to protect livestock and poultry producers from unfair  unjustly discriminatory  or deceptive and anti competitive practices in the marketplace   Since enactment of this important law  the livestock and poultry industry has changed dramatically  especially in the past 15 years    Packing companies have become larger and the industry more consolidated and vertically integrated  often leaving producers with just a handful of buyers for their livestock and poultry   This imbalance of economic power increases the potential for unfair or discriminatory practices in the market    That is why enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act is so critically important   Producers depend on this law to protect them   So I commend the Chairman for holding this hearing today to examine USDA  s authority and commitment to enforcing this important law                   I had heard from a lot of producers that USDA was failing to act on their complaints of unfair and anti competitive practices by packers   I was also hearing that USDA was purposely misrepresenting its enforcement activities to give the appearance it was in fact enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act when it was not   So I asked the Inspector General to investigate   The Inspector General found that USDA management was preventing employees from investigating complaints of anti competitive conduct and even covering up its inaction by inflating the number of investigations listed in annual reports                   I  m sure USDA officials will promise today to do a better job of enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act   And for the sake of America  s producers  I hope they do   But it is important to remember that USDA has a long history of agreeing to make changes but never following through with them   The Inspector General made recommendations to improve USDA  s ability to investigate violations of anti competitive behavior in 1997  and the Government Accountability Office made similar recommendations again in 2000   I led efforts in Congress to provide funds to carry out GAO  s recommendations   It is now 2006  yet those recommendations were never implemented and the Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA  is now in complete disarray                        It is also troubling that while GIPSA was failing to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act  no one above the level of deputy administrator took corrective action   Where was the governmental oversight   Where was the GIPSA Administrator  the Under Secretary for Marketing and Regulatory programs or the Secretary of Agriculture   Most importantly  where was USDA  s Office of General Counsel  OGC     OGC has a history of inaction on enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act   Perhaps it comes as no surprise that OGC was not sending up red flags when GIPSA only referred two investigations of anti competitive practices to them over the course of several years   Surely OGC has a responsibility to enforce the law                Recently  I introduced with bipartisan backing the   Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act of 2006  to spur USDA enforcement action and strengthen producer protections against anti competitive practices    My legislation will create an office of special counsel for competition matters at USDA whose sole responsibility is to investigate and punish unfair  anti competitive behavior in agricultural markets   This high profile person will be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate to create new accountability for enforcing the Packers and Stockyards Act   The fact that the upper levels of USDA were unresponsive to the problems at GIPSA  despite the fact I was sending letters to the Secretary pointing out that such problems did exist  and the failure to implement past OIG and GAO recommendations  supports my assertion that a reorganization at USDA is badly needed                USDA officials have a lot of explaining to do in this hearing   We need to hear pledges and specific plans to reconstruct this broken agency    I call on USDA to support the changes I have proposed in my bill to remove layers of bureaucracy and reverse USDA  s longstanding apathy toward enforcing the law   I look forward to working with the Chairman and members of the Committee to enact these needed reforms                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
