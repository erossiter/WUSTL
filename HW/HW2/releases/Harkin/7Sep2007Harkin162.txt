 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today voted to pass the conference report for the College Cost Reduction and Access Act which helps students and families meet rapidly rising tuition costs  The bill  which merged the House and Senates priorities  invests more than  20 billion in student aid increases and cuts student loan interest rates in half over four years  With the passage of this legislation  Senate Democrats delivered on their campaign promise to make a college education more accessible to all   The bill pays for its financial assistance to college students by reducing excess subsidies paid to student loan lenders  Lenders have been shown to improperly make financial agreements with educational institutions in return for being designated as a preferred lender  Preferred lenders often reap a large majority of students business  even though they may not offer students the best deal   The President must sign this bill into law immediately  said Harkin Iowa students deserve financial relief and have waited long enough  Students are currently saddled with mountains of debt caused by skyrocketing tuition costs as they work to obtain higher education to maintain their competitive edge in the workforce  It is our responsibility to students and families to help them make ends meet as they journey into the next steps of their lives   As the cost of college has skyrocketed 40 percent over the last six years  the buying power of federal grant aid has fallen  forcing many students to turn to private loans with high interest rates  Between the 2000  2001 and 2005  2006 school years  the cost of attending  including tuition  fees  room and board  at a four year public college in Iowa increased 62 percent  from  7 589 to  12 329  Currently  72 percent of Iowa students at four year colleges and universities graduate with debt and the average amount of debt is  22 727  the second highest rate in the country      Many Iowa students will see increases to their Pell Grants  which they do not have to repay  The legislation will boost the maximum Pell Grant from  4 310 to  4 800 next year and  5 400 by 2011      This bill makes up for lost time by increasing the maximum Pell Grant to a level that will help more disadvantaged young people realize the dream of a college education  said Harkin  I fought to increase the maximum grant earlier this year and we will now build on that success and raise the Pell Grant maximum award   In addition to increasing Pell Grants  the College Cost Reduction Act caps federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrowers discretionary income  bringing needed relief to students with excessive loan burdens  For instance  an Iowa social worker with one child earning  35 530  with an average student loan debt of  22 727  would have his or her monthly payments reduced by  88  from  262 to  174       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
