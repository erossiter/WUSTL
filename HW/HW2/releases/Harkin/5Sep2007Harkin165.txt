 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today held a hearing to investigate the recent Utah mine disaster and how future tragedies can be prevented  The son of an Iowa coal miner  Harkin has continually pressed the Mine Safety and Health Administration  MSHA  to improve mine safety      The following witnesses testified at todays hearing  the Honorable Richard E  Stickler  Assistant Secretary of Laborfor Mine Safety and Health at the United States Department of Labor  Cecil Roberts  International President of the United Mine Workers of America  J  Davitt McAteer  Esq   Vice President of Sponsored Programs at Wheeling Jesuit University and formerly the Assistant Secretary for the Mine Safety and Health Administration under President Clinton  and Mr  Bruce Watzman  Vice President of Safety and Health for the National Mining Association      Harkin made the following statement at todays hearing      As we all know  last month  an underground collapse in the Crandall Canyon mine in Utah trapped six miners  My heart goes out to the families of the six missing miners      Three rescue workers died trying to save the trapped miners  One of those brave men  Gary Jensen  was an MSHA employee  Mr  Stickler  I understand how difficult this must be for you personally and I offer my condolences to you and for the loss of Mr  Jensen  Our hearing today will address what we know so far about why this accident happened and what we can do to prevent similar accidents from recurring in the future      I come from a coal mining family  so I appreciate the risks involved in mining  My father was a coal miner  starting around 1910  Not many people are aware that Iowa was a coal producing state in the early 20th century  In fact  my father mined coal there for 23 years      And  not only was Iowa an active coal state  it also is home to the great labor leader  John L  Lewis  Lewis was born February 12  1880  to Welsh immigrant parents  in the coal mining camp of Cleveland  Iowa  one mile east of Lucas  Now  Lucas is home to a museum in his honor      Anyhow  I will never forget the stories my dad told me about how they used to pump air down into the mines  and ride rickety old elevators down the mine before sunrise and come back up after the sun had set  He and his fellow miners would describe the cave ins and other tragic losses of their friends  The bravery of these men really left an impression on me  Its also why I believe we need to do all we can to protect workers who operate in dangerous settings like these      A lot has changed since my father started mining in Iowa  almost 100 years ago  Thats why I continue to ask why we do not have better systems for communicating safely and effectively with miners underground after an accident  or at least knowing where they are through some tracking technology  I am disappointed that MSHA has not been able to approve the use of better communication and tracking systems and that mine operators are not employing the best technology currently available to protect their employees      Our hearing today will focus what this subcommittee and agencies under its jurisdiction MSHA  NIOSH  to make mining as safe as possible  We also need to understand MSHAs actions leading up to the accident in Crandall Canyon  What did MSHA know about the bounces that occurred in March before it approved the plan to mine in the area of the accident  Is the approval process for this type of mining rigorous enough  Is the inspection process identifying everything it should when miners are pulling pillars of coal 2 000 feet beneath the earth      We also need to know how the rescue operation plan was developed  Did we get the best thinking and technology available to the table  I know MSHA sponsored the third annual International Mine Rescue Conference just last week  What did we learn about what other countries are doing in effective mine rescue operations that can be adopted here      And  most importantly  why do we continue to have these hearings  Its been more than 18 months since the hearing after the Sago disaster in West Virginia      This Congress has taken significant steps to give the Administration the resources and tools it needs to work toward zero fatalities and serious injuries in underground coal mines  The 2006 emergency supplemental appropriations bill included  25 million to hire more mine inspectors  The 2007 appropriations bill included more than  300 million for MSHA  almost  14 million more than the President requested in his budget  The Administration must respond by effectively spending these substantial resources and delivering the kind of results that mining families across the country expect and deserve      Before we hear from our witnesses  I would like to recognize Senator Byrd and Senator Specter for their vital role on mine safety issues  Senator Specter and I continue the seamless passing of the gavel for this subcommittee and both had a great interest in calling for this hearing  He is a true friend to miners in Pennsylvania and the United States  His legislation was crucial in forging the bipartisan MINER Act  which was passed last June       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
