                   Today s hearing examines our nation s agricultural export and international food assistance programs within our Committee s jurisdiction  which together make up the core of the farm bill s trade title                               Trade in food and agricultural products is vitally important to the U S  agriculture sector   Since the 2002 farm bill was enacted  U S  agricultural exports have increased by 30 percent  with the past three years each setting a new record   Agricultural imports are increasing even more quickly  with the annual net trade balance shrinking to less than  5 billion in the past two years   And from 1984 to 2005  the U S  share of global agricultural exports has fallen by more than half   In a nutshell  those figures illustrate both the potential and the stiff challenges in trade for U S  agriculture                                  The United States has historically been the world s most dependable food donor nation  accounting for more than half of total food donations globally in the last several years   Our basic standing food assistance program  long known as Food for Peace  or P L 480  was enacted over 50 years ago   Over the years  the nature of the problems faced in developing countries has changed  and so we need to consider how we should change our food aid programs to better address today s circumstances   For that reason  Senator Chambliss and I asked the Government Accountability Office  GAO  to examine our existing food aid programs to see how their efficiency and effectiveness can be improved   The full GAO report will be released next month  but the key recommendations will be presented in testimony today                                  USDA s farm bill proposal recommends additional funds for the largest trade promotion program  the Market Access Program   It also calls for new initiatives mostly targeted at enhancing export opportunities for specialty crops   The proposal also includes modest changes to various export credit programs and elimination of the Export Enhancement Program  which has not been used in more than a decade   Our Committee will take a serious look at these ideas  and a number of them may eventually be incorporated into the new farm bill                                  There are longstanding discussions and disagreements over the ramifications of U S  food aid in developing countries and international markets   Some have argued for eliminating in kind shipments of food aid and converting this form of assistance to grants of money   The administration has proposed allowing up to 25 percent of our P L 480  Title II  funding to be used for cash purchases instead of for buying and shipping U S  commodities for donation   Congress has not embraced this idea previously  in large part because not much is known about how it would work in practice   Our Committee will carefully consider this proposal and examine the likely consequences should it be adopted                                  I thank our witnesses for appearing today and look forward to their comments concerning trade and food aid and their recommendations for the new farm bill                                                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
