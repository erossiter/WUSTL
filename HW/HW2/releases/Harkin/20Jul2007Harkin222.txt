 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today praised the Senates passage of legislation that will make college more affordable for millions of Americans  In light of rapidly rising tuition costs  the College Cost Reduction Act increases the amount and availability of Pell grants and takes other measures to help low and moderate income Americans pursue higher education  With the passage of this legislation  Senate Democrats delivered on their campaign promise to make a college education more accessible to all   At a time when higher education is more important than ever for career success  rapidly increasing tuition costs are pushing college out of many students reach  Those who can go to college often graduate with a mountain of debt that restricts their career choices and forces them to delay making important investments  such as buying a car or a home  Harkin said  This much needed legislation will help students across the country pursue higher education and gain a competitive edge in todays global economy  With this bill  Senate Democrats are fulfilling their promise to make it easier for Americas young people to obtain the tools they need to pursue the American dream   As the cost of college has skyrocketed 40 percent over the last six years  the buying power of federal grant aid has fallen  forcing many students to turn to private loans with high interest rates  Between the 2000  2001 and 2005  2006 school years  the cost of attending  including tuition  fees  room and board  a four year public college in Iowa increased 62 percent  from  7 589 to  12 329  Currently  Iowa students at four year colleges and universities graduate with an average of  22 727 in debt  the second highest rate in the country   The College Cost Reduction Act will reduce many Iowa students debt by cutting excess subsidies to the private loan program by  18 billion and channeling those savings into Pell Grants  which students do not have to repay  The legislation will boost the maximum Pell Grant from  4 310 to  5 100 next year and  5 400 by 2011   In addition to increasing Pell Grants  the College Cost Reduction Act caps federal student loan payments at 15 percent of a borrowers discretionary income  bringing needed relief to students with excessive loan burdens  For instance  an Iowa social worker with one child earning  35 530  with an average student loan debt of  22 727  would have his or her monthly payments reduced by  88  from  262 to  174   This legislation would also encourage public service by providing loan forgiveness for graduates who pursue public service careers such as nursing  teaching or law enforcement  For example  a starting teacher in Iowa who earns  27 284 and has the state average loan debt of  22 727 would have his or her loan payments capped at 15 percent  This would reduce the teachers monthly payments by  112  from  262 to  150  After 10 years of teaching  all remaining debt would be forgiven  in this case  a benefit worth  17 150       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
