   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today welcomed the United States Department of Agriculture  USDA  decision to drop plans that would close over one in five Iowa Farm Service Agency  FSA  offices and 30  nationwide   The proposal would have severely curtailed USDA  s service to Rural America with no input from affected farmers or communities   Until today  s announcement  the administration had maintained that closing FSA offices would improve services to farmers             This was a half baked and ill advised plan from the beginning     Harkin said      Thankfully  the public uproar from the plan resulted in it being put off   I will watch closely to make sure this plan isn  t repackaged and rolled out again in the future                USDA  s plan would have caused lengthy drives for farmers to FSA offices  longer lines and more inconvenience to see local FSA officials   Many county FSA offices in rural areas like Iowa are located in the same facility as Natural Resource Conservation Service  NRCS  offices   Under USDA  s plan  many farmers would deal with NRCS in their home county  but have to travel to another country for FSA services              This plan simply did not make sense     Harkin said     I welcome the administration  s decision to shelve a plan that would have confused and frustrated many farmers                The plan would have closed 22 of the following Iowa 78 county FSA offices  Adair  Adams  Allamakee  Appanoose  Black Hawk  Bremer  Buena Vista  Butler  Calhoun  Carroll  Cass  Cedar  Cerro Gordo  Chickasaw  Clarke  Clay  Clayton  Clinton  Crawford  Dallas  Davis  Decatur  Delaware  Des Moines  Dickinson  Dubuque  Emmet  Fayette  Floyd  Franklin  Fremont  Grundy  Hamilton  Hancock  Hardin  Henry  Howard  Humboldt  Ida  Jackson  Jefferson  Jones  Keokuk  Kossuth  Lee  Linn  Louisa  Lucas  Madison  Mahaska  Marion  Marshall  Mills  Mitchell  Monroe  Montgomery  Muscatine  Osceola  Page  Palo Alto  Pocahontas  East Pottawattamie  West Pottawattamie  Ringgold  Sac  Scott  Story  Taylor  Union  Van Buren  Wapello  Warren  Wayne  Webster  Winnebago  Winneshiek  Worth  and Wright                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
