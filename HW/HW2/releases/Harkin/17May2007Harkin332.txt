                     The 2002 farm bill provided the greatest expansion of conservation funding in history   Yet the promised conservation initiatives   expanding EQIP  creating the CSP program  continuing to expand acres protected in the WRP   were denied because funding was cut in subsequent legislation   This year s farm bill provides an opportunity to reverse the damage of those budget cuts   That is more necessary than ever given the demands placed on conservation by the record planting this season and the need to produce more biofuels for national energy security                        The House bill perpetuates the damage to conservation and the environment caused by the previous two Congresses and the Bush administration   Farmers need more conservation funding on agricultural land  yet the House bill doesn t provide it   We need to devote funding to providing farmers the tools they need to produce the food  fiber and fuel America needs  while also producing the environmental benefits like clean water and abundant wildlife that come from good conservation                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
