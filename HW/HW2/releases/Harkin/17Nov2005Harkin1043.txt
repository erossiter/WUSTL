           Well  the bill that emerged from conference this week certainly reflects the Republicans   priorities   But it does not reflect the priorities of the American people                The Republicans   bill reduces federal investments in education for the first time since the Newt Gingrich era   It cuts Head Start  and shortchanges the No Child Left Behind Act by a whopping  13 billion                   It cuts total health care funding by nearly  900 million   And essentially level funds the National Institutes of Health for the first time in 35 years                The Republicans say they are making   tough choices      But this rings totally hollow  because the whole point of these cuts to education and healthcare is to make room for another  60 billion in tax cuts  overwhelmingly for the wealthy                   Just as disturbing is what is not in this bill   The Republicans completely eliminated the nearly  8 billion that I put in the Senate bill to finance emergency preparations for an avian flu pandemic                  I have been doing everything in my power to prod the administration to get moving on avian flu   Now we are left with vague assurances from the Republicans that they  ll get around to paying for an attack on avian flu at some future  unspecified time                This continued procrastination is just unfathomable   I mean  what part of   inevitable pandemic    don  t the Republicans understand               Think about it  Japan came up with its plan to fight avian flu in 1997   This week the Chinese announced a plan to vaccinate 14 billion birds   And  here in the U S   we have no money to buy vaccine for a single human being                   So we are playing catch up ball  and every day matters                  Every day we wait is another day that we are not stockpiling antiviral drugs                 Every day we wait is another day can  t purchase vaccine                 Every day we wait is another day that other countries get in line ahead of us                 Frankly  I am at wit  s end trying to prod this administration to action   Look at this calendar   Look at all the days and months that have been squandered                 Way back on April 20  Senator Specter and I wrote to Secretary Leavitt requesting a plan to fight avian flu                   April and May passed  and there was no plan                  June and July passed   No plan                 In August and September  avian flu was confirmed in humans all across Asia   Still no plan                 In October  avian flu spread to Europe  and I attached my avian flu amendment to the Labor HHS appropriation bill   Still no plan from the administration                 This month  finally  the administration announced a plan   We ought to get moving on it   But instead  this week  the Republicans struck all avian flu funding from the Labor HHS bill   So once again  we are stopped cold                 This is the height of irresponsibility   It puts us further behind the curve   And it puts the American people at risk                  So I won  t mince words   We need to defeat this bill when it comes to the floor   And we need to force the Republicans to come back to the table and fund the American people  s priorities    not yet another round of tax cuts                 MISPLACED PRIORITIES              THE LABOR HHS EDUCATION CONFERENCE REPORT                    The Senate and House will soon consider the FY 2006 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations Conference Report   This bill is the most recent evidence that working and middle class families are paying the price for Republican tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans   Overall  the conference report cuts labor  education  health care  and human services by  1 3 billion from last year                 HEALTH CARE               Health care initiatives face  976 million in cuts including a  249 million cut to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention  and deep cuts to programs to improve healthcare access such as Rural Health Outreach grants  Maternal and Child Health Block Grants  and training for Health Professionals   Programs such as the Rural Emergency Medical Services and the Healthy Communities Access Program are eliminated altogether   As a result of these cuts  not one new community health center will be created next year                The bill also includes the smallest percentage increase for the National Institutes of Health  NIH  since 1970  which will hinder promising medical research and disease prevention initiatives               EDUCATION             This bill cuts education funding for the first time in a decade   The Department of Education is cut by  59 1 million  and No Child Left Behind Programs are cut by  780 million   There are cuts to Even Start literacy services  Safe and Drug Free Schools  and Technology Grants  and the maximum Pell Grant is frozen for the fourth year in a row even as college costs are skyrocketing   And  for the first time in 10 years  the federal government will slide backwards on its commitment to students with disabilities            LEAVING FAMILIES OUT IN THE COLD           The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  is frozen at last year s level  despite Department of Energy predictions that many families will see a 50 percent increase in fuel costs this winter              AVIAN FLU PREPAREDNESS              Senator Harkin and Senate Democrats led the fight to prepare for a possible avian flu outbreak by including nearly  8 billion in federal funding for avian flu preparedness in the Senate version of the Labor H bill   The proposal would have allowed the United States to stockpile vaccines and antiviral drugs  invest in our vaccine infrastructure  improve our global surveillance  strengthen state and local public health departments  improve hospital preparedness and surge capacity  expand outreach and education efforts  and increase surveillance of migratory birds             Although the Administration offered a plan nearly identical to the Harkin measure a few weeks later  Republicans stripped the Harkin amendment from the final version of the bill   Without this funding  preparations for an influenza pandemic will be further delayed
