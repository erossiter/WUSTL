   WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today released a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report outlining the United States Department of Agriculture s  UDSA  defenses against Asian Soybean Rust  ASR   The report revealed that USDA has done a solid job of monitoring ASR and preparing America s farmers to handle the disease  GAO cautions however that soybean rust remains a substantial threat to farmers and highlights areas that can be improved  A 2004 USDA study estimated that a widespread outbreak could cost farmers up to  2 billion a year in losses   Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee                   It s clear that our nation has made progress and strengthened our farmers  defenses against soybean rust   Harkin said   But this disease could still impose huge losses on soybean farmers and others involved in the soybean industry   I hope USDA will continue to strengthen coordination among the federal government  state governments  and all parts of the soybean sector to minimize the threat this disease poses to the U S  soybean industry               Among the report s key findings are the following                    Sentinel plots  areas of soybeans planted in advance to detect soybean rust  served as a way to identify where ASR was present and warn producers in potentially affected areas nearby   Effective monitoring and public notification of new finds of ASR led to timely fungicide application which likely hampered the spread of the ASR spores                   Inconsistency in reporting of soybean rust between states left some producers without timely  accurate information on the spread of the disease  One state only reported its findings four times during the growing season while another state reported on 162 different occasions  This inconsistency in reporting also impedes the progress of researchers in developing statistical models designed to predict the spread and severity of Asian soybean rust in future crop years                    USDA and EPA coordinated efforts effectively to ensure that pesticides were registered in a timely fashion so farmers could use them against soybean rust  Concerns remain about whether the supply of these fungicides will be available should soybean rust spread rapidly                    GAO s report outlines potential problems in the planned transfer of management responsibilities for nationwide ASR monitoring and tracking from USDA s headquarters to research scientists at North Carolina State University  This monitoring and tracking effort received priority attention and resources from USDA in 2005  and GAO expresses concern about whether the current degree of national coordination can be maintained once the planned transfer of authority occurs   The GAO report recommends USDA issue rules to ensure elements of the successful 2005 effort are preserved and improved following any transfer of responsibilities outside of USDA               USDA anticipated the problems soybean rust would present to our farmers and has taken appropriate steps to fight it  I commend the Department for its work on this matter  USDA needs to remain one step ahead of soybean rust   said Harkin   We need to have a consistent standard for monitoring and informing producers of where the disease is so they can take appropriate action to protect their crops while avoiding unnecessary application of fungicides                     This report is a follow up to a GAO report requested by Harkin and released in May 2005 which focused on USDA s preparations for soybean rust before the disease reached the United States and on USDA s actions immediately after ASR was discovered within the country   A copy of the report can be obtained at  www gao gov                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
