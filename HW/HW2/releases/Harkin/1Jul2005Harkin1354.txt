         Protocol Establishes Framework for Progress           In September 2001  chocolate and cocoa industry representatives signed an agreement  developed in partnership with Senator Harkin and Representative Engel  to eliminate the worst forms of child labor in the growing of cocoa beans and their derivative products from West Africa            The agreement  known as the  Harkin Engel Protocol   laid out a series of date specific actions  including the development of credible  mutually acceptable  voluntary  industry wide standards of public certification by July 1  2005    to give a public accounting of labor practices in cocoa farming               The Harkin Engel Protocol marked an important first   an entire industry  including companies from the United States  Europe and the United Kingdom  taking responsibility for addressing the worst forms of child labor and forced labor in its supply chain   Today  the Protocol stands as a framework for progress  bringing together industry  West African governments  organized labor  non governmental organizations  NGOs   farmer groups and experts in a concerted effort to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced labor from the growing  processing and supply chain of cocoa in West Africa         Since the Harkin Engel Protocol was signed  some positive steps have been taken to address the worst forms of child labor in cocoa growing   These include the creation of the International Cocoa Initiative foundation  which is now beginning to form partnerships with NGOs to provide social protection programs in West Africa   Also  small pilot projects have been initiated  which will be assessed and used to develop a child labor monitoring system   While the July 1  2005 deadline will not be fully met  industry has assured Sen  Harkin and Rep  Engel that it is fully committed to achieving a certification system  which can be expanded across the cocoa growing areas of West Africa and will cover 50  of the cocoa growing areas of Cote d  Ivoire and Ghana within three years              The Harkin Engel Protocol established a framework to improve the living and working conditions for families and children who are growing  harvesting  and exporting the cocoa we enjoy here in America     Harkin said     I am disappointed that the July 1 deadline established in the Protocol was not fully met   But I am pleased that they have committed to redouble their efforts to create a certification system and eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced labor in the cocoa fields and throughout the supply chain   The farmers and children in the cocoa growing countries deserve no less                 After meeting with the cocoa industry  I am comfortable that the industry is committed to moving forward even though I am disappointed that the original deadline was not fully met     Engel said     I am committed to working with them  because only with the cooperation of the chocolate industry will we end the worst forms of child labor and forced labor in Ghana and the Cote D Ivoire  I am assured that progress will be made and deadlines will be met               Commenting on efforts to date and the road ahead  Lynn Bragg  President  Chocolate Manufacturers Association  CMA   and David Zimmer  Secretary General of Association of the Chocolate  Biscuit   Confectionery Industries of the EU  CAOBISCO   jointly said               The leadership of Senator Harkin and Representative Engel gave us an historic opportunity   when the Protocol was signed    to bring about meaningful  positive change   Today  we remain committed to the Protocol and to a supply chain free of the worst forms of child labor and forced labor                    While we would like to be further along than we are in this effort  the building blocks are in place today for the development of a certification system which can be expanded across the cocoa growing areas of West Africa  and for programs to improve the well being of farm families   The Harkin Engel Protocol will continue as the framework for these efforts to get the job done                  Next Steps           Going forward  the chocolate and cocoa industry is dedicating more than  5 million annually to support the full implementation of the certification system for cocoa farming labor practices  and for programs to improve the well being of the more than 1 5 million farm families growing cocoa in West Africa  including efforts to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced labor    Specifically  industry efforts include             Rollout of the certification system    including monitoring  data analysis  reporting and activities to address the worst forms of child labor    as aggressively as possible in Cote d Ivoire and Ghana  with a goal of covering 50 percent of the two countries  cocoa producing areas by July 2008    This is a milestone on the way towards the ultimate goal of 100 percent coverage in the two countries              Support for programs to improve conditions in West African cocoa farming communities  and to address the worst forms of child labor and forced labor at the community level  through the International Cocoa Initiative  ICI  foundation  the World Cocoa Foundation  WCF  and the Initiative for African Cocoa Communities  IACC    These programs include  among others  recently announced support for expansion of Winrock International s education efforts in Cote d Ivoire and for an International Foundation for Education   Self Help  IFESH  teacher training program that will benefit approximately 40 000 children annually in Ghana and Cote d Ivoire                 Four years ago  I embarked on this historic effort with Sen  Harkin and the world s cocoa industry to combat the worst forms of child labor in cocoa fields     Engel said     Some progress has been made  but it is my fervent hope that in four more years Senator Harkin and I will be able to stand with the industry with pride as we see vastly improved conditions on cocoa farms in West Africa                  The industry funded child labor oversight organization  the Cocoa Verification Working Group  recently published a discouraging report on the chocolate industry  s progress to eliminate the worst forms of child labor and forced labor from the cocoa fields   The report made several recommendations  and I hope that industry will take these recommendations seriously as we move forward in the Protocol process     said Harkin     To ensure accountability  positive momentum and transparency  we have agreed to establish an independent oversight entity to monitor the further implementation of the Harkin Engel protocol                              Originating Site  Number  Site
