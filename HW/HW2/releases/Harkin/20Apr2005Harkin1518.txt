        Meth continues to plague Iowa    destroying lives  families and entire communities     said Harkin     Law enforcement in Iowa has been successful in reducing the supply and demand of methamphetamine   However  this effort is in jeopardy without the resources and coordination that the Midwest HIDTA program provides to Iowa law enforcement   We cannot allow our region to suffer a dramatic loss in drug enforcement capabilities at this critical time in our fight against methamphetamine               According to the regional Directors of the HIDTA program  the proposed cuts would shut down most of the task forces  intelligence centers and other activities funded by HIDTA and result in the elimination of most of the 28 individual HIDTAs   This will cause a significant gap in drug enforcement coverage  particularly in rural areas  that state and local law enforcement will be incapable of filling              In 2004  HIDTA task forces disrupted or dismantled 744 drug trafficking organizations that were engaged in distributing methamphetamine   These task forces seized and dismantled 5 065 clandestine lab operations capable of producing  51 742 000 worth of methamphetamine   These same HIDTAs were involved in locating and clearing 2 663 clandestine lab hazardous waste dumpsites  60  of all dumpsites nationwide  and seizing 1 703 partial non operational clandestine labs            Harkin also urged continued funding for this program within the Office of National Drug Control Policy  ONDCP   rather than within the U S  Department of Justice s Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force  OCDETF    To date  no explanation has been provided for the proposal to move HIDTA to the Department of Justice              We cannot afford to let methamphetamine and other illicit drugs to again take hold of our communities     Harkin said     For the security of this nation and the protection of our communities and our families  we urge you to fund the HIDTA program at the FY 2005 level of  228 million               A copy of the letter is available upon request                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
