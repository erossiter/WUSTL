         WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin today said he is pleased that the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  has responded to recommendations he and others have made for strengthening USDA  s protections against bovine spongiform encephalopathy  BSE  but is concerned that significant shortcomings in the anti BSE efforts still exist   Harkin  s comments were based on findings within a USDA Inspector General  OIG  report to be released later today on BSE surveillance efforts   Harkin emphasized that consumers should not have concerns about the safety of beef  but that USDA must strengthen its anti BSE efforts to head off potential BSE problems in the United States and to shore up consumer confidence both here and in foreign markets               This report finds that USDA has made some progress in improving America  s anti BSE firewalls     Harkin said     Yet a good deal more must be done  The OIG identified shortcomings throughout USDA s anti BSE program   I urge USDA to expedite implementation of OIG  s recommendations in order to assure our trading partners and consumers around the world that U S  beef is safe               Some of the key findings in the 118 page report include            Sampling is Poor   Since USDA  s expanded testing and surveillance program is voluntary  it is unclear whether its sampling design was sufficient to make conclusions about the prevalence of BSE in the United States   The report emphasized the need to ensure that limitations in the testing and surveillance program are apparent to the public given that industry stakeholders could misinterpret USDA  s conclusions              Since USDA  s testing is voluntary  we still cannot demonstrate with certainty that the incidence of BSE is extremely low in U S  cattle  which we believe to be the case     Harkin said     USDA should design its program to ensure it is truly representative of U S  cattle at risk for BSE   Presently  it does not               Potential Problems in Tracking the Disease   OIG has found that USDA has not maintained a complete database of all meat renderers so that so that the Department can trace any possible infection back to its origins   This information is also needed to aid proper functioning of the proposed national animal identification system              The OIG listed numerous instances when USDA had difficulties tracing the origin and age of cattle   An animal ID system would resolve these issues immediately                 An animal identification program could help solve many of the current problems this report identified in USDA  s anti BSE efforts     said Harkin     Unfortunately  the administration has dragged its feet on this and lacks a clear plan for moving forward with an effective  feasible and practical system for producers               20 000 Clinically Normal Cattle Sample Poorly Done   USDA did not conduct tests of clinically normal aged cattle in a statistically valid manner   This is important because countries in Europe have had a small number of cases with BSE from these clinically normal aged cattle   Harkin has written letters to USDA requesting random testing among cattle born around the time of the feed ban   the key safeguard for managing BSE                The OIG found that USDA put forth a half hearted effort to conduct this testing  and focused on younger cattle    guaranteeing their findings would be largely meaningless     Harkin said    I am disappointed in USDA  s efforts in testing these animals and maintain that their testing should be a critical component of the Department  s surveillance program               Problems in demonstrating removal of specified risk materials  SRM  from food   OIG could not determine if SRM procedures were followed due to a lack of record keeping at many establishments   OIG also found that inspectors responsible for ensuring proper SRM removal were not always experienced to identify problems   This limits their ability to know when requirements for removing risk materials are not met              Removing risk materials is the primary way to prevent the introduction of BSE into the food supply    and this is the key part of the protections that consumers are counting on     Harkin said     It is vital that these shortfalls are corrected immediately                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
