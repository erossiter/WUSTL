     Thank you  Burtch  for that generous introduction   It  s good to see Jerry Hadenfeldt  director of government relations with Meredith Corp  in Des Moines    In addition to Burtch  I  d like to thank Bob Liodice and Wally Snyder for your kind invitation to meet with you this morning             This invitation speaks volumes about your industry   It tells me that you are interested in genuine dialogue and a good faith exchange of views    even where we have honest disagreements   In Washington  today  that kind of openness is in very short supply   So I am grateful to you              That said  as I was driving here  I couldn  t help but recall Mark Twain  s story about the missionary who went among the cannibals to convert them to his faith   As Twain told it     They listened with great interest to everything the missionary had to say   And then they ate him     I trust that you folks have already had a good breakfast            The fact is  politicians and advertisers have a lot in common   We both operate in intensely competitive environments   We both live or die by our ability to sell  to persuade  to shape public opinion and personal choices   Here  this morning  I appreciate that I  m surrounded by master communicators and persuaders      some of the most creative minds in America              While political leaders have the persuasion of power  you folks have the power of persuasion   That  s real power  with enormous consequences for our economy and society   And power    whether yours or mine    must be tempered with responsibility and restraint   Let me be clear   When it comes to the advertising and marketing of food to children  it is still my hope that real restraint will come from within your industry      obviating the need for further federal regulation              Today  the United States is confronted with a problem    only it  s no longer just a problem  it is a public health crisis of the first order   We are in the midst of an epidemic of childhood obesity that is growing at a rapid pace   Some 15 percent of American children and teenagers are obese  a higher rate than in any other industrialized country   As a consequence  rates of obesity related diseases such as adult onset diabetes    which used to be unheard of in young people    are skyrocketing            Childhood obesity is a gateway to an entire lifetime of chronic illness and  eventually  premature death   Today  s young and more overweight generation could very well become the first generation in American history to have a shorter lifespan than the one that preceded it            This is a huge wakeup call    as if we needed yet another one   We  ve already had major warnings about childhood obesity from the Surgeon General  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  from the National Institutes of Health  from the Institute of Medicine  and on and on   The alarms are going off  one after another   Yet  we keep hitting the snooze button            A key question is   What is causing this epidemic   Many people attribute it largely to changing nutrition patterns    more calories  more junk food   Others say    No  the cause is a dramatic decline in physical activity     This is a pointless debate   I mean  do we really need a Harvard study to tell us the obvious   the childhood obesity epidemic is being caused by both  sedentary lifestyles and bad nutrition             For years  I have been speaking out about the fact that our kids have fewer and fewer opportunities for physical activity   We are building subdivisions without sidewalks  and even some elementary schools without playgrounds   Teenagers spend  on average  6      hours a day sitting in front of TVs  video games  computers and movies   Of course this is contributing to childhood obesity              Likewise  it is absurd to deny that bad nutrition is also a major factor   Since the late 1970s  per capita dietary intake in the U S  has increased by some 200 calories a day   Portion sizes have increased dramatically   High calorie low nutrition food is more readily available    including in our public schools            Why are children consuming more calories and more foods high in sugar  fat  and salt   Again  we don  t need a Harvard study to tell us the answer   Kids are eating more junk food for at least three reasons   One  because it tastes good   Two  because it is available everywhere    including  as I said  in schools   And three  because it is being aggressively advertised and marketed               Corporate America doesn  t spend  12 billion a year on advertising aimed at children because it likes to waste money   No   It spends  12 billion because that advertising works brilliantly        because it persuades children to demand    to the point of throwing temper tantrums  if necessary    a regular diet of candy  cookies  sugary cereal  sodas  and all manner of junk food               My friends  it  s not my job to assess blame or to send anyone on a guilt trip   But I do not flinch from assigning responsibility   Elected officials  government  the food and advertising industries  schools  parents    we all have a responsibility to wake up and confront the childhood obesity epidemic   Denial is no longer an option    not for any of us            Obesity is a complex problem  and there is no one  simple solution   That  s why I have introduced comprehensive legislation    the Healthier Lifestyles and Prevention Act   My aim is to give communities  employers  schools  and individuals the tools they need to prevent obesity and promote wellness           Right now  we don  t have a health care system in America  we have a sick care system   We wait until people get sick  obese  or disabled  and then we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to try to pick up the pieces   This is unwise   It is uneconomic   And  as we now know  it is totally unsustainable           The alternative    which I am promoting with my legislation    is to create a genuine health care system       a system that focuses on wellness and disease prevention       a system that keeps people out of the hospital in the first place           But    specifically with regard to childhood obesity    let me be clear that the issue before us is government responsibility and corporate responsibility   The First Amendment permits all kinds of irresponsible  inflammatory  and hurtful speech   We allow this as a necessary evil of living in a free society   But that doesn  t mean that such speech is right or responsible  And there are circumstances where government rightly regulates speech  including advertising  We regulate ads differently for kids then we do for adults   In fact  we are more lax in how we look at advertising targeted to kids  I do not think that is right          Nor is the issue  here  individual responsibility   I believe just as strongly in individual responsibility as anyone in this room    as long as we  re talking about adults   But it is entirely different when we are talking about children              Young kids are totally vulnerable and exploitable   Studies show that children do not understand that commercials are designed to sell products  because they don  t yet possess the cognitive ability to evaluate advertising   It  s not until age 7 or 8 that children even begin to distinguish between the show they are watching and the commercials that are trying to sell them something   So it is nonsensical to say that young kids have a personal responsibility to resist the lures of junk food advertising   They can  t    and they don  t     with disastrous consequences            OK  so what about parental responsibility   No question  many parents need to make better choices for their children   But there are practical limits on what we can expect   It is just not realistic to think that most parents are going to deny their children access to TV on Saturday morning and after school   And  for goodness sake  why do we have a situation where conscientious parents have to protect their children from the ads on Saturday morning TV              Do you know what parents tell me   They come up to me in airports or shopping malls   And they tell me that they are angry       they feel that their parental authority is being undermined by the sheer pervasiveness of junk food advertising and marketing to their kids              Not even schools are safe havens anymore   There is Channel One  with ads for candy bars and sugary sodas   There are giant Coke machines that double as billboards  right in the school hallway or cafeteria            A senior brand manager at Heinz was quoted in the Wall Street Journal   He said     All of our advertising is targeted to kids  You want that nag factor so that seven year old Sarah is nagging mom in the grocery store to buy funky purple  We  re not sure mom would reach out for it on her own               My friends  this is probably not news to you  but moms and dads across America know exactly what  s going on   For them  the harassment factor is bad enough   But now they are reading in Time and Newsweek that junk food is contributing to an obesity epidemic and endangering their children  s health             For parents I talk to  this is the last straw   A backlash is brewing   A Wall Street Journal poll in February found that 68 percent of American adults believe that advertising to kids is a major contributor to the rising tide of obesity in children   In the same poll  a clear majority said government should do more to regulate food ads directed at children            As I said  it is still my hope that real restraint will come from within your industry   CARU has done some good things   And CARU is an acknowledgement by the advertising industry that irresponsible food marketing to children is a very real problem   But CARU is not cutting it   It has no legal authority    and it has no teeth             So I have come here  this morning  to do some direct marketing of my own   I am appealing to you to heed the excellent recommendation of the Institute of Medicine   Sit down with the food and broadcasting industries  and hammer out tough  rigorous  age appropriate standards to govern the marketing of junk food to children   And create an enforcement body that has independence and teeth              Some will advise you to stonewall this request   They say that Corporate America  s job is to move product  maximize profits  and reward shareholders   They say that as long as no laws are being broken  then anything goes   In other words  it  s all about the almighty dollar              I don  t buy that   I don  t believe that you buy that    I am confident that you are moral  responsible people   You are parents and grandparents who care deeply about the wellbeing not just of your children  but of other people  s children    You wouldn  t want your child being encouraged to buy a 20 ounce soda in school    with 15 teaspoons of sugar   You wouldn  t want anyone  s child to be encouraged to buy that soda            The problem is that in the current  anything goes environment  you can  t afford to act responsibly   If your competitors are aggressively marketing junk food to young kids  then you have to  as well   It  s a race to the bottom   And I strongly suspect that many of you are looking for a way to stop that race            Well  there are two ways to accomplish this   There is restraint from within   Or there is restraint from without   The choice is largely up to you   But  I can tell you    based on my own conversations with parents and with other members of Congress    patience is running out              Late in her life  Jackie Kennedy said a very wise thing   She said that   If you botch raising your children  nothing else you do in life matters very much     I fear that  in so many respects  we are botching the raising of our children in the United States              We are exposing our kids to a barrage of messages and influences that are just plain toxic    not just unhealthy foods  but ultra violent video games and TV shows  sexual images in music videos  and much more   We are exploiting our children   We are pouring acid on their innocence   And  very often  this is being done to make money            It  s not just parental authority that is being trampled on   It  s also the values and standards of a decent society              And we    each and every one of us    have a responsibility to reverse this destructive course   Yes  it is time for individual responsibility   But it is also time for government responsibility and corporate responsibility   And I am convinced that the advertising industry    with all your resourcefulness and creativity    can be a powerful force for change       and for doing good            So  again  I am deeply grateful for your invitation to speak  this morning   Dialogue is a good thing   And I look forward to continuing this conversation in the days and months ahead   Thank you  my friends
