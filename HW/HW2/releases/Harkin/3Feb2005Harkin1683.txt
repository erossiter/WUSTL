        Social Security faces long term challenges  and we can work together to do what is needed to strengthen Social Security and develop new ways to help Americans save for their retirement             But I cannot support privatization proposals that cut benefits and increase the debt for our children and grandchildren              The President has called for us to act now   But acting now on a plan that drives up debt  cuts benefits  and leaves Social Security vulnerable to the uncertainties of the market is simply not responsible            Any plan to strengthen Social Security must be true to our values  it must be responsible  not passing debts to our children and grandchildren  it must help middle income Americans save and grow wealth  and above all  it must be fair   Privatization proposals that rely on deep benefit cuts and massive increases in debt do not meet this basic standard               30          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
