        The FDA ruminant to ruminant feed ban is the linchpin of the U S  strategy for preventing the spread of BSE to U S  cattle herds     Harkin said     Yet the GAO found substantial shortcomings in enforcing the ban  including failure to monitor feed plants adequately and to test animal feed for prohibited ruminant byproducts   Common sense tells us the best way to measure compliance is to sample feed to make sure it does not contain ruminant byproducts   Despite what FDA asserts  technology is available for testing feed to detect ruminant byproducts   FDA should use this technology               The loopholes that allow BSE risk materials into animal feed must be closed     Durbin said     The United States food supply is still the safest in the world  but we must take the steps necessary to keep it that way  This GAO report is one more link in a long chain of evidence that the threat of BSE is not being taken seriously enough             In 1997  FDA prohibited ruminant byproducts in ruminant feed and began requiring firms handling both prohibited ruminant byproducts and ruminant feed to keep these materials separate   Since enactment  questions have persisted concerning FDA  s enforcement of and industry compliance with the ban   The GAO report creates even more questions by shooting holes in FDA  s claim of 99  compliance with its regulations   The report found this claim by FDA misleading because it is based on inspecting only a fraction of feed plants and does not count actual violations of the feed rules if the plants involved are later found in compliance   The GAO also noted that because feed plants are not required to register with FDA  not all plants that make animal feed and are subject to FDA inspection have even been identified  or inspected            In addition to raising questions about the validity of FDA  s compliance reports  the GAO cited a number of other shortcomings in FDA  s enforcement of the ruminant to ruminant feed ban   Specifically  the report noted that FDA fails to set consistent standards for cleaning machinery and transport vehicles that handle both prohibited and allowed feed materials and fails to conduct timely inspections in all known plants            This report makes it crystal clear that much work remains to get compliance with the ruminant to ruminant feed ban to where it needs to be     the senators said     It is critically important that U S  anti BSE efforts are above and beyond questioning to assure consumers beef is safe  to protect animal health and to help reassure foreign markets and encourage them to reopen to U S  cattle and beef exports   We hope FDA and the Department of Agriculture take this report seriously and immediately act to rectify the problems outlined             Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee and Durbin is the Senate Democratic Whip   A copy of the report is available at www gao gov   www harkin gov or by request                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
