        President Bush  s economic policies may be working for the millionaires on Wall Street  but they have a very different effect for working Americans on Main Street     Harkin said     The number of Americans in poverty has increased by 4 3 million since President Bush took office and minimum wage employees currently earn  5 000 below the poverty line for a family of three  It is unacceptable that minimum wage in America is far from a living wage   We are long overdue for a fair increase             Since the last increase in the minimum wage in 1997  the value has eroded by more than 15 percent   Today  the real value of the minimum wage is more than  3 000 below what it was in 1968   To have the same purchasing power it had in 1968  the minimum wage would have to be nearly  8 50 today  not  5 15            The Senate Republicans will also offer a minimum wage amendment to the bankruptcy bill   This proposal would increase minimum wage by  1 10 an hour  benefiting only 1 8 million workers while undermining overtime and minimum wage rights   This amendment would allow employers to refuse to pay workers up to ten hours of earned overtime pay every two weeks   That means a cut of  3 000 a year for a median income earner and an  800 pay cut for minimum wage workers   Additionally  this amendment would deny Fair Labor Standards ACT  FLSA  coverage for workers at businesses worth  1 million or less  resulting in more than 10 million more workers losing minimum wage  overtime pay  and equal pay rights            This is a wolf in sheep  s clothing   Senate Republicans are disguising this anti worker  anti family legislation which would deny millions of Americans their right to overtime and minimum wage while touting a modest increase in minimum wage that would benefit very few     Harkin said     Last year the Bush Administration  aided by some Senate and House Republicans  pushed through a proposal to deny overtime protections for 6 million workers   I feared then that once they were able to get those new overtime rules pushed through more harmful policies would follow          In Iowa  87 400 workers would be positively affected by an increase to  7 25   that  s 6 4 percent of Iowa  s workforce   An increase in the minimum wage to  7 25 can make a dramatic difference  For a full time  year round worker  that would add  4 370 in income   This type of increase in earnings has real value to a family living in poverty   For a low income family of three  that would be enough money to pay for a year and a half of heat and electricity  almost two years of child care  or full tuition for a community college degree               In the past eight years  Republicans in Congress have raised their own pay seven times  by  28 500   In those same eight years minimum wage workers have not gotten a single raise   It is time for Congress to act  no one who works for a living should have to live in poverty             History clearly shows that raising the minimum wage has not had any negative impact on jobs  employment  or inflation   In the four years after the last minimum wage increase passed  the economy experienced its strongest growth in over three decades   More than 11 million new jobs were added  at a pace of 232 000 per month   There were ten million new service industry jobs  including more than one and a half million retail jobs                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
