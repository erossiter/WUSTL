     It is my pleasure to congratulate Governor Michael Johanns of Nebraska on his confirmation to be the next secretary of agriculture   I have spoken with Governor Johanns in some depth on several occasions and believe he has the qualities and potential to be a very good secretary   I might add  his Iowa pedigree is certainly a plus         As we look ahead to the next four years  there are many challenges and many opportunities ahead   We passed a good farm bill in 2002  President Bush praised it and signed it   For the most part it has been working   But too many of the key initiatives in that bill have suffered from misguided or delayed implementation   And while we stayed within our budget in writing the bill  agriculture and farm bill funding has been siphoned off since then   Those threats seem certain to intensify   The risks to food safety and security    from bovine spongiform encephalopathy or other animal and plant diseases    continue to make headlines   The new secretary will have to deal with some very serious issues    many of them very soon         At the same time  we have some great opportunities in agriculture and the rural economy  that is  if only we will seize them   I am encouraged that Governor Johanns understands the importance of capitalizing on these opportunities  specifically value added agriculture spanning the range from pork and beef to the great potential to produce energy and bio based products from farm fields across the country          For instance  we adopted a provision in the farm bill to require all Federal departments and agencies to give a preference to procuring bio based products whenever feasible    thus creating a huge potential market   While USDA has issued final rules to carry out this program  nothing will actually happen until a list of eligible products is published   I have urged Governor Johanns to move as quickly as possible to implement this program fully and without further delay to begin realizing the economic and environmental benefits of this bio based initiative                                                                                              We also included a very robust conservation title in the 2002 farm bill  one that was touted by the president when he signed the bill into law   Unfortunately  many of those initiatives  including the Conservation Security Program  have been undermined by funding cuts and too often poor execution   I have talked with Governor Johanns about these problems  and I am hopeful that we will work together to fulfill the promise of the farm bill and move forward on these important conservation initiatives so that farmers and ranchers have the tools they need to be the best stewards of the land they can be         We also have a history of bipartisan cooperation to meet our responsibilities to alleviate hunger and malnutrition through Federal and international food and nutrition assistance   We face compelling challenges in improving diets and nutrition in order to promote healthier and longer lives                                         Many other issues important to the prosperity and quality of life in rural America must be addressed    ranging from providing broadband access to boosting locally owned businesses and jobs to ensuring opportunities for family size farms and independent producers         I am optimistic that we can make real progress in addressing these and other challenges in food  agriculture and rural issues   I welcome Governor Johanns to Washington  congratulate him on his confirmation as the next secretary of agriculture and remind him that my door is always open                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
