         Washington  D C    At a press conference today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   top Democrat on the committee that funds health care initiatives  gave the following statement calling for an immediate vote on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  H R  810             We are rapidly approaching the one year anniversary of the vote in the House on HR 810  the bill to lift the President  s restrictions on stem cell research                  It has been 346 days since the House passed this bill with a strong bipartisan vote    346 days   It is supported by the majority of Senators on a bipartisan basis   It enjoys large majorities in every public opinion poll    which is hardly surprising  because stem cell research holds tremendous promise for curing illnesses and saving lives                    But one obstacle stands in the way   The Senate has squandered almost an entire year waiting for Majority Leader Bill Frist to make good on his pledge to bring HR 810 to the floor for a vote                    The Hippocratic Oath says    First  do no harm      But  while suffering people are desperate for this research  Dr  Frist has refused to act                  Next week has been designated as   health week    in the Senate   It is hard to believe that the Senate would consider a series of health bills next week without being allowed a vote to support stem cell research   But that appears to be exactly what Senator Frist has in mind                 I appreciate the fact that many Republican Senators have been very helpful and outspoken on this issue   Senators Specter  Hatch  and Smith  in particular  have urged the majority leader to bring up the bill   Senator Frist himself gave a speech last summer in which he endorsed HR 810   But  again and again  he has refused to schedule a vote                     Well  my patience    and the patience of other Democratic Senators    has run out   So  today  we are taking the extraordinary step of sending a letter to the Majority Leader  formally calling on him to bring HR 810 to the floor                   It  s no secret that the reason for the nearly one year delay in bringing up this bill is because of political divisions within the Republican Party   And that  s a shame  because stem cell research shouldn  t be a partisan issue                   Make no mistake  if the Democrats were in charge in the Senate  we wouldn  t be holding this press conference  this morning   We would have brought HR 810 to the floor  passed it  and sent it to the President long ago                 As I speak  people we love are dying from Parkinson  s and ALS   Children are suffering from juvenile diabetes   People are unable to walk due to spinal cord injuries   These people can  t wait another year for Senator First and his party to resolve their differences   They need help now                    That  s why we will continue to push for a vote on HR 810 next week   And I urge people all across America to send their own letters and e mails to Senator Frist demanding a vote on this absolutely critical bill                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
