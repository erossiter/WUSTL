        I am pleased that the world spoke with one voice in condemning the actions of North Korea  s oppressive regime  The global community cannot permit the rogue state to march closer toward obtaining a nuclear weapon  Such a result would destabilize the region and make WMD more available to terrorist states and organizations            The Bush Administration bears a heavy burden for allowing Kim Jong Il  s tyrannical nation to reach this point  The White House foolishly focused its attention on Iraq while allowing countries that pose a real imminent threat to operate with impunity thus making America less safe  Like other examples in the Bush Administration  s playbook  this failed strategy must also end            As Democrats have long stated and prominent Republicans have recently pointed out  it is time for the United States to engage in robust diplomacy  and engage directly with the North Koreans so that they know that their actions carry consequences            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
