     Tomorrow    July 26    marks 15 years since the signing of the Americans with Disabilities Act   Here in the Senate  Senator Bob Dole and I were the leaders in our respective caucuses in the long fight to pass this ADA   I don  t think either of us expected the progress    the transformation    that ADA has created over the last decade and a half             People often sing the praises of ADA as one of the great civil rights laws of the 20th century    an emancipation proclamation for people with disabilities   And it is those things   But I never lose sight of the seemingly mundane changes made possible by this law              I remember  during the long campaign to pass ADA  explaining to a young woman in a wheel chair how ADA would open new opportunities in education and employment   She said    Senator  I know that  s important   But I just want the freedom to go out and buy a pair of shoes  just like anybody else              How soon we forget that  prior to ADA  Americans with disabilities routinely faced prejudice  discrimination  and exclusion    not to mention an obstacle course of physical barriers to movement in their everyday lives             Today  the physical impacts of ADA  s quiet revolution are all around us   For example  several weeks ago I attended a downtown convention of several hundred disability rights advocates  many with severe impairments   They arrived in Washington on trains and airplanes built to accommodate people in wheelchairs   They came to the hotel on Metro and in regular busses  all seamlessly accessible by wheelchair   They navigated city streets equipped with curb cuts and ramps   The hotel where the convention took place was equipped in countless ways to accommodate people with disabilities              For those of us who are able bodied  these changes are all but invisible   For a person in a wheelchair  they are transforming and liberating   So are provisions in ADA outlawing discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the workplace            Just as important  ADA has changed attitudes   It used to be perfectly acceptable to treat people with disabilities as second class citizens  to exclude and marginalize them  I witnessed this discrimination firsthand with my older brother Frank  who was deaf       and who was the real inspiration behind my work on ADA   And I take enormous satisfaction in knowing that ADA now prevents the kind of discrimination that he faced            The prejudice and the negative stereotypes are largely gone   So is the false dichotomy between   disabled   and   able     We recognize that people with disabilities    like all people    have unique abilities  talents  and aptitudes   And America is better  fairer  and richer when we make full use of those gifts            This is amazing progress in just 15 years   For millions of Americans with disabilities  it truly is a revolution   This afternoon  I will be introducing a Sense of the Senate Resolution acknowledging all that has been accomplished             Now  I  d like to turn to my partner in passing the Americans with Disabilities Act   Bob Dole needs no introduction   But let me just say this about this remarkable person   Bob just epitomizes all the qualities that we admire in the Greatest Generation   As a very young man  he served and sacrificed in the Second World War   He went on to become one of the most accomplished and respected Senators of the 20th century   For more than six decades  Bob Dole has been a soldier  a statesman  and a patriot   And he is also a great friend                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
