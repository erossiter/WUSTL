      WASHINGTON D C      Continuing his effort to improve the country  s energy security  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   today introduced the Rural Energy For America Act  legislation that strengthens and expands the farm bill  s Section 9006 renewable energy and energy efficiency program          The bill will increase the overall funding under the section over time to  250 million  including funding for competitive grants to state or regional organizations for   off the shelf    renewable energy and energy efficiency projects  The bill also provides new grant options for wind energy development  fosters the administration of direct loans  and allows rural schools to participate in the program  The new legislation also renames section 9006 the Rural Energy For America Program  REAP             This legislation will dramatically increase financial support for farmers and rural businesses to purchase renewable energy systems and make energy efficiency improvements     Harkin said    We have only begun to tap into the potential for American ingenuity in home grown clean energy production and use             During its first three years  the 9006 program has distributed nearly  64 million and catalyzed the development of 412 renewable energy and energy efficiency projects in 37 states  The awards have leveraged nearly  700 million in additional investments in farms and rural communities  As Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee in 2002  Harkin authored the first ever farm bill energy title establishing these renewable energy grants and loans through USDA          This legislation also promotes wind energy expansion by giving farmers and other developers an additional financing option  Currently  many grant recipients use the grants to pay for capital development and construction costs  Under federal tax rules  such construction grants have the potential to offset important wind production tax credits  PTC    In other words  these   anti double dipping    provisions often reduce the size of the PTC if a project receives some other types of government support such as a 9006 grant          To make clear USDA  s authority to craft additional grant options  the legislation authorizes USDA in appropriate circumstances to structure grants as production incentives instead of construction grants  thereby reducing the risk of undercutting the tax credit benefit          This legislation also includes a new rebate program for relatively simple and straight forward   off the shelf    renewable energy or energy efficiency projects   The rebate program allows small and medium sized farmers and rural businesses to obtain rapid and long lasting relief from high energy prices by installing energy efficiency equipment or renewable energy systems  This rebate program would mimic state run programs that have been very effective at promoting small scale development projects  Grants will be made available with support limited to no more than 20  of the total available funding          Co sponsoring the bill are Senators Richard Lugar  R IN   Richard Durbin  D IL   Chuck Hagel  R NE  and Ben Nelson  D NE                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
