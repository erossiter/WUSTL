   Washington D C      Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a leading advocate of stem cell research and co sponsor of HR 810  today released the following statement regarding reports of a new procedure to derive stem cell lines without destroying the embryo            I welcome the report that biologists have succeeded in deriving a stem cell line from an embryo without destroying it   This is a very positive development  and it deserves more investigation             I am disappointed  however  by the President  s knee jerk  hypocritical opposition to this new stem cell method  President Bush has said he doesn  t want to expand embryonic stem cell research because current methods of deriving stem cell lines require the destruction of the embryo              Now  scientists have apparently figured out how to derive such lines without destroying the embryo   His concern has been addressed   So why does he oppose this new method   I can think of no other reason than that  in his heart  he doesn  t want this potentially life saving research to proceed            Last month  he crushed the hopes of millions of Americans by vetoing HR 810  which would have greatly expanded federal support for stem cell research   Now  he  s objecting to a new method of deriving stem cell lines that satisfies all the concerns he raised in his previous statements            I should add that this new scientific development  while encouraging  does not in any way eliminate the need to pass HR 810 into law   There are currently about 400 stem cell lines in the world today   Our top scientists currently can use federal funding to study just 21 of them  and all 21 are at least 5 years old and contaminated with mouse feeder cells  Passing HR 810 would immediately give our scientists access to hundreds of additional  higher quality lines  and hasten our search for cures to diseases like Parkinson  s  ALS  and juvenile diabetes                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
