         Washington  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  released a study on the Fruit and Vegetable Program  a Harkin initiative that provides free fresh fruits and vegetables to kids and teens in participating schools in 14 states and on three Indian reservations   CDC studied five Mississippi schools and found that students are eating more fruit and that they also have positive views about eating more fresh produce   The Fruit and Vegetable Program was created by Harkin as a pilot program in the 2002 farm bill and was made permanent in 2004 Nutrition Reauthorization bill            This study provides initial confirmation of the anecdotal reports I  ve been hearing for years  that students are enthusiastic about the program and want to make healthy choices     said Harkin     The conventional wisdom    that kids are only interested in junk food    is just wrong             Among the specific findings of the new study of the Fruit and Vegetable Program are the following             Participation in the Fruit and Vegetable Program increased the variety of produce sampled           Participation in the Fruit and Vegetable Program promoted positive attitudes about fruit consumption  and          Participation in the Fruit and Vegetable Program increased fruit consumption for the majority of students sampled           Overall  the initial findings of the study led the study authors to conclude that   the results of this evaluation suggest that the distribution of fresh fruit at school free of charge to secondary school children might be an effective component of a comprehensive approach for improving student dietary behaviors               Of course  this is just one study and further review of the Fruit and Vegetable Program in different geographical areas and with different student populations is important for Congress to stay informed and knowledgeable about the impact of the program   That  s why I look forward to additional  more in depth examinations of this program that can paint a fuller picture of the program  s results     said Harkin     But this first blush evaluation of the program is a positive step that supports recent Congressional action to expand the program around the country             Harkin has been the Senate leader in federal efforts to promote wellness initiatives that can help Americans live longer  healthier lives and lower spiraling healthcare costs  In the 2002 farm bill  Harkin created the Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools across the country  including 25 schools in Iowa  Harkin sponsored the 2005 Healthy Lifestyles and Prevention  HeLP  America Act  comprehensive legislation that seeks to combat obesity and other preventable chronic conditions by providing all sectors   child care centers  schools  workplaces  and communities    with the tools and incentives that they need  to help American  s become healthier  In 2005  28 public and private organizations Iowa received nearly  3 million in Harkin wellness grants to develop community approaches to promote prevention and wellness                                       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
