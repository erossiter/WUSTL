         Whether they own a business on Main Street or operate a farm  too many Iowans are feeling the pinch caused by high energy prices     Harkin said     This legislation would help provide some relief to businesses and farmers that are at the mercy of the high prices of oil  propane and natural gas             The bill would authorize low interest Small Business Administration Disaster loans for businesses harmed by high energy prices   The bill would also amend the emergency loan program at USDA to allow agricultural producers access to low interest loans as well          The rise in energy costs over the past several years has threatened the viability and survival of many small businesses and farms   As an example  compared to last year  the cost of home heating oil has jumped as much as 45 percent   Natural gas and propane prices have also escalated dramatically over the past few years   Most small businesses and farming operations do not have the cash flow or operating margin to absorb these costs without real hardship   For these businesses  access to capital is needed to avoid serious financial damage or even being forced out of business            Until we have a national energy policy that focuses on domestic  renewable sources of energy  small businesses and farmers will continue to suffer from high prices brought on by often unfriendly regimes in the Middle East     Harkin said     Until such time  it is important that we help businesses survive the volatile energy market and continue to create jobs and grow our economy             Other senators cosponsoring include   Mr  Reed  Mr  Dodd  Mr  Bingaman  Mr  Kohl  Mr  Jeffords  Ms  Cantwell  Mr  Johnson  Mr  Pryor  Mr  Leahy  Mr  Levin  Mr  Schumer  Mr  Lieberman  Ms  Clinton  Mr  Kennedy  Mr  Bayh and Mr  Obama                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
