      WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today issued the following comment on an announcement made by President Bush to cut gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions                     With gas prices once again reaching record highs  I welcome the President s call for action to reduce our dependence on oil   I support his direction to EPA and the Departments of Transportation  Energy and Agriculture to take the first steps toward reducing gasoline consumption and greenhouse gas emissions   I believe the Senate soon will consider energy legislation with the same purpose  and I intend to include a strong energy title in our farm bill that will bring significant amounts of clean domestic energy to consumers   Regarding climate change  I m glad that the President is heeding the Supreme Court s ruling that EPA does have the authority for limiting greenhouse gas emissions   This is a welcome reversal by the White House to let EPA move on greenhouse gases and climate change                                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
