      President Bush  s privatization commission has proposed creating private Social Security accounts that would cut benefits by one third or more  even for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts   Workers could invest two thirds of their Social Security contribution in stocks and bonds  but those returns could not make up for the deep benefit cuts and would be subject to the whims of Wall Street            Even many supporters of the president  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved          WHO       Senator Tom Harkin         WHAT     Fix It  Don  t Nix It Social Security Forum          WHEN     1 00 PM                       Saturday  April 23         WHERE   Grant Wood Area Education Agency          4401 6th Street SW          Cedar Rapids                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
