           On this solemn anniversary of the September 11 attacks  our thoughts and prayers remain with those who lost so much on this tragic day   Five years later  we still grieve for the all the good people who were lost in New York  in Washington  and in Pennsylvania   At the same time  we honor the heroes of that day    the first responders and ordinary citizens who showed such extraordinary courage    We also honor the sacrifices of those who protect us everyday   And we are proud that our nation has rebounded so strongly from that heartbreaking event              While today is one of national mourning and somber reflection  we must also recognize that we still have much more to do to protect our nation   It is my hope that we can take serious steps to secure our country by fully committing to implementing all of the 9 11 Commission  s recommendations and to providing real resources for our homeland security                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
