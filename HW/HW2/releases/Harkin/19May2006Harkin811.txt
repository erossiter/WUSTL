        Thank you  Mr  Chairman   You  ve led the way on NIH funding  and it  s been a real honor working with you on this issue               Good morning  Dr  Zerhouni  and welcome   We  re glad to have you back with us today                   We need a strong NIH now more than ever  for so many reasons   First  our security as a Nation depends on it   We often think about security only in military terms   But in today  s world  we need to be just as worried about the threats we face from a bioterrorism attack or pandemic flu   NIH research is critically important for protecting us in both of those areas               We also need NIH to help us through our health care crisis   Consider just one disease    Alzheimer  s   It  s been estimated that delaying the onset of Alzheimer  s by just 5 years could save  50 billion a year in medical costs   That would go a long way to solving our Medicare problems all by itself               And we need NIH now  because we  re on the cusp of so many exciting breakthroughs   Researchers are learning how to match drugs to individual patients  based on their genetic code   They  re learning more about stem cell research   They  re making discoveries about the interplay between our genes and the environment             What a shame  then  to get a budget like the one the President has sent us                  His budget would level fund NIH  one year after the first cut to this agency since 1970   Eighteen of the 19 institutes would get less funding than they did last year   The number of research project grants would drop by about 640   And the success rate for grant applications would remain at a record low of just 19 percent             We  re at a point now where only 1 out of every 5 grant applications is accepted for funding   I  m sure there are a lot of young researchers out there who are wondering    Why bother applying to NIH   Why bother going into research at all               Senator Specter and I didn  t work so hard to double NIH funding just so we could watch the President cut it to the bone from then on out   But that seems to be the President  s plan   As bad as this year  s budget is  next year  s will probably be even worse   According to OMB projections  the Administration will cut NIH by  800 million in FY08  and make more cuts in FY09 and FY10             We  re going to hear firsthand what the President  s budget will mean for many diseases from our second group of speakers   I want to thank the representatives of the 20 advocacy groups that are with us today for taking the time to be here                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
