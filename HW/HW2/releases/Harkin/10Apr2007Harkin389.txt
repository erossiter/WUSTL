            WASHINGTON  D C    Today  U S  Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Claire McCaskill  D MO  sent a letter to President Bush urging that he reverse his recent executive order to slow action by federal government agencies to cut consumption of petroleum   Despite a failure to fulfill a seven year old executive order requiring the federal fleet to use more alternative fuels like ethanol and speeches about plans to make America more energy independent  President George Bush recently issued a new directive                             On January 23  2007  President Bush stated his support for reducing the country s dependence on oil in the State of the Union Address for a second consecutive year   But the following day  President Bush took action to scale back an existing executive order to cut petroleum use by the federal government  the world s single largest consumer of the fuel   In the January 2000 executive order  Bush asked the federal government to cut petroleum use over the next eight years by just two percent annually based on 2005 consumption levels  with the total reduction equally only 16 percent                           This new executive order is much weaker than the executive order issued in 2000  which directed federal agencies to reduce their use of petroleum by 20 percent in just five years   The Bush administration only reduced petroleum use by two percent                           We applaud the president s many references to reducing our country s dangerous addiction to imported oil  but the time has come to put these words into action   said Harkin  Chairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee    An executive order issued in 2000 called for a 20 percent reduction in imported oil across 21 federal agencies by 2005   Yet seven years later  this goal has not been met   The least we can do is get the federal government to reduce its dependence on imported oil   We urge the President and his administration to be more aggressive in this regard                           Actions speak louder than words   McCaskill said   It s one thing to say that energy independence is a priority in this country and something else entirely to make it a priority   We had the right blueprint to set an important example   We fell short   It s important now more than ever to make this right   I urge the President to show us that he s serious about energy independence and renewable fuels                         In their letter  McCaskill and Harkin urged the president to reevaluate his recent executive order and consider implementing a more aggressive plan to cut energy consumption by the federal government                          Further  McCaskill and Harkin urged the president to improve enforcement of current and future petroleum consumption requirements   Poor enforcement of the 2000 executive order requirements by the White House led to few federal entities fulfilling the requirement   By 2005  federal agencies had only cut their petroleum consumption by two percent  despite the 20 percent requirement                           Specifically  McCaskill and Harkin urged the president to set higher goals for reducing energy consumption by the federal government  provide specific guidance to federal agencies on how to achieve the such goals  and to implement performance requirement to enforce accountability of petroleum reduction requirements                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
