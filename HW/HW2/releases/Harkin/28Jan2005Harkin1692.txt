        We are rapidly approaching the planting season for soybeans across much of the country     Harkin said     I am asking USDA to provide a detailed accounting of their efforts to fight soybean rust so we can identify and address any holes or shortcomings before the disease has a chance to gain a foothold   I believe that USDA must utilize all tools at its disposal  including partnerships with commodity groups and other private organizations  to minimize damage from the spread of this disease             Because nine states have already identified the disease  it is very likely the disease will spread to major soybean producing areas this growing season  potentially including fields in Iowa   This very short timeline requires that USDA have a plan up a running by that time   That is why Harkin is asking Secretary Johanns to provide a plan as well as allocate sufficient resources to combat this disease            I respectfully request a report detailing what programs USDA has or will have in place to deal with soybean rust by the time the soybean crop is planted this spring  the level of funds being dedicated to soybean rust education  monitoring and other preparations  and the availability of adequate funds to USDA for a full  effective response in case of a soybean rust emergency     Harkin wrote           Asian soybean rust is a potentially devastating disease  capable of causing yield losses of up to 80 percent in the absence of timely identification and proper treatment   Among Senator Harkin  s activities include urging USDA to address this issue  successfully working to fund research into rust resistant soybean hybrids  and urging EPA to make fungicides available          A copy of the letter to Secretary Johanns is attached                                  January 26  2005         The Honorable Mike Johanns      Secretary of Agriculture      United States Department of Agriculture      14th Street and Independence Avenue  SW      Washington  DC 20250         Dear Secretary Johanns                      American soybean producers are scrambling to prepare for a potentially devastating attack of soybean rust in the coming growing season  in the wake of the discovery of the fungus in the United States last year   This disease can cause yield losses of up to 80 percent in the absence of timely identification and proper treatment   Because nine states in the southern part of the United States have reported infestations of rust on soybean and kudzu  migration of the disease to the major soybean producing areas of the country is likely to occur this growing season   Once disease symptoms are found in a soybean field  it is often too late to contain losses   In order to prevent severe crop losses  growers need information  advice and a nationwide surveillance system   I would like to request information about the current status of USDA  s education and surveillance efforts  as well as the availability of funds to USDA to combat soybean rust and prevent major crop and financial losses                         Two critical steps in fighting this disease involve education and surveillance   Across the country  both private and public organizations are training growers regarding how to identify early symptoms of the disease  how to send samples for laboratory confirmation and how to apply fungicides   County extension agents  county Farm Service Agency employees  commodity groups and crop consultants are all resources USDA can enlist to communicate information about soybean rust to producers   These groups can also help establish a surveillance network to make real time information on the disease  s path available to farmers to allow them to estimate their proximity to the disease   It is clearly the most effective course that USDA work with the private sector in developing and implementing education and surveillance efforts for soybean rust   I would like to know the current status of USDA  s participation in and support of these efforts                        In the past  USDA has provided emergency funds to control crop diseases and to assist farmers sustaining losses from crop diseases   For example  in 1996 and 1997  Commodity Credit Corporation  CCC  funds were used to compensate farmers whose wheat crops were destroyed because of karnal bunt infections   USDA is also authorized to use CCC funds for actions to help prevent serious financial losses due to crop diseases such as soybean rust   Because the availability of adequate funds is a crucial component of contingency plans USDA may have for soybean rust  I would like to work with USDA to ensure these funds are available for education and surveillance purposes                      I respectfully request a report detailing what programs USDA has or will have in place to deal with soybean rust by the time the soybean crop is planted this spring  the level of funds being dedicated to soybean rust education  monitoring and other preparations  and the availability of adequate funds to USDA for a full  effective response in case of a soybean rust emergency                        I appreciate your attention to this important issue              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
