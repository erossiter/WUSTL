        It  s no accident this final bill was passed out of the House in the dead of night   Quite simply  this budget attacks America  s working families  children  the elderly  and the least fortunate so the Republicans can pass yet more tax giveaways for the wealthy   Congressional Republicans have touted these cuts as necessary to address this country  s runaway deficit  but with their new round of tax cuts on the way  their plan will make the deficit even worse   Republicans cut Medicare  Medicaid  child support and initiatives helping family farmers and give those savings  and then some  to the nation  s wealthiest   It  s still possible for the House to reject this legislation because some of it violated Senate rules and I urge them to do so            This budget is only the latest slap at farm families and rural communities thanks to the Bush administration and this Republican Congress   The president  s trade negotiators just returned from Hong Kong  where they were offering large reductions in U S  farm commodity programs   Secretary Johanns and the Bush administration have said we should expand trade  cut those commodity programs and put more emphasis on conservation  renewable energy  rural economic development and agricultural research   Yet it is exactly these forward looking initiatives  which we funded in the 2002 farm bill  that suffer the biggest  most disproportionate cuts in the Republican budget   This is a classic bait and switch    with rural America the loser                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
