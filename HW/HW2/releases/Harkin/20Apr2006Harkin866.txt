            I commend the U S  Postal Service  USPS  for holding a town hall meeting today with the Siouxland Community    this meeting is long overdue   It is critical that USPS hears from residents and provides real answers about how its proposed consolidation plan will truly impact their community                    Postal officials should not just look at this meeting as checking a box in the process  but as an opportunity to finally come clean with area residents  businesses and government officials   I encourage USPS to release the full Area Mail Processing  AMP  Study  not just a hollow summary   USPS needs to be up front with all its stakeholders in the community   Major issues such as the costs the USPS plan will impose on local businesses and possible delays in mail service need to be apparent to all involved before moving the mail processing facility  The community has a stake in this decision and they should be included in the process   They deserve no less                   At Harkin  s request  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  is conducting a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Months later after GAO  s original report  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing the recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
