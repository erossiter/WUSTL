 WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  today announced that new funding has been approved for Iowa projects that combat crime and drug abuse in the FY 2008 Commerce  Justice  and Science Appropriations Bill  The Senate and the House of Representatives must pass this bill before it becomes law   These funds are absolutely critical to Iowas ability to combat meth and prevent crime  Harkin said  Meth continues to plague Iowa  and while Iowa law enforcement has taken some successful steps to reduce this drugs supply and demand  it is still too readily available  I am pleased that Congress plans to prevent the Presidents ill conceived efforts to eliminate local law enforcement assistance programs and instead continues to fund many of these vital programs   Details of the funding follow   Law Enforcement  Highway Drug Intercept Squads   300 000  With the decline in meth labs  this money will allow Division of Narcotics Enforcement agents and the Iowa State Patrol to devote more resources to finding and seizing meth entering Iowa in cars  trucks  buses and trains   Regional Meth Enforcement Teams   350 000  This funding will pay for drug task force agents in smaller counties throughout Iowa and will allow smaller counties to continue sharing resources and coordinating investigations of meth and other drug related crimes  Harkin established these multi county drug task forces in 2002   Iowa Cold Case Squad and DNA Backlog   200 000  This funding will allow the Iowa State Crime Lab to develop a cold case squad to begin analyzing DNA evidence in unsolved crimes and increase the capacity of the statewide DNA felon database  States that have implemented felon databases have experienced hit rates as high as 8 percent  and nationally over 6 000 cold cases have been solved through a combination of felon databases and solid cold case investigations   Midwest Forensics Resource Center   200 000  The Midwest Forensics Resource Center  MFRC  at Iowa State University works to improve the availability  quantity  and quality of forensics training in rural areas  crime laboratory performance  the practice of forensics sciences through research and development projects and university education in the forensics sciences   Innovative Meth Treatment and Intervention Programs  Law enforcement officers across Iowa have told me that prevention and treatment are the keys to stopping the meth epidemic  Harkin said  We continue to invest in treatment programs so that meth users can recover and lead productive lives   In Jail Treatment for Polk  Story  Scott and Woodbury Counties   600 000  Long term treatment is key to breaking meth addiction and stopping the huge drain low level drug users take on criminal justice resources  This funding will allow this program  which provides treatment in jail and after  to continue operating in three Iowa counties and expand into a fourth county   Heartland Family Service Residential Treatment Center   150 000  This new funding will help start a much needed meth treatment program in Council Bluffs that will allow women to obtain treatment while keeping their young children with them  Heartland Family Services would be only the provider in western Iowa providing family based treatment  which is key to breaking addiction amongst women and to keeping families intact   Judge Cohens Court Team for Maltreated Infants and Toddlers   200 000  This money will continue an innovative program that provides science based  coordinated intervention in cases involving neglected and abused infants and toddlers  A recent study also found that methamphetamine usage or exposure was a factor in over 50 percent of child neglect cases in Iowa   National Programs  In recent years  President Bush has repeatedly tried to severely cut or eliminate funding for many of our nations most effective law enforcement initiatives  Harkin said  Countless Iowa law enforcement officials have told me that these initiatives  like Byrne grants and the COPS program  are instrumental to their crime fighting efforts  I am pleased that that Senate has rejected President Bushs draconian budget proposals and given law enforcement the resources they need to keep Iowa families safe   Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants   616 million  Byrne Grants help state and local governments support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime  including drug task forces  prosecution and court programs  prevention and education programs  corrections and community corrections programs  drug treatment programs and planning  evaluation  and technology improvement programs  Harkin has been a long time supporter of the Byrne program  which is critical to ensuring Iowa law enforcement have the resources they need from the federal government   Community Oriented Policing Services Program   550 000  The COPS program provides law enforcement agencies with an array of community policing training and technical assistance resources  Many police chiefs  sheriffs and criminal justice experts have credited community policing  a strategy that uses partnerships between law enforcement officers and the people they serve  with the reduction in violent crime over the past several years       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter
