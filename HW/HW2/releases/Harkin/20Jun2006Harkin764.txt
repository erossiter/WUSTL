           Mr  Chairman  I very much appreciate your holding this hearing to examine the rural development programs of the Department of Agriculture  and to understand better what is working as well as where there may be room for improvement   This hearing will also be valuable as we move toward writing the rural development title in the next farm bill                 Rural America contributes tremendously to the greatness of our nation  and it offers many advantages to those of us who live there   Yet in an increasingly competitive global economy  rural communities face huge challenges   Incomes continue to trail those in urban America and poverty is higher   Rural communities find it harder to grow existing businesses or attract new ones  and as a result  jobs and wages lag   Too often a potential employer will simply strike a rural community off the list for lack of a vital service or resource   And while some costs may be lower  others may be higher because of fewer paying customers in a square mile                 I am very concerned that USDA assistance falls far short of the needs of rural communities for basic  essential services such as electricity  telephones  and water and waste water treatment   Broadband internet access is no longer merely a desirable option in today  s world   It is absolutely vital for businesses to operate productively and competitively  as well as for the education of our children and a host of other activities in rural communities   USDA ought to do more to support day care centers to foster rural employment and proper child care  and it needs to do more to promote rural assisted living facilities               The fact of the matter is  hundreds of millions of dollars that we dedicated to rural economic development in the farm bill have been taken away as a result of President Bush  s budgets and Congressional action   If we expect USDA  s rural development programs to work  we have to provide a reasonable level of resources               A key initiative I  ve pushed for years is for USDA to do a better job of helping to get investment dollars to rural areas   USDA has a number of programs aimed at helping provide capital to businesses   Regarding venture capital however  I have to be honest to say that there was a real failure to carry out the farm bill  s Rural Business Investment Program   We also put in the farm bill a new mechanism that has generated a large amount of capital for investment in the Rural Economic Development Loan and Grant Program  but again much of that money sits idle   Funding for grants to producer owned value added enterprises has also been cut well below the mandatory funds we dedicated in the farm bill            Now  despite the concerns I have expressed  I see a lot of opportunities and a better future in rural America   There is no better place to live and raise a family   We have tremendous potential for economic growth and new jobs in producing far more renewable energy and biobased products   This brighter future will not happen on its own   We must pursue sound initiatives and make the wise investments that will pay off in the years to come                Thank you  Mr  Chairman              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
