                 Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced legislation to correct deficiencies in USDA s enforcement over agricultural markets and provide needed protections for producers involved in production contracts for agricultural commodities   The Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act will be the basis for the development of a proposed competition title in the upcoming farm bill   Harkin is Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry                        Producers need to have a fighting chance in an industry that is becoming far too consolidated and vertically integrated   Harkin said   I will propose and seek to include this legislation as part of a competition title in the farm bill                          Last year  USDA s Inspector General released a report commissioned by Harkin that detailed widespread inaction  the blocking of anti competitive investigations  and efforts to cover up the lack of action by the Grain Inspection  Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA    A hearing Harkin called to evaluate GIPSA s enforcement dysfunctions also uncovered the lack of commitment towards preventing anti competitive practices by USDA s Office of General Counsel                             If you take these facts together  it represents a complete lack of enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act passed by Congress in 1921  to protect producers from unfair  deceptive and anti competitive practices in the marketplace   Harkin said   If we want to get serious about getting young people into agriculture  creating a fair and evenhanded marketplace is an obvious place to start                        The Competitive and Fair Agricultural Markets Act would                        Reorganize USDA to streamline and improve enforcement of the Packers and Stockyards Act and Agricultural Fair Practices Act by establishing an Office of Special Counsel whose sole responsibility will be to investigate and prosecute violations on competition matters   The Special Counsel would be appointed by the President and confirmed by the Senate  This position will also serve as a liaison between the Department of Justice and Federal Trade Commission                       The legislation also makes the following amendments to the Packers and Stockyards Act                        Strengthens producer protections by making it easier for them to prove unfair actions by firms without additional burdens of having to prove adverse effects on competition  For example  recent court decisions such as London vs  Fieldale Farms have ruled that in order for producers to succeed in cases involving unfair actions they must prove how it adversely affects competition for their region  These rulings will now complicate USDA s ability to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act                          Gives USDA authority to enforce the Packers and Stockyards Act in sales of poultry  Currently  it is illegal for poultry integrators to engage in unfair or anti competitive practices  but current law denies USDA enforcement authority to prosecute violations                            The bill also makes the following changes to the Agricultural Fair Practices Act                        Prohibits unfair  unjustly discriminatory  anti competitive or deceptive practices by a person that affects the marketing  receiving  purchasing  sale or contracting of crops                        Provides needed contract protections to ensure that the production contract clearly spells out what is required of the producer   Harkin s bill would require giving the producer at least 3 days to review or cancel the production contract after signing it  Harkin s bill would prohibit confidentiality clauses so that producers are able to share the contract with family members or a lawyer to help them decide whether or not they should sign it  The legislation would also protect producers from having their production contracts arbitrarily terminated if they have made a sizable capital investment  The bill also prevents mandatory arbitration so that producers are not prevented from going to the courts                              Prevents discrimination against producers belonging to an organization or cooperative by removing a disclaimer clause from the Agricultural Fair Practices Act   This disclaimer clause currently allows processors  handlers  or contractors the ability to refuse to do business with producers just because they belong to such organizations                                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
