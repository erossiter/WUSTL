         WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter to attendees of the renewable fuels summit  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called on the Bush Administration and Congress to reverse damaging budget cuts and make critically needed federal investments in research and development of ethanol  biodiesel and renewable energy   Harkin welcomed President Bush  s comments in recent months  praising renewable fuels as a way to reduce America  s dangerous and costly addiction to foreign oil    The President  s words however amount to little more than cheering from the sidelines until his administration moves aggressively to restore budget cuts and fully fund federal research and development of renewable fuels and renewable energy            As much as I appreciate President Bush  s supportive words about renewable fuels  the time for talking is long past   The need for action to back the President  s rhetoric couldn  t be more critical     said Harkin     The President can  t just hop on the renewable fuels bandwagon and take a free ride   He  s got to reverse budget cuts and fight for full funding of federal initiatives for renewable fuels and biobased products research and development                The Bush Administration  s record on renewable fuels              Biomass Research and Development  The President  s budget fails to live up to what he signed into law through the energy bill to boost development of biofuels made from traditional sources like corn and soybeans as well as from corn stalks  wood chips  switchgrass and other sources  cellulosic ethanol    The energy bill adopted a Harkin proposal increasing funds for research  development and deployment of biofuels by  200 million annually   The Bush budget provides a modest  59 million increase in funding for the Department of Energy but not to the level authorized in the energy bill   Bush  s budget actually calls for a 14  cut to mandatory spending on joint Departments of Agriculture and Energy biomass research and development established in the farm bill                Farm Bill Renewable Fuels  Mandatory farm bill funds have been dramatically reduced or zeroed out by the Bush Administration and through Congressional budget cuts   The President  s track record on farm bill renewable energy is as follows              Bioenergy Grants   Bioenergy grants provide assistance for production of ethanol and biodiesel   The farm bill called for  150 million in annual mandatory spending for such grants in FY03 06   Over just the last two fiscal years  the President has signed into law cuts of 47  for these grants                Value Added Grants   The FY 07 Bush budget calls for roughly cutting in half value added grants  which provide financial assistance for ethanol and biodiesel plants and wind energy   The grants also assist farmers in developing new marketing techniques   Value added grants have been cut by 58  over the last three fiscal years by the White House and Congress               Renewable Energy Systems Grants and Loans   The FY 07 Bush budget calls for a 57  reduction in mandatory funds for renewable energy grants   These grants and loan guarantees go to agricultural producers and rural small business for assistance with purchasing renewable energy systems and making energy efficiency improvements   They include financial assistance to cut back on energy consumption and investment in biofuels production  wind turbines  solar panels and methane digesters            My biggest fear is that the President  s support for renewable fuels is merely designed to help the administration through the summer driving season and this spell of high fuel prices     Harkin said     I want to work with the President to turn the vision for renewable fuels we laid out in the 2002 farm bill and last year  s energy bill into a reality for our nation                          Below is Senator Harkin  s letter to attendees of the renewable fuels summit          Dear Friends          I  d like to extend a warm welcome to the hundreds of attendees of the Biofuels Summit 2006  including many from my state of Iowa   This is an important event and certainly couldn  t be more timely   I thank the farmers  biofuels producers and others here today for leading the way toward a clean energy future using home grown renewable fuels              You have gathered  today  in a changed world   Just a few years ago  many Americans saw ethanol as a boutique product    an obsession for farmers and entrepreneurs in Iowa  Nebraska  and the Corn Belt  but not all that relevant to the rest of America          Well  you know the world has changed   The price of oil is at record highs and escalating energy prices are rippling throughout our economy   There is pain at the pump  with the average price of gasoline hovering around  3 a gallon   Everyone knows renewable fuels are a solution to this crisis              Ethanol and biodiesel are now the fuel equivalent of apple pie  all American  produced here at home  clean       and increasingly popular    My friends  our time has come   We are entering a new era of energy independence using our abundant corn  soybeans  and soon corn stover  wheat straw and even switchgrass  to produce home grown renewable and environmentally friendly fuels            Truth is  we desperately need biofuels   We are  as the President said  addicted to oil  and biofuels are our best bet for weaning America from this dangerous addiction            We  ve been making great progress lately   The Renewable Fuels Standard  which I championed  is a giant step forward   Tax credits for E 85 pump installation are also going to help            However  we can  t rest on our laurels to achieve this very ambitious goal of replacing oil with ethanol and biodiesel in a large share of fuel consumed in America   It  s going to take hard work  good policy making and technological innovation          We need to fully fund the biomass research and development provisions that Senator Lugar and I put into the recently passed energy bill   Research will help us get more ethanol and other biobased products out of a kernel of corn than we get today  and it will increase the number and variety of crops and feedstocks we can use to produce ethanol  biodiesel and many other products   We must make critical investments    significantly beyond what the President proposes in his budget    if we are to achieve what he talked about in the State of the Union speech          We need to make sure the fueling infrastructure for high level blends of ethanol expands very quickly   Thousands of additional E85 pumps must be deployed at gas stations across the country   I sent a letter to the major oil companies back in January urging them to work with us to make this happen              We also need to engage auto companies to produce flex fuel vehicles throughout their entire lineup of cars  trucks and SUVs          To guarantee robust FFV production  I authored legislation last fall  S  1994  the Fuel Security and Consumer Choice Act  to require nearly 100 percent of all new vehicles sold in America be flex fuel capable within a decade   This is eminently achievable           We know that biofuels are a solution to the great environmental challenge of our time  global warming   The more ethanol and biodiesel we produce  the less fossil fuels we use thereby lowering greenhouse gas emissions   We also need better fuel economy   Making a vehicle run further on a gallon of gasoline  ethanol or another fuel must be an essential component of a sustainable national energy policy           We will write another farm bill in the near future   In the 2002 bill  I included the first ever clean energy title that promotes ethanol  biodiesel and wind power  among other clean energy resources             I am disappointed that the President has year in and year out proposed to slash funding we devoted in the farm bill for these forward thinking initiatives  and Congress has gone along and cut funding    The energy price crisis drives home the critical need for the President and Congress all to get on the right track and make the necessary federal investment in biofuels and biobased products research and development                       Friends I am determined to build on our success  and hope you will join me in that effort                      Thank you          Sincerely          Tom Harkin      United States Senator           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
