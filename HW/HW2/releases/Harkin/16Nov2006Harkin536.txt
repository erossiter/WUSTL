      WASHINGTON  D C       The Senate adopted by a voice vote today an amendment introduced by Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  to the U S  India Peaceful Atomic Energy Cooperation Act that requires the President to determine that India is fully and actively participating in U S  and international efforts to dissuade  sanction and contain Iran  s nuclear program consistent with United Nations Security Council Resolutions            This is a time when we need to have the support of every country as the United States works with our allies to contain and constrain Iran  s troubling nuclear program     Harkin said    As we move forward in our effort with the international community to deal  contain  and if necessary  sanction Iran for its defiance of international demands to halt its sensitive nuclear activities  we will need greater support from a regional partner like India             A variety of government and media reports indicate India has a robust relationship with Iran  India actively engages in military to military cooperation with Iran and the two countries have a significant trade relationship  India plans to build a gas pipeline from Iran through Pakistan  India  s leaders also see Iran as a diplomatic partner on many issues            I want to be clear    my amendment is not   anti India     Harkin said    My amendment is a positive and vital step in safeguarding our own national security interests             The U S  government  as a result of the Iran Syria Nonproliferation Act  has sanctioned Indian companies for transferring WMD technologies and materials to Iran and other countries  On Aug  4  the Bush administration publicly announced in the Federal Register sanctions on two Indian entities for transferring to Iran chemicals that can be used to produce missile propellant            What this means is that India  s current export control laws are inadequate and do not meet the same high standards of U S  export laws     Harkin said    The goal of this amendment is to ensure that we are protecting the interests and  more importantly the safety  of the American people                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
