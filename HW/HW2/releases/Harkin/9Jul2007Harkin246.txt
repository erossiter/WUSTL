 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  appeared today with business leaders  medical professionals and public health officials to introduce new legislation he is co sponsoring with Senator Gordon Smith  R OR  that will encourage businesses to implement workplace wellness programs that produce results   The Healthy Workforce Act would provide tax incentives to businesses  particularly small and medium sized employers  that provide opportunities for their employees to lead healthier lives and prevent chronic illnesses  Preventable chronic illnesses  such as diabetes and heart disease  affect more than 33 percent of working age Americans and make up nearly 75 percent of the nations total health care costs  Some companies report spending more than 50 percent of their profits to cover healthcare expenses for their employees   I am thrilled to be standing shoulder to shoulder with both the public health community and leaders in business and industry in a united front to tackle the healthcare crisis in our country  said Harkin  The rising cost of healthcare has taken its toll on individuals  but also on businesses that provide health coverage to their employees   with employer healthcare costs rising by more than 70 percent since the year 2000  This trend is affecting American companies  ability to remain competitive in our global economy  and we must find a way to turn it around   An investment in preventative health care is one of the greatest opportunities we have to improve America s health and to control skyrocketing health care costs  said Senator Smith  Much of the cost borne by our health care system is from preventable chronic illnesses as a result of poor diet and lack of exercise  By encouraging businesses to educate and motivate their employees to take their health seriously  we can take a significant step toward lowering health care costs and keeping our population healthy   Employers are increasingly bearing the costs of diet related chronic disease and obesity through employer provided health care plans and indirectly through higher rates of absenteeism  Obesity alone costs employers approximately  33 billion in health care and other indirect costs   Employer spending on health promotion and chronic disease prevention is a good investment  Studies have reported a proven rate of return ranging from  2 to  10 for each dollar invested  Workplace wellness programs are also economical  averaging  30  200 per employee   Preventing these chronic diseases and unhealthy lifestyles not only helps individuals live longer and more fulfilling lives  it saves money  said Harkin  For example  proactive treatment of hypertension costs about  1 000 per year whereas treatment for a heart attack  which hypertension is often a cause of  costs a minimum of  50 000  not including time off and loss of productivity  It simply makes sense to partner with employers and leverage the place where Americans spend the majority of their waking hours  the workplace   The Healthy Workforce Act would provide a tax credit of up to  200 per employee for the first 200 employees  and up to  100 per employee thereafter  to businesses that offer comprehensive wellness programs   Types of employee wellness programs eligible for the tax credit must include three of the following four provisions   An employer can receive the tax credit for 10 years after establishing new qualified wellness programs       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
