        Since 2000  crop insurance participation in terms of acres enrolled has increased by seven percent  and total crop value covered has increased by more than 33 percent   With the higher premium subsidies provided in ARPA  farmers are both covering more acres and buying higher levels of coverage for acres that were already insured  which is what we intended to achieve   ARPA also invested resources in developing new products for crops for which either no policies exist or for which existing policies were deemed inadequate by producers of those crops    The Act also relaxed the restriction on providing insurance coverage for livestock operations  for which several pilot projects have been approved            I expect that many of the witnesses will raise the issue of the proposed rule for the Premium Reduction Plan   The Federal Register notice for that proposed rule generated several hundred comments   I understand that the majority of the comments were negative  raising concerns both about the adequacy of the proposed rule and the capacity of Risk Management Agency  RMA  to oversee how companies and agents market these discounted policies  in order to reduce the temptation for agents to focus on larger  more profitable operations while neglecting small  and medium sized farms               I share those concerns  and believe that RMA should delay implementing this rule until stakeholders have an opportunity to provide input on the revised version of the rule before it goes into effect   A delay would also permit an independent analysis of the potential impact on the crop insurance program and the resources needed to monitor marketing practices             I also have concerns about the proposed changes to the conflict of interest rules which govern relationships between crop insurance agents and loss adjusters   Many agents from Iowa and elsewhere have objected to requirements which bar any contact between agents and adjusters  even something as routine and non controversial as providing maps or directions to the farm where the crop loss occurred   While I understand the need for effective conflict of interest rules  some of these  proposed changes seem more likely to create confusion and delay in processing farmers   claims without really reducing wasteful or abusive practices            I would like to note that three of today  s witnesses hail from Iowa  and I would like to acknowledge their participation in this hearing   In order of appearance  we have Mr  Norman Nielsen from Preston  Iowa  representing the Independent Insurance Agents and Brokers of America  Mr  Billy Rose  CEO of Crop1  located in Des Moines  Iowa  and Dr  Bruce Babcock  Director of the Center for Agricultural and Rural Development at Iowa State University in Ames   Welcome  gentlemen  and thank you for testifying       I believe that over the last several years  Congress  USDA  crop insurance companies  and agents have combined to provide a greatly improved federal crop insurance program  Certainly  Iowa farmers have embraced the program  insuring their crops to the tune of more than  5 billion in protection last year   Before we tinker with that success  let  s take a long  hard look at these matters   Thank you again  Mr  Chairman                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
