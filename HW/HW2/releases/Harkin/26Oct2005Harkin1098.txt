         America has the highest natural gas prices in the world  imposing unsustainable costs on Iowa  s and the nation  s economy     Harkin said     I want to make sure speculators looking to make a quick buck from high natural gas prices are not leaving Americans out in the cold   It  s vital we ensure everybody is playing by the rules in natural gas markets              High natural gas prices affect farming operations through increasing input costs  such as fertilizer  which is primarily made from natural gas   On average  Iowa farmers spend more than  700 million dollars a year on fertilizer   Last month  the Department of Energy warned that natural gas prices in the Midwest could jump as much as 71 percent  where four out of five homes are heated by natural gas             If these predictions are accurate  the impact on homes  communities  and businesses in my state of Nebraska and throughout the nation will be dramatic     said Nelson           Harkin and Nelson called for GAO to examine whether speculators in energy markets may be unduly influencing  and possibly contributing to  continued high prices for natural gas   The Commodity Futures Trading Commission  CFTC  is responsible for regulating trading of energy derivatives  such as contracts for natural gas  and is subject to oversight by the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  of which both Harkin and Nelson are members   Harkin is the ranking Democrat on the Committee             High natural gas costs are taking a heavy toll on farmers   and families   pocketbooks     Harkin said     I hope this report sheds light on what can be done to bring these costs down for Americans                Some analysts are concerned that market manipulation is occurring through commodities market trading     Nelson said      The analysts believe that as contracts are traded  those with superior information  through speculative buying  can influence the price of natural gas              In 2003  Harkin commissioned a GAO study examining high natural gas prices impact on the fertilizer industry  The study found  among other things  that higher prices in 2000 2001 led to a 25  reduction in domestic production of nitrogen  causing economic hardship for both farmers and the U S  fertilizer industry   Harkin also recently pushed to provide emergency assistance for low income Americans facing record energy prices as part of the annual appropriations process   In addition  he was instrumental in including major biofuels and renewable energy provisions in the comprehensive energy bill enacted by Congress earlier this year           A copy of Harkin and Nelson  s letter is availible upon request                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
