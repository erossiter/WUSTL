         WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today introduced a measure to restore funding to the Community Services Block Grant  CSBG  which funds local community action agencies across the country    including 18 in Iowa    that fight poverty among low income families and children   In September  the Senate failed to pass a similar Harkin amendment and the program suffered a 50 to 75 percent cut under the last Continuing Resolution passed by Congress   Senate Republicans  however  promised it would restore the cuts as soon as possible   Now  two months later as the Senate is considering another CR  Senate Republicans have yet to restore this cut as promised             In September  Senate Republicans pledged to fix this cut  and two months these agencies are still left out in the cold     said Harkin     These cuts to essential programs for needy families and children are callous and ill advised   This couldn  t possibly be happening at a worse time and we must do something to fix it             These cuts would eliminate or disrupt essential services for some 6 5 million low income people  including nearly two million children   In Iowa  nearly 150 000 people would be impacted   Smaller states like Alaska  Delaware  Hawaii  Idaho  Maine  Montana  Nevada  New Hampshire  North Dakota  Utah  Vermont and Wyoming could face a cut up to 75 percent   Currently  in the Gulf Coast region  these agencies are providing services to some 171 000 victims of Hurricane Katrina   Under the cuts a majority of rural outreach centers would be closed  denying entire rural communities access to services   About 1 3 million rural Americans in poverty will lose services          Many one stop neighborhood centers in suburban and urban areas would also be shut down    CSBG also funds support recruitment  training  and support of local volunteers   Communities will soon lose 21 million volunteer hours  valued at over  100 million  Typical volunteer programs in a community action agency are  transportation  for elderly  medical needs  recreation for the disabled   home ownership counseling  tax preparation assistance  literacy instruction  chore services for the homebound elderly  and mentoring and counseling for at risk youth             Community action agencies often administer the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program    LIHEAP    which helps low income families to pay their home heating bills     Nearly 80 000 Iowans depend on LIHEAP   The U S  Department of Energy  DOE  has predicted that households heated by gas can expect their fuel bills to rise by nearly 50 percent this winter   Earlier this fall  DOE warned that natural gas prices in the Midwest could jump as much as 71 percent             With forecasters predicting an unusually cold winter  and with home heating costs expected to rise by 50 to 70 percent  I can  t imagine a worse time for Congress to be slashing the Community Service Block Grant     said Harkin     And  LIHEAP is just one of the vital services that that the poor  elderly  kids and the disabled rely on                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
