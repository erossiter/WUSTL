      WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today applauded Senate approval of emergency funding for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP    The funding will help Iowans who are struggling to pay high home heating bills accumulated this winter   The Senate approved a  1 billion increase for the program  but this falls short of the  2 92 billion increase that the Senate approved repeatedly on a bipartisan basis last year   While this funding is a step in the right direction  Harkin stressed that more funding is needed   Increased home heating costs have created a greater need for LIHEAP assistance and twelve states  including Iowa  are currently running dangerously low on funds or are out of LIHEAP funds            Iowans   heating debt has racked up as LIHEAP funding has nearly run out for the state     Harkin said     I am pleased the Senate passed this increase for LIHEAP  but more is needed   These emergency funds will only help Iowans through the next few months and could leave working families and seniors out in the cold next winter             Half of the  1 billion increase for LIHEAP will be available for states like Iowa that face emergency shortfalls in LIHEAP funds   The other half will be distributed as non emergency spending and will likely not assist Iowa  The rise in energy prices  along with energy debt remaining from last winter  led to increased disconnections among consumers earlier this winter   Increased funding is needed to help low income families and seniors meet the demands of increasing energy prices and ensure they can afford heat for their homes            The funding increase faces a number of hurdles before being enacted into law   It first must pass the House and then would have to be signed by President Bush   Much of the funding would also be released at the President  s discretion and to date  the Bush Administration refuses to distribute over  100 million in emergency funding to states like Iowa where LIHEAP funding is close to running out            The budget choices of this Congress and the White House continue to hurt the pocketbooks of working families and low income Iowans     Harkin said     While Iowans are facing much higher heating bills  the Republican Leadership refuses to pass what  s needed to help             Harkin has cosponsored legislation to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP  the funding level approved on five separate occasions by the U S  Senate            LIHEAP helps eligible low income families  the disabled  and senior citizens living on fixed incomes receive relief from their high home energy costs  In 2004  states assisted more than four million households with LIHEAP assistance  including 85 000 Iowa households   In Iowa last year  the state surveyed households receiving LIHEAP and found that 21 percent reported going without needed medical care and or prescription drugs and 12 percent reported going without food in order to pay their heating bill                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
