        This critical funding helps local law enforcement coordinate drug fighting efforts  hire officers and purchase equipment  stop domestic violence and effectively deal with drug offenders     said Harkin     Ask any sheriff  any detective  or any police officer on the beat  and they  ll tell you that these cuts will weaken our ability to fight meth and crime               The Bush budget would cut funding for Iowa law enforcement efforts by 65 percent   In Iowa alone these cuts would result in a  17 8 million loss used to fight meth and keep police on the street  This comes on the heels of a 27 percent reduction over the last three years              The Bush budget would slash or eliminate many programs aimed at bolstering local law enforcement  including the Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  program  which helps local police departments put more officers out on our nation s streets   It would eliminate funding for the COPS Meth program  which has been crucial to our fight against methamphetamine   And it would also eliminate Byrne Grants that fund many drug fighting programs across the state            These cuts will have a devastating impact across Iowa   Twenty five drug task forces and more than 70 drug and crime control projects would potentially lose all of their funding   Iowa would also lose funding to run the Southeast and South Central Meth Clan Lab Task Forces  the Meth Anhydrous Ammonia Tank Lock Project and the Sioux City Regional Training Center              These are the wrong choices  the wrong priorities     said Harkin     They don  t reflect Iowa values  and they don  t reflect plain common sense   I hope that the President will think this through  and reconsider              Iowa is already reeling from cuts to programs in 2005   Two critical programs the Edward Byrne Memorial Grant and the Local Law Enforcement Block Grant were combined into a single program which amounted to almost a  100 million cut         From Iowa  s Law Enforcement Personnel            Any further reduction in funding would seriously hamper efforts to address Iowa  s number one public safety threat  the manufacture and use of meth   Elimination of these funds would be devastating     said Marvin Van Haaften  Director of the Governor  s Office of Drug Control Policy            Mary Chavez with Iowa Drug Endangered Children said that with nearly 1000 Iowa children rescued by law enforcement from meth labs over the past three years  the problem of child protection in an era of methamphetamine has become a dire problem for local communities     Decreased funding to Iowa drug enforcement efforts will seal the fate of numerous children  who will never be identified  given medical care or a chance for a healthy future     said Chavez            Linda Murken is the Director of the Second Judicial District Department of Correctional Services in Ames   She says that because of Byrne funding  they have been able to implement two innovative Community Drug Courts  in Marshalltown and Mason City which provide intensive drug treatment and intensive correctional supervision     If Byrne funds are severely reduced or eliminated  we will lose this great opportunity to develop and test innovative ideas  and to share what we learn with others     said Murken            Story County Sheriff Paul Fitzgerald said that both their drug task force and their treatment programs would be impacted by these budget cuts            According to Newton Police Chief Thomas Wardlow almost every crime they face is directly linked to substance abuse     We have to work drugs  our community is counting on us  but I don  t know where we will find the money to do so     he said            Ed Kuhl  Norwalk Chief of Police says    The Norwalk Police Department like many other smaller agencies in Iowa are severely challenged today to find the necessary resources to effectively function and the COPs grants have been a tremendous boost for our small department               Ken Carter  Director of the Iowa Department of Narcotics Enforcement says that any cuts to their federal funding will adversely impact their drug enforcement efforts across the state  particularly their efforts to combat meth                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
