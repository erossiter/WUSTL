               WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today released the following statement in response to a study released by the Kaiser Family Foundation  Food for Thought  Television Food Advertising to Children in the United States   The study is the largest and most comprehensive examination conducted of television advertising to children                            Where previous studies have typically used samples of 40 50 hours of programming  this study uses more than 1 600 hours   It covers all genres of programming viewed by children  rather than just children s shows   Previous studies have not accounted for the proportion of children s viewing that is of children s vs  non children s programs                           Junk food advertising isn t just for Saturday morning cartoons anymore   Kids are inundated by these ads all over the place and I m glad to see that that the Kaiser Family Foundation study finally takes a look at the whole picture                         We now have data that conclusively shows kids are seeing an overwhelming number of ads for unhealthy food on all types of TV shows   The  childhood obesity epidemic  isn t just a catch phrase  it s a real public health crisis                           I hope that this study can help plant the seed for actual results from the new FCC Taskforce recently created to address this very issue   I urge my fellow task force members to leave the rhetoric behind  and seize this opportunity so that together  public and private entities can implement real solutions that effectively deal with this public health problem                        Harkin is the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children  He recently joined Senator Sam Brownback  R KS  and others to create the Task Force on Media and Childhood Obesity  an innovative public private partnership aimed at combating the clear and present health dangers stemming from poor nutrition and childhood obesity                          In the 109th Congress  he introduced legislation that would restore the FTC authority to regulate marketing directed at children  This measure would give the FTC the power to restrict the advertising of junk food to children under age 18 in the absence of corporate leadership                              In addition to his efforts on food marketing  Harkin is the author of the Harkin Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program    now operating in eight states and on three Indian reservations    which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools   He has also proposed legislation to give communities funding for more bike paths and sidewalks and tax credits for employers who implement wellness programs for their employees                  A copy of the full report is available at www kff org                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
