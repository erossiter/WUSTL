      WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced legislation that would ensure the biodiesel tax credit is carried out as Congress intended   The biodiesel tax credit was passed to spur U S  biofuels production and stimulate the rural economy and Congress listed a number of vegetable oils as eligible for the tax break   The Internal Revenue Service  IRS  is giving the biodiesel tax credit for production from palm oil  a feedstock not listed under statute and often imported from foreign countries   Harkin  s bill would close this loophole and clarify that only feedstocks listed by Congress are eligible to receive the biodiesel tax credit                Giving tax breaks for biodiesel made from palm oil is not what Congress had in mind with the biodiesel tax credit     said Harkin     This legislation will provide a simple  cost effective and WTO compliant way to boost America  s domestic energy production and help our rural economy through farm based renewable energy               Harkin  s bill would do two things   First  it ensures that the biodiesel tax credit is available only for biodiesel made from the feedstocks listed in statute   The proposal does not discriminate against foreign sourced biodiesel  but it would provide clarification for the IRS that biodiesel made from oilseeds other than those listed in statute are ineligible for the biodiesel tax credit   Second  it establishes a performance standard to ensure that all biodiesel receiving the tax credit works effectively in truck and car engines             With three biodiesel plants operating and more on the way  Iowa leads the nation in production of biodiesel fuel   These plants add good jobs to rural economies  raise local crop prices for farmers and generate additional tax revenue               Harkin has been a leader in Congress in promoting America  s shift to renewable fuels   Harkin was instrumental in including provisions that will double the use of ethanol and biodiesel by 2012  renewable fuels standard  RFS  in the comprehensive energy bill enacted by Congress earlier this year   Recently  Harkin introduced legislation that would require all automobiles sold in the U S  be   flex fuel    vehicles    that is  they are able to use regular gasoline or various ethanol blends up to 85 percent ethanol  known as E 85  Promoting renewable fuels will reduce our dangerous and costly dependence on foreign oil while stimulating the rural economy                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
