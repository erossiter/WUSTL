                  WASHINGTON  D C    Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry urged the Departments of Agriculture  USDA  and Homeland Security  DHS  to implement the recommendations set forth today by both agencies  offices of the Inspector General   The offices released a report citing 13 proposals that would close gaps at the border and at ports of entry to protect the United States from dangerous foreign pests and diseases such as the H5N1 strain of highly pathogenic avian influenza and foot and mouth disease                               Last year  a study from the Government Accountability Office  GAO  found many gaps in the system  which could allow these diseases unintentionally through passengers or cargo  illegal smuggling of agricultural products  or intentionally by terrorists seeking to  damage U S  agriculture and the nation s food supply   Harkin had requested the GAO audit in 2005 in response to concerns that coordination between the departments was inadequate and the number of trained agricultural inspectors was lacking                              The threat of diseases like avian flu are very real and continue to plague our country   said Harkin    Nearly one year after the GAO found significant gaps in the system that could allow agricultural diseases into the U S   the Inspector General confirms that our ports and border are still porous   We must move quickly to defend our borders from these kinds of threats and I urge the USDA and DHS to implement these recommendations immediately                        Among a sampling of the Inspector General s findings                              Customs and Border Protection  CBP  does not have an agriculture specialist staffing model that ensures staffing is adequate to protect agriculture from pests and disease    Since the transfer of agriculture inspectors from USDA supervision to DHS  staffing has decreased 17 percent                               CBP uses performance measures to evaluate whether agriculture inspection activities are efficient and effective   The Inspector General identified only two performance measures in place for agriculture inspections  one for international air passengers  the other for border vehicle passengers   But there should be performance measures for inspections of air and truck cargo  mail  pedestrians  and maritime as well   As a result  DHS and USDA do not have assurance that agriculture  inspection activities for these other pathways of agriculture pest and disease entry are adequate                             USDA policy calls for sealing and labeling seized material for later analysis of pests and diseases   This helps the port assess risk by identifying the pests s source   At only one of the three airports visited by the Inspector General were CBP personnel implementing this policy                            Currently  DHS and USDA share responsibility for protecting the U S  from foreign pests and diseases with USDA responsible for setting inspection policies while DHS is responsible for carrying out most of the inspections                         Click here to view the report in its entirety  http   www usda gov oig webdocs OIG 07 32 pdf                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
