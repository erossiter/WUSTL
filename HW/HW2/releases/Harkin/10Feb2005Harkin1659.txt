    Thank you  Dr  Kamerow  for that kind introduction   I would also like to recognize Dr  Tom Baranowski of Baylor College of Medicine  who gave excellent testimony at a field hearing I conducted last year in Iowa   Thank you  Tom          And let me thank all of you   You are on the front line in fighting this epidemic of childhood obesity   And I am grateful for the passion that you bring to this incredibly important work            I share your passion because  you know  on the macro level  childhood obesity is a public health crisis   But on the individual level       for each child afflicted with this disease       it is something else   It is a tragedy   If current trends continue  one in three children will develop diabetes   And what compounds this tragedy is that it is so unnecessary   Our society created this obesity epidemic    and we are not taking the obvious steps to fix it             Late in her life  Jackie Kennedy said a very wise thing   She said that   If you botch raising your children  nothing else you do in life matters very much      I fear that  in so many respects  we are botching the raising of our children in the United States   We are exposing our children to a barrage of messages and influences that are just plain toxic             You know the statistics   The food industry spends some  15 billion each year marketing to children   And they  re not selling carrots and broccoli   They are selling foods that are high in fat  sugar  and salt       foods that are appropriately called   junk                A couple weeks ago  there was an uproar surrounding the kids   cartoon character SpongeBob Squarepants   Certain groups were concerned that he holds hands with Patrick  his starfish friend   Well  I  ve got a different complaint about SpongeBob   Big  inflatable SpongeBobs are being perched on the top of Burger King Restaurants    enticing young kids to eat foods that in the short could make them obese  and in the long run could kill them           Some of these fast food offerings border on the obscene   How about the Monster ThickBurger  now being pushed by the Hardee  s chain   It consists of two one third pound slabs of beef  four strips of bacon  three slices of cheese  and mayonnaise on a buttered sesame seed bun   That  s 1 400 calories and 107 grams of fat    in one sandwich           Over the last couple of decades  the number of TV ads that kids see every year    mostly for junk food    has doubled from 20 000 to 40 000   Over the same period of time  the incidence of childhood obesity has doubled             Of course  the food industry will deny any cause effect relationship   But ask the parents of overweight children    parents who are constantly being badgered to go to McDonald  s  to buy Oreos  to buy Sugar Frosted Flakes   They understand the connection           My friends  as elected officials  as researchers  as parents and grandparents  as responsible adults  we cannot stand around like potted plants while this assault on our children continues       while it intensifies           Unfortunately  that is what some people would have us do   nothing   When the IOM  s landmark report on childhood obesity came out last fall  the food industry was mostly silent   Acting HHS Assistant Secretary for Health  Christina Beato  told the Washington Post that her department lacks authority to develop guidelines for responsible marketing to children   She called for   voluntary action    from the food industry           But we know that a strictly voluntary approach gets us nowhere   I take that back  it is the strictly voluntary approach that has allowed the epidemic of childhood obesity to grow so rapidly   We need action           Legislation is never the first resort   I believe in individual responsibility   I believe in corporate responsibility   But where these things are missing  I believe that government has a responsibility   But  unfortunately  for nearly three decades  government has been largely in retreat and denial           I take you back to 1978   That  s when the Federal Trade Commission warned Congress about the dangers of advertising aimed at children   In response to numerous complaints about tooth decay and the rapid increase in junk food commercials  the FTC launched a major investigation              The agency concluded that TV advertising directed at young children    especially advertising for high sugar foods    was both unfair and deceptive   It concluded that children do not understand the purposes of advertising  and they are not able to evaluate the merits of claims in advertising   Accordingly  the FTC proposed banning or restricting such advertising             But under heavy pressure from the broadcast and food industries  Congress killed the messenger   It stripped the FTC of much of its regulatory authority   Congress even passed the so called FTC Improvements Act  which expressly prohibited the FTC from following through on its proposals to ban or restrict advertising directed at children   This new law made it next to impossible to regulate advertising directed at kids   Indeed  today  the FTC has more authority to regulate advertising directed at adults than ads aimed at children             In so many respects  the federal government is still going in the wrong direction on health care policy   For instance  in the budget released on Monday  the President proposed zeroing out funding for the Preventive Health Services block grant   This is a major source of funding for health promotion activities in the United States  and the White House wants to get rid of it            The President also proposes that we eliminate funding for the VERB program   This program  which is run by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  encourages young people ages 9  13    the so called   tweens       to be physically active every day   VERB works  but  again  the White House wants to get rid of it           These are the wrong choices and the wrong priorities    not just for the health of the American people  but for the health of the federal budget           The President is spending his time sounding the alarm about Social Security   But the real crisis is in long term Medicare and Medicaid funding   Think about it   Over the next 75 years  the shortfall in Social Security is  3 7 trillion   But the shortfall in Medicare is estimated at  17 trillion   The shortfall in the President  s prescription drug program  alone  is  8 1 trillion   This is the real 800 pound gorilla that threatens to devour the federal budget           To take just one example  obesity   Medical expenditures attributable to obesity are now some  75 billion a year    and growing   Roughly half of those costs are paid for by Medicare and Medicaid              Okay  so what do we need to do to get control of this very real crisis in health care entitlements   Well  there are plenty of short term options   But  thinking long term  we need to completely shift our health care focus in the United States            Currently  we do not have a health care system  we have a sick care system   We wait until people get sick  obese  or disabled  and then we spend hundreds of billions of dollars to try to pick up the pieces   This is unwise   It is uneconomic   And  as we now know  it is totally unsustainable             The alternative    which I am aggressively promoting    is to create a genuine health care system       a system that focuses on wellness and disease prevention       a system that keeps people out of the hospital in the first place   I am convinced that a new national focus on wellness  physical activity  good nutrition  and common sense disease prevention is the way to go   This will be good for the physical health of the American people   And it will be good for the fiscal health of the Medicare and Medicaid programs          To move us in this new direction  I have introduced the HeLP America Act  otherwise known as the Healthier Lifestyles and Prevention Act   This legislation takes a comprehensive approach   It provides tools and incentives to schools  employers  and communities    encouraging them to focus on health promotion and wellness             I introduced the HeLP America Act before the IOM issued its report on childhood obesity last fall   But I am struck by the many ways that my bill tracks with the Institute  s recommendations           Both the IOM report and the HeLP America Act recommend increasing funds for nutrition and physical activity grants programs           Both the IOM report and the HeLP America Act endorse labeling of restaurant foods           The IOM report suggests that the Federal Trade Commission should have increased authority to monitor food marketing  and the HeLP America Act would give this authority to the FTC           The IOM report agrees with me in suggesting that community and child centered organizations  including schools  should play a larger role in promoting healthier eating  including developing standards for foods available to children at school           The Institute of Medicine report recommends that insurers should include preventive screening and obesity prevention services in routine clinical practice   The HeLP America Act would make reimbursement for preventive services a part of the standard reimbursement regulations in the Medicare Program           I could go on an on about the similarities   But the point is that IOM has given us an authoritative blueprint for action   And  in the HeLP America Act  we have a bill that reflects that blueprint             Now it is time to act   I mean  the childhood obesity epidemic is a lot like global warming   We  ve had report after report   We know what the problem is   In large measure  we know what the solution is   Now it is a question of mobilizing to get the job done           That is exactly what you are doing today here in Washington    and what your research will focus on in the years ahead   As I said at the outset  I am grateful for your dedication and commitment to this work   And I pledge to do everything I can in Congress to move our shared agenda forward           To that end  I am well placed as ranking member    the senior Democrat    on the Labor Health and Human Services subcommittee of Appropriations   On Appropriations  there are two especially powerful subcommittees  Defense and Labor HHS   It is said that the Defense subcommittee defends America  and the Labor HHS subcommittee defines America             I want to define America as a nation that cares passionately about the health and well being of its children       a nation that will move mountains to defeat the epidemic of childhood obesity   I thank you for sharing this great goal   Your research will move us to the next stage   And I wish you every success           Thank you  my friends                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
