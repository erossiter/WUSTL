         Welcome to today s Labor HHS Appropriations Subcommittee hearing on the fiscal year 2008 budget for the National Institutes of Health  NIH                             Whenever I talk about NIH  it s a pleasure to sit next to my friend Senator Specter   No one has fought harder to improve biomedical research in this country   He and I worked in lockstep to double funding for NIH between fiscal years 1998 and 2003   one of my proudest accomplishments in the Senate   I know he shares my disappointment that NIH has fallen on tougher budgetary times since then                            The fiscal year 2007 joint funding resolution that Congress passed a few weeks ago brought some good news  for a change   We increased NIH funding by  637 million   enough to launch the National Children s Study  add another 500 research grants  and provide additional funding for high risk grants and young investigators                               Even with that increase  however  FY07 marked the fourth year in a row that NIH funding failed to keep with the costs of inflation   In fact  since the end of the doubling period  in FY03  NIH funding has dropped by about 13 percent in real terms   That cut threatens to squander our nation s investment in biomedical research  delay new cures and treatments  and discourage the next generation of young investigators from entering the field                            The President s fiscal year 2008 budget would make matters even worse   On paper  it would seem to cut NIH funding by  328 million   But the actual reduction is about  200 million more   529 million   because under the President s budget  NIH would pick up the entire tab for the Global AIDS Fund  rather than sharing it with the State Department                                  As a result  comparable funding for the National Cancer Institute would drop by  79 million  and funding for the National Heart Lung and Blood Institute  by  36 million   The National Children s Study would be stopped cold                         I assure everyone here   Senator Specter and I will not allow those cuts to stand                               This is the first of six budget hearings on NIH that this Subcommittee will hold this spring   At today s hearing  we will hear first from Elias Zerhouni  the director of NIH   Our second panel will consist of four leading scientists who have received NIH grants   They will discuss the impact of Federal funding on their areas of research and why it s so important to increase our investment in NIH                         All four of these scientists helped produce a new report on NIH entitled  Within Our Grasp or Slipping Away   Assessing a New Era of Scientific and Medical Progress    That report will be released at a press conference immediately following this hearing                        Then next Monday  we will hold a hearing with the directors of five NIH Institutes   the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke  NINDS   National Institute on Drug Abuse  NIDA   National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism  NIAAA   National Institute of Mental Health  NIMH  and National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders  NIDCD    Before the spring is over  this Subcommittee will hear from the directors of each Institute and Center at NIH                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
