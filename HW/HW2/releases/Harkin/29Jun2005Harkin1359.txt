     Last month  the House of Representatives passed a bill that would vastly expand the number of stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research   This was a strong  bipartisan vote    238 to 194           I never thought I  d see the day when I  d say    Thank goodness for that great stem cell bill the House sent us     But it just goes to show   the more people learn about stem cell research  the more they support this legislation           Now it  s up to us in the Senate to pass the same bill    HR 810   I understand that Senator Frist and Senator Reid are working out a way to bring the bill to the floor  and I commend them for that effort           The key is to pass this bill without any amendments   We don  t want it getting lost in a conference committee   We need to pass HR 810 by a strong  bipartisan majority  and send it straight to the President  s desk         The good news is that we have broad support in the Senate   We have Republicans and Democrats   We have Senators who are strongly pro choice and Senators who are strongly pro life    for instance  Senators Orrin Hatch and Gordon Smith         And we have support from another quarter    from the wonderful people in this room       advocates and patients whose lives could very well depend on how much progress we make with stem cell research         So  my friends  I urge you to call everyone you know across the country and ask them to tell their Senators to vote for HR 810 without any amendments         I was just chatting with the leaders of CAMR a few minutes ago  and they were telling me about all the great work you  re planning to do over the Fourth of July recess   I know you folks   I know you can accomplish anything you put your minds to   Just look at what you accomplished in the House         Now  we need you to work your magic once again   Call your Senators   Send them e mails   If you see your Senators at a July Fourth picnic  bring them a hot dog  and urge them to support stem cell research          And one more thing  my friends   There  s been a lot of talk  recently  about new techniques for deriving embryonic stem cells   The truth is that most of these ideas are nothing but theories   They haven  t been tested   The data haven  t even been published in a journal          I  m for pursuing all forms of stem cell research    adult stem cells  cord blood  you name it   But scientists agree on this   nothing can match the tremendous potential of human embryonic stem cells   We can  t afford to put this research on hold while we wait for some new technique that may never pan out   Patients need help NOW          So let  s pass HR 810 in the Senate and bring hope to millions of Americans                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
