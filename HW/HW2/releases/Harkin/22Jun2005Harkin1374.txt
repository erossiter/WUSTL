       It is generally agreed that Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting is meeting its mandated goal and should continue    The real question is what can be done to make the program more transparent and identify areas that will strengthen the existing law   I have heard from many livestock producers who want the program to continue  but have concerns that there needs to be stronger governmental oversight and external review of the program  improved reporting times for the morning and afternoon reports  inclusion of wholesale pork cuts  and an ability for producers to verify that their own livestock were accurately reported in the system    I have also heard concerns that there is insufficient coordination at USDA among the specific branches responsible for enforcement and compliance activities  which may cause price reports to be less accurate than they should be   The lack of strong oversight and enforcement at USDA complicates Congress   ability to determine whether the problems are due to limitations of the law itself or its administration              In order to have as many facts as possible for purposes of reauthorizing this law  I requested a Government Accountability Office investigation last year to examine issues related to compliance and enforcement activities   I am pleased Senator Grassley joined me in making the request   Currently  GAO is reviewing the timeliness of required reports filed by packers given that late filed reports will alter the true prices paid   They are evaluating USDA  s authority to require accurate reporting of premiums and discounts by packers   GAO is also evaluating the specific branches responsible for compliance and enforcement at USDA to see if they are actually talking to each other and sharing information    These are just a few of the issues GAO is examining right now that may need to be resolved legislatively              The GAO report will provide answers that will be very useful for long term reauthorization of livestock mandatory price reporting   Unfortunately  we find ourselves with a timing issue since the law will expire in September  and the GAO report will not be finished until December   It would be unfortunate for Congress to provide a long term reauthorization without critical analysis and facts from the GAO audit that reflect issues that need to be resolved legislatively right now  and preliminary information suggests that is the case              As the Committee moves forward with reauthorization of the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act  I look forward to working with the Chairman and members of the Committee to find a suitable solution in regard to the timeframe of extending the law                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
