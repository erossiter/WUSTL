        Mr  President  by triggering the nuclear option  the Majority Leader would unleash forces that he would regret  and that everyone who loves this great nation and its system of checks and balances would regret   There is no question that  by breaking the rules  the majority party would gain short term advantage   They would be able to confirm every one of their judicial nominees  no matter how radical or out of the mainstream               But the long term  destructive consequences of triggering the nuclear option would be profound for our system of government   For more than two centuries  Senate rules and traditions have respected the rights of the minority   That would be destroyed              For more than two centuries  thanks to those minority rights  the Senate has been a force for compromise  moderation  and reason   That would be destroyed              For more than two centuries  the minority  s power in the Senate has been essential to America  s system of checks and balances   That would be destroyed            And something else of great importance would be destroyed  Respect for rules            Mr  President  playing by the rules is the American way   It is one of our core values   From childhood  we are taught to respect the rules  to follow the rules  to play by the rules   We are taught that it is dishonorable to break the rules or to change the rules in the middle of the game  especially to gain an advantage or to win   Ask any child  and he or she will tell you that breaking the rules  or changing the rules in the middle of the game  is not only unfair  it is wrong              America is a great country because playing by the rules  and respecting rules  is a core value   It is a way of life   It is at the heart of our athletics  our business dealings  and our way of government   It is no exaggeration to say that if you destroy the idea of playing by the rules  then you invite distrust  disorder  and the disintegration of the American social fabric   You invite chaos  and chaos invites tyranny               And this is exactly why the Republican leadership  s plan to resort to the nuclear option is so dangerous   Since 1790  the filibuster has been used in the Senate countless hundreds of times   Nearly 100 years ago  the Senate passed Rule 22  codifying the right of extended debate   It takes 67 votes to change the Senate rules  and 60 votes to cut off debate   Those are the rules   They are deeply conservative rules    rules that have been respected and honored for nearly a century   Until now            Now  the Republican leadership is unhappy because a small number of judges    all of them I consider far out of the mainstream    have been filibustered by the minority   They are unhappy because they have been able to confirm only 95 percent of the President  s judicial nominees  and not 100 percent   This compares  by the way  to only an 80 percent confirmation rate during the Clinton administration   The Republicans blocked 75 Clinton judicial nominees  including Bonnie Campbell of Iowa   And most of those nominees were blocked in the Judiciary Committee by just one Senator            Does the Republican leadership celebrate the fact that  playing by the rules  they won 95 percent of the time   Do they now play by the rules and gather the votes necessary to change Rule 22  governing filibusters   No              They will make up their own rule    a new rule that will allow them  henceforth  to change any rule at any time for any reason by only 51 votes   In other words  once the nuclear option is detonated and a new Senate precedent is established  this body will be subject to the whim of any group of 51 Senators who want to impose their will without any provision for extended debate              Make no mistake  This will be the end of the Senate as we know it                 And how ironic that this is being done by Senators who call themselves conservative    The truth is that resort to the nuclear option    breaking the rules  making up new rules convenient to the leadership    is a radical  unprecedented action  with consequences that no one can predict   Because  once you break the rules and start making up new rules as you go along  you sow the seeds of anarchy  of chaos   You create an atmosphere of   anything goes   and   the end justifies the means                We have already seen this in the actions of the House Majority Leader  Tom DeLay   We have an honored tradition that congressional redistricting occurs every 10 years after the decennial census   But Mr  DeLay wanted to increase his majority in the House   So what did he do   He tore up the rules   He made up new rules  Tom DeLay  s rules   But the real Tom DeLay rule is this  Anything goes   The end justifies the means   Situational ethics   And I fear that we are about to adopt that Tom DeLay rule here in the Senate            Mr  President  this is profoundly bad news for this institution that we love  the United States Senate   But I am also concerned about the message this sends to business people  to husbands and wives  and to our children   The message is   If our national leaders can break the rules as a matter of convenience  if they can write their own rules and impose those new rules on others  then maybe it  s OK for everyone behave just like that               This is a deeply disturbing prospect   I implore the distinguished Majority Leader  Mr  Frist  to consider the law of unintended consequences   He is threatening to break Rule 22 in order to pass 100 percent of the President  s judicial nominees   But once the rule is destroyed  and once the Majority Leader imposes a new rule to his liking  then who is to say where this will lead   It will be like an out of control virus   If 51 Senators can change any rule at any time for any reason  then anything is possible             The metaphor that Senators are using is   nuclear option      And that is appropriate   There may also be another metaphor   The Majority Leader is planning to let the genie out of the bottle   And there will be no putting that genie back in the bottle   It will wreak destruction in ways that no one  now  can predict or foresee            I don  t know why the Majority Leader doing this   But perhaps what we confront today is an attempt to seize absolute power and unchecked control of all three branches of government   The Republicans already control the Executive branch   A majority of Supreme Court justices were Republican nominees  and that is also true of a majority of judges on our Courts of Appeal and Circuit Courts  indeed  there is a Republican majority on 10 of the 12 Circuit Courts   Republicans have an iron grip on the House of Representatives   And they have a 55 seat majority in the Senate              Only one barrier now stands in the way of the Republican Party seizing absolute control of this government  and that is the right of the minority in the Senate to filibuster   By unleashing the nuclear option  the Republican leadership would crush this last remaining check on its power              The filibuster is a more than 200 year old tradition in the Senate   It has withstood the test of time             Mr  President  I do not believe that the nuclear option reflects the desires or values of the American people   Americans are extremely wary of one party dominance and control    this is a prime reason why so many voters split their ballots   In the election last November  the Republicans won the White House with less than 51 percent of the popular vote   The Republicans have a 52 percent majority in the House and a 55 percent majority in the Senate   But they now want to seize 100 percent control of this government  including the 3rd branch  the judicial branch              That is not healthy for our great country   It is not healthy for our democracy   And I do not believe for one minute that this power grab reflects the wishes of the American people              When it comes to government  there are certain values and principles that the vast majority of Americans share   We prize our system of checks and balances   We respect minority rights and dissent  and we want to ensure that minorities are protected   We understand the danger of majorities acting without check or restraint  running roughshod over those who disagree   As a well known minister recently told me    Democracy exists not just when the majority rules  but when the minority is absolutely safe               Most Americans understand that checks and balances are the key to preserving our liberty            As James Madison wrote    The accumulation of all powers  legislative  executive  and judiciary  in the same hands       may justly be pronounced the very definition of tyranny               But that is exactly the goal of the Republican leadership  today   They seek   the accumulation of all powers  legislative  executive  and judiciary in the same hands       their hands   And this is profoundly dangerous              Mr  President  by resorting to the nuclear option  the majority would break the rules in order to change the rules   Under the rules of the Senate  it takes 67 votes to change the rules  and 60 votes to end debate on a judicial nominee   But by resorting to this parliamentary gimmick  the nuclear option  the majority would change this rule with only 51 votes              The result will be to destroy any check or restraining influence on the power of the majority   This is not the American way   And it certainly is not the wish of the American people             In debate at the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia  James Madison said that the Senate would have two roles    first  to protect the people against their rulers  secondly  to protect the people against the transient impressions into which they themselves might be led               But by attacking the filibuster  the Republican leaders would destroy the ability of the Senate to   protect the people against their rulers      The Senate would lose its capacity to stand up to an out of control majority   Instead  the Senate would be turned into a rubber stamp for the majority  s agenda  just as the House is a rubber stamp for the majority  s agenda now   And that would be a betrayal of the Senate  s traditional role  as envisioned by the Founding Fathers              The Constitution gave Senators six year terms so that they wouldn  t bend to the political passions of the moment   I would remind my colleagues of the famous exchange between Thomas Jefferson and George Washington   On his return from France  Jefferson asked Washington at the breakfast table why he favored the creation of a second chamber  the Senate   Washington replied with a question     Why did you pour that coffee into your saucer      Jefferson said    To cool it      To which Washington said    Even so we pour legislation into the senatorial saucer to cool it               And for two centuries  that is exactly how the Senate has worked   Because of the tradition of free speech and minority rights    specifically  because of the threat of filibuster    Senators have a strong incentive to act with moderation and restraint  to make compromises  to accommodate the legitimate concerns of the minority   That is exactly what the nuclear option would demolish            Mr  President  the majority party in the Senate    whether Democratic or Republican    has always been frustrated by the minority  s use of the filibuster   But I would submit that frustration is the necessary byproduct of an effective system of checks and balances  it is the price we pay to safeguard minority rights            For decades  a determined conservative minority used the filibuster to block civil rights legislation and to deny an up or down vote to a liberal Supreme Court nominee  Abe Fortas   Progressives were extremely frustrated by this exercise of minority rights and minority power              Now it is the Republicans   turn to be frustrated by the filibuster   They are frustrated because they can  t get their way on judges 100 percent of the time   They get their way 95 percent of the time on judicial nominees  and not 100 percent    and they believe that this justifies breaking the rules to get rid of the filibuster   I disagree   I submit that the Republicans   frustration is evidence that the system of checks and balances  here in the Senate  is healthy   It is working exactly as it should            In 1995  I proposed to modify Rule 22 in a way that would have given the minority an incentive to limit the use of the filibuster   However  my proposal bore no resemblance to this nuclear option   First  I did not propose to break the Senate rules   I played strictly by the rules   I pursued my rule change through normal Senate procedures  as a floor amendment   It would have taken the requisite 67 votes to pass on the floor  which is entirely appropriate when changing a time honored Senate rule   By contrast  the nuclear option discards the rules   It would impose the Republicans   radical change with only 51 votes              Ten years ago  I proposed to modify the filibuster rule as a matter of principle   Today  the Republican leadership wants to modify the filibuster as a matter of political expediency  to make it possible to stack the courts with radical judges   They are pursuing unchecked power  the absolute control of all three branches of government   In this context  the filibuster takes on new importance   It is all that remains to check the majority  s quest for absolute power              By the way  I note that 24 current Republican Senators actually voted against my proposed change to the filibuster back in 1995   The distinguished Majority Leader  Mr  Frist  was one of those Republicans opposing any change to the filibuster   Indeed  he voted in the year 2000  just five years ago   to sustain a filibuster of a Clinton nominee  as did many other Republicans              The same Republicans who now say that President Bush  s judicial nominees have a Constitutional right to an up or down vote on the Senate floor denied that alleged right to scores and scores of President Clinton  s judicial nominees  including a distinguished Iowan  Bonnie Campbell   Ms  Campbell    a former Iowa attorney general and respected Justice Department official    was nominated for the 6th U S  Circuit Court  but her nomination was blocked in committee              And let  s be clear   If the issue is denying nominees an up or down vote by the full Senate  there is no practical difference whatsoever between blocking a nominee in committee and or by filibuster on the floor   During the Clinton years  Republicans blocked judicial nominees again and again and again   They were happy to block Clinton nominees in committee  block them by   blue slip     or block them on the floor   It didn  t matter  so long as the nominees were denied an up or down vote on the floor of the Senate              Mr  President  the nuclear option is a flagrant abuse of power   The minority party  the Democrats   will resist it vigorously  within the rules of the Senate   We have a responsibility  an oath of office  to defend our constitutional system of checks and balances   We have a responsibility to defend the Senate  s unique function as the last bastion of minority rights    and as the last check on an abusive  out of control majority              But this should not be the responsibility only of minority party   It should be the responsibility of all Senators who respect the rules and traditions of this body   It should be the duty of all Senators who value our democratic principles  our system of checks and balances  and minority rights   The very nature of the Senate as an institution is at stake   This is a time to look beyond party  to look beyond short term partisan advantage              So I have every hope that there will be enough Senators  Democrats and Republicans alike  to disarm this destructive nuclear option   I have every hope that a critical mass of Senators will be true to the rules and traditions of this body    and that we will act to preserve the integrity and independence of this great institution                               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
