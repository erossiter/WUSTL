 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today announced he will again mandate a Presidential Commission on food safety in the farm bill currently being drafted in the U S  Senate  The Commission was created in the 2002 farm bill  but was never constituted or allowed to meet  Harkins announcement came as the Food Safety and Inspection Service  FSIS  Department of the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  announced that a voluntary recall has significantly expanded today      Topps Meat Company  LLC of Elizabeth  NJ is voluntarily expanding its Sept  25 recall to include a total of approximately 21 7 million pounds of frozen ground beef products because they may be contaminated with E  coli O157 H7  There are currently 25 illnesses under investigation in Connecticut  Florida  Indiana  Maine  New Jersey  New York  Ohio and Pennsylvania       The recent spike in recalls involving meat products should serve as a warning about our meat and poultry food safety system and the oversight of domestic processing  We all want USDA and FDA  the two primary agencies charged with regulating food  to have stronger authority to do a more effective job at keeping our food safe  But we must examine where gaps and weaknesses exist in addition to strengthening other policies that improve our food safety regulations      The government panel announced by the White House earlier this year will review only imported foods  a shortsighted goal given the increasing number of food safety recalls happening with food produced in the United States  but to examine the safety of both imported and domestically produced food  comprehensive recommendations from a Food Safety Commission are needed  The farm bill I am working on in the Senate will include a Presidential Commission to examine the entire system       Apart from the Commission  Senator Harkin has called for moving aggressively with strong and responsible legislation in Congress  Just last week  Harkin introduced The Fresh Produce Safety Act of 2007 to give the FDA the authority to make its current voluntary guidelines on produce mandatory      Several reports by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  and other respected organizations have already given Congress unequivocal recommendations to improve the nations food safety system  A Food Safety Commission  in Harkins view can only add to the overwhelming evidence that USDA  FDA and Congress all must act urgently to ensure the safety of our food supply      For more information on the recall or to learn the symptoms of E  Coli  please visit FSISs website         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
