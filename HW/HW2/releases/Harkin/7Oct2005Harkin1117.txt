        The work conducted at the Rock Island Arsenal has been indispensable to our military and our national defense    said Harkin     It is fully capable of expanding its mission  and I am hopeful the Army recognizes its successful and proven track record   If the Army thinks that these offices should be consolidated  I don  t see why they can  t be moved to the Rock Island Arsenal             Although not directly connected to the 2005 round of Base Realignment and Closures  BRAC   the planned move is related   Once BRAC recommendations are fully approved  the BRAC Implementation Offices of the various military branches will oversee implementation of the realignments and closures   The Army  s BRAC Implementation Office is supported by three field offices located at Fort Monroe  Virginia  Fort McPherson  Georgia  and Rock Island Arsenal in the Quad Cities area   Due to recommended closures of the Fort Monroe and Fort McPherson installations in the 2005 BRAC Commission final report  the Army plans to close the three field offices and relocate them to leased office space in Crystal City  Virginia            However  this proposed move goes against 2005 BRAC Commission recommendations instructing that the military vacate all personnel and units using leased space in Northern Virginia   The Army would also lose many highly trained personnel because more than 50 percent of current employees are unlikely to relocate to the Crystal City area              The Army  s proposal to relocate these field offices to Crystal City defies all logic     said Harkin     I am hopeful that the Army will visit Rock Island Arsenal  realize the effectiveness of the Rock Island BRAC Implementation Office  and in turn make the decision to keep its employees there              Harkin was joined on the letter by Senators Chuck Grassley  R IA   Dick Durbin  D IL   Barack Obama  D IL  and Congressmen Jim Nussle  R IA  and Lane Evans  D IL   A copy of the letter is availible upon request                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
