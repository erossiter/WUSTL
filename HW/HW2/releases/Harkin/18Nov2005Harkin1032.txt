           Section 8 is meant to be a stepping stone for low income Americans to achieve self sufficiency  and we need to get serious about assuring that this goal is realized     said Harkin     It is an abuse of this important program if people who do not really need help are displacing the many that truly do need it   Unfortunately  a big loophole has continued to plague this program and it is past due that we get rid of them                   Harkin  s amendment will take into account parental income to determine Section 8 housing eligibility for students unless they are over 24  married  veterans  or have dependents   This is the same criteria students must meet to be declared   independent    for federal financial aid purposes   Additionally  any financial aid received over tuition will be counted as income   In a recent letter to the U S  Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD   the University of Iowa called for the same changes in HUD  s Section 8 guidelines                  Harkin first introduced this legislation last year  after the Des Moines Register reported that a Section 8 loophole allows students  regardless of financial need  to live free of charge or at a greatly reduced price in government housing   Since learning about this loophole  Harkin has repeatedly called on the Bush Administration to take action against abuses in the public housing system which has allowed student athletes receiving scholarships and housing stipends to displace needy Iowans in an Iowa City public housing facility                  Although HUD issued revised Section guidelines in August 2005  the changes did little to close the loophole   Subsequently  abuses in the system have continued even though the average waiting period is two years for Iowans who truly need Section 8 housing                  Thousands of low income  elderly  and disabled Iowans depend on Section 8 housing to meet their basic needs     said Harkin      I regularly hear from truly needy Iowans desperate for housing and struggling to make ends meet while they wait two years for Section 8  This is just plain wrong  and I am pleased Congress is making changes that will actually work to help those most in need                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
