        The World Food Prize is the most prestigious prize in agricultural research  and gives vital recognition to agricultural achievement in increasing the quality  quantity and availability of food in the world              Some 200 million acres of genetically engineered crops are grown worldwide  and about 60  of that is in the United States   Biotechnology holds the promise of improving yield  disease and pest resistance  nutrition  and creation of beneficial compounds from many different crops   Products like Bt corn and cotton are helping the environment by reducing the need for pesticide spraying   Drought resistant varieties are being developed to improve production in places where food scarcity is a serious problem  like Africa              Biotechnology is a broad topic    though the most controversial aspects are in the area of recombinant DNA  biotech is as old as the first people who used yeast to make their bread rise   Biotechnology is also being used to trace genetic markers in conventionally developed hybrids  speeding up the process of cross breeding   It  s improving the characteristics not just of food  but of fiber and plants grown for industrial production              And even more advances are on the horizon   Just last week  I hosted a Capitol Hill showcase of biobased products manufactured from raw materials like soybeans and corn   Everything from plastic drinking cups and carpet backing to cleaning fluids  to industrial lubricants are being manufactured from renewable sources  and more will be done in the future   Bioengineering is developing new varieties of these commodities that would be particularly suited to these manufacturing processes  making them more efficient  It is even possible to produce pharmaceuticals within a plant   But these commodities not intended for human or animal consumption raises challenging regulatory issues    how to ensure that the genetic manipulation does not spread to conventional crops in the field  or get intermixed with food crops in commerce            With the great promise of biotechnology comes a need for caution and regulation   Testing and strong controls are important to ensure the safety of genetically modified organisms introduced into the food supply and the environment   Recombinant DNA is being regulated under a network of laws originally created for other purposes   This is based on an assumption that bioengineered crops are essentially the same as their conventionally bred precursors   The fundamental question we need to address is whether that assumption is correct    are bioengineered crops properly regulated under existing statutory and regulatory authority  or are there challenges associated with these commodities that would require new authority                Our committee is involved not just in regulating biotechnological products  but also in promoting biotech research   In the 2002 farm bill  we set the goal of doubling agricultural research over the six years that the bill is in effect   Unfortunately we are far below that figure   In 2002 when the current farm bill passed  combined research spending for the two largest ag research programs  the Agriculture Research Service and the Cooperative State Research  Education and Extension Service  was some  2 04 billion   Three years later  it has risen to  2 13 billion in inflation adjusted dollars  an increase of just 4 3    Obviously  only a fraction of the funding to these programs goes directly to biotechnology research             I strongly support research currently being funded by the National Science Foundation to map the corn genome  which promises tremendous benefits when this basic science is available for commercial application   The soybean genome is also being explored  which has become more important now that we desperately need to quickly develop varieties that are tolerant of Asian soybean rust              Again  thank you  Mr  Chairman                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
