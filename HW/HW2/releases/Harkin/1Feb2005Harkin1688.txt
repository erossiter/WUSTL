        There are very real concerns about USDA  s plan to open the Canadian border to live cattle and a broader range of beef products     Harkin said     My colleagues and I are strongly urging USDA and Secretary Johanns to withdraw the rule and address the shortcomings that exist   This issue deserves a proper and comprehensive solution             Harkin  s concerns center around how a country is categorized a   BSE minimal risk region     and USDA  s departure from World Organization of Animal Health  OIE  standards that USDA has purported to follow   The rule appears to be narrowly focused on broadening trade with Canada rather than taking a comprehensive approach which should help reopen trade with all markets that have been closed to the U S  following the December 2003 identification of a BSE positive cow in Washington state   By choosing less protective safeguards than the OIE standards  USDA is creating the risk that other countries with a higher prevalence of BSE than Canada may try to get their products into the U S   Harkin is concerned that imports from Canada under USDA  s current plan would potentially jeopardize U S  efforts to restore beef trade with countries like Japan and South Korea  who are likely to require stricter safeguards than the U S  is requiring of Canada          The letter is included below        February 1  2005               Dear Secretary Johanns                      At your confirmation hearing  several members of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry expressed concern about the final rule published in the January 4  2005  Federal Register  Volume 70  Number 2  regarding measures to define a Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy  BSE  Minimal Risk Region and to allow for the expansion of beef and live cattle trade with Canada                       The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  is to be commended for taking the lead worldwide in efforts to put the Office International des Epizootics    OIE  guidelines for BSE minimal risk into practice   Defining and implementing a global minimal risk standard for safely resuming trade with countries or regions that have experienced cases of BSE is critical to facilitating trade worldwide and restoring lost U S  beef markets                      Unfortunately  USDA  s final rule has serious shortcomings that necessitate the rule  s revision  even if that means a delay in USDA  s March 7th effective date   The rule appears to be narrowly focused upon broadening trade with Canada rather than representing a comprehensive approach to trade under a minimal BSE risk framework   Two elements are critical to efforts to restore and expand beef trade  protecting our domestic food  feed  and livestock supply from BSE  and fostering international agreement on a BSE minimal risk policy  a benefit of which would be facilitating the restoration of safe two way beef trade with key trading partners such as Japan and South Korea                      To protect our domestic food  feed  and livestock supply  we must make certain that all necessary steps are taken to ensure that beef products and live animals imported from countries  such as Canada or Japan  known to have BSE are free of the infective prion  and that our domestic safeguards against BSE are effective   Restoring trade in light of BSE can only be achieved by seeking scientifically based consensus among our trading partners regarding the conditions under which countries or regions can be classified as minimal risk and the products that are safe to trade with them                       Currently  the only international standards that have widespread agreement are those adopted by the OIE   While USDA purports to rely upon OIE standards as a reference in its final rule  the reality is that USDA has chosen weaker standards than the OIE   This raises questions about whether USDA  s standards are adequate to protect our food  feed  and livestock in fact and in the minds of consumers  producers  and our trading partners                      USDA  s final rule  establishes a   minimal risk region    category for BSE that USDA says is modeled after the OIE minimal risk guidelines   The OIE minimal risk guidelines are part of the larger OIE guidance regarding classifying the BSE risk of regions and countries    OIE BSE guidelines are intended to allow for countries or regions that have experienced BSE cases to continue safe trade of beef products and live cattle   The guidelines reflect the consensus of world animal health experts regarding what steps importing countries should take to protect themselves when trading with other countries that have  or may have  BSE                      USDA  s final rule disregards key OIE protections against BSE that serve as linchpins for the guidelines   The OIE guidelines contain three stringent requirements with crucial time sensitive factors   The first is that an effectively enforced ruminant to ruminant feed ban must have been in place for at least eight years   The second is that a requirement for the mandatory reporting and investigation of cattle displaying clinical signs of BSE must have been in place at least seven years   The third is that a well implemented education and surveillance program to assure effective monitoring of BSE must have been in place for at least seven years   These requirements are central to assessing a country or region  s BSE risk  yet USDA  s final rule adopts less stringent measures in all three of these areas   USDA is essentially saying that USDA reserves the right to review a country  s anti BSE measures  ignore the science based OIE standards  and instead create its own standards                      In the final rule  USDA requires a feed ban that is equivalent to measures taken in the U S  but omits the requirement that a feed ban be in place and effectively enforced for eight years   The passage of several years following the effective implementation of a feed ban is required to ensure that younger cattle have not been exposed to potentially contaminated feed                        In the final rule  USDA also does not specify a seven year requirement for mandatory reporting of cattle exhibiting clinical signs of BSE nor does it specify the time requirement or factors for determining the effectiveness of a country  s surveillance system  both of which are required by the OIE     Together  these two OIE measures are intended to ensure it is possible to accurately assess the prevalence of BSE in a country   Without an accurate estimate of prevalence there is no good way to assess a country  s risk of BSE   In disregarding these OIE requirements  USDA is creating the risk that USDA will underestimate the risk of BSE in other countries because of those countries   inadequate reporting and surveillance systems                       Under a strict reading of the OIE guidelines  for instance  Canada could be considered a country at moderate rather than minimal risk of BSE   This classification  of course  would further intensify the BSE mitigation measures the OIE would recommend for Canada to ensure the safety of Canadian export products   In fact  USDA  s departures from the OIE guidelines noted above seem specifically directed at avoiding those OIE criteria that would place Canada in a moderate risk category    The two most significant factors that would place Canada into a moderate risk category are that Canada  s feed ban has not been in place for eight years or proven to be effective  and that the ultimate prevalence of BSE in Canada  s cattle population is not known with confidence                        While Canada has had a ruminant to ruminant feed ban in place for seven years  it appears it was not effective throughout that period as required by the OIE   FDA has raised concerns in issuing import alerts concerning the presence of animal tissue in vegetable feed products that Canadian feed companies have attempted to export to the United States   Additionally  Canada has proposed new regulations that are about to go into effect that would strengthen its feed rules by barring the use of specified risk materials  SRMs  in any animal feed or in fertilizer  suggesting that Canada itself has concerns about the effectiveness of its current feed rules                      As for the prevalence of BSE in Canada  there will be no authoritative estimates of Canadian BSE prevalence until Canada has completed at least one cycle of its enhanced BSE testing program   Based on Canadian testing results so far  it is possible that Canada may ultimately be shown to have a BSE prevalence rate that is  in fact  too high to meet the OIE  s minimum risk standard of two cases per million cattle                      Especially since BSE infected cattle continue to be discovered in Canada  it is important that USDA resolve these issues prior to designating Canada a minimal risk country   USDA has failed to show why it should not adopt the OIE guidelines in full   USDA  s departures from OIE guidelines appear to create an increased risk that BSE infected products or animals will be imported into the United States  whether from Canada or some other country seeking minimal risk status under USDA  s final rule at a later time                      More specifically  we are concerned that in its proposed rule  USDA proposes backing away from the 30 month age limit on beef products and the requirement for segregated processing of cattle over 30 months   A sound public health approach dictates cutting off all possible routes by which material from infected cattle could enter the U S  food and feed supply  USDA  s final rule expresses a belief that removal of SRM  s from cattle over 30 months old during slaughter is sufficient to manage BSE risk   However  given the unknowns about BSE  and the unknowns about the prevalence of BSE in Canada and the effectiveness of Canada  s feed ban  it is not clear that SRM removal is sufficient   Furthermore  Canada has not universally adopted the U S  ban on non ambulatory cattle slaughtered for human consumption                                  Additionally  the U S  Food and Drug Administration  FDA  has not yet taken final action on its proposed expansion of the U S  ruminant feed ban to include plate waste and poultry litter   Taken as a whole  these facts present a pathway through which there is some risk  quite small yet still significant given the consequences of BSE  that BSE could enter the U S  feed supply   Given the uncertainty about whether Canada truly fits the OIE minimum risk profile  USDA should strengthen  not abandon existing measures  such as requiring the removal of SRMs in animals 20 30 months of age that are slaughtered to provide beef for export to the U S   At the very least USDA should continue a ban on beef products from cattle over 30 months old until these concerns are addressed                        Restarting trade among countries that have experienced BSE cases within their borders is no easy task  particularly when it comes to large beef exporting nations such as the United States and Canada   The USDA approach seems to have been to focus almost exclusively on restarting trade with Canada  rather than developing a comprehensive approach to address BSE risk globally and reopen overseas beef markets currently closed to the United States   Currently  the United States seems to be headed towards at least two different sets of minimum risk standards  one for imports into the United States from Canada  and one for exports of products from the United States to Japan    The United States will allow live cattle under 30 months of age and beef from cattle of any age to enter the United States  while Japan  according to news reports  is considering allowing only beef from cattle 20 months and younger to enter Japan   Given that BSE has been found in cattle between the ages of 20 and 30 months  it is not clear why there should be a more protective standard for Japanese consumers than for U S  consumers                        Of great concern is the very real danger that allowing imports of Canadian beef products from cattle over 30 months of age and live cattle under 30 months of age will impair our efforts to achieve resolution of beef trade issues with countries such as Japan   The key to reopening these markets to U S  products is to restore their governments   and consumers   confidence in the safety of our beef by demonstrating the robustness of our safeguards against BSE   To establish guidelines that are demonstrably inferior to internationally recommended guidelines seems likely to frustrate that objective   A far better approach would be to work with our major beef trading partners using the OIE guidelines to develop a common framework for deciding whether a country has minimal risk status  and what products are safe to export and import from that country   Not only would this approach lead to common standards for risk determinations and risk mitigation measures as envisioned by the OIE guidelines  it would minimize the economic dislocations that would likely be caused by USDA  s piecemeal approach to reopening lost beef trade market by market                      In closing  we believe the USDA  s final rule  as currently written  would place United States consumers  producers  beef industry and livestock at unnecessary risk  and urge you to withdraw the rule for revision so that these concerns may be addressed   Thank you                                                                          Sincerely          ________________________________
