        Not only is the Rock Island Arsenal a vital national security asset  it is an economic lifeline to the Quad Cities area     said Harkin     These closures would be a major economic loss to this community   I will work to protect the Rock Island Arsenal and the workforce that makes it so successful                   DOD recommended closing the Civilian Personnel Office  the Defense Finance and Accounting Services  the Installation Management Agency  Depot Maintenance  and the Tank Automotive and Armaments Command at the Rock Island Arsenal            DOD  s recommendation will now be considered by the non partisan BRAC Commission led by former VA Secretary Anthony Principi   The Commission will hold hearings and visit bases to determine the economic impact of base closures and realignments on surrounding communities   The Commission can amend the DOD recommendation before sending the final list to the president by September 8  2005   The president will pass on this list to Congress for approval   Neither Congress nor the president can amend the list    it must be approved or rejected in its entirety                The work conducted at the Rock Island Arsenal has been indispensable to our military and our national defense     said Harkin     I hope that this work will not be disrupted  but will be able to continue in the years to come               The letter to Principi follows                              May 20  2005           The Honorable Anthony J  Principi        Chairman        Base Realignment and Closure Commission        Polk Building   Suites 600 and 625        2521 South Clark Street        Arlington  Virginia 22202           Dear Chairman Principi            As members of the Illinois and Iowa congressional delegations  we want to thank you for your willingness to undertake the task that lies before you  evaluating the Department of Defense  s recommendations for base realignment and closure   We recognize the time and commitment that this task demands of you  your fellow commissioners  and your staff    As a bipartisan  bicameral delegation  we write to you today to express our deep concerns about some of the recommendations that have been presented to you regarding the removal of certain components from Rock Island Arsenal and to request a regional hearing at Rock Island regarding the proposed realignment            Rock Island Arsenal  as you know  is a vital national security asset   Its core manufacturing capabilities have been a critical and reliable source of materiel during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  and we appreciate the Department of Defense  s recognition of the Arsenal factory  s organic capabilities and its recommendation to expand them to include munitions   Rock Island Arsenal  s capabilities and facilities extend even further  however  and we strongly object to the proposed removal of several units from Rock Island Arsenal as proposed in the Department of Defense Base Realignment and Closure list of May 13  2005            The removal of these units  including the Tank automotive and Armaments Command  the Northwest Regional Installation Management Agency  the Defense Finance and Accounting Service  and the North Central Civilian Operations Center  as well as Depot Maintenance positions  fundamentally violates the basic principle of BRAC and represents a major economic loss to the area of over 1200 direct jobs   These units   performance has been outstanding  the North Central Civilian Operations Center  for example  has been rated by the Army  s own metrics as the best operating CPO in the country   The movement of the TACOM RI functions to Detroit and the disruption of this crucial military function at a time of war and its separation from the related work of the Arsenal contradicts the goals of base realignment to promote greater national security            Among the great assets of the Arsenal are its central location and its room to grow  with more than 300 acres and 1 9 million square feet available for additional development  along with its community support and the support of two state governments    Illinois and Iowa            The leading criterion for evaluation under the base closure process is military value   These tenants of the Rock Island Arsenal  the workforce that staffs them  and the facility itself represent tremendous military value which should not be disrupted   We look forward to working with you and your staff as we demonstrate how the Pentagon s analysis deviated substantially from the required selection criteria and to discussing these issues at a regional hearing at Rock Island         Tom Harkin          Richard Durbin          Barack Obama            Charles Grassley           Lane Evans          James Leach       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
