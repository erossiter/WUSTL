      Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today offered an amendment expressing the Sense of the Senate in support of maintaining funding for a federal program responsible for enforcing child support payments   The program is currently in danger of having its budget cut by 40 percent  despite its success in bringing back more than  4 in child support for every  1 spent on enforcement   Harkin was joined in his effort by Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Herb Kohl  D WI  and Evan Bayh  D IN                  Gutting child support enforcement not only hurts Iowa families  it is fiscally irresponsible     Senator Harkin said     It is a proven  effective program that even President Bush has heaped praise on   Child support payments keep thousands of Iowa children out of poverty   When parents don  t live up to their responsibilities  strong enforcement of child supports laws keeps our families self sufficient                   In Iowa  the impact of the proposed cuts would reduce the child support budget by more than 40 percent  causing collections to drop by more than a third in the first year and forcing many custodial parents to rely on government assistance  That s a result that doesn t make sense for our state  for taxpayers  and certainly not for kids   said Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack               Sixty percent of all children living apart from a parent receive child support payments as a result of the federal child support program  and 84 percent of low income children depend on payments secured by the program   If funding for the enforcement program is cut as is currently suggested  children across the country would lose more than  24 billion in support payments over the next ten years  a loss that would likely increase reliance on services provided at taxpayer expense  such as Medicaid  food stamps and subsidized housing               In addition to the savings it represents to taxpayers  the federal child support program helps ensure a stronger start in life for millions of children across the country   Children who receive child support payments do better in school than those who do not receive payments and are more likely to attend college   Child support helps lift more than one million Americans out of poverty each year and makes it more likely for families to find and keep jobs                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
