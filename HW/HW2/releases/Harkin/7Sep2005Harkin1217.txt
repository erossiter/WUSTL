      WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to the director of the Children  s Advertising Review Unit  CARU   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  reiterated serious concerns about whether the food industry can effectively self regulate its advertising to children            Harkin specifically cited a recent television and internet campaign for Kellogg  s Apple Jacks cereal  revolving around a   Bad Apple    who is portrayed as a   scheming  meddling  grouchy  sour    apple villain   The apple is contrasted with a   laid back    and   happy    cinnamon stick  which is said to be responsible for Apple Jacks   sweet taste    Harkin called for an immediate review of this marketing campaign as well as CARU  s justification for allowing it to continue             The message of the Apple Jacks campaign could not be clearer  Kellogg  s is telling children that apples taste bad  and they should avoid eating them     said Harkin     Portraying a healthy fruit such as an apple as a bad  sour and sinister character is blatantly irresponsible   Campaigns like this one only undermine a parent  s best efforts to help their children eat healthy              The campaign  s message comes at a time when  on an average day  45 percent of children eat no fruit  and 20 percent eat less than one serving of vegetables   The campaign also implies that cinnamon is responsible for the sweet taste of the cereal  rather than the added sugar that comprises Apple Jacks number one ingredient   In light of the fact that  in just three decades  obesity rates have doubled for teenagers and tripled for children aged six to 11  these messages are nothing short of irresponsible               It is highly disturbing that CARU has done nothing to address this reckless marketing campaign    said Harkin     As this campaign continues to go unnoticed by CARU  it becomes clear that current industry efforts are woefully inadequate   As we are faced with a growing childhood obesity epidemic  all sectors of society    parents  government  communities and the food industry  must do their part to promote sound nutrition and healthier lifestyles              The food industry spent  10 billion last year alone in direct marketing to children    bombarding kids with ads on television and the internet  in movies and magazines  in schools  and through promotional materials such as kids clubs  toys and books   Food companies are increasingly aggressive in marketing unhealthy food to our children through a wide variety of innovative strategies    cartoon tie ins    advergaming     and cross promotions    with a goal of encouraging children to consume unhealthy products             Harkin has introduced legislation that would finally restore the FTC authority to regulate marketing directed at children  This long overdue measure would give the FTC the power to restrict the advertising of junk food to children under age 18  The bill would also address the onslaught of junk food marketing to children in schools  giving the U S Secretary of Agriculture the authority to prohibit all junk food advertising in schools where parents are not present            Harkin is the Senate leader in federal efforts to combat the obesity epidemic by promoting wellness and healthy habits among adults and children    In addition to his efforts on food marketing  Harkin is the author of the Harkin Fresh Fruit and Vegetable Program    now operating in eight states and on three Indian reservations    which provides free  fresh fruits and vegetables to children in schools   He has also proposed legislation to give communities funding for more bike paths and sidewalks and tax credits for employers who implement wellness programs for their employees          A copy of the letter is available upon request                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
