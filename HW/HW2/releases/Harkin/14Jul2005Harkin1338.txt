     As most of you know  I have been highly critical of the advertising industry  s marketing of junk food to children   That said  I appreciated the opportunity  several months ago  to speak to the major advertising associations   And I am eager to maintain a constructive dialogue  Many in the industry have spoken frankly to me about the need for change   And they agree with me that the issue is not what is in the best interest of Tom Harkin  or the advertising industry  or the food industry   There is one issue   What is in the best interest of children    period           I hope that this is the starting point    the premise    for our deliberations  here  today and tomorrow   We are not here to go through the motions  or for purposes of window dressing and public relations   We are here to make a difference for the children of this country  who face a clear and present danger from an epidemic of overweight and obesity          My counsel to you is to seize the day    to do what is right for our children   I urge you to use this workshop to formulate and implement a truly independent  rigorous system of self regulation for food advertising to children            If you move ahead boldly with such a system  I will applaud you  parents will applaud you  and the American public will applaud you   But if you fail to do so  you will have missed a tremendous opportunity   The result  I predict  will be a public backlash           According to Yale University polling  in 2001  57 percent of Americans favored restricting children  s food advertising   In 2004  73 percent of Americans favored such restrictions   The backlash is building steam   And it  s not just that more and more parents favor restrictions on food advertising   More to the point  they are ready to vote with their pocketbooks         So the choice is in your hands   And the stakes could not be higher for the work you are doing here over the next two days         Let me be clear  half measures are not acceptable   The hour is too late   Children are at risk   The time to act is now           I understand that the Grocery Manufacturers of America is set to unveil new  supposedly tougher proposals for voluntary restrictions   Based on a story in yesterday  s Wall Street Journal  GMA will offer many perfectly fine ideas   For instance  it would limit product placements in TV shows  and the use of licensed characters in ads and food packaging   I  m all for it           I have not seen details of the GMA proposals  so I will withhold any final judgment   But based on what I have read so far  there appears to be no meaningful enforcement mechanism       no truly independent body with the will and the power to crack down on offenders           If CARU is the model  that is a non starter   CARU  frankly  has become a poster child for how not to conduct self regulation   Time and again  it has shown itself to be a captive of the industry   It has no real independence   No sanction authority   No teeth           The current situation is like a game with a rule book  but no real referee   CARU is a tiny group tasked with oversight of a multibillion dollar industry   To me  the deck seems a bit stacked           And the proof is in the pudding   Look at the deluge of junk food advertising aimed at kids that we see today   CARU has given the green light to all of it           My understanding is that GMA apparently will propose to give CARU more resources and staff  and to make its process more transparent   But a bigger  more transparent CARU means nothing if it lacks true independence  and if it lacks teeth          I respect GMA  s efforts   But I believe that we must be much more ambitious  especially when it comes to enforcement   For my part  I believe that a meaningful system of self regulation should include at least four elements          First  it must encourage  invite  and utilize stakeholder input   And by stakeholder  I do not mean industry stakeholders alone   I also include parents  public health experts  child development experts  and others   These people need to play a meaningful role in creating the system of self regulation    and they need to have ongoing opportunities for input and participation           Second  there must be a clear action plan both for implementing the self regulation system and for ensuring compliance   The system needs independent monitors   It needs to promulgate enforceable regulations and requirements   And it needs an independent oversight body with teeth    with the power to punish bad actors that violate the agreed to standards         Third  a serious system of self regulation must look at the cumulative effect of food advertisements directed at children   Currently  CARU looks at each advertisement in isolation  determining whether that ad meets certain standards   We need to consider the cumulative effect on children of seeing many thousands of ads each year            Fourth  a system of self regulation must have purview over the whole range of vehicles by which food and beverages are marketed to children    not just television and print media   Marketing has grown incredibly sophisticated and diverse   It has spread to the Internet  to products placements and tie ins  to adver gaming  and much more   So an effective system of self regulation cannot be static   It must adapt and evolve to keep up with rapid changes in advertising and marketing           I am interested in carefully reviewing GMA  s proposals    and any others put forward by the food industry   And I am keenly interested in proposals that you will hammer out today and tomorrow   But let me be clear  my evaluation will be based on the parameters I have set forth here         The stakes are high for your industries   But the stakes are far higher for our children   Poor nutrition and childhood obesity are not just   problems       they represent a public health crisis of the first order   Twenty five percent of children between the ages of 5 and 10 already show the early warning signs of heart disease   We are seeing more and more cases of adult onset diabetes in children  something that used to be extraordinarily rare           As a Senator I cannot stand idly by as obesity related health care costs explode federal and state budgets  and wreak havoc on corporate and family budgets   As New York Times columnist Paul Krugman recently put it     Fat is a fiscal issue             Why are children consuming more calories and more foods high in sugar  fat  and salt   We don  t need a Harvard study to tell us the answer   Kids are eating more junk food for at least three reasons   One  because it tastes good   Two  because it is available everywhere    including in schools   And three  because it is being aggressively advertised and marketed            Some in the food industry insist that there is no evidence that food marketing is responsible for kids eating junk food and consuming more calories   But corporate America doesn  t spend  12 billion a year on advertising aimed at children because it likes to waste money             No  corporate America spends  12 billion because that advertising works brilliantly        because it persuades children to demand    to the point of throwing temper tantrums  if necessary    a regular diet of candy  cookies  sugary cereal  sodas  and all manner of junk food   No wonder parents are so exasperated            Young kids are totally vulnerable and exploitable   Studies show that children do not understand that commercials are designed to sell products  because they don  t yet possess the cognitive ability to evaluate advertising   It  s not until age 7 or 8 that children even begin to distinguish between the show they are watching and the commercials that are trying to sell them something   So it is absurd to say that young kids have a personal responsibility to resist the lures of junk food advertising   They can  t    and they don  t     with disastrous consequences         No question  many parents need to make better choices for their children   They need to say no   But there are practical limits on what we can expect   It is just not realistic to think that most parents are going to deny their children access to TV on Saturday morning and after school   And  for goodness sake  why do we have a situation where conscientious parents have to protect their children from the ads on Saturday morning TV           Food advertising should not be undermining the lessons that responsible parents are teaching their children   It should not be undermining parents   authority         If you hear impatience in my voice  I am expressing what I hear from parents all across this country   They come up to me in airports or shopping malls   They tell me that they are angry   They feel that their parental authority is being undermined by the sheer pervasiveness of junk food advertising and marketing to their kids           A senior brand manager at Heinz was quoted in the Wall Street Journal   He said     All of our advertising is targeted to kids  You want that nag factor so that seven year old Sarah is nagging mom in the grocery store to buy funky purple  We  re not sure mom would reach out for it on her own            Is it any wonder why a backlash is brewing   A Wall Street Journal poll in February found that 68 percent of American adults believe that advertising to kids is a major contributor to the rising tide poor nutrition and overweight among American children   In the same poll  a clear majority said government should do more to regulate food ads directed at children         I believe strongly that when private interests conflict with the public good  government has a responsibility to act   And where corporate responsibility is absent  federal regulation of food marketing directed at children will be necessary           As you know  I have a bill that would take us in that direction   But it is still my hope that real restraint will come from within the food and advertising industries   Many stakeholders in the food industry have  in fact  shown a willingness to look at their own marketing practices and to make changes in order to protect children  s health   I have publicly applauded this   At the same time  I have also been deeply disappointed by actions of others in the food and advertising industries who actively    aggressively    target impressionable children with junk food advertising           My friends  you have a big job ahead of you today and tomorrow   But there is no question in my mind that  in this room  you have the knowledge  expertise  skills  and will to succeed   Likewise    based on my talks with all the major groups represented here    I am hopeful that there is a sincere will and determination to put the interests of children first  and to hammer out a meaningful  effective approach to self regulation           In particular  I am convinced that the food and advertising industries    with all your resourcefulness and creativity    can be a powerful force for change       and for doing good           So I wish you all the best   I will be following your deliberations today very closely   And I look forward to working closely with all of you as we go forward            Originating
