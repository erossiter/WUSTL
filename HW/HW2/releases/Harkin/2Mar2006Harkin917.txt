      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today released the following statement on the reauthorization of the Patriot Act            Last year  I supported a Senate bill to reauthorize the Patriot Act   That bill made modest  but important changes to the original law to restore limited judicial oversight to the secret surveillance powers granted to the government   Judicial review is a critical restraint on unchecked power and an important check on the secret eavesdropping  secret searches of residences and secret subpoenas that the government may use   And  in light of recent revelations that the Bush Administration violated federal law in conducting secret wiretap operations on American citizens  judicial review is more important than ever   Unfortunately  most of these provisions were stripped from the final bill the Senate passed today              The legislation did include the Combat Meth Act  a national anti meth law that fights this drug throughout the country by restricting the sale of pseudoephedrine  but also protects stronger state laws like Iowa   While I would have preferred that the national law be as strong as Iowa  s  I am pleased that we will now be able to launch a comprehensive  national assault on this destructive drug   We have already seen a dramatic reduction in meth labs in Iowa  and I believe we will see similar results nationwide              I have and continue to fully support the Combat Meth Act   But I cannot support reauthorization of the Patriot Act without additional protections for civil liberties   Security and liberty are not an either or choice  but rather the fundamental principals by which our democracy thrives   This bill fails to strike the appropriate balance                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
