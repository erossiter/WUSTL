      WASHINGTON  D C     Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Chuck Grassley  R IA  today released a Government Accountability Office  GAO  report on the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting  LMPR  program confirming the need for legislative reforms that would require USDA to improve the operation of LMPR   GAO found that many meat packers did not report data to USDA correctly and that in some instances packers failed to file price reports altogether   Such gaps in reporting can affect the accuracy of price reports provided to livestock producers and result in incorrect market information for buyers and sellers of livestock  Grassley and Harkin will now work with the House to implement the suggestions made in the report and address other livestock producer concerns                 I requested this report because producers are concerned USDA is not doing enough to make sure price reports are accurate and timely     Harkin said     GAO found that many times these price reports are inaccurate and that USDA is not letting the public know when it finds late or incorrect information                  The Government Accountability Office report shows that we had some serious flaws in the Mandatory Price Reporting law that needed to be changed     Grassley said     I hope now we can take these suggestions and make improvements to the law that will ensure family farmers get a fair price                The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act requires packers  processors  and importers to provide critical price  contracting  supply and demand information to USDA  which uses the information to create price reports for livestock producers              The Senate unanimously passed legislation introduced by Grassley and Harkin in September extending the Livestock Price Reporting Act for one year in order to allow producers and other interested parties to review the GAO report before extending the law for a longer period   Because the House of Representatives did not take up this one year extension bill for consideration  the Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting program expired on September 30   Instead  the House passed a five year extension  but the Senate has been unwilling to pass the longer term extension until the problems in the price reporting system identified and investigated by GAO are adequately addressed   The program has been operating as a voluntary program since that time              The report revealed the following                GAO observed lengthy lag times by USDA in correcting problems when packers failed to report or provided incorrect information   GAO evaluated 844 audits and found that packers incorrectly reported or failed to report required information 64 percent of the time   On many of these audits it showed that USDA  on average  was taking roughly 85 days to ensure a packer made needed corrections to the information                Coordination between the Agricultural Marketing Service  AMS  and the Grain Inspection  and Packers and Stockyards Administration  GIPSA  has been limited  hindering GIPSA  s ability to monitor and correct trends of anti competitive behavior that could negatively affect price reports   This is in part due to the lack of legal authority for GIPSA to review company specific information   GIPSA is better equipped to review longstanding patterns of anti competitive behavior whereas AMS   goal is primarily to ensure price information is collected and quickly turned around for daily and weekly price reports                USDA has been adjusting or excluding packer data but not making this practice known to livestock producers and the public               Since the enactment of the reporting program in 1999  USDA has yet to collect any penalties from packers for violations of program requirements even in cases of longstanding violations               Packers are not consistently and reliably reporting data to USDA within deadlines specified by the LMPR Act               When USDA audits reveal violations of the LMPR Act  USDA has not been providing this information to the public  which undermines the overall transparency of the program              In November  eight farm and livestock organizations  including the Iowa Pork Producers Association  urged that Congress move forward with a five year extension of the federal price reporting law only if the GAO findings and other needed changes are adopted in the new legislation                The Livestock Mandatory Price Reporting Act needs modifications to improve the accuracy and transparency of price reporting for the benefit of livestock producers     Harkin said     It  s critical Congress acts to incorporate these needed changes without delay                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
