                      The momentum continues  The overwhelming majority of Americans   and their members of Congress   want to take the shackles off of federal researchers   They want to move forward with some of the most exciting and promising research of modern times                          Tonight  I am appealing to President Bush to reexamine the substance of this bill  and to reconsider his threat to veto it                             S  5 is a different bill than the one he vetoed last year   It now includes the text of last year s Specter Santorum bill  which promotes alternative ways of deriving stem cells   The President endorsed Specter Santorum last year   He can make it law  now  by signing S 5                             The President has made it clear that there is one moral line he will not cross on this issue   Federal taxpayer dollars should not be used to destroy embryos   We have expressly crafted S  5 to ensure that it does not lift the existing federal ban on using federal funding to destroy embryos   We have fully addressed the President s No  1 concern   Indeed  S  5 would impose strict ethical requirements on embryonic stem cell research that do not now exist                            There are some 400 000 leftover  unwanted embryos in fertility clinics across America   They are being discarded daily as medical waste   All we are saying is  instead of throwing away those leftover embryos  let s allow couples to donate a few of them  if they wish  to create stem cell lines that could cure diseases and save lives   This is the choice that is truly moral and truly respectful of human life                           So  this evening  I appeal to the compassionate conservative in President Bush   I urge him to reconsider this bill   and sign it   Unleash America s scientists   And give hope to millions of suffering people who are desperate for new therapies and cures                             However  I want to be very clear   If the President does veto this bill  and if we fall short of overriding his veto  then we will be back   Momentum is building   One way or another  we are going to lift these arbitrary restrictions this year                                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
