         At this morning  s Senate Agriculture Committee hearing  we heard a lot of support for increasing our commitment to conservation on working lands   We heard from an Iowan  Jim Andrew  who is enrolled in the highest tier of the Conservation Security Program   He urged Congress to help Iowans and farmers across the nation more easily practice sound stewardship                  I congratulate CSP  s new enrollees  but more Iowans deserve CSP contracts   USDA  s announcement is proof positive that Congressional caps and cuts on CSP funding are hurting farmers and ranchers across the country   To improve Iowa  s environment  every Iowa farmer that practices sound stewardship should have had an opportunity to apply and be accepted into CSP   Unless Washington reverses course and funds the CSP  this fundamentally unfair approach will continue                 Harkin authored provisions establishing the Conservation Security Program  CSP  in the 2002 farm bill   When created  Harkin envisioned a program that rewarded farmers and ranchers nationwide for their sound stewardship on working lands while establishing incentives for them to further improve air quality  water quality reduce soil erosion and increase habitat for wildlife   Since that time  Republican Congressional cuts and caps  supported by the Bush Administration  have reduced CSP funding by more than  4 billion dollars   USDA has implemented the program piecemeal by select watersheds  leaving many farmers ineligible to even apply for CSP contracts                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
