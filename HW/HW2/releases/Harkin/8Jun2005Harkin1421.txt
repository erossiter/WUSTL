        For six years  taxpayer dollars have been invested in pursuing the public  s case against big tobacco  And yesterday    at the 11th hour  it appears that a political order was issued from on high in an attempt to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory   The Justice Department put the tobacco companies   financial interest ahead of the health interests of hundreds of thousands of Americans hooked on this deadly drug            The facts are clear  convincing and simple   Big tobacco companies spent decades  and billions of dollars  misleading the American people in order to hook them on a deadly habit that kills 400 000 Americans each and every year   Today  they must face the consequences            I hope that Judge Gladys Kessler  who has spent five years reviewing all the evidence of illegal conduct by the tobacco industry  will choose to ignore this political move by the administration and instead recognize the immense harm the industry inflicted on the public  and order damages appropriate with that conduct             The administration needs to explain their sudden change in course   Today I am calling for an investigation into and therefore I am calling for an Inspector General investigation into possible political interference in this litigation   This case should be based on the facts and the expert testimony of its own witness  not political payback                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
