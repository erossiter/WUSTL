 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  tonight applauded the reauthorization of the Childrens Health Insurance Program  CHIP  by the U S  Senate  and called on the President to re evaluate his decision to deny health insurance to American children   CHIP provides basic health insurance to more than six million children whose parents cannot afford private insurance  but who do not qualify for Medicaid  Iowas version of the program  Healthy and Well Kids in Iowa  HAWK I   provides health insurance to nearly 50 000 children  The legislation reauthorizing the program  which Harkin supported  would cover nearly 11 000 more Iowa children over the next five years   The bill passed the Senate  by an overwhelming  bipartisan vote of 67 29  and passed the House of Representatives by a large margin earlier this week  It will now go to the President  who has threatened to veto it   The President must now decide whether he wants to move our country forward and extend health insurance to more children  or cut kids from the rolls and condemn them to a childhood without checkups or necessary medical treatment   that is  until they show up in an emergency room with an acute condition  said Harkin  How can we expect a child to achieve in school if she is struggling with untreated asthma  or if she cant see the blackboard or hear the teacher speak  What part of leave no child behind does this President not understand   The legislation that passed the Senate tonight enjoys broad support from nearly every governor  and according to a recent poll  nine in 10 Americans including 83 percent of self identified Republicans   The money proposed over five years for improving the lives of American kids is equal to four months of U S  spending in Iraq  said Harkin  But this is not about money  It is about our shared priorities as a nation  In a humane society  no child should go uninsured This is a case of a President and an administration that have lost their moral compass   As chair of the Senates education and health appropriations subcommittee  Harkin included a provision in another bill to maintain CHIP funding at current levels through November 16  2007  Harkin has also worked with Iowa officials to ensure that no child will be cut from the Hawk I program during that time period       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
