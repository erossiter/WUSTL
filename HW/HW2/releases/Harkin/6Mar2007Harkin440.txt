                         One thing I have learned in my years in public service is that if you want answers to the big problems in our society  you have to ask the people who work with those problems every day   When dealing with the meth crisis in my state  the first people I want to talk to about it are the police chiefs and sheriffs  because they are the ones that have to think every day about how a meth distributor might think  where they hide and how they operate   When I want to know how education policy is affecting children in the classrooms  I talk to teachers and parents                                  So it only stands to reason that if we want to know where the holes in our TSA screening processes are  then we ought to talk to the Transportation Security Officers  or TSOs   These are the people who are responsible for screening airline passengers   A good way for the screeners to band together and share their collective thoughts on how to improve safety in our airports is by allowing them to collectively bargain   I realize that some members of the Senate have anti union sentiments   They think that if folks come together and try to negotiate for better pay and working conditions that we will not be able to expect consistently high results                                 Before we created the Department of Homeland Security though  we routinely heard horror stories about non federal airport screeners making near minimum wage and working in terrible conditions   This resulted in a high turnover and a lack of experience and dedication to our shared goal of keeping our airways safe   So we created a federal workforce   We knew that the pay and benefits that the federal government provides can attract top notch workers   I feel strongly that federal TSOs are the first people to care about safety in our airports                                       Many federal workers who are critical to protecting our national security such as border patrol agents  customs agents  and immigration enforcement officers are all allowed to collectively bargain while ably serving our nation s security interests   We re simply saying that TSOs should have the same rights and responsibilities as other federal workers performing similar functions who also are allowed to collectively bargain but not to strike or disclose information that would somehow jeopardize national security                                   One of the most critical protections that the DeMint amendment would have stripped is protection from retaliation against whistleblowers   Whistleblowers are some of our most valuable assets in identifying and eliminating systemic fraud   I  for one  want to see a vigilant federal workforce ready to shed as much sunlight as possible on any practices at any agency that are in contradiction to our goal of promoting the national defense   I do not see a need to explicitly limit TSO whistleblower authority when it already has the ability to expressly prevent TSOs from divulging information that jeopardizes national security   Stifling that activity can and will do more harm than good                                     The truth is that we all want more security   This is precisely why we want TSOs to have fair pay and benefits  and a channel for their concerns for everyone s safety   We need seasoned personnel with reasonable work hours and benefits   A good way to keep good people on the job is by giving them a voice at work   What we fought for is a security enhancement  not detraction                                  There is nothing in the collective bargaining process that would make TSOs less capable of serving the public   We have nothing to lose and everything to gain by giving them collective bargaining rights and the clear ability to communicate their concerns about screening protocols with the TSA                                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
