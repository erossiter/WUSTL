   WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today joined 9 colleagues to re introduce the   Roadless Area Conservation Act    to protect national forests and grassland from road construction and ultimately logging   The roadless rule was originally implemented in 2001 to ensure important national forest areas remained off limits to logging  drilling and mining except in emergency cases  The U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  however recently changed the rule to allow over 58 million acres   about a third of the National Forest system  s total acreage   to be open to development and logging   Harkin is the Ranking Democrat on the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee which shares jurisdiction over the National Forest system            The original Roadless Rule was created with extensive input and support from the public and scientific community     Harkin said     The administration disregarded this public input at the behest of big business   We need to restore the fair balance between conservation and resource extraction in our national forests             The bill introduced will protect sensitive forest lands while maintaining flexibility for economic utilitzation and limited road construction to help maintain resource protection and public safety   Currently  state governors must petition the Forest Service if they wish to have roadless protections reinstated on National Forest lands            These national forests are critical not only to maintain wildlife habitat and clean drinking water but are treasures for fishing  camping and hiking     Harkin said   This legislation is needed to preserve them for future generations                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
