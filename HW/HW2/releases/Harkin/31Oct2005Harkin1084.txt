       Last week  at the behest of the right wing  the White House withdrew Harriet Miers nomination to the Supreme Court   Today  the President nominated a replacement designed to pacify these most extreme elements in his party                Today  the President eliminated any doubt that he is completely beholden to the far right   This small group of individuals does not represent the majority of Americans   It should be unsettling to all of us that they have such control over this President  and this White House   It should be unsettling that such a small segment of the population has enough sway to determine who is nominated for a lifetime seat on Supreme Court                Fortunately  the Senate will also have its say in who replaces Sandra Day O  Connor   It is time for some tough questioning   The Senate has an obligation to determine whether this nominee will uphold the rule of law and protect the Constitutional rights and freedoms of all Americans or will instead use this lifetime appointment to impose a right wing ideology on the nation                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
