      Today  everyone knows that the sooner we reduce our dependence on foreign oil  the better  Many folks are aware that they can reduce the amount of foreign oil they consume by driving cars that run on E85 or biodiesel  A lesser known but equally exciting fact is that Iowa is leading the way in producing a host of new bio based products    including everything from clothing to plastics to building materials    that can replace petroleum based products  These new bio based products will help reduce our dependence on foreign oil and strengthen our rural economy             To give a boost to the emerging bio economy  I asked the U S  Department of Defense  DOD  to hold an exhibition showcasing bio based products that can be purchased and used by government agencies   The event  held at the Pentagon early this September  was titled   Bio based Products   Enhancing DOD  s Mission  Protecting the Environment                The showcase was a huge success   Dozens of companies from around the country    including seven from Iowa    came to display their products and make their pitch to government officials   The Iowa based companies who came manufacture products such as office work station panels  hand sanitizers and soaps  industrial cleaners  lubricants and greases  One company is even making socks from corn                Bear in mind that the DOD is the federal government  s largest consumer of goods and services   And the federal government is the nation  s largest consumer overall  purchasing approximately  300 billion each year   It is not just wishful thinking to believe the DOD will buy more and more bio based products in the future   It is the law                   In 2002  when I authored the farm bill  s first ever energy section  I included a section establishing a bio based products purchasing preference   This provision requires federal agencies   including the DOD  Environmental Protection Agency  Departments of Energy and Interior  etc      to purchase bio based products listed by USDA as long as they are reasonable in price  performance and availability             To date  hundreds of bio based products have been identified by USDA for purchase by federal agencies   Soon the number of these products will swell into the thousands   In addition  USDA is developing a special bio based label to help identify and promote these products   This will give the bio based industry a shot in the arm by differentiating these products from their petroleum counterparts and allowing consumers to make informed choices                By increasing our reliance on the corn and soybean fields of the Midwest  and decreasing our dependence on the oil fields of the Middle East  we will do four things   We will improve America  s energy security   We will boost our rural economy   We will create a cleaner environment   And we will put downward pressure on gasoline and diesel prices at the pump                   From what I saw at the Pentagon this September  America  s bio based economy is well on its way to helping us accomplish these goals               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
