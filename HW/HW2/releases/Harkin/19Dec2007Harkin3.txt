 WASHINGTON  DC   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  released the following statement today regarding Senate passage of the Medicare  Medicaid and SCHIP Extension Act of 2007  The bill extends the State Childrens Health Insurance Program  referred to as the Healthy and Well Kids In Iowa  HAWK I  program in Iowa  through March 31  2009  The HAWK I program provides health insurance to nearly 50 000 Iowa children       The bill also contains a number of provisions designed to ensure seniors continue to have access to the healthcare they deserve      This bill protects some of the most vital healthcare programs that Iowans depend upon  said Harkin  We have delivered on our promises to Medicare and Medicaid patients  as well as Iowa kids  The HAWK I program provides basic health coverage to the children of working families  My top priority was to ensure that Iowa got the funding to ensure that no Iowa children would be dropped from the rolls  The bill the Senate approved does just that      Of course  this legislation is more limited than legislation we twice sent to the President  to reauthorize and expand the program  only to be met with his veto pen  When this temporary extension expires in 2009  I am hopeful that a new Administration will work with us to craft legislation to cover every uninsured child  When children have access to preventive and primary care  they are less likely to end up in the emergency room  they thrive in the classroom  and most importantly  they have the opportunity to live up to their full potential          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
