         WASHINGTON  D C    Sen  Tom Harkin  D IA   Chairman of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry  today released the following statement on a budget resolution agreed to by Senate and House negotiators and its impact on the 2007 farm bill   The full Senate and House are each expected to pass the fiscal year 2008 budget resolution this week             The budget resolution provides up to  20 billion in a deficit neutral reserve fund for the farm bill   This will give us considerable new funding provided we find offsets in the budget   That is a challenge given the tight budget situation   Nevertheless  I can justify additional spending to address our farm  food and energy needs and will continue working to secure additional funding as we move forward             Our nation expects legislation with an ambitious  bold food and agriculture policy for all Americans   one that lays a foundation of better opportunities in agriculture and rural communities   not only for the period of the next farm bill  but for future generations   Though we face a much different fiscal situation than we did when writing the 2002 bill  we will work hard to balance all of the needs and craft a good  sound bill                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
