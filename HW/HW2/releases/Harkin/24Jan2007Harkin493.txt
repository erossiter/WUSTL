      WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a longtime advocate of increasing domestic renewable fuels and chairman of the Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee  released the following statement in response to President Bush  s State of the Union Speech            I appreciate President Bush  s offer to work closely with the new Democratic Congress and help move this country forward   However  the coming months will be the true test of his commitment    the President must follow through on his many promises  not just leave them behind in a speech            It appears I stand arm in arm with the President on the need to wean America off its dependence on foreign oil    Much of what he said tonight echoes legislation Senator Dick Lugar and I introduced the first day of the 110th Congress   It  s amazing to hear a Texas oilman say that America  s energy future lies in the corn and soybean fields of Iowa and the Midwest  not the oil fields of the Middle East  But this is just one example of where the rubber needs to meet the road            The President has called for increased energy security in the past  His actions  however  have not met his rhetoric  We  ll know if he  s serious this time if he includes appropriate funding in his budget request next month   I hope he will            We also heard about plans to expand health care coverage  That fact that nearly 47 million Americans go without health care insurance is a moral shame  Yet the President  s plan would do little to expand access to coverage and instead puts the cost burden onto working Americans whose wallets are already stretched too thin  This is another step in the wrong direction            On Iraq  the President gave us more of the same  He continues to promote his troop escalation plan while ignoring the generals on the ground  the Iraqi leaders and the American people            The Joint Chiefs of Staff unanimously opposed sending in more troops  as did the generals on the ground in Iraq   The Iraq Study Group said that there cannot be a military solution to the chaos in Iraq   In poll after poll  the American people overwhelmingly oppose this new escalation   Yet  the President stubbornly sticks to his plan            The President has tried to portray this latest escalation in Iraq as   a new way forward     But it  s not new  and it  s not a way forward   All the president has done has put lip stick on a pig  The only true way forward in Iraq is to set a timetable for redeployment of U S  forces                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
