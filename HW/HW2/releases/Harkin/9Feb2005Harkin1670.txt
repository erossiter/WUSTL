        I had a very productive discussion with Minister Mitchell about Canadian efforts to combat BSE  ranging from surveillance to reporting to feed regulations     Harkin said     I assured him that we want to resume trade between our two countries  but serious questions still remain about Canadian  as well as  U S  anti BSE efforts   Until I am confident USDA is taking every reasonable precaution to protect our food supply and cattle industry  I will continue to urge USDA to withdraw and revise its rule             Harkin is concerned about the criteria by which a country is categorized a   BSE minimal risk region     and USDA  s departure from World Organization of Animal Health  OIE  standards USDA has previously purported to follow   The rule appears to be narrowly focused on broadening trade with Canada rather than adopting a comprehensive approach aimed at reopening trade with all markets that have been closed to the United States following the December 2003 identification of a BSE positive cow in Washington state   By choosing less protective safeguards than the OIE standards  USDA is creating the risk that other countries with a higher prevalence of BSE than Canada may try to get their products into the United States   Harkin is concerned that imports from Canada under USDA  s current plan would potentially jeopardize our efforts to restore beef trade with countries like Japan and South Korea  who are likely to require stricter safeguards than the United States is requiring of Canada          Following the meeting  Harkin expressed his appreciation for the attention Minister Mitchell is giving to BSE in Canada and pledged to continue his efforts to protect consumers and the cattle industry            I appreciate Minister Mitchell taking time to meet with me and discuss the concerns I have     Harkin said     This is a very serious issue to both our countries and Minister Mitchell has reassured me of Canada  s commitment to containing the problem   I look forward to continuing our relationship and working to put a system in place in North America that effectively ensures the safety and confidence of consumers and protects cattle herds and the beef industry                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
