        I want to work with the president to strengthen Social Security  but I want to do it right     Harkin said     There is no excuse to rush into a plan that will cut benefits for America  s seniors  adds trillions to the debt  and does nothing to strengthen the program   That is unacceptable and the American people are rejecting that approach             President Bush  s privatization commission has proposed creating private Social Security accounts that would cut benefits by one third or more  even for those who choose not to invest in privatized accounts   Workers could invest two thirds of their Social Security contribution in stocks and bonds  but those returns could not make up for the deep benefit cuts and would be subject to the whims of Wall Street              Even those who invest as wisely as Warren Buffet would see returns far lower than the current guaranteed Social Security benefit     Harkin said          Even many supporters of the president  s plan acknowledge that private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   In fact  to fund the private accounts  the government would have to borrow almost  5 trillion dollars over the first 20 years from foreign countries like China and Japan    making Social Security  s financial problems much worse and even further from being solved            We must be responsible and take reasonable  moderate steps to strengthen Social Security for future generations     Harkin said     Millions of Iowa seniors  Americans with disabilities and others who rely on Social Security are depending on Congress and the president to protect this program    I hope the president will work with Congress to do just that                                                       A copy of the letter  2 pages  follows                          March 3  2005         The President      The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW      Washington  DC          Dear Mr  President                      We write in the hope that we can achieve a bipartisan agreement to strengthen Social Security for the long term and enhance the retirement security of all Americans                      Soon after your reelection  you made clear that your Administration  s top priority is to move toward the privatization of Social Security   Your proposal would cut Social Security  s funding by diverting payroll taxes into privatized accounts  which would weaken the program and force deep cuts in benefits   Your Administration also acknowledged that the proposal would require borrowing trillions of dollars  much of which we know would come from foreign countries like China and Japan          Democrats in the Congress believe this approach is unacceptable  and it appears that most Americans agree with us   Funding privatized accounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program  s long term problems worse  but many believe it represents a first step toward undermining the program  s fundamental goals   Therefore  so long as this proposal is on the table  we believe it will be impossible to establish the kind of cooperative  bipartisan process we need to truly address the challenges facing the program many decades in the future          We were encouraged that Treasury Secretary John Snow suggested that you might be willing to abandon your privatization proposal and move instead to an alternative approach in which investment accounts would be established entirely separate and apart from Social Security   As you know  many Democrats  including President Bill Clinton  have advocated just such an approach  with benefits targeted to working and middle class families who need help the most   So long as such accounts remain entirely independent from Social Security and do not put the program  s guaranteed benefits at risk in any way  we believe they deserve serious consideration as part of a broader effort to promote retirement security          While Secretary Snow  s suggestion was initially encouraging  subsequent reports indicate that you remain committed to your privatization plan and his public comments were little more than a tactical maneuver   According to a story in today  s Washington Post    White House officials are privately telling Republicans that Bush is opposed to the idea  of accounts outside of Social Security   but does not want to say so because it would appear he is not willing to compromise                         The President      March 3  2005      Page 2            Given the conflicting and ambiguous reports on such a critical issue  we urge you to publicly and unambiguously announce that you reject privatized accounts funded with       Social Security dollars or otherwise linked to the provision of guaranteed Social Security benefits   Such a statement would eliminate a serious obstacle to the kind of bipartisan process that Democrats are seeking to deal with Social Security  s long term challenges and to improve the retirement security of all Americans            Thank you for your consideration of our views
