        The federal budget cannot be balanced on the backs of farm families and rural communities  and the president should not try to     Harkin said     This budget is like a big snowball rolling downhill and aimed directly at the progress we made in the recent farm and child nutrition legislation   The president and his people surely could not have thought this through   If acted on by Congress  the president  s budget numbers will take away funds promised for farm  rural development  conservation  renewable energy  nutrition and other critical needs             Harkin said he supports tighter payment limits and fought for similar policies in the 2002 farm bill  but believes any savings from payment limits should be reinvested in other agriculture and rural initiatives  Such policies  however  faced adamant opposition from the House conferees during farm bill negotiations            If history is our guide  the president  s payment limit proposal may very well be nothing more than a decoy to divert attention from more devastating cuts to family farmers and rural Americans     Harkin said    And given the make up of this Congress  it is unlikely payment limits will actually be enacted  forcing Congress to find the budget savings from other initiatives such as conservation  rural development  and nutrition      The president  s proposed budget savings from tighter payment limitations are much less than the five percent across the board cut to mandatory commodity programs  including loan benefits and direct payments to all farmers          Federal funding for agriculture and rural programs has been cut back substantially in recent years through annual appropriations bills   Those funding cuts have been especially harmful to rural development  conservation  agricultural research and farm based renewable energy initiatives   The president  s fiscal 2006 budget  if adopted  would lead to a much larger set of funding cuts    most likely involving two successive rounds of action  first in the agriculture committees and then by the appropriations committees            The president  s budget is off base and unwarranted   When we wrote the 2002 farm bill  we had a budget and we stayed within that budget     Harkin said     President Bush praised that bill and signed it into law  yet each of his subsequent budgets has sought to reopen the books and undermine the promise it held    and this most recent budget is a new low                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
