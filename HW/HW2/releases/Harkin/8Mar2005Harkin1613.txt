                 Thank you  Mr  Chairman   In the four years since passage of the Commodity Futures Modernization Act  CFMA   the options and derivatives industry has seen record volumes and unprecedented competition leading to new products and lower costs for users of these markets                            I would like to welcome Chairman Sharon Brown Hruska  Commissioner Walt Lukken  and our two newest Commissioners  Mike Dunn and Fred Hatfield   Mike is from Keokuk  Iowa and has a long record of service to agriculture   I am delighted to see him at the Commission   I look forward to working with all of you on reauthorization of the Commodity Exchange Act                          I commend you  Chairman Brown Hruska  for the CFTC  s work in implementing and enforcing the CFMA   The CFMA addressed some critical issues facing the futures and derivatives industry in the 1990s   Congress sought to improve the competitive footing of the U S  futures and derivatives industry by reducing regulatory burdens  clarifying the legal status of over the counter derivatives transactions  and reforming the Shad Johnson accord to allow trading of securities futures                          The CFMA has been largely successful in achieving these objectives  However  there are a few areas  noted in several witnesses   testimony and my own observations  meriting special consideration as we begin working on reauthorization of the Commodity Exchange Act  CEA  this year                          This country has been rocked by several serious financial scandals the past few years   These scandals have shown that perhaps no segment of the futures and derivative markets are safe from manipulation   Additionally  with the large expansion in futures and derivatives volume  we need to consider whether the CFTC needs additional tools to keep tabs on the over the counter trade in derivatives   Given the impact large pension funds  banks  and other financial institutions have on our economy  we should consider whether the CFTC should have the authority to ask for information from those institutions even regarding OTC activities  if it might help prevent a financial calamity down the road                          I continue to be particularly concerned whether CFTC has adequate authority to oversee energy markets   Energy swaps and derivatives have a far more direct linkage to consumer  s pocket books than other exempt commodities such as metals   The 46 energy enforcement cases settled by the CFTC so far for over  300 million in fines demonstrates that the CFTC has the authority to punish wrongdoing  and that the Commission is using that authority   Still  we need to make sure that Federal agencies have the authority and tools needed to detect and prevent these abuses from occurring in the first place  especially given the fallout they can have for consumers                          We need to review the Commission  s anti fraud and anti manipulation authorities  as well as its enforcement resources  to make sure they are up to the challenge of regulating existing markets   Particularly  I believe we need to consider whether anti fraud and anti manipulation authorities should be applied to principal to principal trades  such as those that take place on many electronic markets  as well as to brokered trades   It seems to me that all similar markets should be held to the same standards of transparency and openness              I thank you again  Mr  Chairman             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
