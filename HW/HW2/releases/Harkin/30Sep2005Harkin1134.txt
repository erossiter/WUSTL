        These cuts to essential programs for needy families and children  including victims of Katrina  are callous and ill advised     said Harkin     This couldn  t possibly come at a worse time and we must do something to fix it             These cuts would eliminate or disrupt essential services for some 6 5 million low income people  including nearly two million children   In Iowa  nearly 150 000 people would be impacted   Smaller states like Alaska  Delaware  Hawaii  Idaho  Maine  Montana  Nevada  New Hampshire  North Dakota  Utah  Vermont and Wyoning could face a cut up to 75 percent   Currently  in the Gulf Coast region  these agencies are providing services to some 171 000 victims of Hurricane Katrina   Under the cuts a majority of rural outreach centers would be closed  denying entire rural communities access to services   About 1 3 million rural Americans in poverty will lose services          Many one stop neighborhood centers in suburban and urban areas would also be shut down    CSBG also funds support recruitment  training  and support of local volunteers   Communities will soon lose 21 million volunteer hours  valued at over  100 million  Typical volunteer programs in a community action agency are  transportation  for elderly  medical needs  recreation for the disabled   home ownership counseling  tax preparation assistance  literacy instruction  chore services for the homebound elderly  and mentoring and counseling for at risk youth          Community action agencies often administer the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program    LIHEAP    which helps low income families to pay their home heating bills     Nearly 80 000 Iowans depend on LIHEAP              With forecasters predicting an unusually cold winter  and with home heating costs expected to rise by 50 to 70 percent  I can  t imagine a worse time for Congress to be slashing the Community Service Block Grant     said Harkin     And  LIHEAP is just one of the vital services that that the poor  elderly  kids and the disabled rely on                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
