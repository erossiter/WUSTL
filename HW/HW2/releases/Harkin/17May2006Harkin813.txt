   WASHINGTON  DC    At a Senate Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry Committee hearing  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called on the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  to make its broadband loan program more available for rural communities and businesses   Harkin authored provisions in the 2002 farm bill establishing a broadband loan program for rural communities   But  the Department has put in place excessive hurdles preventing small towns and mainstreet business from receiving loans for broadband   In Iowa for example  only three loans have been distributed since 2002 to help rural communities receive high speed broadband technology            Many have not even bothered applying for the loans because USDA has made it so burdensome     said Harkin     It  s critical that rural areas have access to broadband technology to keep pace with the rest of the country   USDA needs to embrace its proud tradition of doing what  s necessary to ensure rural American is not left behind in technological advances             There are a number of concerns about USDA implementation of the broadband loan program  Currently  USDA imposes excessive cash on hand requirements that work to defeat the purpose of the program  This makes many smaller businesses and rural communities effectively ineligible for the loans  This cash requirement means that only firms or communities who already have enough capital to purchase broadband technology can qualify for USDA loans  while those who cannot afford this without assistance are automatically denied because they lack money  USDA broadband loans also have an unnecessarily burdensome application process which is costly  time consuming and complicated  Harkin has expressed these concerns with USDA  s broadband loan program to Rural Utilities Service Administrator James Andrew              I urge Mr  Andrew to issue new federal rules that will resolve these ongoing problems with the rural broadband application process     Harkin said     Right now  the application process is simply unfair                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
