        I am urging USDA and Secretary Johanns to withdraw and rework its rule for opening the Canadian border to live cattle and additional types of beef products     Harkin said     I am concerned this rule was specially written to reopen the border with Canada and too little thought was given to its details and implications   Our first concern must be to assure the safety of our food supply and the health of our U S  cattle industry             Harkin  s concerns center around how a country is categorized a   BSE minimal risk region     and USDA  s departure from World Organization of Animal Health  OIE   standards they have purported to follow   The rule appears to be narrowly focused on broadening trade with Canada rather than a comprehensive approach aimed at reopening trade with all markets that have been closed to the U S  following the December 2003 identification of a BSE positive cow in Washington state   By choosing less protective safeguards than the OIE standards suggest  USDA is creating the risk that other countries with a higher prevalence of BSE than Canada may try and get their products into the U S   Harkin is concerned that imports from Canada under USDA  s current plan would potentially jeopardize U S  efforts to restore beef trade with countries like Japan and South Korea  who are likely to require stricter safeguards than the U S  is requiring of Canada            This is a very serious issue whose proper resolution is absolutely critical     Harkin said     USDA needs to work with all our major trading partners to come up with an acceptable framework for determining which countries or regions can be classified as minimum risk  and what products are safe to export and import from them             Harkin continued    I will be writing Secretary Johanns prior to the February 3 hearing outlining in detail my concerns   I hope we can have an honest and frank discussion during that hearing that will result in a solid  safe  well thought out rule on cattle and beef trade with countries known to have BSE   Until that time  I believe Secretary Johanns and USDA should withdraw the rule                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
