 Washington  D C   Senators Tom Harkin  D Iowa  and Orrin G  Hatch  R Utah  today welcomed the long sought publication of good manufacturing practices  GMP  regulations for dietary supplements  Hatch and Harkin were the principal authors of the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act  DSHEA  of 1994  which gave the FDA the authority to write GMP guidelines specific to supplements  and they have been pushing the FDA to publish GMPs for more than a decade   I cant believe this day is finally here  Hatch said  GMPs are crucial because they assure the public that the products they are buying live up to their labels  Thats why we included GMPs in DSHEA  It took a long time to publish these GMPs  and theyre more than 800 pages  So Im going to review them very carefully to make certain they are good regulations  But every indication leads me to believe the Administration was very sensitive to the impact the GMPs might have on the supplement industry  especially smaller companies   I am pleased that the Food and Drug Administration has  at long last  issued GMPs for dietary supplements  said Harkin  More than 150 million Americans regularly take dietary supplements  I look forward to reading this rule in its entirety  but it is my hope that these GMPs will increase consumers confidence that all dietary supplement manufacturers are adhering to the highest standards of quality  In the absence of FDA action  many companies have taken steps to adopt GMPs on their own  and I have applauded those steps  I hope that todays announcement can build on that work       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
