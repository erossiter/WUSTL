        DNA evidence can be an extremely useful tool for Iowa  s law enforcement and criminal justice systems     said Harkin     This money will help Iowa  s criminal justice system realize the full potential of DNA technology in solving old cases  preventing new crimes  and exonerating the innocent            The DOJ grant will fund training and salary for additional DNA technicians for the state crime lab   The lab is responsible for processing all forensic evidence including the newly strengthened convicted offender DNA database   In June of this year  Iowa strengthened its law requiring that all convicted felons be entered into the national DNA database   Since the law  s passage only three months ago  DNA testing has yielded three   hits     meaning that samples entered from recently convicted felons matched DNA evidence obtained in unrelated  unsolved crimes  In Virginia  which has required DNA collection from all convicted felons since 1998  the database has yielded 2 909 hits  helping to identify suspects in 270 murders  543 sex crimes and 1 760 burglaries           Previously  Iowa only required that those convicted of the most serious felonies be DNA tested  The new staff will help the state lab meet the challenge of processing an estimated 12 500 newly convicted felons a year   up from 800 a year  as well as for addressing the 30 000 currently incarcerated felons           The National Institute of Justice  s DNA Capacity Enhancement Program  which funded this grant  seeks to improve the infrastructure and analysis capacity of state and local crime labs conducting DNA testing   The goal is to ensure these labs can efficiently and cost effectively process DNA samples  preventing future DNA backlogs and capitalizing on the potential of DNA technology                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
