 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  released the following statement today regarding the Bush Administrations release of a report stating that the Iraqi government has failed to meet any key political and economic benchmarks   The Bush Administrations report today laying out the Iraq governments failure to make the sacrifices necessary for political reconciliation clearly shows that the Administrations current stay the course strategy is not working  It is unacceptable and irresponsible to continue to ask our brave men and women to put their lives on the line when the Iraqi government cannot do the most basic work necessary to bring their country together   The current situation in Iraq is dire  our troops are embedded in a civil war between factions who refuse to work together politically  Our military is stretched to the limit  with many troops being sent to Iraq again and again without adequate rest between deployments   Senate Democrats are working to set forth a new  smarter strategy that acknowledges the reality of this untenable situation and redeploys our troops  But we cannot do this alone  We need our Republican colleagues to work with us to forge a smarter path forward in Iraq   Unfortunately  Senate Republicans continue to obstruct our attempts to do this  This week  I joined Senate Democrats in fighting to protect our troops by co sponsoring an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill that requires active duty troops receive as much time at home  recuperating and retraining  as they spend deployed in combat  For reasons that escape me  Senate Republicans filibustered and killed this proposal   The Democrats and the American people have made their choice  to chart a new direction  I sincerely hope that as my Republican colleagues read todays report  they too will decide that they can no longer support the civil war in Iraq and will work with us to lay forth a smarter  more focused campaign against the terrorists who are a real threat to our country        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
