        Sioux City leaders have serious concerns about the Postal Service  s analysis and its anticipated decision to consolidate     said Harkin     It  s clear that the USPS has failed to consider the consolidation  s true costs and its impact on the community   That is why I strongly urge this decision be put on hold until the Postal Service can get its act together             Specifically  Harkin  Grassley and King called for the proposed consolidation to be put on hold until the Postal Service develops a rational methodology for making judgments concerning the consolidation  until a solid business analysis is both conducted and fully vetted with the community  and until the Postal Service  s Inspector General can comprehensively review the methodology  analysis  and business case used to justify this proposed consolidation            Critical cost factors such as the relocation of employees  the disposal and or re allocation of physical plant assets and infrastructure in Sioux City  the potential increased transportation strains  and anticipated additional costs for land and construction at the proposed facility location in Sioux Falls do not appear to be seriously considered or integrated into the Postal Service  s analysis   The Postal Service has also failed to incorporate the Siouxland community  s feedback despite multiple meetings and correspondence over recent months   Concerns also remain that consolidation will not improve the Postal Service  s efficiency and quality of delivery service          Harkin has been working to increase community input and transparency in the USPS proposed consolidation plans   At Harkin  s request  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  is conducting a follow up study to its 2005 report on USPS strategy for realigning and consolidating its mail processing operations   Months later after GAO  s original report  USPS appears to have made little progress in implementing the recommendations to develop a clear  transparent  and consistently applied process that includes stakeholder consultation and communication and includes specific management criteria and performance measures   Instead  they are proceeding with close to 50 Area Mail Processing  AMP  studies on consolidation that provide no opportunity for local communities  business people and other stakeholders to either provide input or hear the Postal Service  s reasoning behind their decision making at any stage of the process        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
