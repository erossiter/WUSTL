        The Iowa education leaders I met with today were very clear  the President  s proposed cuts to the TRIO program will drastically hurt their ability to serve at risk middle and high school students     Harkin said     The President says it is time to tighten our belts and make difficult choices  Unfortunately  he seems to think it  s more important to cut initiatives like academic counseling for Iowa kids than it is to roll back his tax giveaway bonanza for the wealthiest Americans             The federal TRIO programs help low income and first generation college students plan  prepare and succeed in college   There are five separate programs within TRIO  and the two programs targeted for cuts  Talent Search and Upward Bound  generally work with middle and high school students   Upward Bound provides intensive academic instruction and counseling support to high schools students   Students receive tutoring and counseling support throughout the regular school year and participate in a six week residential summer program   Educational Talent Search works with students from ages 11 to 27   The program begins working with students as early as 6th grade to provide academic and counseling support to encourage them to graduate from high school and attend college             Iowa has ten Education Talent Search Programs  serving 8 775 students  and 18 Upward Bound Programs serving 1 222 students          Throughout the president  s budget  nearly a third of the initiatives targeted for elimination are education related   Other Iowa specific cuts include a  14 1 million cut for career and technical education  a  2 4 million cut in education technology   3 4 million cut for safe and drug free schools  a  1 million cut for family literacy programs and a  1 1 million cut for comprehensive school reform              Unfortunately  these cuts in education funding do not exactly come as a surprise   At this point  the Administration  s priorities are all too clear   The President  s budget insists on two new tax cuts next year    worth a whopping  146 billion over 10 years   Yet this same budget proposes to cut funding for education   To put it mildly  these are very misplaced priorities             A list of schools that faces cuts follows  2 pages           Central Iowa                                                                                             School  City   Program  Funding   Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Central College       Pella   Talent Search   353 235       Upward Bound   566 467   1130   919 702   DMACC       Ankeny   Upward Bound   279 496   55   279 496   Iowa State       Ames   Talent Search   327 508       Upward Bound   323 818   1050   651 326   Simpson       Indianola   Upward Bound   234 624   50   234 624              Eastern Iowa      School  City   Program  Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Coe College       Cedar Rapids   Upward Bound  75   345 116   St Ambrose       Davenport   Upward Bound  67   341 588   U of Iowa       Iowa City   Upward Bound  99   531 050              Northeast Iowa                                                                                                    School  City   Program  funding   Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Luther College       Decorah   Talent Search   250 261       Upward Bound   545 774   774   796 035   NE Iowa CC       Calmar   Upward Bound   220 000   50   220 000   NE Iowa CC       Peosta   Upward Bound   220 000   50   220 000   UNI       Cedar Falls   Talent Search   393 075       Upward Bound   365 636       UB Math Science   288 383   1433   1 047 094              Northwest Iowa      School  City   Program  funding   Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Briar Cliff       Sioux City   Talent Search   286 988       Upward Bound   380 344   1075   667 332   Iowa Lakes CC       Estherville   Talent Search   343 754       Upward Bound   328 818   889   672 572   WITCC       Sioux City   Talent Search   230 135       Upward Bound   234 624   850   464 759           Southeast Iowa                                                                                                                 School  City   Program  Funding   Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Indian Hills CC       Ottumwa   Upward Bound   220 000   50   220 000   Southeastern CC       Burlington   Talent Search   204 000       Upward Bound  234 624   650   438 624           Southern Iowa      School  City   Program  Funding   Students Impacted  Funding Lost   Graceland Univ       Lamoni   Talent Search   321 845       Upward Bound   234 624   850   556 469   SWCC       Creston   Talent Search   204 000   800   204 000                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
