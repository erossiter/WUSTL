 WASHINGTON  D C   As part of his ongoing effort to support Iowa s first responders  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  announced today that Delhi Volunteer Fire Department and First Responders received  49 842 from the U S  Department of Homeland Security s Assistance to Firefighters Grant  AFG  Program  Harkin is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee   Iowa firefighters are brave public servants who help protect our families when disaster strikes  Harkin said  These grants will provide Delhi firefighters and first responders with the resources they need to effectively respond to emergencies and keep Iowans safe   The AFG Program helps Iowa communities purchase firefighting equipment  improve facilities  and implement health and wellness programs  Fire departments can submit proposals to receive funds for new fire trucks  hoses  protective equipment  rescue vehicles  and training for emergency personnel   Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments  At least 55 percent of the programs funding must go to fire departments that use volunteer firefighters  This means that towns like Delhi are not competing against cities like Des Moines  Additionally  the program allows smaller communities to contribute less in local funding  In today s economy  this makes it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
