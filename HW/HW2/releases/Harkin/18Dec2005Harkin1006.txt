        The agriculture budget cutting measure being pushed by the Bush administration and Republican Congress was fundamentally misguided and unfair from the outset   I have opposed from the beginning cutting the agriculture budget at a time of record energy costs and slumping commodity prices   This entire exercise imposes sacrifice from Americans least able to afford it in an attempt to camouflage far larger Republican tax breaks for the wealthy   It is the utmost in hypocrisy to use   budget reconciliation   as a means actually to worsen the federal budget deficit  as is being done here              The Republican Congress has inflicted virtually all of the real cuts in agriculture on farm conservation  rural economic development  value added agriculture  renewable energy and agricultural research initiatives   These are all forward looking initiatives we wrote into and funded through the 2002 farm bill   Remarkably  absolutely nothing was done in these budget cuts to limit the size of payments going to America  s very largest farming operations and the excessive concentration of farm program dollars to these select few Americans            These budget cuts fly in the face of what the Bush administration and Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns have been telling farmers and rural communities around the country   that the future of farm policy lies in greater focus on conservation  renewable energy  rural economic development and agricultural research   Ironically  at the very same time the Bush administration and this Republican Congress are cutting funds to these forward looking initiatives  U S  negotiators in Hong Kong have been pushing for cuts to U S  farm income and commodity programs   Taken together  Republicans here in Washington appear to have nothing to offer for the future of U S  agriculture other than cutting back all forms of assistance to U S  farmers and rural communities                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
