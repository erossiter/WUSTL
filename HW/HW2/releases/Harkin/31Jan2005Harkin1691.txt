     To understand this success  let  s be clear what Social Security is not   It is not welfare  only those who work and pay Social Security taxes are eligible for benefits   Likewise  Social Security is not an investment program  for that  we have IRAs  401 k   s  Individual Development Accounts  and a vast range of private saving and investment accounts             So what is Social Security   Simply put  it is an insurance program   It was established in 1935 to provide benefits to workers and their family members upon retirement  disability  or death   In fact  the original name for Social Security was the Old Age  Survivors  and Disability Insurance program  OASDI             Social Security is an insurance program that embraces almost the entire American family   It is the highest expression of our connection and commitment to each other   It reflects our core values  our compassion  and our decency         our bedrock belief that no senior  no orphan  no survivor  and no person with disability    no member of our American family    will be left behind                        We see this in our own families   In good times  in normal times  the individuals in the family are independent  self sustaining  going their separate ways  building a good future   But in times of misfortune  financial crisis  old age  or death  that  s when the individuals in the family pull together   They come together    sacrificing if necessary    to give aid and comfort to the family member in need             As Americans  we all respect the virtues and benefits of the free marketplace   We believe in individual responsibility   However  we also know that sometimes markets fail  and sometimes people fall on hard times through no fault of their own   That is exactly why we have the Social Security insurance program   To provide a basic safety net for the elderly  for survivors  and for Americans with disabilities             Mr  President  Social Security has deep meaning for me and my family                 And don  t think that things have changed all that much since the 1940s   Even today  one out of five American seniors still rely on Social Security for 100 percent of their income   For two thirds of our seniors  Social Security supplies the majority of their income            In fact  according to a publication of the Social Security Administration  Income of the Population 55 or Older  2000   in the year 2000  nearly 48 percent of America  s seniors would fall below the poverty line if they did not receive Social Security   In other words  take away Social Security  and we are right back to where we were in the 1940s  with nearly half of America  s seniors living in poverty             The good news is that Social Security is financially strong  and will remain strong for decades to come   This year  Social Security will run a huge surplus  in the neighborhood of  150 billion   The cumulative Social Security surplus now stands in excess of  1 6 trillion   Every one of those surplus dollars is invested in rock solid Treasury securities backed by the full faith and credit of the United States government             What  s more  according to the 2004 Social Security trustees report  in the year 2003  surpluses in the Social Security trust fund earned an average interest rate of 6 percent    By contrast  over the five years ending with 2004  money invested in a stock fund tracking the Standard   Poor  s 500 would have lost an average of 2 4 percent each year            That said  Social Security does face a challenge nearly a half century from now   According to the Congressional Budget Office  in the year 2052  the huge surpluses in the Social Security trust fund will have been used up   Payroll taxes will continue to roll in  allowing 73 percent of scheduled benefits to be paid indefinitely   But  clearly  the 27 percent shortfall will be a challenge             And for that reason  I welcome the current discussion of ways to address this future challenge   In particular  I am interested in hearing the details of the President  s plan in his State of the Union speech on Wednesday   Reportedly  he will propose a partial privatization of Social Security  financed by up to  2 trillion in new borrowing over the next decade   According to other reports  he plans to follow the advice of his 2001 commission on privatization  which recommended that future Social Security benefits be cut by 40 to 50 percent             With good reason  Senators from both parties have been very skeptical and critical of these approaches   As even conservatives acknowledge  private accounts have nothing to do with ensuring the long term financial health of Social Security   One person even described private accounts as   a solution in search of a problem      What  s more  the proposal to cut benefits by 40 to 50 percent is not just draconian  it is utterly unnecessary   It feeds the suspicion that the President  s real aim is not to save Social Security but to drastically shrink it    as the first step toward eventually ending it            A Lifeline for People with Disabilities                      Mr  President  as we look ahead to a full fledged debate about the future of Social Security  I have one overriding concern   I am concerned that those who want to privatize Social Security have almost totally ignored the fate of some 6 2 million Americans with disabilities       people who depend    in many cases desperately depend    on Social Security disability benefits             President Bush says that he has no current plans to cut disability benefits   And I hope that remains the case   Unfortunately  the President seems not to understand that  in our Social Security system  both the retirement and disability programs are closely linked  and they use the same formula for determining benefits   In an interview with the Washington Post published on January 16  the President acknowledged that    Frankly  our discussions in terms of reform have not centered on the survivor disability aspect of Social Security      Meanwhile  the President  s commission on privatizing Social Security devoted a mere two pages out of its 256 page report to the fate people with disabilities             Many advocates of privatization simply assume that disability benefits will be treated the same as retirement benefits   Certainly  this was the working assumption of the President  s commission   The Associated Press reported on January 18 that  in the commission report   disability benefits get reduced along with retiree benefits  in some cases up to 46 percent   The cuts were used to make the plan  s finances add up in the report                Let me quote from the privatization commission  s report   It states    in the absence of fully developed proposals  the calculations carried out for the commission and included in the report assume that defined benefits will be changed in similar ways for  both the retirement and disability  programs     page 149            The commission says it is not necessarily recommending this   But the proof is in the numbers   All the commission  s calculations assume that disability benefits will be cut the same as retirement benefits   Without those cuts  the commission  s numbers simply don  t add up           There is at least one other proposal on the table for dealing with the 6 2 million Americans who receive disability benefits   Some advocates of privatization have casually suggested that these people be thrown into the Supplemental Security Income program               Mr  President  the cavalierness       the callousness        of these proposals is deeply disturbing   Let me state what ought to be obvious to Senators on both sides of this discussion   It is outrageous to treat Americans with disabilities as a mere afterthought in such a momentous debate   And it is unacceptable to leave them as collateral damage when the smoke clears and the casualties are counted           Here  s the crux of the problem   The President  s commission has proposed dramatic cuts in Social Security by calculating future benefits based on changes in the consumer price index   This approach poses huge risks to recipients of Social Security disability benefits    and also to widows and orphans who receive survivor benefits             Bear in mind that Social Security currently uses basically the same benefit formula for all categories of beneficiaries    So if retirement benefits are slashed by nearly half  disability benefits will also be slashed in the same across the board fashion    with catastrophic consequences           Everyone appreciates that the Social Security payroll tax purchases a very good defined benefit upon retirement   But what is not fully appreciated is that the payroll tax also purchases an excellent disability insurance policy    one that would be difficult if not impossible to purchase on the private market              Here are the facts   For the average wage earner with a family  Social Security benefits are equivalent to a  322 000 life insurance policy or a  233 000 disability insurance policy   I had my staff look into how much it would cost to replace those benefits on the private market   The cost of the life insurance  alone  could be substantial   For instance  the cost of a modest  100 000 term life insurance policy varies from  140 a year for a healthy 25 year old to  3 815 a year for a not so healthy 45 year old             The more shocking news is that you can t accurately price a policy that would make up for Social Security disability   The vast majority of currently available policies are group policies   Right now  the only people who buy personal disability insurance are members of small self selected groups of people who are at a lower risk of becoming disabled   And  these group policies are not stand alone policies  they are supplemental policies   They replace a percentage of income beyond what Social Security Disability pays             So any change that lowers Social Security disability payments would actually raise the price of private disability insurance  because there would be a larger gap to make up between what people get from Social Security and a minimum income replacement level             More to the points  this kind of policy wouldn t be available to just anyone   For instance  according to Patricia Owen  the former Associate Commissioner of the Social Security Administration    Private insurance generally will not cover the blue collar occupations   And long term disability insurance for workers is the least offered   With Social Security disability insurance  all are covered   I would guess that the price of private long term disability insurance would be at least 4 to 5 times higher than the percent of FICA that goes to disability insurance              Mr  President  I am concerned that in the rush to privatize Social Security    just as we saw in the rush to war in Iraq    the Bush administration is failing to consider unintended consequences   And just as innocent civilians in Iraq have paid a heavy price for this failure  Americans with disabilities are at risk under the privatization plans now being discussed             In Iraq  President Bush said there were weapons of mass destruction   Now  with Social Security  the President says  in effect  there is a   crisis of mass destruction      He says there is a crisis that justifies slashing benefits by up to 50 percent   Well  there were no weapons of mass destruction in Iraq  and there is no crisis in Social Security   But we will have mass destruction in Social Security if the President and his fellow privatizers get their way            In recent weeks  my office has been flooded with letters and e mails from Iowans who are deeply worried by reports they are reading in the media   These people have read about the President  s 2001 privatization commission  they know that its calculations assume that disability benefits will be slashed   They also have heard the proposal that people with disabilities be thrown into the Supplemental Security Income program   As you can imagine  this is deeply disturbing to people who rely on Social Security not just for their income  but for their dignity           In fact  Social Security disability insurance has been literally a lifesaver for countless Americans   I think of Steven Cook  a former truck driver from Iowa City   After a lifetime of working hard and playing by the rules  he found himself unemployed  sleeping in his car  and diagnosed with renal failure   After qualifying for Social Security disability insurance and corollary health benefits  he was able to receive a kidney transplant and to put his life back together            Mr  President  I do not want to add to the worries and fears of people with disabilities    like Steven Cook    who rely on Social Security   But I have an obligation to raise these issues now  before the President casts his plan in concrete             As I said  the calculations and projections of the President  s commission on privatization assume that disability benefits will be cut along with retirement benefits   The commission recommended   that the President address the DI program through a separate policy development process     p  149    That recommendation was made three full years ago   But  to my knowledge  there has been no such effort to develop any thoughtful policy to safeguard the disability insurance program             So  in the absence of reassurance from the Bush administration  Americans with disabilities    and also widows and other survivors    have been left to assume the worst  that their benefits are going to be slashed in a draconian fashion   This is not compassionate   And it is not acceptable             Mr  President  I have come to the floor  today    at the outset of the privatization debate here in the Senate    to raise these profound issues   It  s time to talk about the fate of the millions Americans with disabilities who rely on Social Security benefits   Is the administration developing a plan to protect these people    who are among our most vulnerable and needy   Does the administration intend to take its cue from the privatization commission  and propose steep cuts in disability benefits             America needs answers   More than six million Americans who rely on disability benefits need answers    as we all do  after all  any one of us could become disabled and face a dire need of this safety net             So as the President finalizes his Social Security proposals  I urge him to consider what I have said today    If the plan is to privatize Social Security on the backs of our most vulnerable people  that is a profound mistake   It is a non starter   Such a plan would be unacceptable to most members of this body  including many on the other side of the aisle   I urge the President and his advisors to give very  very careful consideration to this issue             Let this be a bipartisan  bedrock principle of Social Security reform  the benefits of people with disabilities must be sacrosanct              Mr  President  I will have a lot more to say about Social Security on future occasions   But I appreciate this opportunity to highlight an issue that  so far  has been neglected in the Social Security debate   the impact on Americans who receive disability benefits   For now  I yield the floor                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
