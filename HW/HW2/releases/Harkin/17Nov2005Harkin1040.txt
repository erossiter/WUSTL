           Three years ago  we put COOL in the farm bill because consumers demanded more information about the foods they eat and producers wanted to add value by informing consumers of the origin of food products     Harkin said     Unfortunately  large food processors have sought to kill COOL from the beginning and the House and Bush Administration are determined to delay it indefinitely                   Country of origin labeling for fish and shellfish has already been implemented and is currently on products in grocery stores                  It is a sad state of affairs that we have to push a measure simply to implement what we already adopted in the farm bill three years ago  COOL should never have been delayed  especially when that was done behind closed doors and out of the public  s view     said Harkin     Re writing the farm bill in the appropriations process has gotten out of hand    and blocking COOL is a glaring example of this                                     Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
