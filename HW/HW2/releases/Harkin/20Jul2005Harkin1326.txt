        Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for calling this hearing to review agricultural biosecurity and our nation  s efforts to address the threat of agroterrorism   Because the food and agriculture sector is such a vital part of our national economy  outbreaks of animal or plant diseases from either unintentional or intentional causes have the potential to cause tremendous economic damage and disruption   Some diseases    avian influenza  for example    are capable of infecting humans and causing very serious illness and loss of life   A less tangible  but potentially even more unsettling  threat is rooted in the fact that Americans have for so long enjoyed an abundant and economical food supply   Serious shortages of food or disruptions in supplies    or incidents of intentional contamination    would strike at the heart of the food security we take for granted   Terrorists could hardly dream of a more effective way to cause chaos or even outright panic in America            Today  s hearing will help us better understand what the government departments and agencies responsible for biosecurity and guarding against agroterrorism have accomplished    and what must still be done   It would be hard to overstate the magnitude or gravity of these responsibilities   Most important is doing all we can to prevent and head off these threats   But we also have to be prepared to respond quickly to an incident  to contain and limit disease outbreaks or other threats  and then to recover and repair the damage   We must carefully allocate resources and close gaps   I want to thank Dr  James Roth  from Iowa State University  s Center for Food Security and Public Health  and all of the other witnesses for joining us to testify today            As our witness list reflects  several departments and agencies share responsibility for preventing and responding to biosecurity and agroterrorism threats   I commend them for the steps they have taken   However  we have a very long way to go to address these biosecurity and agroterrorism threats adequately   For example  in March of this year the Government Accountability Office found that while progress has been made  significant and troubling gaps and shortcomings persist   We are playing a catch up game with no time to waste                We also need stronger support and tools for first responders in agriculture  more research and training of professionals  better rapid diagnostic tests and adequate supplies of ready to use vaccines   Stronger coordination and communication among all of the federal departments and agencies and with state and local authorities is critical   In particular  there are too many unresolved issues in the division of responsibility and allocation of resources between USDA and the Department of Homeland Security    notably in protecting our borders   Iowa is among the 11 states that formed the Multi State Partnership for Security in Agriculture to help make up for federal shortcomings   This partnership deserves more funding  support and cooperation from DHS and USDA   In short  biosecurity and agroterrorism threats to our nation  s food and agriculture are very serious  but too little federal funding  personnel and attention are being devoted to the challenge   I urge the administration to work with us in Congress to remedy these shortcomings in our preparedness   There is absolutely no time to waste                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
