     WASHINGTON    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  along with Senator Chuck Hagel  R NE   Easter Seals  the National Education Association  the American Association of School Administrators today called on Congress to fully fund the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act  IDEA    Harkin and Hagel introduced the IDEA Full Funding Act  which authorizes the necessary funding to meet the Federal government  s commitment to students with special needs              When it comes to education reform  we have spent a great deal of time debating accountability and standardized testing     said Harkin     We have not spent enough time on how we will provide every school with the resources required to produce real results                  We need to make sure that school administrators have adequate resources to provide every child  including students with disabilities  with the quality education they deserve  That s why Senator Hagel and I introduced the IDEA Full Funding Act     said Harkin              Congress approved IDEA in 1975  requiring states to provide an appropriate education to students with special needs  While it committed to providing 40 percent of the additional costs for educating such students  today the federal government funds less than half that amount    only 17 8 percent              In the Fiscal Year 2006 Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  for the first time in 10 years  the federal government cut back on its share of the cost of providing special education  This leaves state governments and local school districts to pick up the tab  and to have to make difficult decisions about funding for many other necessary programs like remedial classes  after school tutoring and summer school             Harkin called the IDEA Full Funding Act a   win win    saying    First  fully funding IDEA ensures that children with disabilities get the education they deserve  And second  by helping local schools pay the cost of special education  this bill ensures that funding special education won t come at the expense of other critical education programs                The IDEA Full Funding Act has the support of twenty Democratic  Republican and Independent Senators   In addition  more than 50 nationwide organizations that advocate for students and persons with disabilities have pledged their support for the IDEA Full Funding Act   A list of groups supporting full funding legislation follows               Supporters of Mandatory Full Funding of IDEA    January  2006           Alexander Graham Bell
