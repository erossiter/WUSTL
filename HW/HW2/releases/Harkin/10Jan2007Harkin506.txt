        I am most pleased to welcome you to this first hearing of the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry of this new 110th Congress   Senator Chambliss  I look forward to continuing to work with you in providing leadership to this committee            I also want to welcome our new members  Senators Sherrod Brown  Bob Casey  Lindsay Graham  Amy Klobuchar and John Thune            Our most important committee task this year will be to formulate a new farm bill   When we wrote the last farm bill  the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  we included an energy title for the first time   Since then  we have seen vigorous growth in energy production in rural America  especially in the form of biofuels and windpower  revealing a new and encouraging energy supply capability in that sector             During this same period  we have become increasingly aware of just how precarious our national energy situation is   Energy prices have gone up and appear to be staying up   Environmental impacts of energy use  especially from autos and power plants  are still a major health concern   The evidence of climate change is absolutely clear and very ominous  and we know that combustion of fossil fuels is the primary contributor to the greenhouse gases that drive global warming   On top of all that  our use of petroleum is rising steadily  and we are importing about 60 percent of that petroleum from foreign sources  many of whom are politically unstable or unfriendly to the United States   In short  we need to initiate a major transition of our energy sector  to one that is far more efficient  is much less reliant on fossil fuels and on imported oil  and is utilizing vastly more domestically produced renewable energy             This convergence of national energy needs with agricultural sector energy capabilities represents a genuine opportunity for us   We can  and I believe we must  formulate and pass a farm bill that encourages and accelerates the rural production of energy for the whole nation   In other words  we have the opportunity to move our agricultural sector from one that supplies food and fiber to a sector that supplies food  fiber  and energy    This is a convergence with a real   win win   potential  to help the nation with its pressing energy needs while promoting rural development through business expansion to energy supplies            I want this first committee hearing to begin to set the stage for bringing our agricultural and rural sectors   renewable energy capabilities to bear on our national energy needs   And  I  ve chosen to focus this first hearing on what is arguably our most critical energy need  that of reducing our dependence on petroleum   To that end  we  ve invited 2 panels of witnesses to talk to us about significantly increasing the production of biofuels  and the challenges and implications associated with that expansion               I welcome Senator Chambliss to make an opening statement                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
