                  Good morning and welcome to this hearing of the Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition and Forestry                           Today  we hear additional testimony on two topics that are high on the opportunity side of the ledger for rural America   energy and rural development   One message has been consistently clear throughout preparation for the next farm bill   that is  the new legislation must provide strong support for energy initiatives in agriculture and rural America                           Record gasoline prices are only one indicator that our nation is facing critical energy challenges   We have long known of our vulnerability arising from our over dependence on oil  which is the source of essentially all of our transportation fuels   We now import over 60 percent of the petroleum we use  and the nations with the largest oil reserves and production capabilities are  generally  not especially friendly to us  politically unstable or both                                Our nation s agricultural sector has already demonstrated impressive biofuels production capabilities  and there is impressive evidence it can provide even more in the future   Senator Lugar and I are just two of the believers   We introduced the Biofuels Security Act in January  calling for 30 billion gallons of renewable fuels by 2020 and 60 billion gallons by 2030   I m pleased to see that a number of others  including President Bush and the Energy and Natural Resources Committee  are calling for very similar targets                               If we achieve these levels of biofuels production  it will involve tens of millions of acres devoted to producing biomass feedstocks and very likely some significant shifts and changes in agriculture in America   I know there are concerns that greater biofuels production will disrupt supplies or prices of other agricultural products   Those concerns must be heeded and addressed   However  if we do the research and formulate the technology and market policies carefully  we can capitalize on this tremendous opportunity to produce energy in addition to needed supplies of food  feed and fiber   That will be beneficial to rural America as well as to the nation as a whole   Indeed  energy from our agricultural sector is the most important rural economic development opportunity in decades                           Our first panel brings energy to the table alongside rural economic development   Economic development is much more than just a by product of rural energy production   It must be a priority that cuts across these two important farm bill titles   In particular  we must foster local and regional initiatives using available resources  with the federal government serving as a partner and a leader in driving rural economic opportunities                            Witnesses on the second panel will speak about the future of biofuels   both the technology developments we are likely to see and the role that biofuels from cellulose are likely to play in supplying liquid fuels which are so crucial to our transportation sector                                   The Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002 was the first farm bill ever to include an energy title  and we enacted that with bipartisan support   We will hear testimony today about energy achievements that have resulted from that energy title   That information also will help us frame sound farm bill programs and policies to help our farmers and ranchers and rural communities manage their energy systems   And I trust the information will help us formulate an energy title that again will have support on both sides of the Senate aisle                              Finally  I always like to hear from folks that are utilizing our programs in their farming and their businesses   I m pleased that we were able to include two witnesses actively engaged in the energy business in rural America today                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
