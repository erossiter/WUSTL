      WASHINGTON D C      Before Congress adjourned for the year  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  succeeded in extending a waiver which will allow 54 000 children across the country to continue using public transit vehicles to Head Start classes          Harkin delayed a new rule scheduled to go into effect in the beginning of next year  which would mandate that all children participating in Head Start must be transported on only school buses or school bus like vehicles  This new rule would have prevented the use of paratransit vehicles    smaller transit vehicles that do not follow a specific route like school buses    in getting kids to Head Start classes  This would have had a greater impact in rural communities  many of which cannot fill the larger buses due to smaller populations and which rely more heavily on the paratransit vehicles            These kids need the opportunity to get to Head Start     Harkin said    We should be doing everything we can to make sure they have the chance to better them selves and lay the foundation for a brighter future  That starts by getting them to and from the classrooms             Harkin is a long time leader in the fight to ensure that Head Start is adequately funded  Harkin has also been an active supporter of the Senate  s current proposals to strengthen program accountability and increase children  s access to the program  s offerings            There is no better investment we can make than providing our kids with a strong foundation that will help them succeed in school and in life     Harkin said                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
