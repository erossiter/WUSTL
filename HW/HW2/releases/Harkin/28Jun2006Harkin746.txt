      I am pleased to continue support of this important project  which creates jobs  attracts visitors and new growth  and improves the environment     Harkin said     Storm Lake has done an admirable job of leveraging other kinds of investments to support this project            The City of Storm Lake has completed four years of the project  The funding will be used to dredge Storm Lake and improve the watershed to prevent silt from re entering the lake   Through decades of ground erosion and silt freely entering Storm Lake  the lake levels have diminished   Shallow water and heavy wave action has also increased turbidity and sediment suspension  causing Storm Lake to be on the impaired waters list   In order to remove the silt and prevent the continued inflow of silt  a Lake Restoration Program was needed to dredge a large portion of the lake and to develop watershed protection practices         Harkin has been a long time supporter of dredging efforts at Storm Lake  In the past four years  he has secured over  1 3 million in federal funds for this project   Harkin visited Storm Lake in August of 2004 to see first hand the positive environmental and economic development impact of the project                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
