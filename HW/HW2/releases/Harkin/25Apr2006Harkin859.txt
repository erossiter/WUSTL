           Today  we are making a simple demand   Fair pay for working women               Just think  here we stand on April 25  eight days after the deadline for our 2005 federal tax returns  and the paychecks of American women are only now catching up to the earnings mark achieved by their male counterparts on December 31st of last year               While our government is demanding equal rights for women in the Middle East  it is time for us to practice what we preach   It is time to pay women here in the United States equal to the worth of their work   It is time for Congress to pass the Fair Pay Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act            Discrimination takes many forms   Sometimes discrimination is brazen and in your face  like when people of color were refused service at a lunch counter   And sometimes discrimination is silent and insidious    and accepted by people who ought to know better   That is what we are confronting  today               Women in the U S  workforce are subject to pervasive  systemic discrimination in their quest to be paid their worth   Women make only 76 cents for every dollar that a man makes   African American women get only 66 cents   Latina women get only 55 cents    nearly half of what a man makes                 The Census Bureau has compiled data on hundreds of job categories    hundreds   But it found only five job categories where women typically earn as much as men   This is unacceptable   And it is hurting American families   In nearly 10 million American households  the mother is the only breadwinner   These women struggle to pay the rent  buy groceries  cover the medical bills  and save for their kids   college education   But they face systematic pay discrimination                     You know  it  s shocking to think that when the National Recovery Act was passed in 1935  it required    by law     that women with government jobs be paid 25 percent less than men in the same jobs   But who needs a law when    as we see today    the private marketplace is allowed to pay women nearly 25 percent less than men                    The time for excuses has passed   It  s time to pass the Fair Pay Act and the Paycheck Fairness Act                  Pay inequity is a two headed monster   Women are not getting paid equal to men for doing the same jobs as men  and they  re not getting paid what they  re worth for doing jobs different than those performed by men that are of no less equal value to their employer   The Paycheck Fairness Act addresses the former   The Fair Pay Act addresses the latter   Both solutions are needed to establish pay fairness in the workplace                 The Fair Pay Act  introduced by Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton in the House and by myself in the Senate  would address the longstanding pattern of undervaluing women  s work   For example  women in social work  a female dominated field  are paid less than probation officers  a male dominated field  even though both professions require similar levels of skill  effort  and responsibility                    The Fair Pay Act says that where working conditions are similar  so too should be wages   It requires employers to provide equal pay for jobs that are comparable in skill  effort  responsibility and working conditions   That is hardly a radical idea   In fact  it is just simple fairness                 These are the women who work in hospices taking care of our elderly  in the lodging industry making our business and vacation travel more comfortable  in child care centers  nurturing and watching carefully over our sons and daughters  Their fight to be paid what they are worth is a fight all Members of Congress should be supporting                     This legislation is workable  The states have shown us the way  Twenty states  including the state of Iowa  have honored the worth of all their employees by putting equal pay laws and policies on the books   In fact  Iowa had a Republican legislature and Governor when its equal pay bill was passed into law   So ending wage discrimination against women is not a partisan issue               Let  s keep working together to get our Equal Pay legislation passed in this Congress                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
