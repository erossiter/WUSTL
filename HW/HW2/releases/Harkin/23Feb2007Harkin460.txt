          Today  I learned with great disappointment that my friend Tom Vilsack has decided to end his candidacy for President of the United States   There s no question in my mind that Tom is a great leader  something he s proven as Iowa s two term governor and as a successful state legislator and mayor                      The highest accolade I can give  though  is simply that Tom is a good and decent person   He is a model husband and father  and a loyal friend   And he has a genuine passion for fairness and social justice   It s a message I ve heard again and again from voters across the country                      With Tom s strength and character  he would have made an exceptional President  That s why when I spoke with him today  I urged him to continue his leadership for Iowa and the nation   This is certainly not the last we ve seen of Tom Vilsack                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
