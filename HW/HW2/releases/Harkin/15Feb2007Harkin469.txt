               WASHINGTON  D C    Senators Tom Harkin  D IA  and Gordon Smith  R OR  today introduced the Safe Babies Act of 2007  legislation to protect infants and toddlers in foster care   Specifically  the legislation builds upon the innovative work being conducted in juvenile courts around the country including Iowa   The bill authorizes funding for juvenile courts to create  Court Teams  for the integrated handling of infant and toddler abuse and neglect cases in the foster care system                            The foster care system is a supposed to be a safe haven for many kids during difficult times  Unfortunately  though this is all too often not the case   When instances of abuse or neglect occur  they must be dealt as quickly and as effectively as possible   Harkin said   I hope that increased cooperation between juvenile court judges and other child advocates will keep our kids safe and help them get the best possible start in life  Nothing is more important than doing everything we can to ensure that our kids are living in a safe  stable  and nurturing environment                                In our nation  millions of children are reported abused or neglected each year   said Smith   Of these  more than 900 000 are confirmed maltreated by child protective service organizations and our court systems  These staggering statistics tell us that children who come through our nation s court systems need more support   While the hardworking judges  attorneys  child welfare workers and volunteers do so much to help stop the child abuse and neglect they see every day  they too often see families returning to the courts generation after generation   The Safe Babies Act will help protect the most vulnerable children   This bill puts into motion a proven model for helping infants and toddlers to recover from their abuse  and for families to stop the cycle of abuse and reunite                                 The Court Teams work by bringing together a juvenile court judge with a community based team of child welfare  health and mental health professionals  and child advocates and development specialists   The Court Team works to enhance and coordinate services for these children and their families by screening infants and toddlers for developmental delays and chronic health problems  and by engaging in an intensive approach to parent child intervention with the goal of allowing children to live safely with their parents and reducing the numbers of very young children in foster care                              Children between birth and age three are twice as likely as older children to become victims of maltreatment  and are three times more likely to be placed in foster care   Despite high rates of involvement  the current child welfare system does a particularly poor job of serving infants and toddlers  As many as 42  of infants and toddlers involved in a maltreatment investigation are developmentally delayed  yet less than one in ten currently receives treatment for developmental problems                              From birth to age five  children develop their social  emotional  cognitive and moral capacities more rapidly than at any other time in life   These early relationships and experiences are pivotal for future development and set the stage for how well individuals learn  think  control their emotions  and relate to others                           According to Judge Constance Cohen the Juvenile Court Judge with the Iowa District Court the Des Moines  Court Teams project has already demonstrated better outcomes for families with infants and toddlers in juvenile court    The Iowa project has empowered the juvenile court community to become better equipped to understand and appreciate critical issues in these families  lives   The knowledge shared by experts in mental health  substance abuse  and child development has resulted in marked improvements in the delivery of effective assessments and services that minimize trauma and maximize healing   Cohen said                          Identical legislation has been introduced in House by Representatives Rosa DeLaura  Conn  3  and Ileana Ros Lehtinen  FL 18            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
