   Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called on President Bush to use his national address tonight to lay out a plan for relief and recovery in the Gulf Coast region that will meet the immediate needs of evacuees in the short term  and help boost incomes  create new jobs  and encourage an economic revival for all citizens across the Gulf Coast in the long term   Specifically  Harkin called on the President to reverse his recent Executive Order stripping key wage protections from workers rebuilding the troubled Gulf region            These are the very workers who will rebuild the highways and bridges  reconstruct the houses  schools  and hospitals     said Harkin     These are the workers who will do the hazardous waste clean up in areas rife with bacteria  molds  and chemical contaminants   Statistics show that most carpenters and laborers working in the Gulf Coast region currently make less than  19 000 a year   After all they have suffered  why would we want to cut their already meager income   I urge the President to seize this opportunity tonight to reinstate these basic wage protections for people who will be returning to work to rebuild their lives and the areas impacted by Katrina              Harkin also expressed the need for strict oversight of the substantial federal funding expected for Gulf Coast recovery   He called for a separate entity devoted to the Katrina recovery on the Gulf Coast  which would quickly bring together creative leaders and skilled professionals to restore the local economy  ensure aid to those in need  and protect the unprecedented flow of federal tax dollars from waste  fraud and abuse            The Gulf Coast must be taken care of     Harkin said     But an investment of this magnitude requires strict oversight to ensure accountability to the American taxpayers as well   Developing a separate entity will accomplish this goal  and free up disaster teams to prepare for any future disasters             Harkin also called on the President and Republicans in Congress to endorse an independent investigation into the government  s preparation for and response to the Katrina disaster in order to better prepare for future disasters or terrorist threats                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
