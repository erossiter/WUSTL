            I am pleased Secretary Johanns has laid out a proposal that reflects comments and concerns he has heard in Iowa and throughout the country   I want to thank the Secretary and everyone who contributed to developing these proposals   We will give careful attention to them                   There are a number of good ideas  along with others that raise serious questions  I  m especially concerned about the idea to put even more money in the old Freedom to Farm type of payments                The nation needs critical new investments in farm and rural renewable energy  conservation and rural economic development  While it  s positive the proposal takes significant steps in the right direction  it falls short of the investment levels needed to reach our nation  s objectives               I was disappointed that the proposal fails to remedy the budget damage to the Conservation Security Program since the 2002 farm bill  It does not restore CSP to a nationwide program so every producer at least has an opportunity to apply  That should be the goal                    On energy  the proposal is not enough to meet the ambitious goals the President laid out in his State of the Union speech for increasing production of alternative and renewable fuels  While I support the rhetoric  I do not see adequate resources dedicated to backing it up                                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
