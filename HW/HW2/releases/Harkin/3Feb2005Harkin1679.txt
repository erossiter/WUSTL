        The inability of Secretary Johanns and USDA to justify the departure from OIE standards is troubling at best     Harkin said     Today  s testimony emphasized the importance of making decisions based on sound science   Yet  key aspects of the OIE standards  which USDA has praised as being the gold standard on BSE and trade issues  have been largely ignored             Harkin also noted that moving ahead with this flawed approach may jeopardize reopening markets closed to U S  cattle and beef  namely Japan and South Korea            I had hoped today  s hearing would shed more light on the subject  but USDA seems set on its   damn the torpedoes  full speed ahead   approach to resuming trade with Canada     Harkin said     Failure to withdraw this rule and take a more comprehensive approach based on sound science may severely hamper our efforts to reopen closed markets such as Japan and South Korea   I again urge USDA to withdraw and rewrite this rule                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
