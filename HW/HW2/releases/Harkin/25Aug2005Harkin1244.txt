         I am disappointed that the BRAC Commission has voted to move jobs from the Rock Island Arsenal              Despite this setback  Rock Island Arsenal remains a vital national security asset   The Arsenal has been indispensable to our country  proving time and time again that it can meet and exceed expectations   I will work to ensure that it has all necessary resources to remain a top notch installation   Its proven success cannot be duplicated anywhere             Many of our Quad Cities families will go through a transition in the coming years as a result of this decision   I will do all I can to support them during this time  and I join with the community in welcoming the 1st U S  Army Headquarters to Rock Island                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
