              WASHINGTON D C       Hoping to restore real family values in the work place  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today co sponsored The Healthy Families Act  legislation that would require businesses who employ over 15 staff to provide seven paid sick days a year for their workers                            This bill is a step in the right direction   Harkin said   It says parents should have the right to take their sick child to the doctor and that workers should have the right to take care of their own health and well being without worrying about losing pay or losing their job                         Studies have shown that 50 percent of private sector workers and 76 percent of low income workers do not have paid sick leave at their current jobs  At a February 13 Health  Employment  Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on this legislation  one witness testified the United States is behind the curve in providing sick leave for its workers  showing that 139 countries provide paid leave for short  or long term illness  with 117 of those providing a week or more annually  There is currently no federal law providing paid time off for sick workers                           The Healthy Families Act will also provide leave for caring for a sick child   In most cases  parents are not allowed to leave sick children in daycare  Working families currently have few options if they do not have sick leave to take for an ill child  According to Harvard researcher Judy Heymann  children are healthier and do better in school when a parent can care for them when they are ill                          The issue of providing sick leave to employees is also a matter of improving public health  Reports have indicated 78 percent of food service workers do not have paid sick days  At last month s hearing  Harkin s testimony noted that at one hotel in Nevada last year a worker who didn t have paid sick time went to work with a stomach virus and infected 600 customers and 300 employees  A recent Cornell study found that people coming to work when they are ill costs businesses  180 billion annually in lost productivity alone   not accounting for the cost of spreading illness to coworkers                            My hope is that businesses will come to realize the real benefit of encouraging sick workers to stay at home and recover before returning to the job   Harkin said                                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
