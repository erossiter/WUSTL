      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called for the Department of Agriculture  USDA  to ensure Canadian meat and poultry imports live up to U S  food safety standards in response to findings released by USDA  s Inspector General  OIG    USDA  s OIG report found that the administration failed to   timely address serious concerns with the Canadian Inspection system even though high level agency officials documented the potential for compromising public health      The OIG report revealed that two critical U S  food safety standards are not followed in Canadian meat and poultry inspections  meat inspections are not conducted daily and inspections fail to sample finished products for a deadly foodborne pathogen called Listeria monocytogenes   Listeria monocytogenes is known to cause a sometimes fatal form of food poisoning in pregnant women  the elderly  and people with a weakened immune system                 Well over two years ago  USDA found serious food safety concerns with Canada  s meat and poultry inspection process     Harkin said     Yet the Department did nothing and allowed meat and poultry into the U S  that had not been subject to the same standards U S  processing plants follow to ensure the safety of our food supply   This undermines the integrity of American food safety standards and consumer confidence in our meat supply                  Since 2003  roughly 700 million pounds of meat and poultry did not receive daily inspection  and 261 million pounds were not subject to Listeria testing   This meat entered U S  commerce despite internal USDA warnings that year raising serious concerns about Canada  s inspections of meat and poultry   In a November 2003 memorandum to the Agriculture Secretary  the FSIS Administrator and Under Secretary for Food Safety identified  serious concerns  with the Canadian Inspection system and that these concerns had the  potential for compromising public health     USDA then planned an enforcement review for fiscal year 2004 to determine how to move forward and if USDA should suspend inspection operations in all certified establishments   Despite this  no action was taken by USDA  the proposed enforcement review was  indefinitely postponed   and the food safety concerns remained unaddressed even as of June 2005    almost two years later                    USDA has also not treated all countries the same when enforcing U S  food standards   USDA delisted and no longer allowed export product from Belgium in July 2003 and Australia in June 2004 when it was determined these countries did not meet U S  food safety standards  According to the OIG report  USDA s  actions regarding Canadian processing establishments were not consistent with how the agency treated similarly situated countries                            USDA seems to have a   make it up as we go   attitude in determining which country  s food safety standards match those established by U S  law      Harkin said     That is unacceptable and I urge the Department to quickly take the necessary steps to make sure all meat imports live up to health standards established under U S  law                                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
