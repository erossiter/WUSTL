                  This budget once again demonstrates that the President s priorities are completely disconnected from the values and needs of the American people                                              The Administration s budget contemplates spending an additional  100 billion on the war in Iraq  bringing the total spent to nearly  550 billion  Americans have said loud and clear that the cost of this war     more than 3 000 soldiers killed and over 23 000 injured  and an untold strain on our soldiers  families and communities     has been too high  What this budget document underscores is the dramatic toll our continued involvement in Iraq is taking on our domestic priorities                                           While the President slashes vital initiatives for working Americans and the most vulnerable in our society  he has no problem pushing more tax giveaway bonanzas for the wealthiest among us  These misdirected priorities come at the expense of things like health care and housing for the elderly and disabled  more affordable education for Iowa kids  Iowa law enforcement  and rural America  In fact  the President s proposal shortchanges critical rural initiatives such as renewable energy  conservation and economic development  which could potentially hamper Congress  effort in creating a strong  forward looking farm bill                                               Once again we ve been presented with a budget that just doesn t reflect Iowa values  Americans should not have to suffer because of the poor fiscal management of this country  With the high deficits the Bush Administration has racked up  it is no secret there are tough choices ahead   but these choices have to be fair                                                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
