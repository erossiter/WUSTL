        The President says it is time to tighten our belts and make difficult choices     said Harkin     Unfortunately  he seems to think it  s more important to cut initiatives like career and technical education and school counseling for Iowa kids than it is to roll back his tax giveaway bonanza for the wealthiest Americans               Throughout the president  s budget  nearly a third of the initiatives targeted for elimination are education related   Iowa specific cuts include a  14 1 million cut for career and technical education  a  2 4 million cut in education technology   3 4 million cut for safe and drug free schools  a  1 million cut for family literacy programs and a  1 1 million cut for comprehensive school reform              No Child Left Behind and Title I           The Bush budget will mean another year of broken promises when it comes to funding for the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB    The NCLB established specific funding levels for Title I  the cornerstone program of the law  for every year through 2007  including  22 75 billion for the coming year   But the Bush budget undercuts that pledge by more than  9 4 billion and brings the overall funding shortfall for Title I  since NCLBA was enacted in 2001  to  30 8 billion              Specifically in Iowa  the Bush Administration promised Title I schools  111 million for the coming year but included only  65 million in the budget  denying critical Title I services to more than 14 000 disadvantaged Iowa students   In addition  the White House promised  11 million for Iowa after school programs but included only  4 9 million in the budget  denying after school services to more than 8 300 students            Funding for Children with Disabilities           The White House also broke its promise on special education  Under the IDEA Improvement Act of 2004  which President Bush signed just three months ago  Iowa should receive  153 million to educate students with disabilities in the coming year  The President s budget includes just  118 million for Iowa    a shortfall of  35 million             According to Iowa Educators           The budget proposed to Congress means that Iowans will be hit by cuts in school counseling  teacher training  efforts to reduce alcohol abuse and cuts in programs designed to improve academic achievement of kids from low income families            Elimination of career and technical education funding would impact programs throughout the state      As we enter the 21st century  postsecondary technical training is more important than ever before   This is not the time for the Administration or Congress to eliminate the support for vocational technical education     said Dr  Robert E  Dunker  President  Western Iowa Tech community College in Sioux City            According to Janice Kuhl  a Counseling Facilitator with the Des Moines Public Schools  their program is praised nationally as a model of excellence among elementary school counseling programs   If school counseling initiatives are cut as proposed in the president  s budget  it would immediately compromise the Des Moines   Public Schools   ability to deliver this premier national model              The National Writing Project is a nonprofit educational organization that promotes K 16 teacher training programs to increase teaching effectiveness in writing   Dr  Richard Hanzelka  says that cuts to the program would mean the end of the Eastern Iowa Writing Project at St  Ambrose University     It would be irresponsible to cut funding for NWP  which is the most research based writing project in the country   Successful reading truly depends on successful  comprehensive writing program     said Hanzelka            Vaughn Murphy  an Instructional Technology Consultant in Johnston says that education technology funding allows them to use scientific based research and data more efficiently  and evidence has proven that technology can help improve student achievement              Even Start is an education program for the Nation  s low income families that is designed to improve the academic achievement of you children and their parents  especially in the area of reading   Kristine Schlievert  principal at Demony Elementary in Esterville says that cuts to Even Start would impact her kids immensely    The president  s proposed cut is discouraging and disheartening  because we know this program does make a difference in Esterville               In the Dubuque Community School District  Vocational Programs Coordinator Denzil Barnhill worries that if proposed cuts go through  fewer students will graduate with skills necessary to continue their education in technical fields such as fiber optics  lasers  robotics  or electronics  and fewer students  as equipment ages  will complete programs with marketable skills and experiences     It would have a devastating impact on regional and local staff development efforts to improve performance in math and reading     said Barnhill                                 Note to reporters and editors  For more information on how the Bush budget proposal shortchanges education
