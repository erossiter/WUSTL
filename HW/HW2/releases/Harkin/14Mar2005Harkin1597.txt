        Iowa kids deserve safe  well maintained schools  Yet  far too many children across our state are learning in substandard classrooms and unsuitable environments     said Harkin    These grants will help Iowa schools and students excel well into the 21st Century  This is truly is an investment in our state  s future             Harkin  s school demonstration construction program is intended to study how a modest federal investment can significantly modernize and improve school buildings  Iowa school districts will receive almost  2 6 million in Fire  life  Safety Grants to make urgent repairs to remedy fire  life  safety code violations  School districts will receive over  5 57 million for major construction and renovation projects and will require up to a 50 percent match from the local school district   Harkin recently secured an additional  15 million for the Harkin grants program in the FY2005 Omnibus Appropriations bill             Our government can and should do more to ensure that our kids have access to safe and modern schools equipped with the highest possible technology     said Harkin    There is a legitimate federal role in helping fix our nation  s crumbling schools  and we can do so without undermining local control of education  These grants will make schools more amenable to teaching and learning and will improve the quality of education for thousands of children              According to the General Accounting Office  79 percent of Iowa schools report a need to repair or upgrade their buildings and facilities  In addition  an infrastructure study conducted by Iowa State University in the mid 1990s reported  3 4 billion is needed to modernize public schools in the state           A list of grantees is below and attached  two pages              SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION GRANTS       Grant Year  District Name  Grant Award Amount   2004  Allamakee    394 382    2004  Belmond Klemme    20 897    2004  Cal    162 250    2004  Cedar Rapids    500 000    2004  Central City    500 000    2004  Columbus    500 000    2004  Des Moines    500 000    2004  Iowa City    500 000    2004  Lamoni    500 000    2004  Marshalltown    500 000    2004  Norwalk    500 000    2004  South Tama County    500 000    2004  Waterloo    500 000                 Total Amount Awarded    5 577 529               FIRE AND SAFETY GRANTS       Grant Year  District Name   Grant Award Amount    2004  Audubon   25 000    2004  Aurelia    25 000    2004  Battle Creek  Ida Grove    25 000    2004  Belmond Klemme    25 000    2004  Board of Regents    25 000    2004  Brooklyn Guernsey Malcom    25 000    2004  Center Point   Urbana    25 000    2004  Cherokee    25 000    2004  Clarksville    25 000    2004  Clear Lake    96 715    2004  Collins Maxwell    24 997    2004  Colo Nesco    25 000    2004  Corning    25 000    2004  Davis County      100 000    2004  Denison    11 069    2004  Des Moines      150 000    2004  Durant    25 000    2004  East Marshall    25 000    2004  Eastern Allamakee    25 000    2004  Fairfield    26 918    2004  Fort Madison      100 000    2004  Garner Hayfield    16 140    2004  Gladbrook Reinbeck    25 000    2004  Glidden Ralston    25 000    2004  Greene    25 000    2004  Hampton Dumont    77 000    2004  Harlan    54 000    2004  Hartley Melvin Sanborn     25 000    2004  Highland    21 400    2004  Humboldt      100 000    2004  Iowa Falls    25 000    2004  Keokuk   4 891    2004  Lake Mills    25 000    2004  Mason City      100 000    2004  Meservey Thornton   8 805    2004  Nevada   4 000    2004  North Cedar    25 000    2004  North Iowa    25 000    2004  North Tama County      25 000    2004  Northeast Hamilton    18 060    2004  Norwalk    33 292    2004  Odebolt Arthur    25 000    2004  Ottumwa    95 995    2004  Pocahontas Area    25 000    2004  River Valley    25 000    2004  Rockwell City Lytton    25 000    2004  Rudd Rockford Marble Rock    17 640    2004  Sibley Ocheyedan    25 000    2004  Sioux City       150 000    2004  Southeast Polk      150 000    2004  Southern Cal    25 000    2004  Tripola          4 640    2004  Washington      100 000    2004  Waterloo      150 000    2004  West Bend Mallard          9 313    2004  West Delaware County   20 199    2004  West Des Moines     150 000    2004  Winterset   17 911    2004  Woodbury Central   25 000                 Total Awarded    2 562 985                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
