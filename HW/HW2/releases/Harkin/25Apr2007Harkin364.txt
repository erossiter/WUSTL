                  Good morning to my Senate colleagues  our witnesses and audience   Today we will hear testimony on farm programs and other topics from witnesses representing a diverse range of views on broader farm bill topics as well as the particular concerns of specific commodities and crops                              Most of us commonly use the term  farm bill  when referring to the legislation we are considering today   Yet by simply calling it the farm bill  we understate its far reaching consequences for our entire nation and beyond our borders   and we fail to give the full credit due to the vital contributions of American agriculture and rural communities   This legislation must fulfill a wide range of objectives covering agriculture  food  renewable energy  conservation  nutrition  trade  the rural economy and other subjects   All of these needs and demands have to be balanced out in the bill we write                                    A core mission in this legislation  as it long has been  is promoting profitability and income potential in agriculture   In doing so  we have to recognize that the food and agriculture sector is among the most rapidly changing of our economy   There are tremendous new challenges  but also unprecedented opportunities   With new technology  demographic shifts  the rapid expansion of biofuels  and the growth of global markets and competition  agriculture is at a crossroads   There is a good reason we write farm bills for a limited period of time   As we review and rewrite the legislation  we must take the opportunity to update our food and agriculture policy so it is effective  efficient  and responsive to the needs of the rapidly changing agricultural sector  not only for the period of the next farm bill  but for future generations                                   On the first panel  we have representatives of the two largest general farm organizations and two witnesses who will give our Committee additional and somewhat different perspectives on farm programs   The remaining two panels include witnesses representing wheat  feed grains  upland cotton  rice  oilseeds  peanuts  and pulse crops   These commodities account for roughly one half of the average U S  farm cash receipts for crops   Three of these crops   corn  soybeans  and wheat   are grown on about 70 percent of the cultivated cropland in the United States   Of course  these crops are very important to the U S  economy  as federal farm policy has recognized over the years   By the same token  given their value and large acreage  the policy we write for these commodities has very substantial consequences for our nation                               When we wrote the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  we had the benefit of significantly larger budget and the flexibility that goes with more money   It is true the commodity programs cost significantly less than was estimated 5 years ago  but under the strange logic of budget scoring rules  we do not get credit for that   and the prediction of stronger commodity prices reduces our budget for future years   That means we will have to scrutinize carefully every proposal as we put this farm bill together                              I look forward to hearing from today s witnesse   We have a tremendous challenge ahead of us to craft a sound farm bill that will help improve income  profitability and new opportunities for our nation s agricultural producers while also meeting the variety of additional needs and objectives the legislation must address                                   Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
