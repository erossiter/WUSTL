         And yet the need to expand stem cell research in this country is as critical as ever   For millions of Americans  stem cell research remains a life or death issue   That  s why I  m so disappointed that the White House and the Senate leadership seem to have no interest in bringing H R  810 to a vote   The House passed this bill by a strong  bipartisan majority five months ago   A bipartisan majority support the bill here in the Senate as well   Senator Frist himself said he backs it   And yet we are still denied a vote            Here  s the situation   Opponents of H R  810 know we  ve got the votes to pass the bill   So they  re insisting that the Senate also vote on five or six other bills  some of which have nothing to do with the key issue    expanding the number of stem cell lines that are eligible for federally funded research   What the opponents really want to do is ban a technique that most Americans have never even heard of  called somatic cell nuclear transfer  or SCNT   They figure that even if the Senate passes H R  810  President Bush will veto it   But he  ll sign a ban against SCNT             What is SCNT  and why do scientists think it  s such a promising tool for research   That  s what today  s hearing will address   But in a nutshell  this technique allows scientists to develop stem cell lines that match a patient  s own DNA   Let  s take a patient with Parkinson  s disease   By the time this disease presents itself  most of the key motor neuron cells have already been destroyed   There  s simply not much left to study             But with SCNT  scientists can create stem cells with that patient  s own DNA   That means they can study Parkinson  s in ways that have never been done before   They can observe neuron cells as soon as they form  and learn how and why they go bad   Then they can use these cells to screen promising drugs that might prevent Parkinson  s   Perhaps one day  a patient  s own stem cells will be used to cure his or her disease             Scientists in many other countries are already moving full speed ahead on SCNT   In fact  today Korea is announcing an effort to fund SCNT research all over the world  including here in the United States   But if Congress bans SCNT  our nation  s scientists will be completely shut out of this promising research   That  s why it  s so important to hold hearings like this one  to educate Americans about the value of this technique             Again  Mr  Chairman  I thank you for holding this important hearing  and I look forward to hearing from the witnesses                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
