                Welcome to the Senate Committee on Agriculture  Nutrition  and Forestry hearing on child nutrition within the school setting   Let me begin by welcoming our witnesses and thanking them for their contributions  with a special welcome to Teresa Nece from Des Moines                         Let me also welcome all of the School Nutrition Association delegates who are here today   Again we have a big Iowa delegation  I m proud to say   The School Nutrition Association has long played a critical role in ensuring not only that our children have enough to eat  but also that what they eat is nutritious                           Today we will hear about progress made  about areas where more can be done  and specifically  about the role that this committee can play in improving children s diets   The farm bill reauthorization this year provides us with an opportunity to make further progress on these issues   I look forward to working with my colleagues on this as the year progresses                              This hearing occurs at a critical moment for our nation s children   Over the past 30 years  in large part because of federal nutrition programs  we have made remarkable strides in ending serious hunger in the United States   To be sure  many families still struggle to put food on the table as they also try to pay for rent  transportation  and health care  but the scourge of hunger itself has been greatly diminished                         In recent years  thanks to the efforts of school nutrition personnel  the nutritional quality of federally reimbursed meals has also improved   So  school meals have increasingly addressed many of the nutrition related health risks for kids at school  at least so long as they are eating federally reimbursed school meals                            Now we have a new set of health risks associated with diet which have grown rapidly in recent years  with serious consequences for our children   Unhealthy weight  even obesity  among children has increased dramatically over the past 30 to 40 years   Diet related type 2 diabetes has reached levels never thought possible  with some estimating that one in three children born today will develop the disease   Added sugar and fat consumption generally is on the rise among children  representing half of daily caloric intake among school age kids                         I d like to make it clear that  when I talk about diet related health problems  I m not trying to demonize any particular food   The real issue here is maintaining a proper balance in our diets   In recent decades  there have been significant changes in the diets of most Americans  especially kids   Since the late 1970s  the percentage of daily calories that kids get from sweetened beverages has doubled  from less than 5 percent to more than 10 percent according to an article published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine   Foods that were once considered a treat are now consumed daily  even multiple times daily  by many of our kids   According to USDA s Food and Nutrition Service  fifty two percent of teenage males  and thirty two percent of teenage females consume three or more soft drink servings a day                         Even as the quality of federally reimbursed meals has improved  foods of little nutritional value   candy  chips  and sweetened beverages   have become increasingly available and consumed in most schools  where kids spend a significant portion of their day   Some schools and states have taken action to address these challenges  but many more have not   And the federal government has done little   far too little in my opinion   to set basic nutrition standards for foods that are sold in our schools   Without such guidelines  millions of American children fail to receive optimal nutrition at school  and the  10 billion investment in school meal reimbursements provided every year by American taxpayers is undermined                              Again  thank you all for coming today   I look forward to hearing from a great panel of witnesses and to working with my colleagues and other interested parties on how we can best address this critical challenge                                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
