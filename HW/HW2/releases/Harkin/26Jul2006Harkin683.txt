               On this 16th anniversary of the Americans with Disabilities Act  we recognize it as one of the great civil rights laws of A the 20th century    a long overdue emancipation proclamation for people with disabilities               But as chief sponsor of the law  I never lose sight of the seemingly mundane changes made possible by this law   I remember  during the long campaign to pass ADA  explaining to a young woman in a wheelchair how the law would open new opportunities in education and employment   She said    Senator  I know that  s important   But I just want the freedom to go out and buy a pair of shoes  like anybody else                     Sixteen years later  the physical impacts of ADA  s quiet revolution are all around us   Sidewalks are equipped with curb cuts allowing access for people using wheelchairs   New buildings are outfitted in countless ways    things like ramps  wide doors  and large bathroom stalls    to accommodate people with disabilities   Many banks have talking ATMs to assist individuals who are blind   Service animals are welcome in restaurants and shops   And much more                   For those of us who are able bodied  these changes are all but invisible   For a person with a disability  they are transforming and liberating   So are provisions in ADA outlawing discrimination against qualified individuals with disabilities in the workplace  and requiring employers to provide   reasonable accommodations                  ADA has also changed attitudes and expectations   It used to be socially and legally acceptable to exclude and marginalize people with disabilities   No longer  We have overcome the false dichotomy between   disabled   and   able      We recognize that people with disabilities    like all people    have unique abilities  talents  and aptitudes   And that America is better  fairer  and richer when we make full use of those gifts                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
