        Christopher Reeve was a classic example of a person with a disability who is remembered most of all for his abilities  not his disability  His abilities and personal experiences made him an extraordinarily effective advocate for research in paralysis and improving the quality of life for people with disabilities   I can think of no better way to honor his memory than for Congress to pass this legislation     Harkin said             Currently  paralysis research is performed across multiple disciplines with no effective means of coordination and collaboration  Time  effort and valuable research dollars are used inefficiently because of this problem  In addition  critical research results  information about clinical trials  and best practices are not disseminated to individuals and families affected by paralysis   The CRPA encourages coordination of research to prevent redundancies and hopefully hasten discovery of better treatments and cures and  as importantly  to improve the daily lives today for those living with paralysis          The CRPA has four components that support and enhance paralysis research  rehabilitation  and quality of life programs          Expands research on paralysis at the National Institutes of Health  NIH     Builds on research to enhance daily function for people with paralysis including a Clinical Trials Network to measure effectiveness of certain rehabilitation tactics   Works with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  to improve the quality of life and long term health status of persons with paralysis and other physical disabilities  Utilizes the Veteran  s Health Administration facilities to improve paralysis research by tracking data within the world  s largest system of hospitals           Thanks to efforts led by the National Institutes of Health and the Christopher Reeve Paralysis Foundation  our nation stands on the brink of amazing breakthroughs in science for those with paralysis   However  the biotech and pharmaceutical industries have not invested in paralysis research because they believe the market does not support the private investment   There is an urgent need for the federal government to further step up its commitment in this area   The Christopher Reeve Paralysis Act would do just that     Harkin said                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
