 WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee  today announced that  500 000 was included in the FY 2008 Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Bill to continue the Chariton Valley Switchgrass Project  The bill is expected to be approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee on Thursday  It will then need to be approved by both the House and Senate before it becomes law   I am pleased that funds have been approved to continue showing that Iowas native switchgrass is a viable source for producing electricity  said Harkin  I strongly believe that switchgrass can be to electric power what ethanol is to gasoline   Switchgrass crop requires less tillage  less fertilizer  and less insecticide and herbicide than traditional row crops  It also reduces dependence on fossil fuels  By mixing switchgrass with existing coal at power plants  the energy crop can help generate 35 megawatts of electrical power  enough to light 40 000 homes   The Chariton Valley Switchgrass Project aims to develop the potential for commercial biomass energy generation in Southern Iowa  This project has recently completed a long term test burn to determine the potential effects on the boilers  Further funding is needed to perform analysis and complete project closeout documentation  Over the past several years  Harkin has secured more than  17 million in federal funding for the project       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
