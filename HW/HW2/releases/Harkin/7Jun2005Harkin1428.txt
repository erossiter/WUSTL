      I commend you  Mr  Chairman  for holding today  s hearing on the very important topic of the Central American Free Trade Agreement and U S  agriculture   Today  s witnesses will offer diverse views on CAFTA  which is quite appropriate since assessments and opinions  regarding this agreement are sharply divided   CAFTA is so controversial that we have just passed the first anniversary of its signing  yet it still has not been submitted to Congress for action                          I have voted in support of most of the major trade agreements during my 30 years in Congress   However  I firmly believe we must be careful not to load all of our hopes in agriculture on the slender back of trade   Experience shows that  in general  neither the most optimistic promises of expected benefits  nor the most dire predictions of disaster  from trade agreements materialize   Trade is very important to U S  agriculture  but it is no panacea  despite what we are often told                           On paper  CAFTA appears to offer opportunities for some U S  farmers and negatives for others   The magnitude of these pluses and minuses is  of course  a big part of the debate   Overall  in theory at least  U S  agriculture should benefit  but the projected net benefits would be modest   Analysis by American Farm Bureau Federation economists estimates that U S   agricultural exports will be  1 5 billion a year higher by the time the agreement is fully effective    some 15 18 years from now   If we put that  1 5 billion dollars increase by 2024 into today  s dollars  it is actually equal to only about  930 million assuming an average 2 3 percent annual inflation rate in those years   That level of increase would be only about 1 5 percent of our expected U S  agricultural exports for 2005                        Whether these modest theoretical benefits would actually materialize is a matter of dispute   Skeptics doubt CAFTA DR customers are capable of becoming good customers anytime soon  since average per capita income in CAFTA DR countries is only about  2 200 a year   About a third of the population lives on  2 a day or less   The potential for big gains is also limited because the United States already dominates agricultural trade to the CAFTA DR countries    accounting for about 46 percent of all agricultural exports to the region   To be sure  U S  exporters would pay lower tariffs  but the prospects for significantly expanding the volume of exports beyond current levels are speculative to many                          U S  sugar producers oppose CAFTA DR because this agreement permits increased sugar imports of up to 153 000 tons a year from these six countries and because it establishes a precedent for allowing more sugar imports in future free trade agreements that are being negotiated   They prefer to address sugar reform in the multilateral negotiations of the WTO  where all sugar producing countries  policies would be reformed  rather than the piecemeal approach through bilateral FTA s                           We also need to consider very carefully whether CAFTA helps U S  businesses and workers    including in agriculture    better compete in the global economy or in fact worsens their competitive disadvantages   This agreement has virtually nothing in it to address the cost advantages that companies will enjoy from less effective labor and environmental standards if they produce in CAFTA countries versus the United States   Regarding child labor  CAFTA actually gives up the mechanism we have had since 2000 to enforce international standards against abusive child labor through our Generalized System of Preferences program   If one of the big reasons for CAFTA is to help boost economic and social progress in those countries  it is a glaring omission for this administration to take this clear step backwards on our ability to press our trading partners to more effectively combat abusive child labor practices                          Realistically  for U S  agriculture  the modest opportunities we are promised under CAFTA pale in comparison to the benefits of a successful outcome in the current WTO negotiations   In those negotiations we have the potential to gain better access to a global market worth some  329 billion  while the CAFTA sub regional market is valued at about  3 3 billion   Fighting for a good WTO agreement is where we really should be investing our energy and political capital                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
