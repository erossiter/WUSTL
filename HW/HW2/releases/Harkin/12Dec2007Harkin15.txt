 Washington  D C   U S  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today joined his colleagues to take federal action to curb the predatory mortgage abuses imposed on working families  The Homeownership Preservation and Protection Act of 2007 requires accountability by mortgage lenders  makes deceptive loan practices illegal  and provides adequate oversight to ensure the industry is acting accordingly  Among other provisions  the legislation would ban incentives mortgage brokers receive when they charge homebuyers higher fees  The U S  is facing a huge mortgage crisis with over two million homeowners facing foreclosure       A large share of subprime mortgages went to those who could have qualified for mortgages at regular rates  In many cases  the elderly were specifically targeted by predators to refinance their homes at outrageous terms  stripping them of their equity in their homes and a comfortable retirement with large profits to the mortgage maker  Harkin believes that the law needs to be changed to make clear that mortgage providers have a legal responsibility to treat customers fairly        For years some predators within the mortgage industry schemed future homebuyers with outrageous fees and extreme interest rates  said Harkin  This bill is tough and it will end abuses once and for all  It requires that mortgage originators have a real responsibility to their customers  It allows for a sane and healthy market that will allow American families to safely buy homes     I strongly support this bill  It is a strong and comprehensive effort to reform this industry  said Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller  Predatory lending is a serious problem and is one of the primary causes of the current sub prime foreclosure crisis  In order to prevent this from happening again  it is imperative that important reforms are made to correct this market failure       The rate of home foreclosures in Iowa is among the highest in the nation  Already  3 100 Iowans have called a special hotline established nearly three months ago by Iowa Attorney General Tom Miller to help distressed borrowers  Iowans seeking help should call the hotline at   877  622 4866       The Harkin supported Homeownership Preservation and Protection Act will     Establish new protections for all borrowers  It will prohibit brokers from steering prime borrowers to more expensive subprime loans  create a fiduciary duty for mortgage brokers towards borrowers  and provide for a duty of good faith and fair dealing toward borrowers for all lenders         Establish new protections for subprime borrowers and borrowers who get nontraditional mortgages  It will require a real analysis of the borrowers ability to repay the loan  The bill prohibits prepayment penalties and Yield Spread Premiums  YSPs  on these loans  and requires that these loans provide a net tangible benefit to the borrower        Provide strong remedies to make sure these standards are met  It will allow state attorneys general enforce the provisions of the law  and does not preempt state law         Provide for limited liability for holders of a mortgage made in violation of law  whether it is the original lender or a subsequent investment trust  Unlike current law  which puts the burden on the borrower to find the party responsible for causing the harm  the legislation allows the borrower to go directly to the current mortgage holder for a cure                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
