   Washington  D C   U S  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today made the following statement in response to President Bushs speech discussing the results of the Monitoring of the Future Survey  commissioned by the National Institute of Drug Abuse  NIDA   showing a drop in teen drug abuse except in the cases of prescription painkillers like OxyContin and Vicodin  Harkins health and education appropriations subcommittee funds NIDA     Its sad that the President would choose this moment to propose a funding cut for the National Institute on Drug Abuse  the agency that paid for the Monitoring the Future study and leads the federal governments efforts on drug abuse research  The 2008 funding bill that the President vetoed would have increased funding for NIDA by  24 million  Regrettably  while the Presidents public statements laud the Institutes results  his budget calls for a cut  His hypocrisy should not go overlooked       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
