      WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today released the following statement regarding the estate tax and minimum wage legislation in the Senate             The idea of linking a near repeal of the estate tax with a modest increase in the minimum wage was a transparent ploy by the Republicans that the American people saw right through            For more than nine years  Democrats have fought to increase the minimum wage for working Americans at the very bottom of the economic ladder  Republicans have blocked any increase            Now  three months before the election  Republicans are spooked by polls showing overwhelming support for a minimum wage increase   So they tried to play   Let  s Make a Deal    But it was a toxic deal that  s bad for this country            The Republicans crafted a twisted minimum wage bill that actually hurts many workers    it cuts wages for nearly a million workers who earn tips   And they tied it to a near repeal of the estate tax    costing the treasury three quarters of a trillion dollars over 10 years    with 100 percent of the benefits going to the wealthiest estates in America            The near repeal of the estate tax would give away money we don  t have  overwhelmingly to people who don  t need it  And attempting to hold a minimum wage increase hostage to this latest tax break for the rich takes cynicism to a new level  even for this Congress                This so called   deal   is unfair  unaffordable  and unconscionable  It is a deal the Senate rightfully rejected                              Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
