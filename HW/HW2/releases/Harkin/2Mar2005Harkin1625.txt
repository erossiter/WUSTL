        Today  however  our focus is on the President  s proposed budget for education   And I must speak frankly  this budget is inadequate   It does not live up to the President  s own commitments              Overall  the President  s budget proposes to cut funding for education    the first cut in education funding in 10 years   It underfunds the No Child Left Behind Act by  12 billion   It leaves behind nearly 3 million children who could be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the authorized level   And it underfunds special education by  3 6 billion  just 4 months after the President signed a new IDEA reauthorization law            So this budget is about broken commitments       promises not kept            The impact of this budget on my State of Iowa would be severe   Iowa stands to lose  14 1 million for career and technical education   2 4 million for education technology   3 4 million for safe and drug free schools   1 million for family literacy programs and  1 1 million for comprehensive school reform   That  s money the state gets now  but would not get under the President  s budget            Unfortunately  the cuts come at an especially bad time   Some 11 000 schools across the country have been designated   in need of improvement       meaning they failed to make adequate yearly progress for 2 years in a row  and now face sanctions   That  s almost twice as many schools as last year   And the number will go up sharply next year  when the AYP requirements get tougher   With this new budget  you are asking for reform without resources   You  re asking local school districts to make dramatic academic gains at the same time you are cutting their funding   Frankly  this is giving the No Child Left Behind Act a bad name   This law  s credibility is in real jeopardy             How can we expect those 11 000 schools that are   in need of improvement   to hire better teachers and to close the achievement gap  at a time when their funding is being cut            The good news in the President  s budget is supposed to be his  1 5 billion   high school initiative      Unfortunately  this funding is more than offset by  2 2 billion in cuts to other education programs  like vocational education  GEAR UP  TRIO  and smaller learning communities              So here  s what  s happening  The President eliminates  2 2 billion for high schools  replaces it with  1 5 billion  and calls it an initiative   That is exactly the kind of help our schools can do without              I am particularly concerned about the proposed elimination of the Perkins vocational education program   You have justified this cut by saying the funds will be redirected to the high school initiative   However  in Iowa  30 percent of Perkins funds go to community colleges   This program has helped Iowa develop important relationships between high schools and colleges to train young Iowans for the jobs of the future   It also stimulates economic development by improving the skills of our workforce   Under the high school initiative  Iowa  s community colleges would no longer be eligible for this funding            Unfortunately  these cuts in education funding do not exactly come as a surprise   At this point  the Administration  s priorities are all too clear   The President  s budget insists on two new tax cuts next year    worth a whopping  146 billion over 10 years   Yet this same budget proposes to cut funding for education   To put it mildly  these are very misplaced priorities            Madame Secretary  I look forward to your own views of these priorities   And I thank you for appearing before our subcommittee                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
