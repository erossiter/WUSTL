 Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Congressman Eliot Engel  D NY  today made the following statements in response to the findings of their congressionally mandated report on the cocoa industrys progress in eradicating child labor    In 2001  after working with the chocolate and cocoa industries  the two Congressional leaders created the Harkin Engel Protocol to develop a framework for the cocoa industry to do away with the worst forms of child and slave labor in the growing and processing of cocoa beans and their derived products  When industry leaders did not meet the Protocols 2005 deadline  Harkin and Engel commissioned Tulane University to serve as an oversight body to give an impartial assessment of the cocoa industrys efforts to implement the protocol  Its findings were released today  Tulanes quarterly report will come out on January  2008    Im pleased that the Tulane report confirms that the Harkin Engel protocol has already made a real difference in terms of turning the spotlight on this issue  We have made progress  For example  there are now serious discussions between industry and government leaders on eradicating child labor in the cocoa industry  While this news is promising  it must fuel us as we continue our hard work and push for further results  said Harkin  Of major concern are the reports revelations that the industry implemented certification process lacks a benchmark system and their skepticism about the independence of the verification component  I look forward to reviewing Tulanes next report delving into these issues further as well as addressing the industrys shortfall in excluding non governmental organizations in their discussions  All parties must work together to comprehensively address this serious issue    The Tulane report makes it clear that business leaders and government officials have already made real progress in bringing the issue of slave labor in the West African cocoa industry to the forefront  said Engel  However  the report also indicates that much remains to be done before the July 2008 deadline  The deadline is fast approaching  and I hope that government surveys of the cocoa industry in both Ghana and Cote DIvoire  as well as a completely independent verification process  are soon in place    Yesterday  Harkin  Engel and 20 of their colleagues sent a letter to the Chairman of the Global Issues Group  John Claringbould  urging him and his industry colleagues to heed next years deadline in implementing a credible certification and verification program for improved labor practices in Ghana and Ivory Coast       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
