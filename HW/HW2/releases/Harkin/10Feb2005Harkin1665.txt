        These programs form the vital farm income safety net we included in the 2002 farm bill     said Harkin     While the president has trumpeted efforts to cut payments to mega corporate farms  he is neglecting to mention the nearly  1 billion cuts to programs for farmers across the board in 2006 alone   These cuts would be hardest felt by family sized farmers struggling to make ends meet   I support payment limits and tried to include such measures in the 2002 farm bill  but I will fight efforts to undermine the safety net that average farms do not exploit but utilize to survive             The across the board five percent cut being proposed by the president is particularly harmful to the typical Iowa farmer   These cuts limit eligibility for marketing loan benefits and reduce farmers   support over all  especially when commodity prices fall below reasonable levels   The income protection is in the form of direct and counter cyclical payments as well as marketing loan benefits   Consider this          Assume an Iowa farmer has 250 acres of corn and 150 acres of soybeans on base acres in 2004   Also assume this Iowan had average payment yields and average actual yields last year   If President Bush  s proposal had been in place for the 2004 crop year  this Iowan would have lost  7 700 in farm income in one year alone   This may not seem like a lot  but to a farmer earning  40 000 annually  it represents a nearly 20 percent drop in income   These cuts to the vital farm income safety net included in the 2002 farm bill would impact all farm program participants and have a very damaging impact on family farmers in Iowa and across the country          Below are cuts proposed to farm income safety net programs for 2006 alone           383 million CUT from direct and counter cyclical payments  marketing loan benefits and dairy programs     432 million CUT in loan benefits   This cut would severely limit the amount of a farmer  s crop eligible for marketing loans   If this proposal were in place for 2004  just 54 percent of Iowa  s corn production would be eligible    200 million CUT in program benefits from tightening payment limitations     130 million CUT in dairy price support                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
