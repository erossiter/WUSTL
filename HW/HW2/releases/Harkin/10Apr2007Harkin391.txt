      Washington  D C    Just before the Senate kicked off debate on the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act today  Senator Tom Harkin released the following statement   Harkin is the lead sponsor of the legislation  which would expand embryonic stem cell research and provide hope to millions of Americans who suffer from juvenile diabetes  Parkinson s  cancer  spinal cord injuries  and many other diseases and conditions             Nine months ago  when President Bush vetoed H R  810  we promised that we d be back   Well  here we are             In a few minutes  the Senate will begin debate on two stem cell bills   I will vote for both  but I want to be very clear   The only one that really matters is S  5  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act   This is the one bill that  at long last  will unleash some of the most exciting and promising research of modern times   S  5 will lift the president s arbitrary restrictions on stem cell research and bring hope to millions of Americans who suffer from juvenile diabetes  Parkinson s  cancer  spinal cord injuries  and many other diseases and conditions             Many reporters have been asking  Do we have enough votes to override a veto   I don t know the answer   It s going to be very close   Either way  we ll have more than the 63 we got last year   The momentum is clearly going in the right direction             I also remain hopeful that President Bush will decide to sign the bill   A lot has changed since last year   We had an election in which the voters clearly spoke in favor of stem cell research   Just a few weeks ago  the director of the National Institutes of Health  Dr  Elias Zerhouni   who the President appointed   said the policy needs to be changed               Furthermore  this is a different bill than H R  810   It now includes the text of last year s Specter Santorum bill  which promoted alternative ways of deriving stem cells   The President strongly endorsed the Specter Santorum bill last year   Well  now he has a chance to enact it  by signing S  5             And another thing  The President s spokespeople keep saying there s only one moral line he won t cross on this issue and that is   Federal taxpayer dollars shouldn t be used to destroy embryos   If that s the case  the President shouldn t have a problem with S  5   Our bill would not lift the ban on using federal funding to destroy embryos   That ban is contained in the  Dickey amendment  that s attached to the Labor H appropriations bill every year  and S  5 wouldn t change that               So the President doesn t have to cross any moral line to sign the bill   He can sign it with a clear conscience  knowing he s bringing hope to millions of people in this country who are suffering                                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
