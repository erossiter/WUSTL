   WASHINGTON  DC    In a letter to the U S  Postmaster General John Potter  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today expressed concerns about the possible closing of the U S  Postal Serivce  USPS  processing and distribution center in Sioux City   Citing a loss of local jobs  delays in the delivery of mail and the closure of a 150 year old landmark in Iowa  Harkin questioned the postal service  s process and rationale for a possible consolidation of the Sioux City postal distribution center            Only months ago the citizens of Sioux City were assured that no further postal services would be shifted from their city and out of Iowa     Harkin said     But now the postal service has begun a process that often results in closing these postal centers   I urge the Postmaster General and the United States Postal Service to carefully weigh the costs this will impose on Sioux City and surrounding areas             Currently  the USPS has begun a feasibility study to examine the possibility of moving all mail processing operations from Sioux City  Iowa to Sioux Falls  South Dakota   Nationwide  such feasibility studies have resulted in consolidation of every facility with the exception of one   Sioux City is Iowa  s fourth largest city and the local postal center serves its residents and the surrounding area          A copy of the letter is pasted below                             January 4  2006            John Potter Postmaster General and CEO United States Postal Service 475 L  Enfant Plaza Washington  D C  20260       Dear Mr  Potter              I am writing to voice my strong concerns regarding the Area Mail Processing study that is currently being conducted to determine the feasibility of moving all mail processing operations from Sioux City  Iowa to Sioux Falls  South Dakota               As you may know  earlier this year  Saturday mail processing operations for Sioux City were shifted to Sioux Falls   At that time a spokesperson for the USPS publicly stated that there would not be any additional efforts to shift more processing operations  and my staff received similar assurances from the USPS legislative liaison             Given these assurances  it was with some surprise that I learned that that the USPS announced a study examining the feasibility of centralizing Sioux City  s mail processing less than one month later   I am particularly concerned that USPS would undertake this study given that  nationwide  with only one exception  the result of the every USPS study of this type has been consolidation of the facility  calling into question the methodology used   The decision to initiate the study is even more puzzling given that the USPS is conducting a simultaneous feasibility study for nearby Carroll  Iowa            As you know  I have long been a supporter of the USPS and am well aware of the challenges that the postal service faces both in the decline of first class mail volume and in the escrow burdens that USPS has been forced to assume   That is why I support S  662  the Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act that is currently before the Senate and will address many of the systemic problems faced by the postal service and place it on solid financial footing for the future           However  it seems highly unlikely that forcing a consolidation that would involve moving mail processing operations for Iowa  s 4th largest city entirely out of Iowa and out of the Hawkeye Postal District can provide savings that outweigh the high costs to the Sioux City community   In addition to serious job losses and the elimination of the 150 year old postmark of this proud and vibrant city  Sioux City would suffer very real negative impacts on its timely mail delivery   Currently  one day delivery is possible in the greater Siouxland area including Nebraska  and to the state capitol in Des Moines   This would no longer be the case if operations are consolidated               I expect that as the USPS moves forward with the feasibility study  that the costs to Sioux City will be carefully considered and fully reflected in the decision   I strongly urge you to exercise caution in proceeding with any further consolidation of operations in western Iowa  and I will look forward to receiving a detailed briefing on the exact factors analyzed  the timeline of decision making  and the methodology used in weighing the costs and benefits in the ongoing feasibility report                  Sincerely           Tom Harkin United States Senator         cc   Doug Morrow  Hawkeye District Manager cc   Sylvester Black  Vice President of Western Operations        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
