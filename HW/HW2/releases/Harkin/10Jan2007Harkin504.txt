         WASHINGTON  DC    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that he is cosponsoring legislation that would require Congress to vote before the President escalates troop levels in Iraq   Specifically  the legislation says that no funds can be spent to send additional troops to Iraq unless Congress approves the President  s proposed escalation of American forces   The legislation does not cut off funding for our troops already in Iraq   Harkin has repeatedly called for a new course in Iraq  specifically calling for a political solution              My position is clear  there is nothing to be gained by escalating our involvement in Iraq and putting more of our brave young men and women in the midst of a civil war  The deteriorating situation in Iraq cannot be solved through military action  it requires a political solution  Only when the Iraqi government faces a firm timetable for U S  redeployment will it have the incentive to resolve its differences and stand on its own            The President  s new strategy sounds like much of the same  In fact there have been three   troop surges   in Iraq in 2004  2005 and 2006 and the sectarian violence has worsened  Iraqi leaders have made the same empty promises of reconciliation and reigning in the militias and each time have not fulfilled these goals            President Bush has long said he would listen to the generals on the ground when it comes to making decisions about troop levels  Yet despite our top military leaders repeated assertions that bringing in more American troops will not solve the security situation in Iraq  it is clear that is where the president is headed              I would like to ask the President  where will these troops come from   We already have a military that is stretched too thin   This move would come at a tremendous expense to the men and woman in our military  and to their families  friends and communities   Instead of protecting our home front  our National Guard is spending more and more time away from home  sacrificing our homeland security  Our dedicated soldiers are not getting the necessary recoup time in between their tours of duty   More and more soldiers are losing their lives  and countless others are sustaining life altering injuries   Returning soldiers must also bear the burden of incredible mental strain  even after the fighting stops               The priority for Democrats right now is the safety and well being of our heroic servicemen and women  Democrats will not deny funding needed to protect our troops who are currently in harm  s way  But the Constitution gives Congress the ability to say that we will not provide additional funds to escalate this war when the facts on the ground show us that it is not in our national security interest and it will not improve the situation we see now in Iraq            Shifting our troops to strategic locations within the Middle East would allow the U S  to refocus our efforts on the many pressing threats facing our nation  The sooner we redeploy our military and strategic assets  the better off we will be                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
