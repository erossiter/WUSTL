              I am deeply disappointed that the Senate has missed an historic opportunity to pass strong  comprehensive immigration legislation today that would help bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows  and that would help secure our borders and enforce our laws   Instead  Senate Republicans have chosen to play politics and block this much needed reform                 I continue to believe that we need three components as part of comprehensive immigration reform   One  we need tough  consistent  effective enforcement of reformed immigration laws   Two  we need to enforce sanctions against employers who hire immigrants unauthorized to work   And  three  we need a temporary worker program  with documentation  that gives immigrants a reasonable path to earned legalization by paying fines  learning English  and paying back taxes                      It is long past due that we find a constructive  positive way to bring these people out of the shadows and into the sunlight   I am hopeful  that after the recess  the Senate once again addresses this issue so we can achieve a just and fair immigration system    one that is true to our values and tradition                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
