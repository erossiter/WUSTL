         Seniors wanted a simple prescription drug benefit  and what they got is a complicated and confusing mess     said Harkin     While this amendment won  t fix the crux of the problem  it will help ease pressure on our seniors by giving them more time to sort through the numerous and confusing choices                    Currently  seniors have until May 15  2006 to enroll in the benefit or face a late enrollment penalty   The benefit also restricts seniors from changing plans in between open seasons   This amendment would give seniors and people with disabilities added time to research and make the best decisions for their health care and it would allow a one time chance to correct any initial mistakes made during the first year of implementation             Harkin has been hearing from many Iowans complaining that the new prescription drug benefit has been confusing for seniors and people with disabilities   Medicare beneficiaries face a number of prescription drug options  and choosing the right plan has been challenging for many  There are over 40 plans to for seniors to choose from in Iowa alone   Harkin did not support the prescription drug plan passed in Congress because it failed to provide a simple benefit and lower drug prices                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
