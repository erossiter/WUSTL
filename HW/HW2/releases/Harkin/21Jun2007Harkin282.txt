 The G 4 meeting this week offered some promise in breaking the current stalemate in Doha Round negotiations  I am very disappointed that discussion among trade ministers from these countries broke down  particularly since it now looks unlikely that an agreement will be reached any time soon   As I have told both U S  negotiators and officials from other WTO member countries over the last several months  it is crucial that the U S  proposal in domestic agricultural support be matched by similar improvements in offers from our trading partners in market access and export competition  We should have seen more willingness to match the U S  offer  but we did not see it  Without such reciprocity  the entire effort could well fail       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
