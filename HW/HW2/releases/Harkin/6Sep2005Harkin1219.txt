      WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today announced that the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has begun accepting applications for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program  AFGP    Fire departments can submit applications through 5 00 p m  EST  Friday  October 2  2005  These funds are used by the nation  s fire departments to increase the effectiveness of firefighting operations  to improve firefighting health and safety programs and to establish or expand fire prevention and safety programs                   These funds can help first responders buy needed equipment  update technology  and pay for essential training     said Harkin     I encourage fire departments in Iowa  particularly those in rural areas  to apply for these grants   This help can go a long way when it comes to protecting Iowa  s firefighters and keeping communities safe                  This year  an online tutorial is available to assist applicants in preparing this year s grants   The applicant tutorial is available thorough the www firegrantsupport com website   The tutorial is designed to instruct users on the preparation and submittal of competitive applications as well as an overview of the funding priorities and evaluation criteria  Fire departments who have questions regarding the fire prevention and safety grant opportunity should contact the help desk at 1 866 274 0960 or at firegrants dhs gov   During the application period  the help desk will operate Monday to Friday  from 8 00 am to 5 00 pm  EDT   but is prepared to revise hours of operation based on volume and demand              Although the program assists rural  urban  and suburban fire departments throughout the United States  it places a particular emphasis on rural fire departments     It requires that at least 60 percent of the funding must go to volunteer fire departments   This means that towns like Hartwick and Oelwein are not competing against Des Moines or Cedar Rapids   Additionally  the program requires only a 10 percent match in local funding   In today  s economy  this makes it possible for small fire departments to take advantage of the program                                        Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
