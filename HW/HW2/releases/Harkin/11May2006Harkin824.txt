           Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing to examine the Department of Agriculture  s avian influenza response plan  released in draft form last month                    Of course  it is critically important USDA have a strong  effective and dependable plan for prevention  surveillance  preparedness  and response to highly pathogenic avian influenza  especially the current strain of H5N1                    The H5N1 strain of avian influenza remains primarily an animal disease   But its ability to infect humans may increase over time  and it could change enough to cause a human pandemic   That is a possibility we have to prepare for                       In agriculture  H5N1 is not a possibility  it is a reality   Agriculture is already on the front lines of fighting highly pathogenic avian influenza overseas   The experts tell us it is not a matter of if the current H5N1 strain will reach birds in the United States   The question is when                 We must ensure that we have all the tools ready and all the plans in place to contain the disease and minimize the impact on the economy and food supply   USDA does have extensive experience with dealing with avian influenza   However  not all states have that same experience                    I am concerned about the abilities of states to fight an introduction of highly pathogenic avian influenza  especially if a particular outbreak is widespread and covers multiple states   In such a scenario  state resources will be taxed and USDA resources may be spread too thin   I am interested in hearing what kind of feedback USDA has received from states on its response plan  USDA must also work closely with other agencies across the federal government  obviously with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Department of Health and Human Services   It has become apparent that smuggling of poultry and exotic birds may be more important to the spread of avian influenza than the migratory patterns of wild birds   The H5N1 strain is thought to have gotten to Nigeria through illegal importation of infected poultry from Asia   We have to make sure that USDA and the Department of Homeland Security can keep out avian influenza that may come in through smuggling of birds                    USDA  s avian flu response plan highlights many problems the Department will have to deal with   It is obvious an outbreak would cause tremendous disruption   Quarantine procedures and restrictions on animal movements in areas where there has been an HPAI outbreak would disrupt normal operating procedures in surrounding livestock and poultry operations                    USDA must be working with poultry producers and livestock producers to ensure that business is minimally impacted while containing a bird flu outbreak   Certainly first responders to an HPAI outbreak must be protected as well    I am concerned about whether employees on poultry farms are receiving training and health protections  and whether USDA is playing a role in these efforts               The threat of avian influenza has sobering potential ramifications in animal and human health  and in economic and social impacts   I hope that the issues we bring up here today will help our nation prepare for the potentially devastating effects of avian influenza                                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
