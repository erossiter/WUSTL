      Washington  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today cosponsored a proposal to protect America by outlining a way forward in Iraq   The proposal makes three key policy statements about Iraq and moves to hold the Bush administration more accountable for a strategy for success in Iraq           The proposal  offered as an amendment to the Defense Authorization bill on the Senate floor establishes that 2006 must be a year of significant transition in Iraq to full Iraqi sovereignty  with Iraqis taking more and more responsibility for their own security   It requires the Bush administration advise the Iraqi people that U S  military forces will not stay indefinitely in Iraq  and that it is their responsibility to achieve the broad based and sustainable political environment essential for defeating the insurgency   Finally  it mandates that the president submit  on a quarterly basis  a plan for success to Congress and the American people that specifies the challenges and progress being made in Iraq with timetables for achieving our goals and estimated dates to bring our troops home               For more than three years  the American people have been told to stay the course   But   stay the course   is a slogan  not a strategy  and definitely not a plan for success in Iraq     Harkin said                 Americans and Iraqis alike need to know that the United States is not a permanent occupying force in Iraq   This notion provides the insurgents with a powerful recruiting tool  and eliminates the pressure on political leaders in the new Iraqi government to make the compromises necessary to achieve a broad based and sustainable political settlement              Our troops and their families deserve the respect and gratitude of the American people for their service and sacrifice   The best way to honor them is to establish  at long last   a strategy for success and stability in Iraq               This administration needs prodding   By requiring the President to report regularly on specific goals  I hope to force him to do what he has failed to do so far    present a comprehensive plan that leads a stable Iraq and a redeployment of American troops                   A Summary of the Proposal Follows           UNITED STATES POLICY ON IRAQ ACT       Getting Answers to the American People on the War in Iraq    Mission NOT Accomplished             For too long  the Bush administration has failed to lay out a clear strategy for success in Iraq to the American people   Their rosy statements about the progress of the war are not matched by the conditions on the ground   In their few appearances before the Congress  the Secretaries of Defense and State have failed to answer the most basic questions about our progress in the war or provide even the simplest benchmarks by which the American people could measure our progress   Democrats are offering an amendment to the Defense Authorization Bill that holds the Administration accountable for its actions and requires it to present a real plan for success              DEMOCRATS OFFER THE FOLLOWING ASSESSMENT ABOUT THE WAR             Our troops and their families deserve the respect and gratitude of the American people for their service and sacrifice   The Administration has said that as the Iraqis stand up  we can stand down   Democrats believe we should see a significant transition to full Iraqi sovereignty in 2006 so that our troops can begin coming home   We also believe the Iraqi people must understand that the U S  military will not stay in Iraq indefinitely  they must achieve the political stability necessary to defeat the insurgency              THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION MUST PROVIDE A PLAN  It is essential that the Bush administration submit an unclassified strategy for success in Iraq to the Congress and the American people specifying how and when our troops can begin coming home             An Assessment of the Bush Administration  s Actions to Achieve Progress in Iraq   The Bush administration must provide information on its efforts to convince Iraq  s communities to make the necessary compromises for a political settlement  efforts to engage the international community to help stabilize Iraq  efforts to strengthen the capacity of Iraq  s government ministries  efforts to accelerate the delivery of basic services  and efforts to train Iraqi security forces so those forces can protect Iraq on their own               An Assessment of the Compromises Made by the Iraqi People to Achieve the Broad Based and Sustainable Political Settlement              An Unclassified Report to Congress and the American People   The Bush administration has classified most significant information about their Iraq war plans and kept that information from the Congress   The President should submit to the Congress and the American people an unclassified plan for success in Iraq   We deserve to know the conditions we seek to establish  the challenges we face in achieving these conditions  and the progress we are making   This report should also include                The number of Iraqi battalions that must be able to operate independently or take the lead in counterinsurgency operations              The number of Iraqi special police units that must be able to operate independently or take the lead in policing              The number of regular police that must be trained and equipped               The ability of Iraq  s Federal ministries and provincial and local governments to independently sustain  direct and coordinate Iraq  s security forces            THE BENCHMARKS FOR SUCCESS   The Bush administration must also provide benchmarks by which their success can be measured   This includes the criteria by which to measure the progress being made and a schedule for meeting these conditions               A PLAN FOR BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME   As it lays out a clear strategy with benchmarks  the Bush administration must also provide a campaign plan with estimated dates for the phased redeployment of our troops from Iraq as each condition is met  with the understanding that unexpected contingencies may arise               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
