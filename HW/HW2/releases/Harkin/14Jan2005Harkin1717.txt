        If there is one thing America has in abundance it is food     Harkin said     If there is one thing people in places like Indonesia  Darfur and Ethiopia need it is food   We have the ability now to meet our food aid commitments and ensure that victims of the tsunami  as well as in other parts of the world  do not have to worry about whether they will have enough food for the day             Ensuring that America is meeting its food aid commitments goes beyond the immediate need of those around the world for food assistance   It also makes available food assistance that supports food for work and food for education programs to help affected people recover from the catastrophe beyond the time when there is an immediate threat of starvation              Food aid  particularly in the tsunami disaster area  will be necessary for months down the road  not just in these weeks immediately following the disaster     Harkin said     In South Asia  as well as in other parts of the world  food aid is an important tool to help societies rebuild and get back on their feet   Replenishing our food aid accounts and meeting our commitments ensures this aid will be available in the future             Though no specific amount is requested in the letter  estimates are that it will take at least  1 billion to meet the need   This includes meeting preexisting needs  needs as a result of the tsunamis  and replenishing the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust   However  the senators note that efforts to meet emergency needs should not come at the expense of existing programs or by reducing aid to people in other developing countries     Such a move     the senators wrote    would be tantamount to feeding one group with the seed corn that another group was supposed to sow for crops the following year             Senator Harkin has made this one of his top priorities when Congress considers the supplemental appropriations request in the coming weeks   Harkin also raised the issue with secretary of agriculture designate Governor Mike Johanns during the governor  s confirmation hearing before the Senate Agriculture Committee          A copy of the letter is attached                           January 14  2005            The President       The White House      Washington  D C  20500         Dear Mr  President          The December 26 tsunami which struck several countries in the Indian Ocean Basin is now known to have killed over 150 000 people  with hundreds of thousands or even millions of others injured or left homeless by the catastrophe   Many of these people have lost all their possessions  and find themselves in dire need of essentials such as food  clean water  medical attention  and shelter    Over the past several decades  the U S  food aid programs run by the U S  Agency for International Development and the U S  Department of Agriculture have demonstrated their capacity to help people in need  but their fiscal 2005 funding will have to be increased for them to do the job properly          Even before the massive tsunami struck  other unanticipated natural disasters and wars had strained these agencies  ability to provide emergency food aid while still maintaining long term commitments to development assistance projects   According to one estimate provided to the Senate Agriculture Committee by US AID officials  customary food aid contributions by the United States and other donor countries were expected to fall  1 2 billion short of emergency needs worldwide as of December 9  2004          As part of the supplemental appropriations bill you are planning to submit within the next several weeks to cover the cost of military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  we urge you to include a request for food aid programs to help the tsunami victims in South Asia as well as to address the food aid shortfall generated by pre existing emergency assistance needs in Africa and elsewhere in the world   A portion of that money should be used to reimburse recent withdrawals from the Bill Emerson Humanitarian Trust          It is crucial that you take these steps and not attempt to meet the emergency needs by further cutting existing programs   We believe that previous cuts made to developmental food aid programs in this fiscal year should be restored   It would not be appropriate to help the people of South Asia by reducing aid to people in other developing countries   Such a move would be tantamount to feeding one group with the seed corn that another group was supposed to sow for crops the following year   We urge you to consider carefully this situation and take whatever actions are necessary to ensure our ability to meet all of our food aid commitments                                 Sincerely
