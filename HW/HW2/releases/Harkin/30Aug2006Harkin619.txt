      This Labor Day  I am freshly reminded of the struggles and sacrifices that made possible the decent pay and working conditions that most Iowans enjoy today   In late August  I visited an excellent museum in Lucas  Iowa that is dedicated to the famous United Mine Workers leader and former Lucas resident John L  Lewis   The museum includes old photos of the grimy and hazardous conditions endured by Iowa  s early coal miners  many of whom were young boys                   As the son of an Iowa coal miner  the museum in Lucas really struck a chord with me  one display included old carbide lamps  just like the ones my dad had from his mining days    At the same time  it reminded me that union members were on the front lines fighting for the 40 hour workweek  the minimum wage  employer provided health insurance and pensions   Organized labor led the way in passing legislation to ensure fair and safe workplaces and in championing many other employee safety nets such as Social Security  Medicare  and the Family and Medical Leave Act                   Unfortunately  many of the great achievements of the 20th century labor movement are under attack as we move into the 21st century   Powerful groups are attempting to roll back workers   right to family and medical leave   The minimum wage has been frozen for the last nine years  At the current  5 15 an hour level  it is not a living wage  It is a poverty wage   And this year  the Sago and Melville mine disasters reminded us that skimping on worker safety can lead to tragic results          Meanwhile  private companies have been allowed to default on their pensions  threatening the retirement security of millions of Americans   And the drive to privatize Social Security threatens to dramatically slash future benefits            Why is the clock being turned backward   Why are Americans   hard earned workplace and employee rights being eroded   Certainly  a big factor is the shrinking of union membership in recent decades   In 2005  12 5 percent of workers were union members  down from a high of 20 percent in 1983   Historically  unions have given Americans a strong voice in their workplace   Today  fewer and fewer workers have that advantage            So this Labor Day should be a wake up call   The gains of past decades    everything from the 40 hour workweek to a meaningful minimum wage    are threatened   It is time for ordinary Iowans to speak up    and to write to your members of Congress    in defense of workplace rights and the pillars of economic security   We can  t allow our hard won victories to slip away               Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
