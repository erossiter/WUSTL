                  Washington  D C    Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  and Senator Johnny Isakson  R GA  today introduced the Preventive Medicine and Public Health Training Act  legislation that will address the shortage of physicians trained in Preventive Medicine  The bill would provide training grants to medical schools  teaching hospitals  schools of public health  and public health departments to fund existing programs and in some cases develop new residency training programs in Preventive Medicine                             Investing in our public health infrastructure also means investing in the only medical specialty that provides board certification to physicians in public health   said Harkin    One way to do that is by making sure we fund the residency programs that will produce our next generation of public health leaders   Whether leading public health agencies or providing preventive health care  these physicians are essential to our health care system                            Unfortunately  due to a lack of funding support  the Preventive Medicine specialty has experienced a decline in the number of physicians trained in the last eight years   The number of preventive medicine residency programs has decreased from 90 in 1999 to 75 today   Since residents receive training in both clinical  hospital  and non clinical settings  residency programs typically do not fully benefit from Graduate Medical Education  GME  funding provided through Medicare  Often times  residents are asked to either pay out of pocket or identify their own funding source to cover residency training costs  This serves as a disincentive to dedicate one s career to public health  even though the system needs more preventive medicine physicians                           Preventive Medicine is the only medical specialty that requires training in both clinical medicine and public health  Doctors trained in Preventive Medicine work in both clinical and non clinical settings and work to prevent disease through screening services before chronic disease has a chance to develop   Many Preventive Medicine physicians focus their careers on such pressing public health issues as obesity  childhood and elderly vaccinations  patient safety  health promotion  and emergency preparedness                           Today  there are fewer and fewer trained public health physicians available to fill essential leadership roles in public health departments  in hospitals and clinics  in research  and in the workplace   said Harkin    We must provide better incentives to people entering the medical field to pursue careers in Preventive Medicine  or we ll see this shortage grow to terrible proportions                        The bill has been endorsed by the American College of Preventive Medicine and the National Association of Community Health Centers                                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
