              WASHINGTON  D C    Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today said that a grant from the U S  Department of Energy would transform ethanol production at the Broin Plant in Emmetsburg  Iowa   The grant will accelerate the development of a bio refinery that utilizes both corn and cellulosic feedstocks  and increases overall output to 125 million gallons of ethanol per year                        These biorefinery grant awards that the Department of Energy announced today represent a major step forward toward the commercialization of ethanol production from cellulosic feedstocks   said Harkin    Iowa has been a leader in the production of ethanol from corn as well as the production of biodiesel   This support for Broin s Liberty project in Emmetsburg means that Iowa will be at the forefront of biofuels from cellulosic feedstocks as well   For several years  I and many others have envisioned and supported this technology pathway  so it is very rewarding to see this major step toward fruition of that vision                 This award is testimony to the potential of Broin s technology as well as their business plan   continued Harkin    I congratulate the Broin team on winning this award                    The first cellulosic feedstock for the Emmetsburg operation will be corn cobs as well as cellulosic components of corn kernels  In addition  the bio refinery facility will also take waste streams from the grain ethanol operations as a feedstock   The lignin that is separated away from the sugars during pretreatment will be used to provide power to both the grain ethanol and cellulose ethanol operations  greatly reducing the need for petroleum feedstocks in the expanded production facility   Overall ethanol production will increase from the current level of 50 million gallons per year to 125 million gallons per year                     Key elements of the conversion technology to be used by Broin were developed by DuPont with federal support  and were licensed for use in October 2006   Broin is one of the nation s top ethanol producers today   The expansion will utilize an existing infrastructure with projected costs for the increased capabilities at just over  200 million dollars   The expansion will take approximately 30 months and is slated to begin as soon as the terms of the agreement with the Department of Energy are finalized                                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
