               Four years ago today  the President landed on the U S S  Lincoln adorned in a pilot s suit  and announced that our mission was accomplished   And yet today  four years later  I received word that yet another Iowan was killed in Iraq  bringing the total loss of lives in my home state to 47                      Our troops remain mired in the midst of a civil war  with the President offering nothing but more empty rhetoric as a way forward                        The American people want a change of course in Iraq   By providing legislation that outlined firm benchmarks for the Iraqi government to take responsibility for its own security  and by setting a timeline for redeployment of our troops out of Iraq  the bill passed by the Democratic Congress did just that                       The President  though  has chosen to dig in his heels and ignore the mounting costs of this war   in real dollars  and most importantly  in the loss of American lives                       The President s veto is unfortunate  but he will not have the last word   Congress will get back to work to craft a bill that will provide our troops with the resources they need  and at the same time begin  at long last  to responsibly change our course in Iraq                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
