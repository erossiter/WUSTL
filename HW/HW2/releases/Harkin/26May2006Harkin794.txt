        Given General Hayden  s support of and key role in the Administration  s secret domestic spying program  I am not convinced that he is the right choice to head the CIA   Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act in 1978 to establish legal ways to conduct secret surveillance for suspected espionage and terrorism   In 2001  Congress made changes to that law to make it even easier to eavesdrop in these cases                As I have said all along  our intelligence services should be listening to terrorists   conversations  but they must do so within the law and the Constitution   Yet General Hayden glossed over the FISA law and pretended it simply didn  t exist   Our country needs a CIA director who is committed to aggressively fighting terrorism  but someone who also respects our laws and the rights of all Americans                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
