   Washington  D C   Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today issued the following statement on the Senates failure to move forward on comprehensive energy legislation  The bill included a number of important policies  including increased vehicle efficiency requirements  a renewable fuel standard  RFS  that requires 36 billion gallons of renewable fuels per year  numerous provisions to increase energy efficiency in buildings  industry  and the government  and tax incentives to promote energy efficiency and renewable fuels     We all know America needs to change its energy economy  Record high gas prices  concerns about energy supplies  and the unmistakable evidence of climate change are danger signs that cannot be ignored  And yet  our colleagues across the aisle thwarted an opportunity to enact the excellent energy bill that was passed by the House yesterday  We have every intention of reviving this bill and making our country more energy secure     I plan to fight hard to see that the Senate passes an energy bill that increases our RFS to 36 billion gallons by 2022  a measure I have fought for all year long  In addition  we must enact the first increase in CAF standards in 20 years  and provide a wide range of strong energy efficiency measures  covering lighting  appliances  buildings  industrial activities and government facilities       Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
