     Two months ago  the House of Representatives passed a bill that would vastly expand the number of stem cell lines eligible for federally funded research   This was a strong  bipartisan vote    238 to 194         Now it  s up to us in the Senate to pass the exact same bill    without any amendments          We don  t want it getting lost in a conference committee   We need to pass HR 810 by a strong  bipartisan majority  and send it straight to the President  s desk         Regrettably  opponents of this bill are trying to muddy the waters   They want the Senate to vote on 4  5  or 6 bills  some of which have nothing to do with stem cell research         Their strategy is simple  They  re trying to convince Senators that instead of supporting HR 810  they can vote for a different bill that promotes alternative methods of deriving stem cells   They figure that if they can pull enough Senators off of HR 810  that will keep us from getting the 60 we need to stop a filibuster         Let  s be clear   these alternative approaches are currently nothing but theories   They are hypothetical  speculative  and totally unproven            Should we pursue these alternative methods   Absolutely   But we cannot delay the pursuit of medical research on existing human embryonic stem cell lines while these more speculative methods are tested          As we stand here today  people we love are dying from Parkinson  s and ALS   Children are suffering from juvenile diabetes   People are losing the ability to walk due to spinal cord injuries   They don  t have 10 years to wait and see if these alternative methods pan out   They need help now            And that  s what HR 810 is all about           So  my friends  I urge you    and you  and you  and you    to call everyone you know across the country and ask them to tell their Senators to vote for HR 810 without any amendments                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
