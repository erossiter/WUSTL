        This is great news for IAAP workers   they ARE unsung heroes   They went to work every day  unknowingly handling radioactive and other hazardous materials without proper safety gear   For years  they could not even talk about the material to which they had been exposed because the information was       classified     said Harkin     As many workers became ill and were diagnosed with cancer  they couldn  t even tell their doctor why they were sick   I have heard their stories over the years   stories of pain  suffering and turmoil             Now that the NIOSH Radiation Health Advisory Board has accepted the petition  the Secretary of Health and Human Services  HHS  will have 30 days to act  and following that Congress has 30 days to act   If no actions are taken to block the board  s recommendation  the cohort will take effect by early April making IAAP workers from 1949 to 1974 that have one of 22 specified cancers automatically eligible to receive  150 000              It is high time that we meet our obligation to the workers of IAAP who were guaranteed compensation if they had become ill due to their work in these plants with the passage of Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act    said Harkin            In order to quickly move the IAAP petition  Harkin successfully added an amendment in June 2004 to the Defense Appropriations bill that speeds up efforts to administratively add workers to the cohort if recommended by HHS   Harkin also introduced an amendment in June 2004 that would allow IAAP workers to be automatically eligible for compensation   However  Republicans in Congress stripped the amendment from the Defense Authorization Bill            IAAP was the   forgotten    nuclear weapons plant until Harkin brought it to the government  s attention after being contacted by Robert Anderson  a constituent and former IAAP worker who has non Hodgkins lymphoma  in 1997   Anderson presented the petition to the board today    Harkin was a Senate sponsor of the original Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Act  EEOICPA  in 2000 and of a bill to amend it last fall  and he has obtained government funding for health screening of workers at the plant                      Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
