    The Supreme Court today announced their decision in the case of Goodman v  Georgia   Tony Goodman  the plaintiff in the case  is an inmate with paraplegia who uses a wheelchair for mobility   He was held in the Georgia State Prison for more than 23 hours a day in a cell so narrow he could not turn his wheelchair  Further  the state prison failed to make toilet and bathing facilities accessible to him  denied him needed medical care and excluded him from programs and activities because of his disability               Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  was the lead sponsor of the Americans with Disabilities Act  ADA  in the Senate and chair of the Senate Subcommittee on the Handicapped when the law was passed in 1990                  Today the Supreme Court spoke with a united voice in stating that the ADA does provide a remedy against state operated facilities                 This is an important step forward but I remain very concerned that disabled plaintiffs might need to prove independent Constitutional violations  in addition to discrimination based on a disability  in order to sue under the ADA               This decision still leaves open the possibility that the ADA will end up a patchwork solution to discrimination and place a very high burden on those who have been victims of discrimination which was not the intention of Congress in passing this law                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
