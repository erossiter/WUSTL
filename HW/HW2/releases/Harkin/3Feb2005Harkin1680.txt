        USDA has previously relied on OIE guidelines for BSE minimal risk  But the rule ignores OIE standards in key respects   There are three main areas of concern  protecting U S  consumers and encouraging their confidence  protecting U S  beef industry and demand for beef  and reopening closed foreign markets            Any measures taken by USDA should not compromise safety or negotiations with any our trading partners   Ideally  we should be able to work with our trading partners to come to generally agreed upon standards to trade beef products and live cattle under a minimal risk framework            Even though our export markets have traditionally been marginal compared to our domestic beef market  there have been real consequences to the loss of beef and cattle markets   In Iowa  packing plants have either slowed down their processing lines or have closed altogether   In August  the Iowa Quality Beef plant in Tama  Iowa closed because of higher cattle prices and the ban on beef exports to Japan  affecting 540 employees   On January 6  Tyson Foods decided to suspend operations at its Denison  Iowa plant due to a lack of cattle supply   This affects 275 employees   Tyson  much to their credit  is still paying the employees the equivalent of a shortened 32 hour work week  however              I look forward to having a dialog on USDA  s final minimal risk rule  and our efforts to restore our beef trade with overseas markets             Thank you again  Mr  Chairman                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
