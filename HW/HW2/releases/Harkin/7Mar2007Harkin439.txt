                   Today s hearing will examine an often overlooked  yet vital  portion of the farm bill  the research title   This provides a wide range of benefits to our society  from agricultural producers to consumers   Every kind of research related to food and agriculture is supported by the farm bill  from nutrition to food safety to energy to plant and animal diseases   So much of what we seek in our nation s future depends on the quality and quantity of our agricultural research  extension  and education programs                         Why is this investment critical for our future   Everyone likes to talk about research and advocate for it  and it is easy to see how a specific research program helps a particular industry or population   Sometimes  it is a bit more difficult to see how agricultural research touches everyone in the United States   I believe we take agricultural research for granted because many of us here in the United States take our food supply for granted   The undisputed common thread connecting every human being in the world is that each of us needs to eat to stay alive   Every fruit  vegetable  and cut of meat the public eats has a research story behind it   whether it is a story about improving its nutrition  safety  flavor  or production   The products of agricultural research are literally consumed by Americans every day of their lives   And I hope to ensure that  with this year s farm bill  every ounce of renewable energy that some day every American will use will have a research story behind it  too   The investment in agricultural research affects our daily lives now  and it will affect our lives even more in the future                      Agricultural research has already produced countless success stories   And we continue looking to it to guide our food production  eating habits  and our energy production   Because of agricultural research  we know that particular foods contain anti cancer compounds  we have developed crop varieties that are resistant to particular diseases  and we know that conservation is important to keeping farm land productive   This list could go on and on  as the successes are many   However  it is becoming apparent that future successes in agricultural research  education  and extension are not assured  and I hope this hearing will draw attention to this area of critical need                America s investment in agricultural research  extension  and education has fallen behind   That fact is clear when we compare agricultural research funding with other non defense research and development funding   The National Institutes of Health experienced a doubling of their funding over a period of four years from 1998 to 2002   In comparison  funding for the U S  Department of Agriculture s research  education  and extension programs have remained almost flat in inflation adjusted dollars over the past two decades   Biomedical research saves lives every day  there is no doubt about that   Agricultural research does the same  and when its vast potential is unleashed  the effects are profound   We only need to look at the work of Dr  Norman Borlaug to see the millions of lives saved by agricultural research                    I look forward to hearing from our witnesses today to give us their thoughts on how to reauthorize and invest in our agricultural research  extension  and education programs   I understand that there are a few proposals on how to make that happen  and I believe it s exciting   As we look to the new farm bill  we must not forget the vital role agricultural research plays in all of our lives                                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
