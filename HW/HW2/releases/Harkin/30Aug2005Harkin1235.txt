        I am deeply disappointed that the number of Americans and Iowans living in poverty continues to be on the rise   These numbers are yet another wake up call that the President  s destructive policies are failing hard working Americans  While the Bush Administration  s tax cuts and economic policies continue to prop up the wealthy  they are not helping working families and kids            Just in this past year alone  Midwesterners saw almost a three percent drop in their incomes   With over one in eight Iowa kids living in poverty and over ten percent of Iowans living in poverty  it is clear that that we must do more   It is time we steer this country in the right direction and do all we can to lift up average Americans   Instead of more tax cuts for the wealthy  we need make quality health care more affordable and do more to create strong  high paying jobs                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
