        Ninety seven percent of our transportation fuel today comes from oil  nearly two thirds of which is from foreign sources     Harkin said    This heavy dependence on petroleum undermines our energy security  wreaks havoc on consumers  costs jobs  and threatens our environment  We can stand by and fuel our addiction to foreign oil  or we can make an aggressive shift toward clean  domestic renewable fuels like ethanol and biodiesel             Harkin continued    This RFS legislation will firmly commit our nation to clean  secure sources of domestic energy   Our nation already has the capacity to produce nearly four billion gallons of ethanol a year  almost a third of it in Iowa   The biofuels industry  s output is on track to surpass even our ambitious target of eight billion gallons a year by 2012   Our bill will ensure that market demand for these fuels grows accordingly             Harkin noted that many of the biofuels plants to be built will be farmer owned  bringing tremendous added value to rural economies   For example  according to a recent study  each typical ethanol plant built in the United States creates 700 jobs  expands the local economic base by over  140 million  and increases the local corn price by five to ten cents a bushel   Iowa  s ethanol plants are expected to contribute  4 billion annually to the state  s economy once all are in production   Similar kinds of benefits are expected from biodiesel and other biofuels production facilities               Renewable fuels are a winning proposition for everyone     Harkin said     Producing them boosts rural economies  generates new jobs  reduces our dependence on foreign oil and helps improve our environment   Farmers and biofuel producers are poised to lead our nation toward a future based on renewable energy   I sincerely hope that Congress and the administration will get behind common sense energy policy and support this ambitious RFS             Like the earlier RFS legislation  the bill introduced by Harkin and Lugar requires that petroleum companies market a minimum volume of renewable fuels in the United States each year   These minimum annual volumes of renewable fuels would increase over seven years  beginning with four billion gallons a year in 2006 and rising to eight billion gallons a year in 2012   Mechanisms in the legislation provide for further increases in later years depending on the total volume of U S  motor fuel consumption and other factors   Each gallon of ethanol produced from cellulose biomass will count as 2 5 gallons toward meeting the RFS          The legislation also eliminates the two percent oxygen content requirement for reformulated gasoline under the Clean Air Act and provides the Environmental Protection Agency authority to ensure that emissions standards from the Clean Air Act are still met   In addition  federal vehicle fleets would be required to purchase a minimum quantity of renewable fuels  and EPA would be required to sponsor a study to investigate how the United States could obtain 25 percent of its transportation fuel from renewable sources by 2025            Joining Harkin and Lugar in sponsoring the legislation are Senators Ben Nelson  Durbin  Obama  Johnson  Bayh  Conrad  Dayton  Dorgan  Salazar  Stabenow  Hagel  Frist  Bond  Grassley  Coleman  Talent  Thune  and DeWine          Senator Harkin has been a leader in the push toward increased production and use of renewable sources of energy   To learn more about Harkin  s efforts  please visit www harkin senate gov                                 Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
