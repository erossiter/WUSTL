        We are writing to urge you to take immediate action to salvage the Justice Department  s landmark litigation against the tobacco industry  United States of America vs  Philip Morris USA Inc  et al    In light of continued  detailed revelations about political interference in the litigation by senior Justice Department officials  we believe it is essential for you to direct Associate Attorney General Robert D  McCallum and other political appointees to recuse themselves from further involvement in this litigation and for you to take whatever other steps are necessary to ensure that there is no political interference in the future in this case    In addition  you should immediately restore authority for this litigation in the hands of the senior career attorneys who have shepherded this case since its inception              As yesterday  s New York Times makes clear  the Department  s recent decision to reduce its claim for damages from  130 billion over 25 years to  10 billion over 5 years was made over the strong objections of the lead attorneys in the litigation   Specifically  these attorneys wrote                     We do not want politics to be perceived as the underlying motivation  and that is certainly a risk if we make adjustments in our remedies              presentation that are not based on evidence     emphasis added             According to the article  the lawyers further went on to write that the lower penalty recommendation would weaken the department  s position with regards to future settlement discussions  and would   create an incentive for defendants to engage in future misconduct by making the misconduct profitable             These most recent revelations are only the latest in a recent disturbing series of events in this case   Over the past 2 weeks  we have learned that the decision to seek a lower penalty contradicted the testimony of the government  s own expert witnesses  that government attorneys pressured their own witnesses to alter their testimony to favor tobacco companies  and that  just one month ago  Department attorneys argued in favor of the higher penalties that they have asked the court to disregard   Indeed  the Department  s own Office of Professional Responsibility has announced that it will conduct an investigation into the troubling pattern of behavior in this case           This conduct cannot be allowed to continue   The very credibility of the Justice Department is at stake   At best  Mr  McCallum has demonstrated poor leadership and an inability to manage this case effectively   At worst  and even more troubling  he has allowed his political judgment to cloud the Department  s six year effort to ensure that the tobacco industry is held accountable for their decades of efforts to mislead the American people in order to hook them on a deadly habit that kills 400 000 Americans each and every year   For all of these reasons  we urge you to seek his immediate recusal  and put the interests of the American public ahead of the interests of big tobacco                         Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
