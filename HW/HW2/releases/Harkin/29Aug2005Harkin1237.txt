         President Janez Drnovsek   Foreign Minister Dimitrij Rupel   Allow me to express to you  to the entire Slovene government  and to the people of Slovenia  my deep gratitude for this honor and for your extraordinary graciousness and hospitality   From the bottom of my heart  I thank you all                For me  this is a kind of homecoming   As many of you know  my mother came to America from the village of Suha  a short distance from Skofja Loka   Today  85 years later  I see this beautiful country through her eyes   I feel the warmth of Slovenia  s people with her heart   And I feel very much at home            As a son  I am here on a personal pilgrimage    to visit my mother  s home town   But as a United States Senator  I am on a different kind of pilgrimage   I am here to see  firsthand  one of the world  s newest and most successful democracies              Thomas Jefferson said that   the tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants     It is equally true that old democracies  such as the United States  can draw inspiration from new democracies  such as your own               Indeed  as President Bill Clinton noted during his visit here to Brdo Castle six years ago  Slovenia was one of Thomas Jefferson  s inspirations   Jefferson was intrigued by the ancient model of democracy in Carinthia   And he heartily approved of the tradition that the dukes of Carinthia could only take office after being questioned by a simple peasant to test their worthiness   If the peasant was satisfied with the answers  then he gently slapped the duke as a symbol of accountability to the people   Imagine that  people slapping around politicians in a democracy   How little has changed in 1 000 years              My friends  I am not just inspired by Slovenia  s democracy   Quite frankly  I am amazed by what you have accomplished during your 14 years of freedom   You have established a robust democracy   You have built the most successful economy in Central and Eastern Europe   You have gained entry to the European Union and NATO   You have been a force for stability and democratic reform here in the Balkans                 Slovenia is what we Americans call an   overachiever      and we respect you for it   And I  for one  am especially grateful for the Republic of Slovenia  s outstanding leadership in the campaign to rid the world of landmines and to assist the victims  especially children               This is a humanitarian mission of profound importance    a mission that Senator George Voinovich and I have worked hard to support with major funding from the United States Congress   I salute Dorijan Marsic  director of the International Trust for De Mining  for the passion and persistence he has brought to this campaign   And I pledge to do everything in my power to ensure that the International Trust has the resources its needs to continue this all important work            The world looks at Slovenia  s success  and it wonders   How could a nation of just two million people accomplish so much in so short period of time   As an American  I know the answer              Bear in mind that  when Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence  America was also a nation of just two million people   Like Slovenians in 1991  Americans in 1776 dared to break away from a much larger and more powerful mother country   Like Slovenians  Americans paid in blood for their freedom   Like Slovenians  Americans demanded a democratic course for their new country            But the most important parallel between our two countries is this   Historians of the American Revolution have marveled that a tiny nation of just two million people was blessed with such an extraordinary collection of thinkers and leaders  Washington  Jefferson  Hamilton  Franklin  and more            At this crucial crossroads in Slovenia  s history  you  too  have been blessed with extraordinary leaders              Milan Kucan skillfully guided Slovenia  s democracy during its first crucial decade   Like George Washington  he served two terms as president and was a statesman above party politics    a president of all the people          Janez Drnovsek  a brilliant economist  unleashed the entrepreneurial spirit of the Slovenian people and continues to provide visionary leadership as President            Janez Jansa  the celebrated military leader of the Slovenian Spring  is now respected as one of the Republic  s most forward looking political leaders            Dimitrij Rupel  architect of Slovenia  s entry into the European Union and NATO  now charts the future of Europe as chairman of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe             So make no mistake  the success of independent Slovenia  like the success of the young American republic two centuries ago  was no accident   It was secured by visionary leaders and by a determined people              Eighty five years ago  my mother left a Slovenia that was impoverished  ruled by autocrats  dominated by foreign powers    a nation that sent forth emigrants desperate to find a better life   Today  her son returns to a free  prosperous  democratic Slovenia    a nation that sends forth statesmen  diplomats  and humanitarians impatient to build a better world             My friends  I salute your immense achievements   And  again  from the bottom of my heart  I thank you for your generosity to me today   May God continue to bless America and Slovenia                             Originating Site
