         Washington  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called for scrapping Congressional efforts to reduce federal food assistance as recent data again confirms more Americans are food insecure and going hungry   According to new Department of Agriculture  USDA  data  hunger and food insecurity in the United States increased significantly in 2004 for the fifth consecutive year   The increases in hunger and food insecurity last year were the largest recorded since USDA began collecting the data in 1998                  It is clear that the need for food assistance to America  s working and needy families is increasing     said Harkin     Yet inexplicably  some in Washington are calling for cutting food assistance to Americans    a move that is out of touch with our nation  s real problems                  President Bush  s budget proposed cuts to federal food assistance  and Congress is currently considering such cuts as part of the Republican budget package    referred to as the budget reconciliation measure   While the Senate budget reconciliation bill does not have cuts for nutrition assistance  the House Agriculture Committee voted on Friday to cut food assistance by  850 million    several hundred million dollars more in cuts than the president  s budget   If enacted  the budget cuts in the House measure would eliminate federal food assistance eligibility for over 300 000 individuals  mostly low income working families with children and legal immigrants               If cuts to food assistance are passed by Congress  thousands of working families would be prevented from receiving help to put food on the table     Harkin said     Cutting off food assistance will cause more Americans to go into poverty and result in fewer people receiving food aid at a time when more need it                 According to the new USDA report                Food insecurity rose from 11 2 percent of all households in 2003 to 11 9 percent in 2004                 The number of Americans experiencing food insecurity has increased by 7 million since 1999  from 31 million to 38 million Americans                 In 2004  nearly 14 million American children experienced food insecurity  an increase of over half a million from 2003                Rates of food insecurity among minority households were approximately double the national average in 2004  23 7 percent for African American families and 21 7 percent for Hispanic families                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
