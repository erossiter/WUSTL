       WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today called the new Medicare prescription drug plan a confusing mess  and called on Congress to fix the problem by providing a simple  more effective benefit for Iowa seniors   Harkin did not vote for the drug bill in 2003 because it created a confusing plan that did not allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices directly with drug manufacturers  A new report released today by Families USA shows that predictions have come true and that there are multiple barriers for seniors trying to navigate this confusing  complicated program                While the new drug benefit may help some seniors  particularly low income seniors  it is a long way away from being adequate   While seniors and people with disabilities are struggling to understand this complicated plan  the drug companies are celebrating     said Harkin     Instead of staying the course with a plan that is a boon for Wall Street  we should be doing everything we can to make it the best plan for those that live on Main Street                According to Families USA  some seniors  depending on where they live  must choose from 52 prescription drug plans   In Iowa alone  seniors have to wade through over 40 plans to try to determine which one will provide the best benefit    the average US worker has to choose from fewer than three plans   Information on premiums  deductibles  and whether each plan covers specific drugs is also very complicated   In addition to the confusing plan  the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid services relies very heavily on its prescription drug website as the main conduit for information on these plans   However  only 28 percent of seniors regularly use the internet               Harkin called on Congress to pass two different pieces of legislation he supports that would make the benefit more cost effective and simpler for Iowa seniors    The Medicare Prescription Drug Price Reduction Act would allow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices for the elderly and disable    just like the Veterans Administration   The Medicare Informed Choice Act to give seniors more time to sort through these confusing choices  The bill gives them until the end of 2006 to make a choice    right now they have to choose by May 15 of next year or face a penalty                 A prescription drug plan should address the heart of the problem and provide real relief to seniors under Medicare     said Harkin     Unfortunately  that  s not what seniors will be signing up for  We need to offer solutions that give seniors what they really need  simplicity and low prices   They deserve both                             Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
