      WASHINGTON  D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   the ranking Democrat on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds education initiatives  today criticized President Bush for failing to propose a federal budget that provides needed resources for beneficial education programs   The President  s budget would cut federal education spending by  2 1 billion             A budget is a moral document  and the President  s budget flunks the most basic moral test     said Harkin      It calls for literally hundreds of billions in additional tax cuts  with the lion  s share going to those making more than  1 million a year   And it calls for deep cuts to programs that our most vulnerable citizens depend on for their very survival             Education Facing Deepest Cut in 26 Years         The President  s budget makes the deepest cuts in education in history  at a time when schools are struggling to meet the requirements of the No Child Left Behind Act  And this comes on the heels of a  600 million cut in FY06    the first cut in a decade            It looks to me as if this administration has basically given up on the three programs that matter most to the nation  s students    Title I  IDEA  and Pell     said Harkin           Title I and IDEA         The President substantially under funds the No Child Left Behind Act   His budget leaves behind 3 7 million students    including about 18 000 in Iowa    who could be fully served by Title I if the program were funded at the level the President promised in the NCLB Act            For many Iowa schools  this latest cut is just another deficit on the heels of a three year shortfall in Title I funding   A new analysis shows that two thirds    248 of  367    of Iowa  s districts received less Title I money this school year than they did three years ago  A listing of this information is available upon request              Title I is the cornerstone program for the NCLB Act     said Harkin     It is the program that targets aid to the students who are most at risk of failing   That  s why NCLB calls for a  2 2 billion increase for Title I this year   But how much more does the President ask for   Zero   It is flat funded             The president also comes up short on after school programs  funding them at less than half the amount recommended in the NCLB Act  As a result  10 000 at risk Iowa students who should receive after school services will have to go without   Since NCLB  s enactment  the Bush Administration has underfunded NCLB programs by a total of  55 7 billion          The Bush Budget also shortchanges students with disabilities by providing a smaller share of states   total costs for special education for the second year in a row  In FY05  the federal government provided 19 percent of the average per pupil expenditure toward the costs of special education   This year  FY06  it went down to 18 percent   Next year  under this budget  it would go down again  to 17 percent   As the federal share goes down  states and local districts will have to pick up more of the tab             This administration has not only given up on funding for students with disabilities  it  s actually moving in the wrong direction     said Harkin            Bush Budget Makes College Less Affordable         This administration has also given up on student aid   Under the President  s budget  the maximum Pell Grant award would be frozen at  4 050   This is the same level as four years ago              I don  t think there are any colleges in America that charge the same amount for tuition that they did four years ago     said Harkin     It gets tougher and tougher all the time for low  and middle income families to afford college  but this administration doesn  t seem to care             Among some of the initiatives slated for elimination is the Upward Bound program that provides grants to colleges to help disadvantaged high school students succeed in college   Additionally  the President  s much hyped  1 5 billion High School Initiative is more than offset by  2 1 billion in cuts to similar education initiatives like vocational and adult education          In all  the budget zeroes out 42 programs   Some of these programs include education technology initiatives  state grants to keep schools safe and drug free  smaller learning communities  alcohol abuse reduction  school dropout prevention and dozens of other education initiatives                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
