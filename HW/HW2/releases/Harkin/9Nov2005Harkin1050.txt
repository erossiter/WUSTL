           The GAO concluded FDA  s feed testing program does not ensure industry compliance with rules prohibiting ruminant byproducts in feed intended for cattle   Keeping ruminant byproducts out of cattle feed is the most important firewall against BSE getting into or spreading among U S  cattle     said Harkin     If FDA  s testing program is not designed to catch violations in a timely manner  than that needs to be corrected immediately                    FDA had prevented GAO from obtaining information needed to assess the feed testing program earlier this year  thus delaying the completion of the GAO study of the effectiveness of FDA  s ruminant to ruminant feed ban rule   The report released today focuses on a portion of the ruminant to ruminant feed ban   testing done to ensure the feed industry complies with FDA guidelines  GAO found that FDA  s feed testing program    which is meant to ensure compliance with FDA  s rules against feeding ruminant byproducts back to ruminants    in fact provides   no additional assurance of industry compliance    because of FDA  s poor design and implementation of the testing program   It notes that FDA  s poor documentation of results makes it impossible to assess FDA  s thoroughness in addressing feed rule violations                    FDA initially did not cooperate with GAO and prevented a fair evaluation of FDA  s feed testing program     Harkin said     Now it appears FDA doesn  t have sufficient paper work and documentation to show whether its feed testing program is working to provide additional assurance of compliance with the ruminant to ruminant feed ban                  The GAO study released today found the following         FDA has failed to establish timeframes for FDA laboratories and FDA district offices to analyze and review feed samples for prohibited ruminant materials    Almost half of the 989 feed samples audited by GAO revealed FDA laboratories took longer than 30 days to analyze samples     Twenty one samples took longer than 100 days    As a result  by the time laboratories districts finish their work  samples found in violation of the feed ban already may have been consumed by cattle      FDA districts also were not documenting their findings in a manner to allow the accuracy of testing feed samples to be verified     FDA headquarters were not exercising adequate oversight of the feed testing program                                             FDA needs to provide clear direction to its labs and district offices that analyze cattle feed and take a more active role in managing the feed testing program     said Harkin     Right now  it appears FDA  s feed testing program is largely for show and not ensuring industry compliance                      In March 2005  Senator Harkin released a GAO report on compliance with FDA  s anti BSE feed rules   That report outlined problems in FDA  s enforcement of the ruminant to ruminant feed ban and a lack of compliance with the FDA rules by the animal feed industry   GAO discovered that while FDA claims 99 percent industry compliance with its regulations  that assertion is based on inspecting only a fraction of all feed plants and on not counting a plant as in violation of the FDA feed rules if the plant eventually works to comply                    FDA started its feed testing program in August 2003 to ensure industry compliance with the feed ban by sampling and analyzing animal feed and feed ingredients for prohibited ruminant byproduct materials   FDA  s ruminant to ruminant feed ban rule is designed to prevent the spread of BSE by keeping ruminant animal material out of feed for U S  cattle and other ruminant animals   Allowing animal proteins that are infected with BSE into feed for cattle and other ruminants is thought to be a major route by which BSE is transmitted among animals                                    Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
