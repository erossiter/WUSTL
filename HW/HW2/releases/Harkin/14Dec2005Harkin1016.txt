    WASHINGTON  DC    The Senate today strongly backed Senator Tom Harkin  s  D IA  motion to instruct members of the joint House Senate conference committee to reject cuts to food assistance that have been proposed as part of federal budget legislation   The House budget bill includes cuts to the Food Stamp Program that would eliminate food assistance benefits for approximately 250 000 people  many of whom are working families with children   The Senate version does not include cuts in food assistance   The Harkin motion adopted today instructs conferees to reject the House proposal for food assistance cuts and accept the Senate position of no cuts to food assistance              Today Harkin released the following statement            I  m pleased that the Senate overwhelmingly agreed to instruct budget conferees to maintain our commitments to America  s hungry and food insecure   The number of Americans who are food insecure has been steadily rising over the past few years  and it  s critical that conferees reject any attempts to scale back food assistance that will make this problem even worse               During this holiday season  we remember Dickens   A Christmas Carol   Let  s hope that this Congress will see Marley  s ghost and follow the example of the enlightened Scrooge  not the heartless  miserly one that opens the story  It would be especially inexplicable during this holiday season for Congress to cut back on initiatives helping America  s most vulnerable citizens put enough food on the table              Senator Harkin voted against the underlying Senate budget bill calling for cuts through the federal budget and has repeatedly called for Congress to abandon efforts to cut programs serving low and middle income Americans                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
