        We have a responsibility to preserve and protect the Stars and Stripes of the United States of America   But even more importantly  we have a responsibility to preserve and protect the principles and rights for which it stands               The flag is an important symbol of our Democracy   As a veteran  I will never  ever do anything to show disrespect for the flag   At the same time  I will never  ever do anything that would diminish the freedom our flag represents  If you truly believe that the First Amendment guarantees free speech as it does  you also have to believe in the people  s right to express them selves    even if that expression is offensive              Most moving to me was an article I read years ago in the Cedar Rapids Gazette by a former prisoner of war  James Warner  Below is an excerpt of Mr  Warner  s comments               It hurts me to see other Americans willfully desecrate the flag  But I have been in a communist prison where I looked into the pit of hell  I cannot compromise on freedom  It hurts to see the flag burned  but I part company with those who want to punish the flag burners                It is my hope that this debate can have a positive legacy    not by diminishing our rights as citizens  but by increasing public displays of the flag  increasing people s knowledge and understanding of the flag s history  an increasing good citizenship and public service                                Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
