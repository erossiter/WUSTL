     I thought that we had learned from that experience  so it was with a terrible sense of d    j     vu that I saw the pictures of abuse at Abu Ghraib prison last year   Unfortunately  it was an extraordinary document prepared at the request of Alberto Gonzales  the nominee for Attorney General  that laid the groundwork for the abuses at Abu Ghraib and harmed our stature in the international community          Appallingly  Gonzales continues to assert his view that the President has the power to override laws passed by the Congress and to immunize others to perform what would otherwise be unlawful acts   As the nominee for Attorney General  Alberto Gonzales is the person with the single greatest responsibility to uphold and defend the rule of law   Because of this  but more because of his fundamental lack of respect for basic human rights  I cannot support him to be the Chief law enforcement officer of this country                            Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
