      Full text of Harkin  s letter to Jackson follows            Please find enclosed a copy of an article that appeared in the Des Moines Register about the continuing abuse of project based Section 8 in Iowa   I first contacted you about this in June of 2004 asking that we work together to develop policy guidelines to close these loopholes     Harkin wrote              I was disappointed that your initially proposed rule would only require a student to use parental income if their parent claims them on their taxes   A simple cost benefit analysis would show that the cost of housing for a year to be more than the deduction allowed for a dependant   In response  Congress said that the portion of an athletic scholarship that exceeds tuition should be counted as income   While I would have preferred that this guidance included anyone receiving money in excess of tuition  it is a start   Still  many student athletes are living in housing meant for the poor in Iowa City   Worse yet  new loopholes have been discovered   Students are passing their apartment on to their roommates  keeping the units out of the grasp of those for whom it was intended            I continue to hear from truly needy Iowans desperate for housing and struggling to make ends meet while they wait two years for Section 8   In Des Moines  the Public Housing Authority  PHA  opened the waiting list for a month and got thousands of applicants   Meanwhile  students who are given a stipend specifically for housing are still gaming the system   I would consider this to be a major failure in the oversight of the program            Today University of Iowa President David Skorton announced that he  Executive Vice President and Provost Michael Hogan and Vice President for Student Services Phillip Jones wish to work with HUD  Iowa Finance Authority  and the Iowa City Housing Authority to fix this problem   I would strongly encourage you to take advantage of their perspective and advice in dealing with this issue            My suggestion would be to require that students take into account their parents   income when applying for section 8 unless they are over 24  married  have children  or are veterans   Furthermore  I would request that you issue clear guidance to PHAs and Section 8 project managers that scholarship assistance that exceeds tuition be counted as income for the purposes of qualifying a student for housing and determining rental obligation   Finally  students passing on housing to roommates are in no way comparable to allowing members of the same household doing the same   Special rules need to be developed to address that abuse                          Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
