                  WASHINGTON D C     Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  today decried yet another Bush Administration budget that leaves education and health care initiatives behind in the dust while the wealthiest Americans get yet another tax cut                        Year after year  President Bush s budget is just more of the same   said Harkin   Instead of standing up for hard working citizens and the most vulnerable in our society  he pushes more tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans  Over and over again  the President expects education and health care initiatives to take a back seat   this just doesn t reflect what is best for Iowa or this country                        While healthcare costs soar and the number of uninsured Americans grows  President Bush has proposed slashing programs that assist poor  rural and elderly communities throughout the nation   The FY 2008 budget for the Department of Health and Human Services totals  63 2 billion  a cut of  700 million below FY 2007  Funding is substantially reduced for  rural health programs   104 million decrease  or 86    and Health Professions Training   180 million decrease  or 61    The Advanced Education Nursing  Emergency Medical Services for Children  Newborn Hearing Screening  and Trauma Care programs are eliminated                        STATE CHILDREN S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM  the President s budget provides only  5 billion for children s health insurance  one third of what is needed over the next five years just to maintain coverage for those in the program  This year alone  Iowa faces a  15 million funding shortfall and will not be able to enroll new children in the program  Further cuts will undermine a program critical to raising healthy and economically secure children and risk adding to the ranks of Iowa s nearly 44 000 uninsured kids                       MEDICARE AND MEDICAID  The President s budget includes  78 billion in across the board Medicare and Medicaid cuts to hospitals  doctors  nursing homes  and home health agencies  The proposal would leave Iowa providers behind and threaten access to essential services for Iowa s 484 000 Medicare beneficiaries  Over the next five years  the Bush budget would                      Cut Iowa hospitals by  133 million                      Cut Iowa inpatient rehabilitation facilities by  6 5 million                 RURAL HEALTH PROGRAMS  The President s Budget includes only  17 million for rural health programs    a cut of  104 million or 87   Important programs disappear altogether including                       63 million in grants to rural hospitals  including  500 000 in Iowa                    38 9 million in grants to improve access to health care services through partnerships in rural areas  including  1 million in Iowa                   1 5 million in funding for defibrillators in rural areas  including  200 000 in Iowa                    At a time when America needs to do everything it can to make sure it s students remain competitive in the global arena  the President s FY08 budget would cut the Department  of Education s discretionary funding by  1 5 billion  The proposal calls for elimination of 44 programs  including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  education technology state grants  arts in education  and school counseling  and large cuts to numerous other programs including career and technical education  and safe and drug free schools state grants                        NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND  Despite calling himself a  passionate advocate  of the law  President Bush s budget underfunds NCLB by  14 8 billion  for a cumulative shortfall of  70 9 billion since enactment of the law  The President s budget denies promised services to more than 17 000 disadvantaged young people in Iowa under Title I                        SPECIAL EDUCATION  President Bush again retreats on helping students with disabilities  proposing that  for the third year in a row  the federal government provide a smaller share of states  total costs for special education   This year  the President s budget includes  10 5 billion   a shortfall of  8 7 billion promised to special education under the IDEA Improvement Act of 2004   The cumulative shortfall for special education since the President signed the law is  20 7 billion                        HIGHER EDUCATION   The budget proposes eliminating the Federal supplemental educational opportunity grants  or SEOG   771 million   Federal Perkins Loan cancellations   65 4 million   and Leveraging Education Assistance Partnerships  or LEAP   64 million   SEOG provides supplemental grant aid for the most disadvantaged college students  In 2006  Iowa received  13 7 million in federal college work study funds and  11 4 million in SEOG grants  As tuition and fees at Iowa s public universities increase 42 percent in just four years  the administration s cuts in student aid will put college further out of reach for many Iowa students                     AFTERSCHOOL PROGRAMS   Funding for the 21st Century Community Learning Centers would remain flat  at  981 million    1 5 billion below the  2 5 billion authorized level for FY07   The Bush budget leaves behind 2 million students who would receive afterschool services if the program were funded at the level promised last year in NCLB
