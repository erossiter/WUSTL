      WASHINGTON D C       Senator Tom Harkin  D IA   one of the Senate  s leading advocates for alternative fuels and renewable energies  said he was disappointed that real progress on fuel efficiency and flexible fuel vehicles was not evident from a White House meeting today by President Bush with Chrysler Group president and CEO Tom LaSorda  Ford Motor Company president and CEO Alan Mulally  and General Motors chairman and CEO Rick Wagoner            I am disappointed that the President did not obtain a firm commitment from the automakers on delivering more fuel efficient vehicles and more vehicles that can utilize more renewable fuels  such as E85            The potential was there to give a big boost to home grown renewable fuels instead of imported oil  which the President rightly recognized in his State of the Union message  But when the White House and these industry leaders got together  they glossed over the subject  instead of working to set real benchmarks to move the country forward            If we want real progress on energy security  we are going to need to set firm goals and achieve them  It looks like that opportunity was missed today                           Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
