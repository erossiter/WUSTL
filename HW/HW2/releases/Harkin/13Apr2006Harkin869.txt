    WASHINGTON  D C     In a letter to U S  Postal Service  USPS  Senior Vice President for Operations Bill Galligan today  Senator Tom Harkin  D IA  called on USPS to fulfill its commitment to publicly release the relevant data related to the proposed consolidation of Siouxland Mail Processing Operations   Senator Chuck Grassley  R IA  and Congressman Steve King  R IA  joined Harkin in signing the letter           A text of the letter is as follows                   The Area Mail Processing  AMP  Study that you have released to our offices does not meet our expectations  nor does it meet the understandings reached at our March 27 meeting in Senator Grassley  s office   In addition  the one page summary sheet that you will provide to community leaders insufficiently explains the analysis behind the proposed consolidation   We are very concerned that this lack of information will undercut the potential for a successful Town Hall meeting next week in Sioux City  and we expect you to fulfill the commitment you made at the March 27 meeting to publicly release all relevant data related to the proposed consolidation               As you recall from the meeting in Senator Grassley  s office  you committed to release   all the data  analyses  or other information considered by the Postal Service in making the proposed decision     Such release is fundamental to ensuring that an open  informative  and constructive discussion takes place at next week  s meeting   While we understand that your General Counsel has concerns about its release to the community  we believe that a complete withholding of all this information contradicts the spirit of your commitment to the Siouxland community leaders  Senator Grassley  Senator Harkin  and Congressman King                While the sections of the U S  code you cited in providing us with the AMP study do not prohibit either you or us from making this material public  we understand your desire to protect trade secrets and or particularly sensitive information    Therefore  we are requesting that the Postal Service either share a modified AMP document with the community prior to the Town Hall meeting  or tell us which information should be redacted from the current AMP so that we can instead share the modified document with the community   This modified document should be a version of the current AMP that only redacts information that the Postal Service deems too sensitive to release  for trade secret or other proprietary reasons   And it should include enough information to make it understandable to a reasonably knowledgeable party             In making this request and by holding you to your commitment  we are hoping to keep the concerned stakeholders in this matter    our Iowa constituents    from developing the impression that the Postal Service is only concerned with appearing to consult the community in order to achieve its predetermined decision of consolidation  rather than seeking truly substantive public input   We therefore request that either the updated document or the information we are seeking be provided to us by no later than Friday April 14  2006   We look forward to your prompt response                                  Originating Site  Number  Site Filter  Search
