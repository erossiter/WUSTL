                                                                                                                                                             Delays  missed deadlines    adversely affecting government   s ability to protect citizens          WASHINGTON   Noting two years worth of delays and missed deadlines in the production of a national transportation strategy  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Maine  and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   are pressing the Homeland Security Department to complete and detailed plan within the next two to three months  The HSGAC was responsible for creating the Department of Homeland Security and is now responsible for overseeing its activities       In a letter to DHS Deputy Secretary Michael Jackson  the Chairman and Ranking Member acknowledge Secretary Chertoff   s desire for a top to bottom review of department plans and policies  given his short tenure on the job   The Senators  however  indicated that repeated delays in producing the report   due most recently on April 1   were not furthering the security of Americans or our national transportation system       The Aviation Transportation Security Act of 2001 originally required a national transportation security plan and strategy  In 2003  then Transportation Security Administrator Adm  James Loy promised the plan by the end of that year  Most recently  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004 required the plan to be produced by April 1  2005  Deputy Secretary Jackson informed the Committee that the Department would miss its latest deadline          We are concerned that the delay in producing a cohesive and comprehensive transportation security strategy is adversely affecting the federal government   s ability to protect the citizens of this country     the Senators wrote     It is important not only that these documents be completed and delivered  but that they provide the necessary detail and vision to provide a roadmap for coordinating and improving transportation security          Following is the text of the letter        April 13  2005      The Honorable Michael P  Jackson  Deputy Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C   20528      Dear Deputy Secretary Jackson       We are writing in response to your April 5  2005 letter to us  which indicated that you and Secretary Chertoff are reviewing the National Strategy for Transportation Security and would not meet the April 1  2005 deadline specified in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004                                                                                                We understand that both you and Secretary Chertoff  having only recently been confirmed for your positions  need some time to review all of the relevant plans and policies that the Department must complete    However  we are concerned that the Department has been working on a comprehensive national transportation security plan or strategy since 2003  and that your predecessor  Admiral Loy  previously testified that the Department   s work on the National Strategy for Transportation Security would be completed by December 2003   For various reasons and at various times  the Department has repeatedly pushed back the completion date for this document  and we are concerned that the delay in producing a cohesive and comprehensive transportation security strategy is adversely affecting the federal government   s ability to protect the citizens of this country       We appreciate your statement that neither you nor Secretary Chertoff take lightly missing a Congressional deadline   You have stated that the Department now intends to produce both the National Strategy for Transportation Security and the modal specific plans which help compose the broader strategy to Congress in 2 3 months  and we look forward to receiving those documents on or before that time frame   It is important not only that these documents be completed and delivered  but that they provide the necessary detail and vision to provide a roadmap for coordinating and improving transportation security across all modes  as set forth in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004   This necessarily includes setting forth the respective responsibilities of and relationships among the Federal government  state and local entities and the private sector owners and operators of the transportation system       We look forward to receiving the National Strategy for Transportation Security  and to working with you and your staff at the Department to improve the security of this country   If you have any questions  please feel free to have your staff contact Kathy Kraninger of the majority staff at  202  224 4751 or minority staff member Jason Yanussi at  202  224 2627       Sincerely       Susan Collins  Chairman      Joe Lieberman  Ranking Member                  30
