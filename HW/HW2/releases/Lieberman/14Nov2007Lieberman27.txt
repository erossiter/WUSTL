Affairs today gave unanimous approval to bipartisan legislation that would significantly strengthen the Inspector General  IG  system  The bill is now headed to the Senate floor for a vote  which senators are hopeful will occur by the end of the year      The Inspector General Reform Act of 2007  S  2324   sponsored by Senators Claire McCaskill  D MO   Susan Collins  R ME   Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   and Tom Coburn  R OK   aims to bring greater government accountability by guaranteeing that qualified individuals are appointed as IGs  that IGs remain independent of inappropriate pressure or influence  and that all IG reports and audits are easily accessible to the public   With unanimous approval of the legislation only a week after the bill was introduced  the senators plan to push for a vote of the full Senate before the end of the year      With all the politics of Washington  government accountability is too frequently left behind and not given the attention it needs and deserves   The incredible support expressed today from both Republicans and Democrats during the Committee s consideration of the IG Reform bill makes me optimistic that we will be able to get this legislation through Congress quickly and in a truly bipartisan fashion   Our tax dollars are at stake if we don t   McCaskill said     Senator Collins said   Inspectors General are vital partners in Congress s effort to identify inefficient  ineffective  and improper government programs  The investigations and reports of IGs throughout the government help Congress shape legislation and oversight activities   improving government performance  providing important transparency into programs  and giving Americans better value for their tax dollar   The Inspector General Reform Act of 2007 will improve the independence and effectiveness of Inspectors General and contribute to better relations among the IGs  the agencies they serve  and the Congress  I am pleased the Committee has approved this important legislation       IGs have become like consumer protectors for the taxpayer deep within each federal agency   said Lieberman   Their audits have saved our government billions of dollars  and exposed cases of serious misconduct and mismanagement  This legislation further strengthens the independence of the IGs as well as their accountability so that they can better perform their valuable work for the public interest       Inspectors general are true champions for the taxpayers and annually save taxpayers billions of dollars in their quest to root out waste  fraud and abuse   This bill is a great first step to making them more effective   The most important step  however  will be for elected officials to respond to their findings and eliminate the waste and other abuses of the public s trust uncovered by inspectors general   said Senator Coburn     Specifically  the legislation will require that          Congress is notified of any proposed removal of an IG  along with the reasons for the removal  in writing with 30 days notice          All IGs must receive their own legal counsel or have access to the services of legal counsel of another Inspector General  This will allow them to avoid using agency counsels          A Council on Integrity and Efficiency for Inspectors General must be established   Within the Council  an Integrity Committee must be created to receive  review  and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing that are made against Inspectors General or certain other staff members          All IG websites are directly accessible from the home page of agency web sites   All IG reports must be posted on agency websites within 3 working days of their release           In the event of a vacancy  the Council for Integrity and Efficiency will recommend to the appointing authority three possible replacements          The president s budget submission must state how much money is being requested for each IG office  as well as the funding level the IG requested for the office  This will allow Congress to identify whether agencies are trying to interfere with the work of an IG office by cutting funding          No IG may accept a bonus          Presidentially appointed IGs must be paid at Level III of the Executive Schedule  plus three percent  and other IGs must receive compensation comparable to other senior level executives in the department   This is aimed at preventing agencies from discouraging qualified candidates by lowering pay      Senators Daniel Akaka  D HI   Barack Obama  D IL   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Tom Carper  D DE  and Ted Stevens  R AK  are co sponsors of the legislation   Similar legislation introduced by Congressman Jim Cooper  D TN  in the House of Representatives received overwhelming bipartisan approval with a vote of 404 11     30
