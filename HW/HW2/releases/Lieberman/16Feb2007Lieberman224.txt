concerning the non binding Iraq resolution  Senator Lieberman stated        The non binding resolution before us today  we all know  is only a prologue  That is why the fight over it   procedural and substantive   over these past weeks has been so intense  It is the first skirmish in an escalating battle that threatens to consume our government over many months ahead  a battle that will neither solve the sprawling challenges we face in Iraq nor strengthen our nation to defeat the enemies of our security throughout the world from Islamist extremists  That is to say  in our war against the terrorists that attacked us         We still have a choice not to go down this path   it s a choice that goes beyond the immediate resolution before the Senate   a chance to step back from the brink and find a better way to express and arbitrate our opinion  and I hope we will seize the moment and take that chance        Senator Lieberman called for nonpartisan cooperation        Whatever our opinion of this war or its conduct  it is in no one s interest to stumble into a debilitating confrontation between our two great branches of government over war powers  The potential for a constitutional crisis here and now is real  with congressional interventions  presidential vetoes  and Supreme Court decisions   If there was ever a moment for nonpartisan cooperation to agree on a process that will respect both our personal opinions about this war and our nation s interests over the long term  this is it        We need to step back from the brink and reason together  as Scripture urges us to do  about how we will proceed to express our disagreements about this war        Senator Lieberman argued that the non binding resolution   proposes nothing   It contains no plan for victory or retreat    It is a strategy of  no   while our soldiers are saying   yes  sir  to their commanding officers as they go forward into battle        Senator Lieberman closed with a call for unity   Whatever our differences here in this chamber  about this war  let us never forget the values of freedom and democracy that unite us and for which our troops have given and today give the last full measure of their devotion  Yes  we should vigorously debate and deliberate   That is not only our right  it is our responsibility   But at this difficult juncture  at this moment when a real battle  a critical battle is being waged in Baghdad  as we face a brutal enemy who attacked us on 9 11 and wants to do it again  let us not just shout at one another  but let us reach out to one another to find that measure of unity that can look beyond today s disagreements and secure the nation s future and the future of all who will follow us as Americans        Below is the entire text of the speech as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  when the roll is called tomorrow on the motion for cloture with regard to the resolution that the House is expected to pass tonight on Iraq  I will vote no  I will vote against cloture   I will do so not because I wish to stifle debate   the fact is that debate has occurred  is occurring now  and will continue to occur  on our policy in Iraq   I will vote against cloture because I feel so strongly against the resolution  It condemns the new plan for success in Iraq  I support that plan        From all of the research my staff and I have done  including asking the Library of Congress to do  we have found no case in American history where Congress has done what this resolution does   That is  in a non binding resolution  oppose a plan that our military is implementing right now   Congress has expressed non binding resolutions of disapproval before a plan of military action has been carried out   Congress has taken much more direct steps  authorized to do so by the Constitution  to cut off funds for military action or a war in progress         But never before has the Congress of the United States passed a non binding resolution of disapproval of a military plan that is already being carried out by American military personnel   I believe it s a bad precedent and that s why I will do everything I can to oppose it   And in the immediate context  that means that I will vote against cloture        Mr  President  more broadly  we are approaching an important moment in the history of this institution and of our republic   a moment  I fear  that future historians will look back to and see the beginning of a cycle that not only damaged the remaining possibilities for success in Iraq  but established political precedents that weakened the power of the presidency to protect the American people over the long term        The non binding resolution before us today  we all know  is only a prologue  That is why the fight over it   procedural and substantive   over these past weeks has been so intense  It is the first skirmish in an escalating battle that threatens to consume our government over many months ahead  a battle that will neither solve the sprawling challenges we face in Iraq nor strengthen our nation to defeat the enemies of our security throughout the world from Islamist extremists  That is to say  in our war against the terrorist that attacked us         We still have a choice not to go down this path    it s a choice that goes beyond the immediate resolution before the Senate   a chance to step back from the brink and find a better way to express and arbitrate our opinion  and I hope we will seize the moment and take that chance       As we meet in this chamber today  the battle for Baghdad has already begun  One of our most decorated generals  David Petreaus    whom this Senate confirmed eighty one to nothing   has taken command in Baghdad  And thousands of American soldiers have moved out across the Iraqi capital  putting their lives on the line as they put a new strategy into action        We can now see for ourselves  on the ground in Iraq and Baghdad  where it matters  what this new strategy looks like   and we can see why it is different from all that preceded it       For the first time in Baghdad  our primary focus is no longer on training Iraqi forces or chasing down insurgents or providing for our own force protection  though those remain objectives  Our primary focus is on ensuring basic security for the Iraqi people  working side by side with Iraqi security forces   exactly what classic counterinsurgency doctrine tells us must be our first goal now       Where previously there were not enough troops to hold the neighborhoods cleared of insurgents  now more troops are either in place or on the way        Where previously American soldiers were based on the outskirts of Baghdad  unable to secure the city  now they are living and working side by side with their Iraqi counterparts on small bases that are being set up right now throughout the Iraqi capital       At least six of these new joint bases have already been established in the Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad   the same neighborhoods where just a few weeks ago  jihadists and death squads held sway  In the Shiite neighborhoods of east Baghdad  American troops are also moving in  with their Iraqi counterparts   and Moqtada al Sadr and his Mahdi Army are moving out        We do not know if this new strategy for success in Iraq will work over the long term   and we probably will not know for some time  The Mahdi Army may be in retreat for the moment  but they are not defeated  They have gone to ground  and they are watching  Our hope is that our determination and that of the Iraqi government will lead them now to devote themselves to politics instead of death squads  But that  only time will tell       The fact is  any realistic assessment of the situation in Iraq tells us that we must expect that we must expect that there will be more attacks  and there will be more casualties in the months ahead  as the enemies of a free and independent Iraq see the progress we are making and adapt to try to destroy it with more violence        The question they will try to pose to us   which is the question that is posed every time a fanatic suicide bomb goes off and that person expresses their hatred of everyone else more than their love of their own life by ending their own life   the question is  Will we yield Baghdad  Iraq  the Middle East  our own future  to those fanatical suicide bombers        But we must also recognize that we are in a different place in Iraq from where we were just a month ago  because of the implementation of this new strategy        We are in a stronger position today to provide basic security in Baghdad   and with that  we are in a stronger position to marginalize the extremists and strengthen the moderates  a stronger position to foster the economic activity that will drain the insurgency and the militias of their public support  a stronger position to press the Iraqi leaders to make the political compromises that everyone acknowledges are necessary       John Maynard Keynes famously said   When the facts change  I change my mind        Mr  President  in the real world  in just the past month  the facts in Iraq have changed   and they are changing still  And I would ask my colleagues to allow themselves to wait and consider changing their minds as further facts unfold in Iraq       The non binding resolution before us is not about stopping a hypothetical plan  It is about disapproving a plan that is being carried out now by our fellow Americans in uniform  in the field   In that sense  as I have said  it is unprecedented in Congressional history  in American history   This resolution is about shouting into the wind  It is about ignoring realities of what s happening on the ground in Baghdad        It proposes nothing   It contains no plan for victory or retreat  It proposes nothing  It is a strategy of  no   while our soldiers are saying   yes  sir  to their commanding officers as they go forward into battle        And that is why I will vote against the resolution by voting against cloture       I understand the frustration  anger  and exhaustion that so many Americans  so many members of Congress  feel about Iraq  the desire to throw up one s hands and simply say   Enough   And I am painfully aware of the enormous toll of this war in human life   and of the mistakes that have been made in the war s conduct       But let us now not make another mistake  In the midst of a fluid and uncertain situation in Iraq  we should not be so bound up in our own arguments and disagreements  so committed to the positions we have staked out  that the political battle over here takes precedence over the real battle over there  Whatever the passions of the moment  the point of reference for our decision making should be military movements on the battlefields of Iraq  not political maneuverings in the halls of Congress        Even as our troops have begun to take Baghdad back step by step  there are many in this Congress who have nevertheless already reached a conclusion about the futility of America s cause there  and declared their intention to put an end to this mission not with one direct attempt to cutoff funds  but step by political step  No matter what the rhetoric of this resolution  that is the reality of the moment  This non binding measure before us is a first step toward a constitutional crisis that we can and must avoid       Let me explain what I mean by a constitutional crisis       Let us be clear about the likely consequences if we go down this path beyond this non binding resolution  Congress has been given constitutional responsibilities  But the micro management of war is not one of them  The appropriation of funds for war is       I appreciate that each of us here has our own ideas about the best way forward in Iraq  I respect those that take a different position than I  and I understand that many feel strongly that the President s strategy is the wrong one  But the Constitution  which has served us now for more than two great centuries of our history  creates not 535 commanders in chief  but one   the President of the United States  who is authorized to lead the day to day conduct of war        Whatever our opinion of this war or its conduct  it is in no one s interest to stumble into a debilitating confrontation between our two great branches of government over war powers  The potential for a constitutional crisis here and now is real  with congressional interventions  presidential vetoes  and Supreme Court decisions   If there was ever a moment for nonpartisan cooperation to agree on a process that will respect both our personal opinions about this war and our nation s interests over the long term  this is it        We need to step back from the brink and reason together  as Scripture urges us to do  about how we will proceed to express our disagreements about this war       We must recognize that  while the decisions we are making today and we are about to make seem irretrievably bound up in the immediacy of the moment and the particular people now holding positions of power in our government  these decisions will set constitutional precedents that will go far beyond this moment and these people  President Bush has less than two years left in office  and a Democrat may well succeed him  If we do not act thoughtfully in the weeks and months ahead  we will create precedents that future Congresses  future Presidents  and future generations of Americans will regret        Right now  as the battle for Baghdad begins  this institution is deeply divided  However  we should not allow our divisions to lead us to a constitutional crisis in which no one wins and our national security is greatly damaged  We are engaged  as all my colleagues know  in a larger war against a totalitarian enemy   Islamist extremism and terrorism   that seeks to vanquish all of the democratic values that it is our national purpose to protect and defend        Whatever our differences here in this chamber about this war  let us never forget the values of freedom and democracy that unite us and for which our troops have given and today give the last full measure of their devotion  Yes  we should vigorously debate and deliberate   That is not only our right  it is our responsibility   But at this difficult juncture  at this moment when a real battle  a critical battle is being waged in Baghdad  as we face a brutal enemy who attacked us on 9 11 and wants to do it again  let us not just shout at one another  but let us reach out to one another to find that measure of unity that can look beyond today s disagreements and secure the nation s future and the future of all who will follow us as
