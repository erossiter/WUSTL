                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Wednesday assailed the distribution of Fiscal Year 2006 homeland security grants  arguing that first responders in Connecticut and across the nation should get more  not less  money and that Connecticut suffers because the Department   s assessment of risk remains unclear and unfair                   The Department Wednesday announced the recipients of  1 7 billion in grants from five programs   Connecticut will receive  13 5 million from four of those programs  a 37 percent reduction from the  21 5 million it received from these programs last year   Nationwide  funding for these programs was reduced by 36 percent   Funding for all states except two     Florida and Nebraska     was reduced  New York   s funding was decreased 37 percent and Washington  D C   s went down approximately 43 percent                       The Bush Administration and this Congress continue to under fund one of the most crucial needs of this nation     Lieberman said     I will continue to argue for more  not less  funding for those brave men and women who are first at the scene to help in the event of a terrorist attack or natural disaster  and I will advocate especially on behalf of Connecticut   s security                      Connecticut   s critical military  energy  chemical  education and other infrastructure create significant vulnerabilities and risks  Connecticut is also strategically located in one of the nation   s most important travel corridors  the state   s densely populated urban and suburban communities are directly affected  and its emergency management resources must respond  whenever there are terrorist attacks or natural disasters in New York  Massachusetts  and other New England communities                      The announced funding will come from DHS   s major grant programs  the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSGP   the Urban Area Security Grants  UASI    the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  LETPP   as well as the Metropolitan Medical Response System  MMRS  and Citizens Corps Program  CCP                    The Department based its distribution of the grant money on a complex combination of factors that the Department uses to estimate both risk and effectiveness   States and cities are judged by whether they are considered at risk for terrorist attacks and on the effectiveness of their plans to spend the money                     Since the Department of Homeland Security was established in 2003  Lieberman has worked assiduously to increase funding for a variety of homeland security needs  particularly the training and equipping of first responders   In March  he offered an amendment to the FY 2007 Budget Resolution that would have restored  1 6 billion in proposed Administration cuts to first responder programs and added another  1 2 billion to improve state and local capabilities to deal with mass casualties and achieve communications interoperability                    In addition  Lieberman proposed distinct grant security programs for ports   400 million   rails   500 million   transit   500 million   buses   10 million   and the trucking industry   5 million   The amendment failed                   Lieberman also offered an amendment with HSGAC Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   for  986 million which the Senate accepted but the House has not                   Lieberman and Collins also tried to increase grant funding while reforming the distribution formula   Last year  the Senate approved S  21  the Homeland Security Grant Enhancement Act of 2005  which would have authorized  2 925 billion for the three core first responder grant programs  70 percent more than the total approved for FY 2005  Connecticut would have been guaranteed a minimum of  21 million  This measure passed the Senate but did not survive conference with the House        30
