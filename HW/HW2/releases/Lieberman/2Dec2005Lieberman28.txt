                                                                                                                                                                    This morning  in about an hour  the President will be speaking at the Naval Academy in Annapolis to define our strategy for victory in the war against terrorism and particularly in the war in Iraq         But I want to argue to you today what I would guess most of you in the room believe  that notwithstanding the change in our own world on September 11th  the answer we would have given on September 10th is still largely correct and certainly still true  That appropriately managing our relationships with an emerging  complicated China     with a booming economy  growing investments in their military strength  different values than we have in some senses and yet remarkably similar circumstances in other  senses  that that remains and must remain a critical priority of American foreign policy          In some senses the President   s recent trip to China illustrates the complications and challenges of achieving the long term good relations with China     principled relations that we like          During the trip  the Chinese leadership  as you will remember  promised to work with us on fairer trade policies    continuing an aspect that continues to be a flashpoint here in our domestic political and economic life  The leadership in China agreed with us again to fairly price their currency and to protect intellectual property rights  all points of real contention        But truly  as I look at it  nothing concrete was offered        And on the other side of the relationship     in a departure from a lot of the past visits to China by U S  Presidents     rather than releasing some political prisoners  as the President had requested  China sentenced a Christian minister to prison for printing bibles and closed down the offices of a human rights lawyer  a message clearly there from the Chinese government        So we   ve got our work cut out for us in achieving what I believe     and I presume most everybody does     should be a central goal of our foreign policy  which is to have peaceful  mutually productive and principled relations with China        Today I want to discuss what I believe is one of the biggest sources of potential friction between the U S  and the PRC  People   s Republic of China      that is our global competition for oil  The U S  and China are now the world   s number one and two consumers of oil respectively  with China   s need growing as rapidly as its economy is         This could lead to Sino American confrontations over oil that could in the years ahead threaten national security and global security unless each of  our nations     two great nations     develop and employ new technologies that will reduce their dependence on oil  And let me point out here that  though  our economic circumstances are different  and painting with a broad brush  if you will allow me to do that  there is a very comparable reality here that both countries face  which is that each of our energy systems depends on a form of energy  oil  that neither nation has naturally in abundance  And  in fact  in some senses the pressure on the Chinese will be even greater in the years ahead because their economy is growing so rapidly  and I   ll get to some numbers on       well I   ll get to that right now        In the next 20 years estimates show that the Chinese demand for oil will double as their economy grows   Estimates also are that they will need to obtain two thirds of that from outside of the PRC itself          What I want to say today is it is time the U S  and China not only recognize the similarity of our oil dependency status  and the direction that competition may take us  but begin to talk more directly about this growing global competition for oil so that we can each develop national policies and cooperative international policies     even joint research and development projects     to cut our dependency on oil before the competition becomes truly hostile        The U S  China energy engagement that I foresee could be  in one sense  the 21st Century version of what arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union were in the last century        But we   ve got to start those discussions before the race for oil becomes as hot and dangerous as the nuclear arms race between the US and the Soviet Union did in the last century          I   d point out what I think is a fortuitous difference in these two races  if you will  With arms control  we were focused on reducing dangers by destroying weapons systems        Here  we have a chance to reduce dangers by separately and jointly building new energy and transportation systems based on alternative fuels and new technologies to power our vehicles        Let me quote from Bob Zoellick  the Deputy Secretary of State  who recently told the National Committee on U S  China Relations the following           Picture the wide range of global challenges we face in the years ahead     terrorism and extremists exploiting Islam  the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction  poverty  disease     and ask whether it would be easier or harder to handle those problems if the United States and China were cooperating or at odds           That   s a question that answers itself and should lead us in the direction of exploring each and every cooperative effort with China that we can         Then  Zoellick went on     relevant to the point I   m trying to make this morning     to talk about how China   s drive to     I quote        lock up    energy supplies  could put it on a collision course with the United States and other nations        Absolutely right        This is exactly my point this morning  Let me give you a few examples of what I would call early but clear signs of an aggressive  nationalistic     understandably nationalistic     Chinese international energy policy        First  China   s negotiations with Russia on an oil pipeline that would end at Daqing     China   s main oil field and refining center in the industrial northeast  This could put it at odds with Japan  which wants the same oil and would like the pipeline to end at the Russian port of Vladivostok     which is a shorter and more secure tanker trip to Japan        China  second  is entering military basing agreements with countries along its oil supply routes from the Middle East and is building a very substantial blue water navy        We tend to see this as a reaction to Taiwan and potential conflict in the Taiwan Straits  I want to suggest that an equally significant motivation  I would guess  for the Chinese  is to develop this blue water navy is to be in a position to defend oil supply routes because if oil doesn   t get to the mainland the economy will suffer dramatically        China   s has energy contracts with both Iran and Sudan that not only would we not consider because of our values  but make China  an ally of nations that are openly hostile towards us         And fourth China  as many of you know  has been negotiating oil contracts with nations in Latin America and Africa that are part of broader bilateral relations     often involving military to military contexts     and some of those nations are Nigeria  Venezuela and Peru        So all of this is aggressive  but from the Chinese point of view  quite logical behavior for a nation dependent on oil to continue the vigorous economic growth that is necessary to bring more and more of the well over one billion Chinese into the modern economy        China     bottom line     needs assured access as best as it can secure to sources of oil or it risks being starved off of the energy it needs to feed its growing economy and in a conflict situation being blocked from those sources of oil        The U S  can and should make concrete proposals for joint projects with China which would break both nations    dependence on foreign oil  or would help break both nations    dependence on foreign oil  And as the world   s two biggest consumers of oil  again it makes sense that we work together on this          But in the meantime  the U S  has a responsibility to take our own steps to get our own appetite for oil under control  Because our national security     not to mention our economic well being and environmental health     require that we do that        I cite briefly a recent report by the International Energy Agency which says that global demand for oil     now about 85 million barrels a day     will increase by more than 50 percent to over 130 million barrels a day between now and 2030 if nothing is done         China   s oil consumption surpassed Japan   s in 2003  It is now at 6 5 million barrels per day  By 2025  demand  as I said before  is projected to more than double to more than 14 2 million barrels per day        If we do nothing  the United States demand for oil by that same year 2025 will increase 8 7 million barrels     a 40 percent increase to about 28 million barrels a day        As the authors of the IEA report say     and here I quote        we are ending up with 95 percent of the world relying for its economic well being on decisions made by five or six countries in the Middle East           That means practically that we could be one terrorist attack  or political upheaval or a rogue leader   s anti American decision away from an overnight price spike for oil that would send the global economy tumbling and the industrialized world scrambling to secure oil     with the U S and China leading the scramble        The fact is that history tells us that wars have been fought over such competitions for natural resources  In fact  as you all know  exactly such a competition is one of the factors that led to Pearl Harbor and World War II        For the good of our nation and global stability  we   ve got to lead America into a new energy age by transforming our transportation system because it is there that we consume 70 percent of our demand for oil        It is these facts that recently led 10 United States Senators  of which I am proud to be one     five Republicans and five Democrats  not just bipartisan but from every ideological point on the spectrum and every region of the country     to recently introduce the    Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act of 2005    that will put us on the path to energy diversity and greater strength and energy independence by reducing demand for oil to power our vehicles        Let me just give you a sense of the range of my colleagues I   m proud to say  Sam Brownback of Kansas was my main cosponsor  Evan Bayh  Jeff Sessions  Ken Salazar  Norm Coleman  Mark Pryor  Lindsey Graham  Bill Nelson  Dick Lugar  and Barack Obama        Now that   s a very broad group of people          It   s a bold program which I   ll describe in a moment  but the door that brought us all together was not just economic concern  but concern about the way in which our oil dependence can     no matter how strong we are militarily     compromise our national security       Very briefly  the bill starts by making it our national policy to cut America   s oil consumption by 10 million barrels a day progressively to that total     and I think we can even go higher     in 25 years        This goal will be reached by the diversification of our energy sources and the use of new technology         The fact is that gasoline is not the only portable source of stored energy  Tons of agricultural materials and agricultural waste  materials     such as corn  sugarcane and switchgrass     can be used to create billions of barrels of new fuels on millions of acres of both active and otherwise idle cropland         This is not a fantasy       a pipe dream       it   s a vision and a goal  My most tangible evidence here is Brazil  the world   s fifth largest nation  gets 80 percent of its transportation fuel from sugarcane        In a few years  American farmers could be measuring production in barrels of energy as well as bushels of food         Let me talk about the new technologies which are out there     they   re not exotic     including not just the hybrids  for which there are waiting lines at most car dealerships today  but for alternative fuels and hybrid electric plug ins        Electricity  a sector that relies on oil to fuel just two percent of its output  could further lower our oil dependence if we use it to power our cars        When I first heard about this it sounded impractical     I was about to use the un Senatorial term    flaky        but we   re all plugging in our cell phones and our blackberries every night  And we can get to the point where we are plugging in our cars as well at a time of day when the demand on the electricity grid is lower and again  most of that electric power is not produced by oil        To create the market for this new era of vehicles and reduction of our consumption of oil  this legislation requires that by 2012  10 percent of all vehicles sold in the U S  be hybrid  hybrid electric plug in or alternative fuel and biofuel vehicles         That number will rise by 10 percent a year until by 2016 we require that 50 percent of all vehicles sold in the United States be these energy alternative vehicles        We also require that about a quarter of the total federal fleet purchases be advanced diesels  hybrids or plug in hybrids by 2016  10 years from now   In fact that 75 percent be those or bio fuels        This can lead to some really exciting options that are practical  Plug in hybrid vehicles that I   ve talked about would be able to use their batteries exclusively for the first 30 miles of a trip         While Americans drive about 2 2 trillion miles a year  the vast majority of those trips are less than 10 miles  That means a plug in hybrid would use zero gallons of gasoline     or any other combustible fuel     for the vast majority of car trips that are made        Passage of this legislation I believe would go a long way toward providing the U S  not only with greater energy diversity and independence  but for all the reasons I   ve said  with greater security         As we establish our own credibility and commitment to energy diversity  I think it is critically important that we set up an accelerated  cooperative technology research and development program with China          We still have time         As a recent report by the Congressional Research Service noted     Because China does not yet have an expansive oil infrastructure  it may have less vested interest in maintaining an oil based economy  particularly if there are viable alternatives           But this window of opportunity that will close before long if we don   t take advantage of it         We should expand the U S  China Policy Dialogue  established last year with a Memorandum of Understanding between our two nations last year  to specifically create joint programs for the kinds of new vehicles and new fuels that I   ve talked about       For instance  as we work to turn our idle cropland into new fuels  why not share that knowledge and capability with the Chinese  and why not ask that they do the same for some of the steps that they are beginning to take for energy diversity and independence        Let   s also specifically work with them on alternative automobile technologies  while we have this window of time  before millions and millions of new Chinese drivers hit the roads in gas guzzling  gas only vehicles        And I want to say  finally  that we should work to bringing China into the International Energy Agency as either a full or partial member         According to the Congressional Research Service  had China been a member of the IEA before the war in Iraq and been following IEA   s oil reserve practices  it would not have hoarded 30 million barrels of oil as the Iraq invasion approached        Traditionally IEA membership has been restricted to Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  countries     and some may resist Chinese membership        In fact the Chinese themselves may have to be convinced  And China     while working cooperatively with IEA on specific projects     might itself resist joining because of the requirements for a more open and transparent energy policy        But allowing China to stay out of the IEA and the global effort to deal with energy problems makes no sense when you look at it in light of our shared economic and security needs         This is a problem that we can either let go as it is now and it may end out at a point where we can   t stop it     where we are not only at competition  but on the verge of hostilities  We have the ability now to avoid that  It seems totally appropriate to end now with a quote of Sun tzu the ancient Chinese military strategist from    Art of War           It is best to win without fighting            Taking Sun tzu one step further into the contemporary world  that when both nations  that are potentially combatants  have the chance to win     when both can prosper and provide for their people by visionary leadership and cooperative action     f fighting would be a tragic failure of foresight and leadership        We have the opportunity with regard to our dual dependence on oil to break it and avoid the conflict and instead look forward to exactly what I said was a goal of foreign policy when I started  Principled  peaceful and mutually beneficial relationships between the United States and the People   s Republic of China         Thank you very much          30
