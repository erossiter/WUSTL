Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Wednesday asked the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  to provide details on steps it is taking to implement the recommendations that the Government Accountability Office  GAO  outlined in a report criticizing the nation s traveler inspection system   The GAO report  entitled  Despite Progress  Weaknesses in Traveler Inspections Exist at Out Nation s Ports of Entry   found that Customs and Border Protection  CBP  officials were inconsistent in their enforcement of border procedures  In some instances  border officers allowed drivers to cross the border without looking at their identification and they allowed pedestrians to pass freely into the country without looking at or speaking to them                  This type of noncompliance with existing laws and inspections procedures is a likely contributing factor to CBP s struggles to increase apprehension rates of serious law violators attempting to gain illegal entry through our nation s airports or land ports of entry   the Senators wrote to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff   The findings in this report reflect poorly on the effectiveness of our current border security inspection procedures  We respectfully request that you outline how the Department will ensure proper implementation and compliance with both the reforms CBP had previously announced and with those suggested by the GAO    This report follows news of a Mexican national with a highly drug resistant form of tuberculosis who was repeatedly allowed to cross the southern border into the United States  even after officers had placed him on a border lookout list  Senators Lieberman and Collins have asked for further clarification of that incident        A copy of the letter sent to DHS can be found below                             November 14  2007    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528   Dear Secretary Chertoff     We are writing to express concern about the findings in a report released last week by the GAO that exposed serious weaknesses in traveler inspections at many of our nation s ports of entry and to request that you outline what efforts are underway to implement the GAO s recommendations        The report  entitled  Despite Progress  Weaknesses in Traveler Inspections Exist at Out Nation s Ports of Entry   found that while U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  has made progress in identifying and detaining individuals attempting to enter the country without proper documentation  vulnerabilities in its traveler inspection procedures have exposed the country to exploitation by those who intend to do us harm       The 9 11 Commission reported that 15 of the 19 hijackers could have been detained by border authorities if their travel documents and patterns had been more closely scrutinized   According the Commission s report   had the immigration system set a higher bar for determining whether individuals are who or what they claim to be   and ensuring consequences for violations   it could potentially have excluded  removed  or come into further contact with several hijackers      It is troubling to learn that despite significant efforts to improve our nation s border screening system since the 9 11 attacks  the GAO investigation found that CBP officers often fail to establish either the nationality of travelers or their eligibility to enter the country        The GAO investigators reviewed video surveillance of CBP officers allowing vehicles to enter the U S  without stopping the driver to ask for identification   Additionally  the video captured footage of people on motorcycles passing through the port of entry without making any verbal contact with a CBP officer   Also troubling are reports of a CBP officer allowing pedestrians to enter the country without looking at them or speaking to them     This type of noncompliance with existing laws and inspections procedures is a likely contributing factor to CBP s struggles to increase apprehension rates of serious law violators attempting to gain illegal entry through our nation s airports or land ports of entry   In addition  we question if it played a role in CBP s recent failure to prevent a Mexican citizen with multi drug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB  from repeatedly entering the United States even after CBP placed his name on a border lookout list   The findings in this report reflect poorly on the effectiveness of our current border security inspection procedures       The report attributes many of the problems to lack of focus and complacency among the inspection officers  insufficient staffing levels  poor training  and lack of supervisory reviews   The GAO describes a series of actions CBP has taken to address the weaknesses in the inspection process such as issuing revised inspection procedures  increasing the presence of supervisors at primary inspections  developing a staff allocation model  and developing an extensive training program       However  the report warns that even after these reforms were implemented at CBP field offices  GAO investigators continued to find weaknesses in inspections   The GAO therefore made additional recommendations such as developing internal controls to ensure compliance  developing stronger training oversight  and formalizing performance measures   We respectfully request that you outline how the Department will ensure proper implementation and compliance with both the reforms CBP had previously announced and with those suggested by the GAO   Please also describe what measures will be put in place to evaluate the success of these reforms       Conducting thorough and secure inspections at our nation s 326 ports of entry while also promoting safe and efficient travel and commerce is a difficult and complex task  Nevertheless  we must meet our obligation to the American people to prevent dangerous goods and people from entering the country       We look forward to receiving a timely response and thank you in advance for your cooperation   If you have questions about this request  please contact Patricia Rojas on the majority Committee staff at  202  224 2627 or Rob Strayer on the minority staff at  202  224 4751     Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman
