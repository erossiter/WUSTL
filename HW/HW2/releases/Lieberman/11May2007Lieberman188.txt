Leslie Phillips                                                                                                Senators Lieberman  Kyl  and Collins Introduce Legislation to Encourage Continuing Citizen Involvement in Fighting Terrorism                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Bill Provides Immunity to Individuals Who Report Suspicious Activities       Washington  D C    A bipartisan group of United States Senators including Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security Committee  Senator Susan Collins Chairman  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT   and Senator Jon Kyl  R AZ  today introduced bipartisan legislation that would provide legal protections to individuals who report suspicious activity that may reflect terrorist threats   The bill would provide civil immunity in American courts for citizens who  acting in good faith  report threats to our transportation systems to appropriate law enforcement and transportation system officials  without fear of being sued   The bill would not protect individuals who knowingly make false statements          An amendment authored by Representatives Peter T  King  R NY  and Steve Pearce  R NM  containing similar language was already adopted by the House   The Senate sponsors indicated that the introduction of the bill in the Senate represents a breakthrough for efforts to include the amendment in final 9 11 legislation  currently under negotiation between the House and the Senate       King  Pearce  and Rep  Bill Shuster  R PA  are also set to introduce companion legislation next week       In a speech to the U S  Senate  Collins explained that the recent arrests in Fort Dix  New Jersey  which foiled a plot to attack and kill American soldiers  was the result of a tip from a vigilant citizen  coupled with effective coordination by state and federal law enforcement officials         The recent arrests in New Jersey of six men charged with conspiring to murder American soldiers at Fort Dix underscores the need for this bill   noted Senator Collins    Law enforcement officials have noted that their investigation was triggered by an alert clerk s report that a customer had brought in a video that showed men firing weapons and shouting in Arabic  which reminded him of the 9 11 terrorists   Protecting citizens who make good faith reports of potentially lethal activities is essential to maintaining our homeland security        Senator Lieberman said   Since 2001  when we were struck on our own shores by Islamist terrorists  the idea has taken hold that everyone needs to be alert to possible terrorist incidents  This notion paid off when authorities arrested six men in Fort Dix  N J   after a store clerk noticed alarming elements in a video tape the alleged would be terrorists brought to the store for copying  The Fort Dix incident reminds us that ordinary people can and do play an important role in the security of our communities   This bill will encourage others to be alert to suspicious activities regarding transportation systems  without fear of repercussions       Senator Kyl said   I am happy to join with Senator Collins on this bill to provide legal protection to citizens that report information to law enforcement officials   If you see something  you should say something  and not have to worry about being sued        Rep  King noted   In a post 9 11 reality  passenger vigilance is essential to security   If we fail to protect passengers that report suspicious behavior  it would be a huge victory for terrorists   It is terrific news that Chairman Lieberman and Ranking Member Collins have thrown their weight behind this important measure   If we expect the 9 11 bill to be meaningful  substantive homeland security legislation  the  John Doe  protections for passengers must remain a part of it         Rep  Pearce said   Alert Americans are often our first and last line of defense in protecting the country from terrorist attacks   They should not face potential prosecution for doing the right thing and coming forward to report suspicious activity   It is a sad commentary that this kind of common sense has to be written into law  but we must make it clear to America s enemies that they can not exploit our system of justice         Rep  Shuster noted   No American should ever be sued because they tried to stop a terrorist act   No American should be forced to second guess a decision to alert authorities that could save the lives of other   This legislation will protect vigilant American against the threat of punitive and frivolous lawsuits whose only objective is to chill public involvement in the War on Terror when we need it most   I applaud Rep  Pearce and Rep  King for their leadership in spearheading this legislation with me
