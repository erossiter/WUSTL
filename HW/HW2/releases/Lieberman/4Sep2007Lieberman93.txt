Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   Tuesday voted to confirm Congressman Jim Nussle as the new director of the Office of Management and Budget  Nussle s was confirmed by a vote of 69 24  Following is the statement the Senator made on the floor of the Senate earlier in the day in favor of the nomination      Madame President  I rise today to express my intent to support the nomination of Jim Nussle as Director of the Office of Management and Budget       I do so because Congressman Nussle  in my judgment  falls comfortably within the standard that I have set as I have had the honor to dispatch my responsibility under the advice and consent clause of the Constitution  and to state it in non Constitutional terms  I have always felt that the standard I should apply is not whether I would present this nominee to the Senate  because under the Constitution  that s not the Senate s responsibility  It s the President s authority and responsibility  The question would be   in dispatching my responsibility under the advice and consent clause  do I conclude that this individual   who the President has nominated   is within an acceptable range for the particular job for which he s been nominated  On that basis  I have reached a conclusion that I will vote to support Congressman Nussle s nomination      I speak in my individual capacity  but I also obviously am honored to be the Chair of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  and I will note for the record that there were no negative votes in our Committee on this nomination and there was one abstention      Madame President  this nomination would be a significant one no matter when it came before the Senate for a vote because the Office of Management and Budget is a very significant and powerful one in our government   But fate brings it before us at an important and challenging fiscal time in Washington and for our country  The fact is  in less than a month  Congress must enact 12 appropriations bills to fund the vital functions of the federal government for the fiscal year beginning October 1  We have much work ahead of us  It is difficult work  It has been complicated by a number of veto threats emerging from the White House about the appropriations bills   Some have even speculated that the ensuing confrontation will lead yet again to a government shutdown of parts of the federal government   I hope not because no one gains from such stalemate and shut downs      To meet our obligations to the American people  we must reach across the partisan divide   as voters have so often said they want us to  In this case  that means we must have an OMB Director who is not just but who is constructive  He must be a consensus builder  a willing partner with Congress  a mediator between the Executive and Legislative branches  working to solve problems and accommodate legitimate differences in opinion  He must be a fiscal expert  But he must also  in the weeks ahead  be a statesman           I support this nomination of Congressman Nussle but I do so with the understanding that the Congressman will have to exercise the full measure of his diplomatic skills  at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue  to help bring the FY 2008 budget and appropriations process to a satisfactory conclusion      There s a lot on the line in achieving that end in a responsible and appropriate way  The nation counts on it  but a lot of individual citizens who rely either on the security that the government provides or the services that the government provides count on us as well      We are a nation at war   Our soldiers in the field need critical funding to ensure their safety and the success of their mission   We are a nation still under threat of terrorist attack here at home  Resources for our homeland security  our first responders  must be more sufficient than the Administration has provided to date to allow our first responders and homeland protectors to do the jobs we expect them to do for us with the proper equipment and the proper training  We are a nation with an aging infrastructure  The Minneapolis bridge collapse last month was a clear warning that we cannot ignore the highway and transportation systems that move people and commerce in our dynamic and complex society  We have children going to schools across the country who depend on the investment that the federal government makes in their education   We have senior citizens who depend on the federal government to not only protect their security but to provide a decent minimum standard of living in so many different ways in their senior years       These are just a few of the obligations we have to meet   That is why it is so critical on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue that we come to this budget and appropriations task in the coming weeks with a sense of good faith and share values as Americans who care about our future and our people        We cannot meet these obligations with confrontation or deadlock   Let me be specific about this  The key difference between Congress  FY 2008 budget plan and the President s is the discretionary spending level   Congress established a level of  953 billion   The President set his level at  933 billion  That s a  20 billion difference  Now   20 billion is a very significant amount of money  But it represents just 2 percent of all discretionary spending for the federal government for the next fiscal year and represents less than one percent of all federal expenditures  In other words  this difference  less than 1 percent  is something that reasonable people sharing a loyalty to our country out to be able to resolve   It is not a difference that merits a government shutdown in whole or in part   It is a difference that can and must be bridged   by people who understand the budget process and are willing to forge consensus       Congressman Nussle has considerable experience in budgetary matters  having served as Chairman of the House Budget Committee from 2001 through 2006 and on the House Ways and Means Committee  During his confirmation hearing before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  I asked him if he would be willing to advise the President to remain open to compromise on spending levels to avoid a government shutdown   He responded  and I quote the nominee here   I will remain open and I need to remain open   That s part of the reason why I voted to report Congressman Nussle s nomination out of the committee favorably  I repeat  based on his experience  based on his intelligence  he is comfortably within the range  in my judgment  of people who can serve as Director of the OMB  But  I will say that to me it is critically important that Congressman Nussle keep the promise he made to our Committee that he will do everything in his power as the next Director of OMB to avoid confrontation for funding the federal government in the operations for 2008       Achieving compromise on the FY08 Appropriations bills is only one of the OMB Director s many critical responsibilities   He must also help the President prepare and execute the budget across 14 cabinet departments and more than 100 executive agencies  boards  and commissions   The OMB Director recommends where every taxpayer dollar is spent  oversees how each agency s programs are managed  and reviews vital rules for public health  worker safety  and environmental protection      The OMB Director also is the chief management officer of the federal government  overseeing how agencies conduct procurement  handle their finances  manage information technology  and otherwise carry out their operations  The numbers here  and I want to pause for a moment to stress the  M  part of OMB  the management part  which is often overlooked because it the  B   the budgeting that is the most publicly visible  The numbers are startling and disturbing and demand our attention and will  if confirmed  demand Congressman Nussle s attention  Government spending on contracts has exploded while the overseeing has shrunk  causing widely publicized and  I add  infuriating examples of waste  The problem will only worsen in the years head if we do not act to better protect the taxpayers  dollars      The United States Government is the largest buyer of goods and services in the world  Between 2000 and 2006  spending on government contracts has grown from  219 billion a year to  415 billion  That is an astounding 89 percent increase  Yet  the number of federal acquisition specialists   the people who negotiate and oversee the contracts for this  415 billion   these people have dropped dramatically  This is a significant period of downsizing of the workforce in the 1990 s and a small decrease in the last six years in response to an enormous increase in contracting  The numbers are particularly striking at the Department of Defense where the workforce has declined by nearly 50 percent since the mid 1990s  Government wide the workforce is about to shrink even further if nothing is done since roughly half the current federal workforce is eligible to retire within the next four years  So  it is imperative that he pay particular attention to this challenge  federal government buying  contracting  which involves mores than  400 billion of taxpayers  hard earned dollars       Let me conclude by saying I have had serious concerns about how budget responsibilities have been dealt with by the administration over the last six and a half years  While I understand that the next Director will not begin with a blank slate  his performance will be judged by how well he comes to grips with some of these inherited problems       The next OMB Director will likely be President Bush s final OMB Director   He will have the opportunity to craft policy that will be a lasting legacy  Let s hope it s a lasting legacy of responsibility and fairness   I would urge that  if confirmed  Congressman Nussle take a long look at that legacy and that he works to achieve both the fiscal soundness and fairness that has too often been absent from this administration s record to date      For the past six years  we ve wrestled with the politics of confrontation here in Washington  D C  and  generally speaking  not only have all of us lost  but  more importantly  the American people and the public interest has lost   As the election season shifts into high gear  we cannot let that increasingly partisan environment culminate in fiscal and governmental chaos   To meet our obligations  we must work together   as voters demand   for the greater good of our nation  Jim Nussle will have a great opportunity and an equally good responsibility to see that we do just that       Thank you       30
