praises inclusion of worthy provisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today expressed strong disapproval of what he considered to be a deeply flawed budget reconciliation bill that passed the Senate last night on a nearly party line vote of 52 47   Lieberman decried the passage of a provision to allow drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge as a serious mistake that would haunt Americans for generations to come   Lieberman also cited changes that adversely affect Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries and the rejection of fiscal responsibility measures as among the worst problems with the bill             I am heartbroken that after my 17 years successfully fighting off attempts  the Senate has now voted to destroy the pristine Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for only a small amount of oil that won t lower prices to our consumers or give us true energy security   This is a serious mistake that will haunt us for generations to come     Lieberman said      Moreover  I simply could not support a budget that severely cuts important programs that Connecticut residents rely on to help with the increasing costs of health care  yet failed to include a common sense    pay as you go    measure to ensure that our nation   s budget is fiscally responsible           In particular  Lieberman expressed disappointment that the Senate rejected                     An amendment sponsored by Lieberman and Senator Maria Cantwell  D WA  to strip language in the budget that authorized the Interior Department to lease the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas drilling   Rejected 51 48                       An amendment sponsored by Senator Kent Conrad to restore Pay As You Go rules to the budget process   Rejected 50 49                      An amendment sponsored by Senator Bill Nelson  D FL  that would have protected an increase in Medicare reimbursement rates for physicians but would have ensured the cost was not passed onto seniors through an increase in Medicare Part B premiums   Rejected 50 49                      An amendment sponsored by Senator Patty Murray  D WA  to provide individuals that are eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid a 6 month transition to the new Part D drug benefit to avoid any gaps in coverage  particularly for the disabled   Rejected 56 43   and                     A Hurricane Katrina relief amendment sponsored by Senator Blanche Lincoln  D AR  that would have used unspent FEMA funds to provide Medicaid coverage to displaced individuals  provide federal support for affected states    Medicaid programs  create a disaster relief fund  and provide assistance to Medicare beneficiaries   Rejected 51 48         Despite his disappointment in the overall budget  Lieberman hailed several worthy provisions that did make it into the final bill  including his FairCare legislation to increase health care quality for all and provisions based on legislation he has sponsored to provide incentives for study in math  science  engineering and foreign languages           As often happens with even bad budget bills like this one  a few bright rays of light shine through the fog     Lieberman said      I am gratified my proposals to address health care disparities and to encourage study of fields crucial to our nation   s prosperity and security   math  science  engineering and foreign languages     made it through the Senate   I will continue to fight for these provisions as the bill goes to conference with the House           Specifically  Lieberman praised the inclusion of                     An amendment based on the Lieberman Hatch FairCare legislation that seeks to improve health care quality for all  including for minorities who receive inappropriate care more frequently than do majority groups   A Medicare provision in the underlying bill creates a health care quality measure and offers incentives to healthcare providers for practicing them   The FairCare amendment builds upon that to specify the development  collection and reporting of healthcare quality measures for majority and minority groups   Accepted by voice vote                      An amendment sponsored by Senators Lieberman and John Warner  R VA  to authorize the Secretary of Education to award increased federal    ProGAP    grants to students majoring in programs of math  science  engineering and foreign languages that are all key to our national and homeland security   Accepted by voice vote                      A new provision in the underlying bill  based on Lieberman Warner legislation  that awards  450 million a year in    SMART Grants    to supplement funding received by low income Pell Grant recipients in their 3rd and 4th year of college who are pursuing majors in math  science  engineering and critical foreign languages                       An amendment based on the Lieberman Santorum Colon Cancer Screen for Life Act  that aims to improve utilization of lifesaving colorectal cancer screening among Medicare beneficiaries and to improve Medicare coverage of procedures    Accepted by voice vote         Lieberman floor statement on ANWR         More on Lieberman FairCare amendment         30
