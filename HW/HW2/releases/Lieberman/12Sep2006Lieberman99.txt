  Joseph Lieberman  D CT   and Richard Durbin  D IL  have called on John Negroponte  the Director of National Intelligence  to ensure that an information sharing implementation plan that was required under the provisions of the intelligence reform bill of 2004  is submitted to Congress without further delay   The Information Sharing Environment  ISE  implementation plan  which was due within one year of enactment of the intelligence reform bill  is intended to outline a plan to facilitate government wide terrorism information sharing and access capabilities among federal agencies and among federal  state  local  and tribal governments   The Senators acknowledged that some progress has been made in this regard  but this progress is not enough to ensure the continued security of the country   The newly created ISE has already seen its Second Program Manager  is not yet fully staffed  and has completed only an interim Implementation Plan                    In its Final Report on the 9 11 Commission Recommendations  the Public Discourse Project  which was the successor entity of the 9 11 Commission  gave the government a    D    grade in areas of    government wide information sharing                       A text of the Senators    letter to Negroponte is as follows        September 11  2006       The Honorable John D  Negroponte      Director of National Intelligence      Office of the Director of National Intelligence      Washington  DC 20511       Dear Ambassador Negroponte        We are writing to express our concern that the President has not yet submitted to Congress an implementation plan for the Information Sharing Environment  ISE          As you know  this report was due within one year of enactment of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  IRTPA   P L  108 458  Section 1016 e    Effective congressional oversight  including our consideration of whether the ISE should be reauthorized  depends on our receipt and review of the Implementation Plan        In its July 22  2004 report on the terrorist attacks of September 11  2001  the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks upon the United States  the 9 11 Commission  concluded that a lack of information sharing contributed to the government   s failure to prevent the attacks and recommended that 1  policies and procedures should provide incentives for sharing information  to restore a better balance between security and shared knowledge  and 2  the President should lead the government wide effort to bring resolution to the sometimes conflicting legal  policy  and technical issues across agencies to create a    trusted information network      In light of these conclusions  recommendations  and other information  Congress passed IRTPA  establishing the ISE to improve information sharing         Although some progress has been made in establishing the Information Sharing Environment  the relatively young ISE has already seen its second Program Manager  is not yet fully staffed  and has only completed an interim Implementation Plan        As two major reports indicated last year  much remains to be done   In January 2005  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  added    Establishing Appropriate and Effective Information Sharing Mechanisms to Improve Homeland Security    to its High Risk List  stating that they were    designating information sharing for homeland security as a governmentwide high risk area because this area  while receiving increased attention  still faces significant challenges     GAO 05 207    On December 5  2005  the 9 11 Public Discourse Project  the successor body of the 9 11 Commission  issued its Final Report on 9 11 Commission Recommendations  Important areas on information sharing  including    incentives for information sharing    and    government wide information sharing     received a D in the scheme of letter grade assessments  This is simply unacceptable and demands urgent action to maximize our ability to prevent future acts of terrorism against the American people        This year  the Markle Foundation   s Task Force on Information Security in the Information Age issued its third report     Mobilizing Information to Prevent Terrorism  Accelerating Development of a Trusted Information Sharing Environment      The report states    we have witnessed some genuine improvements in information sharing  But    systematic  trusted information sharing remains more of an aspiration than a reality     The report calls for a renewed commitment to developing the information sharing environment  and we echo this call        While we are aware of the strides that have been made  more must be done  As partners in the endeavor to foster better information sharing  we pledge to do our part  However  Congress cannot contribute fully to this effort without information  This is what makes the Implementation Plan so important  We request that you make completion and submission of the Implementation Plan a priority        There is widespread agreement that information sharing must be improved and a trusted information sharing environment achieved  We cannot allow turf battles and agency infighting to stymie this effort  We ask that you  as the Director of National Intelligence  encourage the President  with the assistance of the ISE Program Manager  to submit to Congress the Implementation Plan required by IRTPA        Thank you for your tremendous efforts in protecting our citizens from another terrorist attack  We look forward to continuing our work with you to address critical security and intelligence issues facing this nation  To respond to this request  or if you have questions  please feel free to contact one of us or our staff
