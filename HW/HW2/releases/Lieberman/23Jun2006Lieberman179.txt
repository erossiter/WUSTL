submitted the following testimony yesterday at a hearing before the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee on the Enhanced Energy Security Act  a bill based on the legislation that Lieberman introduced last November with Senators Bayh  D IN   Brownback  R KS   and Coleman  R MN  to reduce America   s dependence on oil        Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman      Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee      Hearing on S  2747  the Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006      June 22  2006          Thank you  Mr  Chairman   I am grateful to the members of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee for allowing me to testify in support of the Enhanced Energy Security Act   I was proud to cosponsor this bill with Senator Bingaman last month              As you know  the Enhanced Energy Security Act is based on the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  a bill that Senators Bayh  Brownback  Coleman  and I introduced with six other colleagues last November   Twenty six Senators  including Senator Bingaman  have now cosponsored that bill  which I like to call the Set America Free Act   Seventy nine Congressmen and Congresswomen have cosponsored its companion bill in the House of Representatives              The Set America Free Act   s core provisions fall within the jurisdiction of this committee   Senator Bingaman has taken that core  has slightly amended and supplemented it  and has reintroduced it as the Enhanced Energy Security Act   He also has taken those of the Set America Free Act   s provisions that fall within the Finance Committee   s jurisdiction and has introduced them as the Enhanced Energy Security Tax Incentives Act  of which I am also an original cosponsor              As the Ranking Minority Member of this Committee  and as someone who has earned the respect of Senator Domenici  the committee   s esteemed Chairman  Senator Bingaman has had the wherewithal to bring about today   s hearing   I commend him and Chairman Domenici for doing so   It is an unmistakable sign of the momentum that continues to gather behind the Set America Free Act              Like that bill  the Enhanced Energy Security Act requires the Executive Branch to use means readily at its disposal to save  by 2016  2 5 million barrels per day from projected oil consumption in that year   It goes on to require 7 million barrels per day in savings by 2026 and 10 million barrels per day in savings by 2031   Currently  we import just over 10 million barrels per day of crude oil and consume just over twice that amount              Americans are alarmed both by the steady rise in gas prices and by the increasing volatility in those prices   The main reason fuel prices are high and volatile is that the price of oil is high and volatile   The fundamental reason for that  in turn  is the narrowness of the margin between global oil demand and global oil production   We might never again see a comfortable margin  because while we have not yet drained all the oil deposits in the world  the demand of countries such as the US  China  and India is growing just as quickly as production              Many Americans are also concerned that the US is being thrust into increasing competition over oil with nations such as China  and they do not like seeing our economy held hostage to the caprice of those unstable and even hostile countries that supply much of the world   s oil               The US can not drill its way out of this bind   Oil is a commodity that trades in a global market   Any modest amount of oil produced by new wells in the US would be merely a trickle in the stream of global production  and thus would not have any appreciable effect on the price we pay for oil              The only permanent solution to high fuel prices is to end our oil addiction   The Set America Free Act would do just that   What is more  in the process of making our cars  trucks  and busses more efficient and increasing the use of fuels derived from crops  the act would reduce greatly the amount of global warming pollution that our vehicles add to the atmosphere               Energy independence  economic security  and curbing global warming     the Set America Free Act advances us toward each of those vital goals   So I am honored to testify today in favor of Senator Bingaman   s Enhanced Energy Security Act   I respectfully ask this committee to schedule a vote on the bill and to report it favorably to the Senate floor              Thank you  Mr  Chairman            30
