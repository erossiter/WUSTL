Mismanagement and Fraud in FEMA s Disaster Aid Program in Miami Dade                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     DHS IG releases audit report of awards following 2004 Hurricanes in Miami Dade County  Florida       Washington  DC   Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  today held a hearing in the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to examine the Federal Emergency Management Agency   s  FEMA  response to the series of hurricanes that struck Florida last year   The Committee documented fraudulent claims  wasteful spending  and ineffective government management in FEMA   s response to Hurricane Frances in Miami Dade County  Florida   Senator Collins is the Chairman and Senator Lieberman is the Ranking Member of the Committee  which has jurisdiction over FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security  DHS         Although our focus is on specific events in Florida  this issue has ramifications that are relevant to future disaster relief efforts in all regions of our country     said the Senators in a joint statement      Federal disaster relief is very important to help families and communities rebuild from a disaster  however  it must be limited to those who have truly suffered losses   The critical nature of this assistance makes reports of waste  mismanagement and outright fraud particularly disturbing   We cannot sweep such allegations under the rug  we must face them head on to preserve public confidence in this critical program          The Committee   s investigation has revealed that  31 2 million of disaster aid was distributed in Miami Dade County after Hurricane Frances  even though the county   s Emergency Operations Center reported that damage and debris from Frances was    minimal      Quality control inspections conducted by FEMA inspectors after disaster aid was distributed found that  out of a random sampling of completed inspections  37  showed errors on personal property awards  18 5  showed errors made on determining if the home was unsafe  and 11 5  showed errors on aid that was granted for rental assistance and relocation          These numbers are higher than any acceptable rate of error   It appears that FEMA lacks the controls to prevent significant amounts of waste and fraud   There is no reason that the federal government cannot deliver swift and compassionate disaster assistance and still ensure the proper checks and balances are in place so that the people who truly need help are getting it     said the Senators      Clearly  FEMA needs to make changes in its processes and regulations   FEMA failed to properly perform required damage assessments and properly oversee its inspection process   The public needs to know that fraud will be prosecuted and that we will not tolerate waste or abuse          The DHS Inspector General   s Office  IG  released a report during the investigative hearing today that found that  1  FEMA designated Miami Dade County eligible for Individual Assistance programs without a proper preliminary damage assessment  2  some disaster aid provided for repairs and replacement of household items were not based on actual disaster related damage or loss  3  the verification of some personal property damages were based on undocumented verbal representations  4  guidance and criteria for replacing or repairing automobiles and the reimbursement of expenses for funerals and other items were generally lacking  5  some Expedited Rental Assistance applicants received assistance without a need for it  and 6  rental assistance awards were made to some applicants without reasonable assurance of eligibility   The report also found that FEMA   s oversight of inspections needs improvements       The DHS IG report concluded that     The policies  procedures  and guidelines used in Miami Dade County for the Individuals and Households Program  IHP  were also used throughout the State of Florida  casting doubt about the appropriateness of IHP awards made to individuals and households in other counties of the state as a result of the four hurricanes  of 2004   particularly those counties that had only marginal damage   Further  according to FEMA officials  most of the procedures were used for disasters in other states making the conditions and recommendations broadly applicable to FEMA   s implementation of the IHP nationwide          The witnesses who testified at today   s hearing were  DHS Acting IG Richard Skinner  FEMA Director Michael Brown  and Senator Bill Nelson  D FL        30
