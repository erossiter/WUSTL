s Expanded Human Intelligence Capabilities    Could Undermine Congress s Vision for Intelligence Reform

Intelligence Reform legislation  ask Sec  Rumsfeld to explain Strategic Support Branch and coordination with new DNI       Washington  DC     Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  today asked the U S  Secretary of Defense  Donald Rumsfeld  to explain the Pentagon   s expanded human intelligence operations  reportedly called the    Strategic Support Branch     and whether the initiative is consistent with the Collins Lieberman intelligence reform bill  which was signed into law by President Bush last month   Recent news reports have identified the development of a human intelligence capability at the U S  Department of Defense  DoD  to conduct human intelligence operations and possible covert operations in foreign countries   Senators Collins and Lieberman are seeking to ensure that the operation not attempt to supercede or circumvent the authorities of the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA   or the new Director of National Intelligence  DNI           Senators Collins and Lieberman authored the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  which redefined the position of the CIA Director and created the DNI   The legislation represented the most sweeping reform of the nation   s intelligence community in more than 50 years  in order to coordinate and transform the country   s intelligence agencies to counter terrorism and other emerging national security threats   Senators Collins and Lieberman expressed concern that DoD   s expanded human intelligence operations    could undermine Congress   s vision for intelligence reform as embodied in this new law                       The following is the text of a letter that Senators Collins and Lieberman sent to Secretary Rumsfeld today        The Honorable Donald Rumsfeld       Secretary of Defense      The Department of Defense      Washington  DC 20301       Dear Secretary Rumsfeld                    We are writing to seek additional information about the Department of Defense   s development of a human intelligence capability reportedly called the    Strategic Support Branch      Recent news stories have discussed the Department   s apparent creation of a    full spectrum    human intelligence capability to conduct human intelligence operations and possibly covert operations across a host of countries   As authors of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  we are concerned that this capability could undermine Congress   s vision for intelligence reform as embodied in this new law                      The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  signed into law by President Bush on December 17  2004  enacts the most comprehensive overhaul of our nation   s intelligence agencies in more than 50 years   The legislation   s objective is to ensure that the Intelligence Community has the leadership  resources  personnel  coordination  and oversight necessary to counter the security threats of today and the future   Central to the legislation is the creation of a strong Director of National Intelligence  DNI      one person who will be in charge of and accountable for the Intelligence Community  Under the legislation  the DNI serves as the head of the Intelligence Community and the principal intelligence adviser to the President                     The legislation also states that the Director of the Central Intelligence Agency  CIA  reports to the DNI   Under the legislation  the CIA Director has the responsibility to    collect intelligence through human sources   and  provide overall direction for and coordination of the collection of national intelligence outside the United States through human sources by elements of the intelligence community authorized to undertake such collection and  in coordination with other departments  agencies  or elements of the United States Government which are authorized to undertake such collection  ensure that the most effective use is made of resources and that appropriate account is taken of the risks to the United States and those involved in such collection        Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  P  L  108 458  section 1011  adding section 104A to Title I of the National Security Act of 1947  50 U S C  section 402 et seq                      The legislation envisions that intelligence agencies    capabilities will be integrated by mission oriented National Intelligence Centers  which will conduct all source strategic analysis and also drive collection requirements   The legislation also establishes a National Counterterrorism Center  NCTC  to forge unity of effort across the Executive Branch  both by integrating the Intelligence Community   s capabilities against terrorism and by conducting strategic operational planning against terrorism on an Executive Branch wide basis                     Based on our concern that the Department   s alleged development of a    full spectrum    human intelligence capability would detract from the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  we ask that you provide us answers to the following questions                  To what extent does the Department   s reportedly expanded human intelligence capability duplicate or overlap with the CIA   s capabilities   Is the Department   s human intelligence capability focused only on counterterrorism   or also on other intelligence topics   And how will the CIA Director ensure that the most effective use is made of the nation   s human intelligence capabilities                   Will the NCTC Director  who reports to the DNI regarding all counterterrorism intelligence matters  have access to the human intelligence developed by this Department capability relating to the national counterterrorism effort   And if the Department   s human intelligence activities extend beyond terrorism  will they be integrated with other intelligence capabilities via the National Intelligence Centers                    How does the DNI retain authority over and accountability for the Intelligence Community and fulfill the role of being the President   s principal advisor on intelligence if the Department has a competing worldwide intelligence capability                  The intelligence reform bill does not materially alter statutory requirements contained in Title 50 of the Unites States Code for Presidential authorization of covert action and notification to Congress   We understand that there are different authorization and notification requirements for activities carried out under the authority of Title 10 of the United States Code as opposed to Title 50   However  we are concerned that a broad interpretation of Title 10 authority could allow the Executive Branch to engage in covert action without complying with Title 50 authorization and notification requirements   Please describe in detail the Department   s plans for compliance with Title 50 requirements concerning covert action or provide the legal basis for any conclusion that Title 50 does not apply in certain circumstances                    Staff of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs have attempted for more than a month to secure information from the Department on these matters  which have now received widespread media attention   We write because we know that you understand the importance of Congressional oversight of Executive Branch actions as well as Congress   s responsibility to ensure that its laws are faithfully executed                    Thank you for your consideration of this request         30
