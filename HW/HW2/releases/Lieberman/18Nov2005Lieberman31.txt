and Urban Development  THUD  Appropriations Conference Committee today approved a measure that  thanks in part to the efforts of Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman  will provide funding to help improve surface transportation  rail transit and promote affordable housing and community development in Connecticut and across the country   Dodd and Lieberman worked with their Senate and House colleagues to ensure that funds for a number of Connecticut projects remained in the bill providing more than  55 million in new federal funds for transportation and housing initiatives statewide         Included in the spending package is  4 22 billion for Community Development Block Grants to states  The CDBG program  which is administered by the Department of Housing and Urban Development  was created in 1974  CDBG provides resources for community development projects that benefit low  and moderate income residents including support for local health and senior services  housing rehabilitation  and improvements to parks and public facilities  President Bush announced earlier this year that he had plans to eliminate funding for the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program in his FY 06 budget   Senators Dodd and Lieberman  along with other congressional colleagues  successfully fought to keep the CDBG program alive         The conference report also appropriates  1 3 billion for Amtrak despite the Administration   s effort to eliminate all funding for the passenger railroad   Though Senators Dodd and Lieberman applaud this funding level  they expressed concern over a provision in the conference report allowing the Secretary of Transportation to determine user fees for commuter railroads that operate along the Amtrak owned Northeast Corridor           I   m proud to help secure more than  55 million for community redevelopment efforts and transportation improvements across Connecticut  Our communities are the best in the country and this funding will help them continue to thrive and live up to their full potential     said Dodd         This bill is good news for Connecticut   Lieberman said   The funding approved today will make significant strides in improving Connecticut s commute on our highway  rail and transit systems  This bill also helps support redevelopment and modernization initiatives by restoring community development funds and funding other key state projects           The funding was included as part of the annual appropriations bill that covers the Departments of Transportation and Housing and Urban Development for fiscal year 2006   Below are the Connecticut projects included in the bill  which now goes to the President for his signature  Non transit highway and transportation projects will not be decided on
