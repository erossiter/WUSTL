Importance       WASHINGTON     The Connecticut Congressional delegation has joined forces with Governor Jodi Rell to seek adequate funding to secure the state   s ports and transit systems and to urge the Department of Homeland Security to take a more regional approach in awarding federal transit security grants        In a letter sent Wednesday to Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge  the state   s two Senators  five Representatives  and the Governor asked that Connecticut   s    strategic regional position    be carefully evaluated as federal money is awarded in the future  For example  Connecticut is the transportation gateway to all of New England and over 100 000 people commute to New York each day on Connecticut rails  In addition  New Haven   s harbor is the home of the Regional Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage terminal  the second largest heating oil reserve in the Northeast        The letter follows news that Connecticut will receive less money in 2005 than it received in 2004 under a general homeland security grant program  which has been reduced nationwide  In addition  the Department of Homeland Security has announced that a grant awarded to New Haven in 2004 under a high risk urban area program will not be renewed for 2005        These cuts    make Connecticut   s need for funding under the Port Security Grants Program and the Transit Security Grants Program all the more urgent     the letter said     Inadequate funding under these programs could jeopardize the state   s security enhancements at the Port of New Haven as well as its other ports and would further threaten Connecticut   s ability to address security needs at critical transportation infrastructure facilities              In the case of Connecticut  the state   s role as a regional  commercial and cultural leader comes with significant responsibilities for security and protection  We urge your careful consideration of Connecticut   s significant responsibilities and potential vulnerabilities    as grants are awarded in the future        Following is the complete letter           January 4  2005        The Honorable Tom Ridge      Secretary      United States Department of Homeland Security      Washington  DC  20528        Dear Secretary Ridge        As the Department of Homeland Security determines its FY2005 awards to states under the Port Security Grant Program and the Transit Security Grant Program  we write to you to urge your careful consideration of Connecticut   s strategic regional position and its enhanced security needs        Connecticut   s location  as the midpoint of the New York to Boston corridor and as the gateway to all of New England  means the state plays a role of special significance to the safety  vitality and security of more than 14 million people   The major interstate highways of I 84  I 91 and I 95 support much of the commercial activity northeast of New York State   Similarly  Connecticut   s transit systems are integral to the region   On a daily basis over 100 000 commuters travel to New York on Connecticut   s rail system   New Haven   s train terminal is a hub for train travel and commerce in the Northeastern United States   Thousands of people commute daily along the Metro North Commuter Rail Line from suburban New York and Southwestern Connecticut into the financial and business districts of New York City   Much of the passenger and cargo traffic carried by rail to New England must pass on Connecticut   s coastal rail lines  and these lines form a critical link in the rail system connecting New York City to Providence and Boston        Connecticut   s role as a social and economic crossroads requires that the State expend substantial resources to protect both residents and nonresidents in their travels and to ensure the safe transport of valuable economic commodities   For these reasons  additional funding to protect the state   s transit systems is essential and we hope that you will keep this in mind in allocating this year   s upcoming transit grants          Moreover  we urge you to take a more explicitly regional approach to transit funding in these awards than was done in FY2004   Last year  in cases in which a transit system extended into more than one state  the state in which the relevant transit agency was headquartered was the sole designated grant recipient   In the case of Metro North  this meant that New York State was the grant recipient  although the Metro North system operates in both New York and Connecticut   Although the grantee state was required to pass through 80  of the money to the relevant transit agency  there was no requirement that that state or the transit agency allocate any of the grant funds to protect those portions of the transit system that are located in any other state   We believe that the better and more equitable approach where there is a multistate transit system is to take steps to ensure the entire system is protected   If the Department continues its approach of making grants to multi state transit systems through only a single state  we believe that the Department needs to create a mechanism to ensure that appropriate funding is passed on to all states participating in the transit system and that the home state of the transit agency is not allocated a disproportionate share of the funds   Such an approach would better reflect the reality of interconnected transit systems in the Northeastern United States and the need to protect all parts of those systems   When the threat level has been raised for New York City  for example  the state of Connecticut has had to expend significant resources without reimbursement to increase security on the many trains running between Connecticut and New York  including  among other things  placing state troopers on trains and deploying additional canine units   In an interconnected transit system  if all of the system is not protected  then none of the system is        Like its highways and transit systems  Connecticut   s ports are also of substantial regional  and in some cases national  importance   New Haven   s harbor is the home of the Regional Strategic Petroleum Reserve storage terminal  the second largest heating oil reserve in the Northeast  as well as the jet fuel pipeline that provides 2 7 million gallons of petroleum liquids per year to Westover Air Force Base in Massachusetts and Bradley Airport   New Haven is the port of entry for energy products serving business  industry and residential home heating markets throughout New England   A disruption in the flow of petroleum products through New Haven Harbor during a frigid New England winter  even for a few days  could prove disastrous to many families throughout the Northeast   Groton and New London  home to a nuclear submarine base  significant shipbuilding facilities  weapons stockpiles and the U S  Coast Guard Academy  also have significant security needs  as does the Port of Bridgeport  which is a major center for the importation of perishable goods and a terminal for passenger ferry traffic   We therefore hope the Department will also give the state   s considerable port security needs due consideration when port security grants are awarded later this year        As you know  the Department of Homeland Security recently announced that it was not renewing the Urban Area Security Initiative grant for the New Haven region   We believe that decision was erroneous and vastly undervalued the significant public and private infrastructure that exists in New Haven and Connecticut and which is of immense strategic value to the entire New England region   As has been stated in previous correspondence to you  the termination of the UASI grant  coupled with the announced reductions in Connecticut   s funding under the State Homeland Security Grant Program  will limit the State   s plans to enhance the protection provided to the citizens of Connecticut  as well as each of the surrounding states   These cuts make Connecticut   s need for funding under the Port Security Grants Program and the Transit Security Grants Program all the more urgent  inadequate funding under these programs could jeopardize the state   s security enhancements at the Port of New Haven as well as its other ports and would further threaten Connecticut   s ability to address security needs at critical transportation infrastructure facilities          The United States    security depends on a comprehensive strategic view of the nation and its system needs   In the case of Connecticut  the state   s role as a regional  commercial and cultural leader comes with significant responsibilities for security and protection   We urge your careful consideration of Connecticut   s significant responsibilities and potential vulnerabilities in providing enhanced homeland security for Connecticut   s residents and the entire Northeastern Region of the United States as the Department prepares to allocate funding to states under the Transit System Security Grant Program and to solicit applications for the Port Security Grant Program   Thank you
