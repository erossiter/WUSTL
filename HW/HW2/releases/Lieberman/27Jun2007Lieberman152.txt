Transatlantic Slave Trade       Washington  D C   The entire Connecticut delegation introduced a resolution to applaud the Freedom Schooner Amistads 14 month 2007 Atlantic Freedom Tour  which will recognize the critical role the Amistad played in ending the transatlantic slave trade  This journey will preserve the ships legacy and in doing so will help promote multi cultural dialogue  education  and cooperation  As the freedom Schooner Amistad sets sail on a 14 month journey  its voyage serves as an opportunity to remind us of our history and the struggle for freedom and the elimination of slavery  The Amistad is a strong symbol that even the darkest hours of our nations history can ultimately provide the tools for change  I hope that this anniversary voyage will begin dialogues around the country and around the globe about the struggle for liberty that continues today  said Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro  Thanks to the hard work of AMISTAD America  Inc   people across the globe will have the opportunity to learn the historical and current significance of the story of the Amistad  firsthand  The Amistads voyage will confront a dark history of slavery and human degradation  but will also promote the Amistads ongoing legacy of intercultural cooperation  human rights  and the struggle for freedom  The Amistads history lives on and its legacy has paved a path for progress towards equality in the United States and the world  said Congressman John Larson  While nothing can restore justice to the individuals whose freedom was stolen by the horrors of slavery  and nothing can duly commemorate the struggles they endured  the launch of the Amistad on its Atlantic Freedom Tour provides a meaningful gesture to remember Connecticuts role in our history and preserve the ships legacy of hope and freedom  said Senator Chris Dodd  Her journey is a powerful reminder of our past  but it also serves as a symbol of hope that nations worldwide will embrace our common humanity  The launch of the Freedom Schooner Amistad is an important tribute to the beginning of the end of the slave trade in the United States  I am proud to represent a state that so strongly valued human life and dignity at a time when external pressures steered away from those principles  I commend Amistad America for their tireless work and dedication to making this voyage a reality  said Senator Joseph Lieberman  The Freedom Schooner Amistad has made an outstanding impression on the communities the ship has visited along the Eastern seaboard  said Congressman Chris Shays  Commemorating the fight against slavery and the freedom that was won  the Freedom schooner has been an educational ambassador teaching lessons of history  cooperation  and leadership  This historic voyage will commemorate a tragic era in our history  but it is a part of our nations story that we cant forget  It is so important for the students who take part in this 14 month tour to share this unique experience when they return so that the struggle for freedom fought by those on the original Amistad is honored  said Congressman Chris Murphy  The Freedom Schooner Amistads 14 month 2007 Atlantic Freedom Tour will serve as recognition of the progress we as a nation have made in defending equality and social justice  but the voyage is also a reminder of how much farther the world must journey to value life and freedom  I honor the legacy of those who suffered through the brutal transatlantic slave trade and will continue to fight such prejudice and cruelty  said Rep  Joe Courtney  Below is the text of the resolution  Recognizing the historical and educational significance of the Freedom Schooner Amistads 14 month 2007 Atlantic Freedom Tour  and expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that preserving the legacy of the Amistad story is important in promoting multi cultural dialogue  education  and cooperation  Whereas the 1807 Act of the British Parliament was the first major initiative that abolished the slave trade and began the march to end slavery  Whereas  in 1839  53 Africans were illegally kidnapped from Sierra Leone and sold into the transatlantic slave trade  Whereas the captives were brought to Havana  Cuba aboard the Portuguese vessel Tecora  where they were fraudulently classified as native born Cuban slaves  Whereas the African captives were sold to Spaniards Jose Ruiz and Pedro Montez  who transferred them to the coastal cargo schooner  La Amistad  Whereas the African captives  while being transferred from Havana  Cuba up the coast in the Amistad  revolted after 3 days and ordered the schooner head east back to their native Africa  Whereas  on the evening of the rebellion  the Amistad was secretly directed back west and up the coast of North America  where after 2 months the Africans were seized and arrested in New London  Connecticut  Whereas  the captives were jailed and awaited trial in New Haven  Connecticut  and the case became historic when former President John Quincy Adams argued on behalf of the enslaved Africans before the United States Supreme Court and won their freedom  Whereas  in 2007  the Freedom Schooner Amistad will embark on its first transatlantic voyage to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the abolition of the transatlantic slave trade  and Whereas the Amistad case represents an opportunity to call to public attention the evils of slavery  the struggle for freedom  and the restoration of human dignity  Now  therefore  be it Resolved  That  1  the House of Representatives  A  recognizes the historical and educational significance of the Freedom Schooner Amistads Atlantic Freedom Tour  and  B  encourages the people of the United States to learn about United States history and better understand the experiences that have shaped the United States  and  2  it is the sense of the House of Representatives that preserving the legacy of the Amistad should be regarded as a means in fostering multi cultural dialogue  education  and cooperation   30
