 22nd Floor   New York  NY 10017       Dear Ms  Vance     We are writing to suggest that it may be desirable to revise or enhance the current ESRB rating system   We continue to believe that the ESRB takes seriously its responsibility with respect to the ratings and their enforcement   However  we believe that a number of issues have been raised regarding the release of Manhunt 2       As you know  in June 2007 the British Board of Film Classification  BBFC  refused to rate Rockstar s Manhunt 2 video game  effectively banning its sale in British stores  stating that  it contains  unremitting bleakness and callousness of tone    which constantly encourages visceral killing with exceptionally little alleviation or distancing    The BBFC Director concluded that any other action  would involve a range of unjustifiable harm risks  to both adults and minors    Consistent with your British counterpart  this version received an  Adults Only   AO  rating from your Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB      In October 2007 the BBFC again refused to rate a revised Manhunt 2 stating that   t he impact of the revisions on the bleakness and callousness of tone  or the essential nature of the gameplay  is clearly insufficient   There has been a reduction in the visual detail in some of the  execution kills   but in others they retain their original visceral and casually sadistic nature    Other countries agreed and have also banned the game      Unlike the British Board  the ESRB reduced the revised version s rating to  Mature   M  effectively opening the door to its widespread distribution and its licensing approval by game system manufacturers Sony and Nintendo   And  while significant progress has been made  the FTC reports that 42 percent of unaccompanied children 13 to 16 years of age can still successfully purchase M rated games meaning that the practical difference between an AO and M rating affects more than simply 17 year olds     Manhunt 2 was sanctioned by Nintendo for its Wii system   That system permits children to act out each of the many graphic torture scenes and murders in Manhunt 2 rather than simply manipulating a game pad   This led one clinical psychologist to state that the realistic motions used with the Wii mean that  you re basically teaching a child the behavioral sequencing of killing    While this was not cited as the reason for the   BBFC decision  we do believe that the ESRB should take the Wii remote controller  and future advances in game controllers  which create more realistic gaming environments  into consideration          Another disturbing aspect of this saga is that the AO version ended up being leaked on the Internet thereby circumventing the rating restrictions   News reports state that the leak came from a Sony employee  who was reportedly fired  rather than the game manufacturer   Nevertheless  the possible use of the internet to circumvent the ESRB and permit broad access to kids is another concern     There are many questions that are raised because of the above cited issues regarding the process  robustness and repeatability of the ratings provided by the ESRB system   First  there appears to be a lack of information  to the public and developers  regarding why a particular rating is given or changed   What information is provided back to developers after receiving a rating   Why is information regarding rating changes or reasons for decisions unavailable  except for content descriptors  to the public   We understand to some extent the concerns regarding the confidentiality of pre released materials however that argument is no longer compelling after the product is released   Some speculate that the ESRB could be used to provide attention to increase sales of future games   Under this scenario  a game like Manhunt 2 would first be produced to ensure receipt of an AO rating and thereafter tweaked to get the reduced M rating   A more transparent process might protect the ESRB from being used in this manner     Further  do the same reviewers view the original and the revised version of a game after an AO rating is received   How frequently do you use more than your minimum of three reviewers when evaluating a game   Are three reviewers adequate for the more violent games   How often do your reviewers disagree in their initial ratings and how frequently is the final rating a majority opinion rather than a consensus       In sum  we ask your consideration of whether it is time to review the robustness  reliability and repeatability of your ratings process  particularly for this genre of  ultra violent  video games and the advances in game controllers  We have consistently urged parents to pay attention to the ESRB rating system   We must ensure that parents can rely on the consistency and accuracy of those ratings     Thank you for your attention to this matter                                                                                     Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman  United States Senator                               Sam Brownback  United States Senator                                    Evan Bayh  United States
