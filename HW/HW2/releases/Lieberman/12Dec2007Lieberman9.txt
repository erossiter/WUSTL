security committees Wednesday urged President Bush to preserve several homeland security grant programs made permanent in the law this past August in the face of reports the Administration plans to abolish them               In a letter dated December 12  the bicameral  bipartisan group expressed dismay over an Associated Press report that the Office of Management and Budget proposed to cut homeland security funding by more than 60 percent and totally eliminate most of the grants programs permanently authorized by the President when he signed the Implementing Recommendations of the 9 11 Commission Act of 2007 on August 7  2007                    We believe that adoption of such a proposal would abandon our first responders and significantly impair our nation s ability to prevent  prepare for  and respond to potential terrorist attacks and natural disasters   the signers of the letter wrote  They were Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   House Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson  D Miss   and Ranking Member Peter T  King  R N Y                If true  the planned abolition of these programs and the proposed evisceration of overall grant funding would mark a dangerous reversal in the Administration s support for homeland security programs and our nation s first responders  and a wholly unjustified departure from a law only recently passed by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of Congress                A copy of the letter follows                                                                             December 12  2007    The President  The White House  Washington  DC 20500   Dear Mr  President                 As the lead authors of the Implementing Recommendations of the 9 11 Commission Act of 2007   9 11 Commission Recommendations Act    we are writing to express our dismay at reports that the Administration is considering eliminating most of the major homeland security grant programs established by that law   We believe that adoption of such a proposal would abandon our first responders and significantly impair our nation s ability to prevent  prepare for  and respond to potential terrorist attacks and natural disasters                 The 9 11 Commission Recommendations Act  P L  110 53   enacted on August 3  2007  provides long term or permanent authorization for many of the core homeland security grant programs that support state and local preparedness for natural and man made disasters  including the State Homeland Security Grant Program  the Urban Area Security Initiative  the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  the Emergency Management Grants Program  the Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program  public transportation security assistance  railroad security assistance  and over the road bus security assistance   In addition to authorizing funding for these programs  the law that you signed provides the first statutory guidance on permitted and prohibited uses for these grants  how the grants should be allocated  and measures to ensure that the grants are spent effectively                   Barely four months after you signed the 9 11 Commission Recommendations Act into law  it has now been reported that the Office of Management and Budget has proposed to abolish all but one of the grant programs authorized by that Act  as well as the port security grants authorized under the SAFE Port Act  Assistance to Firefighters Grants and SAFER Grants authorized by the Federal Fire Prevention and Control Act of 1974  and Buffer Zone Protection Program grants   Instead  new block grants would be created  subject to none of the provisions previously enacted by Congress  and with funding cut by more than 60  from the appropriations for homeland security grants in fiscal year 2007  which already drastically cut funding from fiscal year 2004 levels                  We believe that such a proposal is at odds with the new homeland security law that we worked so hard to craft and that you signed this summer   The grant programs that would be eliminated provide critical support for prevention  planning  and response efforts by states and localities  and help fund training  exercises  and equipment for our first responders   They help keep our transit systems and our ports secure and protect our country s critical infrastructure   They enable our first responders to communicate in an emergency and support fusion centers that allow officials to share information that can prevent terrorist attacks           If true  the planned abolition of these programs and the proposed evisceration of overall grant funding would mark a dangerous reversal in the Administration s support for homeland security programs and our nation s first responders  and a wholly unjustified departure from a law only recently passed by overwhelming majorities in both Houses of Congress   We urge you to reconsider this wrong headed strategy and continue to invest in the courageous men and women who work every day in towns and cities throughout this country to keep the rest of us safe                                                    Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman  Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs    Susan M  Collins
