Joe Lieberman  ID Conn  is asking The Government Accountability Office to verify that any decision by the Department of Homeland Security to move ahead with a planned  1 billion procurement of next generation nuclear radiation detection monitors is  based on realistic performance testing in operational environments                    The request came in a letter to GAO Comptroller General David Walker that was also signed by five other members of Congress  including the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Homeland Security Committee and the Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee                   In the DHS FY 2007 budget  Congress provided funding for DHS  Domestic Nuclear Detection Office to begin buying so called Advanced Spectroscopic Portal radiation detection sensors  However  as a result of questions GAO raised about a June 2006 Cost Benefit Analysis that DHS had submitted in support the ASP procurement  the FY 2007 Conference Report required that the Homeland Security Secretary personally certify that the new monitors will provide a  significant increase in operational effectiveness  over current radiation portal monitors that use a different technology to detect nuclear smuggling                    To be clear  the objective of this audit request is to ensure that  in the event DHS moves forward with the certification of the ASP acquisition  Congress   has the benefit of timely and authoritative GAO findings and recommendations regarding the validity of the DHS certification process and the costs and benefits associated with proceeding with full scale acquisition of ASP sensors   the letter said                     The lawmakers also asked GAO to determine the  projected costs to implement the domestic and international portions of the global nuclear detection architecture  being developed by DNDO and the extent to which the intelligence community  particularly the Directorate of National Intelligence and DNI s National Counter Proliferation Center  contributed to the design of the architecture                     Signing the letter along with Lieberman are Representatives Henry Waxman  D Calif   Bennie Thompson  D Miss   Peter King  R N Y   James Langevin  D R I   and Michael McCaull  R Tex                   Following is full text of the GAO request       May 14  2007        The Honorable David M  Walker  Comptroller General   U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G St   NW  Washington  DC 20548         Dear Comptroller Walker        The U S  government places a very high priority on detecting  interdicting and deterring nuclear smuggling because the consequences of a nuclear detonation in this country would be devastating to our lives  our economy  and our society        The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Domestic Nuclear Detection Office  DNDO  is an interagency office that includes representatives from the Departments of Defense  Energy  State  Justice and other agencies   DNDO is responsible for coordinating the federal government s efforts to devise a multi layered system of radiation detection  also known as the global nuclear detection architecture  to thwart the smuggling of nuclear materials into the United States  DNDO is specifically responsible for implementing the domestic portion of the nuclear detection architecture and for testing  evaluating  and procuring radiation detection equipment to support the efforts of DHS and other federal agencies to detect and prevent nuclear terrorist attacks        In pursuit of this mission  DNDO conducted testing and evaluation of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal  ASP  radiation monitors in 2005 at the Nevada Test Site  awarded a  1 1 billion advanced development contract to three ASP vendors in July 2006 for the production of an additional ASP prototype  and  so far in 2007 has conducted additional testing and evaluation of ASP prototypes   We understand that these tests and other efforts will be used by DNDO and DHS to comply with a requirement in the Conference Report of the DHS Appropriations Act for 2007  House Report No  109 699         The conferees are concerned preliminary testing of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal  ASP  monitors indicates the effectiveness of the new technology may fall well short of levels anticipated in DNDO s cost benefit analysis  To date  the conferees have not received validated quantitative evidence that ASP monitors perform more effectively in an operational environment compared to current generation portal monitors  Therefore  the conferees include bill language prohibiting DNDO from full scale procurement of ASP monitors until the Secretary has certified and reports to the Committees on Appropriations that a significant increase in operational effectiveness merits such a decision       Therefore  we ask that GAO address the following questions        1          To what extent does the data and analysis that DNDO will use for the secretary s certification of ASP sensors show a significant improvement over current detection capabilities  based on realistic performance testing in operational environments       2          What are the projected costs to develop  procure  deploy  operate  and maintain ASP detection sensors over a 10 year life cycle and do the improvements in detection performance capabilities or benefits identified in Question 1 justify the additional cost of the ASP systems       3          To what extent has DNDO developed a global nuclear detection architecture   Please discuss the role played by the Intelligence Community  particularly the Directorate of National Intelligence  DNI  and DNI National Counter Proliferation Center  in developing any threat scenarios that underlie DNDO s architecture   We would also like to know the degree to which DNDO used risk analyses in developing its architecture and how these analyses ultimately affected the configuration of the architecture  Finally  please assess the degree to which the United States must rely on the cooperation and assistance of foreign countries for the effective implementation of the global architecture       4          What are DNDO s projected costs to implement the domestic and international portions of the global nuclear detection architecture   Please assess the validity of DNDO s projections given what is known about the costs to procure  install  and operate radiation detection equipment                   Given the rapid changes that DHS contemplates for the domestic nuclear detection system over the next several years  we recognize that additional cost  policy or implementation questions may arise during this engagement and that GAO will need the flexibility to refine the scope of individual audits under this request and  further  that for some aspects of this audit request  time may be of the essence                   During a recent briefing for the staff of the U S  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  DNDO officials indicated that they may limit the field validation testing of ASP prototypes to two or three weeks at selected ports of entry and could initiate the certification process as early as this summer  We appreciate the department s desire to increase the tempo of DNDO testing  evaluation  and acquisition activities  but we question whether a few weeks of testing in operational settings will be sufficient to determine the readiness of the ASP systems for full deployment                     More generally  we are concerned about the management challenges that are inherent in evolutionary or spiral advanced technology development acquisitions of the type DNDO is conducting  These challenges have the potential to produce soaring cost overruns  schedule delays or performance problems  including those that result from laudable efforts by agencies to accelerate the use of advanced technologies                     To be clear  the objective of this audit request is to ensure that  in the event DHS moves forward with the certification of the ASP acquisition  Congress  and more specifically the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations  has the benefit of timely and authoritative GAO findings and recommendations regarding the validity of the DHS certification process and the costs and benefits associated with proceeding with full scale acquisition of ASP sensors                    We understand that in the recent past some GAO audit teams have reported unusual delays in gaining access to documents at DHS agencies  have experienced limitations in conducting interviews of DHS personnel  or have had to conclude audits without receiving all requested documents or information                    In this case  we would view any such limitations on GAO access as unacceptable   The gravity of the nuclear terrorism threat and the massive investment that will be needed to significantly improve our radiation detection defenses against nuclear terrorism require that Congress has the benefit of timely and authoritative GAO audit reports that are based on full and contemporaneous access to all documents  facilities  personnel or technical information that GAO deems relevant                    Therefore  we ask that GAO promptly notify our committees of any delays in gaining access to documents or conducting interviews pursuant to this request and  further  that GAO contact the committee staff at least monthly for the purpose of responding to the following questions       1          Has GAO encountered delays or difficulties in obtaining relevant documents or conducting interviews with government personnel or contractors        2          Has GAO identified any potential internal or external impairments that could delay or hinder GAO s ability to provide Congress with reports or testimony that are responsive to this request       3          Have GAO auditors or analysts identified new information or any additional audit issues that appear to have a bearing on the deliberations of the Committee on Appropriations or that may merit oversight by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee or the House Committee on Homeland Security              If you have any questions  please contact Jim McGee on Senator Lieberman s staff at 202
