                                                                                                                                              Floor Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman on Iraq Amendments to the FY06 Defense Authorization Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Mr  President  this is one of those quiet moments in the Senate with very few people in the Chamber when  in my opinion  something very important is happening  It is happening in good measure because of the two good men  my colleagues from Virginia and Michigan  who lead the Armed Services Committee  of which I am privileged to be a member  They are two gentlemen  two patriots  two people who have known each other for a long time  who work closely together  respect each other  even seem to like each other and  most important of all  trust each other        Those qualities of personal trust and personal relationship have been too absent from our nation s consideration of the ongoing war in Iraq among our political leadership  We have  I am convinced  suffered from it        It is no surprise to my colleagues that I strongly supported the war in Iraq  I was privileged to be the Democratic cosponsor  with the Senator from Virginia  of the authorizing resolution which received overwhelming bipartisan support   As I look back on it and as I follow the debates about prewar intelligence  I have no regrets about having sponsored and supported that resolution because of all the other reasons we had in our national security interest to remove Saddam Hussein from power     a brutal  murdering dictator  an aggressive invader of his neighbors  a supporter of terrorism  a hater of the United States of America  He was  for us  a ticking time bomb that  if we did not remove him  I am convinced would have blown up  metaphorically speaking  in America s face         I am grateful to the American military for the extraordinary bravery and brilliance of their campaign to remove Saddam Hussein   I know we are safer as a nation  and to say the obvious that the Iraqi people are freer as a people  and the Middle East has a chance for a new day and stability with Saddam Hussein gone         We will come to another day to debate the past of prewar intelligence  But let me say briefly the questions raised in our time are important  The international intelligence community believed Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction  Probably most significant  and I guess historically puzzling  is that Saddam Hussein acted in a way to send a message that he had a program of weapons of mass destruction  He would not  in response to one of the 17 U N  Security Council resolutions that he violated  declare he had eliminated the inventory of weapons of mass destruction that he reported to the U N  after the end of the gulf war in 1991        I do not want to go off on that issue  I want to say that the debate about the war has become much too partisan in our time  And something is happening here tonight that I believe  I hope  I pray we will look back and say was a turning point and opened the road to Republican and Democratic cooperation  White House and congressional cooperation  to complete the mission  As Senator Levin said  no matter what anyone thinks about why we got into the war and whether we should have been in there  it is hard to find anybody around the Senate     I have not heard anybody     who does not want us to successfully complete our mission there  I feel that deeply         If we withdraw prematurely from Iraq  there will be civil war  and there is a great probability that others in the neighborhood will come in  The Iranians will be tempted to come in on the side of the Shia Muslims in the south  The Turks will be tempted to come in against the Kurds in the north  The other Sunni nations  such as the Saudis and the Jordanians  will be sorely tempted  if not to come in at least to aggressively support the Sunni Muslim population  There will be instability in the Middle East  and the hope of creating a different model for a better life in the Middle East in this historic center of the Arab world  Iraq  will be gone        If we successfully complete our mission  we will have left a country that is self governing with an open economy  with an opportunity for the people of Iraq to do what they clearly want to do  which is to live a better life  to get a job  to have their kids get a decent education  to live a better life   There seems to be broad consensus on that  and yet the partisanship that characterizes our time here gets in the way of realizing those broadly expressed and shared goals           Politics must end at the water s edge     That is what Senator Arthur Vandenberg of Michigan said  articulating the important ideal that we seem to have lost too often in our time   I found a fuller statement of Senator Vandenberg   s position  the ideal  I found it to be in some ways more complicated and in other ways much more compelling  I want to read from it  Senator Vandenberg said           To me    bipartisan foreign policy    means a mutual effort  under our indispensable two party system  to unite our official voice at the water s edge so that America speaks with maximum authority against those who would divide and conquer us and the free world           That speaks to us today     the threat of Islamist terrorism  the desire they have to divide us and  in that sense  to conquer us in the free world  Senator Vandenberg continued in his definition of what he meant by bipartisanship in foreign policy           It does not involve the remotest surrender of free debate in determining our position  On the contrary  frank cooperation and free debate are indispensable to ultimate unity of which I speak           In a word  it simply seeks national security ahead of partisan advantage        I felt again in recent days and recent months how far we have strayed down the partisan path from Vandenberg s ideals  The most recent disconcerting evidence of this was the lead story from the Washington Post     it  was in papers all over the country     last Saturday  November 12  I read from that story           President Bush and leading congressional Democrats lobbed angry charges at each other Friday in an increasingly personal battle over the origins of the Iraq war  Although the two sides have long skirmished over the war  the sharp tenor Friday resembled an election year campaign more than a policy disagreement           That is from Saturday s Washington Post  Campaign rhetoric over policy debate  and what about  About how we got into the war 2 1 2 years ago  not about how we together can successfully complete our mission in Iraq        The questions raised about prewar intelligence are not irrelevant  they are not unimportant  but they are nowhere near as important and relevant as how we successfully complete our mission in Iraq and protect the 150 000 men and women in uniform who are fighting for us there        I go back to Vandenberg s phrase  the question is how Democrats and Republicans can unite our voice    at the water s edge    against those who would divide and conquer us and the free world in Iraq  I add  and beyond        The danger is that by spending so much attention on the past here  we contribute to a drop in public support among the American people for the war  and that is consequential  Terrorists know they cannot defeat us in Iraq  but they also know they can defeat us in America by breaking the will and steadfast support of the American people for this cause        There is a wonderful phrase from the Bible that I have quoted before     If the sound of the trumpet be uncertain  who will follow into battle      In our time  I am afraid that the trumpet has been replaced by public opinion polls  and if the public opinion polls are uncertain  if support for the war seems to be dropping  who will follow into battle and when will our brave and brilliant men and women in uniform in Iraq begin to wonder whether they have the support of the American people  When will that begin to affect their morale        I worry the partisanship of our time has begun to get in the way of the successful completion of our mission in Iraq  I urge my colleagues at every moment  when we do anything regarding this war that we consider the ideal and we are confident within ourselves  Not that we are stifling free debate  Free debate  as Vandenberg said  is the necessary precondition to the unity we need to maximize our authority against those who would divide and conquer us  But the point is to make sure we feel in ourselves that the aim of our actions and our words is national security  not partisan advantage        Now we come to today  After reading that paper on Saturday  I took the original draft amendment submitted by Senator Warner and Senator Frist     it actually wasn t offered  but it was around     and Senator Levin and Senator Reid  I took the amendments back to Connecticut  and last night I looked them over  Neither one expressed fully what I hoped it would  but as I stepped back  I said that these two amendments     one Republican  one Democratic  unfortunate in a way  breaking by parties     are not that far apart        I like the way in which the Warner amendment recited again the findings that led us to war against Saddam Hussein and  quite explicitly  cited the progress that has been made  I do think Senator Levin   s amendment doesn   t quite do this part enough  about the progress  particularly among the political leaders of Iraq  They have done something remarkable in a country that lived for 30 years under a dictator who suppressed all political activity  encouraged the increasing division and bitterness among the Shias  the Sunnis  and the Kurds  These people  with our help and encouragement  have begun to negotiate like real political leaders in a democracy  It is not always pretty  What we do here is not always most attractive  That is democracy  Most important of all  eight million Iraqis came out in the face of terrorist threats in January to vote on that interim legislation  Almost ten million came out to vote on a constitution  which is a pretty good document  a historically good document in the context of the Arab world        What happened when the Sunnis felt they were not getting enough of what they wanted in a referendum  They didn t go to the street  most of them  with arms to start a civil war   They registered to vote  That is a miraculous achievement and a change in attitude and action  They came out to vote in great numbers and they will come out  I predict  again in December in the elections and elect enough Sunnis to have an effect on the Constitution next year   So I wish that some of that had been stated in Senator Levin s amendment        30
