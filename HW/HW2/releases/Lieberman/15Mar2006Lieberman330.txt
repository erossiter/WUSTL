the legislation that he and Senator John Ensign  R NV  have introduced  with 22 additional bipartisan cosponsors  which would ensure the United States remains  the lead in innovation  research and development and the training of scientists and engineers  The National Innovation Act  which is based on     Innovate America      The Council on Competitiveness    National Innovation Initiative Report  focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining and improving United States    innovation in the 21st Century   research investment  increasing science and technology talent and developing an innovation infrastructure   In his appearance  Senator Lieberman stressed his hope that there would be a bipartisan effort to move this legislation in the current session of Congress        Submitted testimony is below         STATEMENT BY SENATOR LIEBERMAN ON INNOVATION AND COMPETITIVENESS      Committee on Commerce  Science  and Transportation      March 15  2006       Thank you Senator Ensign and Committee Chairman Stevens for holding this hearing to discuss building a new century of American prosperity by spurring a new wave of American innovation        From the Franklin stove to the personal computer  Americans have a strong history of innovation  But we face new challenges  We live in a global age where competition can come as easily from across an ocean as across the street        We got a wake up call earlier this year about how tough today   s challenges are when the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development  OECD  announced that China had overtaken the United States as the world   s largest exporter of high tech products     shipping  180 billion worth of high tech goods worldwide last year  versus  149 billion for the U S       If this continues  the global high tech centers could shift from America to China  and with them the high skill  high paying jobs that are key to the innovation economy will be lost as well       America must prepare itself to compete in this new world       Earlier this year  the Council on Competitiveness circulated a report in response to these challenges with detailed recommendations on how to reinvigorate our innovation economy         In December  Senator Ensign and I     along with 22 bipartisan cosponsors     introduced the National Innovation Act  which is based on the Council   s recommendations in three key areas  Developing talent  targeting investment  and creating infrastructure       Last week  Senator Ensign and I reintroduced Title I of the bill  now called the National Innovation Act     Commerce Provisions  which contains key provisions of the original bill and has been referred to this Committee       One of the key provisions of this bill is the creation of a President   s Council on Innovation whose goal will be to develop a comprehensive national innovation agenda and coordinate all federal efforts   The Secretary of Commerce will chair the Council which will have oversight over legislative proposals as well as executive branch initiatives        But new ideas need research money if they are to move from imagination to market        This bill strengthens the National Science Foundation by more than doubling its research budget from  4 8 billion in 2004 to nearly  10 billion by 2011       Our bill also creates an    Innovation Acceleration Grants    program to stimulate high risk research by urging federal research agencies to allocate at least 3 percent of their current R budget to breakthrough research     the kind of research that gave us the Internet       Now  having moved a product idea from imagination to the point where it   s ready to market  we must be able to manufacture it as well  It   s the manufacturing component of the innovation economy that creates and sustains high paying  high skilled jobs       This bill directs Commerce Department   s National Institute of Standards and Technology to hold a competition to develop three new pilot test beds where innovators could evaluate and refine new manufacturing ideas  The competition to create these test sites would be open to state and local governments and the business community       As I said  the ideas contained in this bill were pulled from our larger bill  which  among other things  would also                     Encourage students to train for technical professions by increasing federal support for graduate fellowships and trainee programs in science  math  and engineering                     Create a Professional Science Master   s degree program that couples business or legal training with a traditional science or engineering discipline to create a cadre of new professionals with broad skills in both business and science                     Direct the Defense Department to work with the private sector to identify and develop innovative manufacturing techniques and that could help create a 21st Century manufacturing base                     Make permanent the current Research and Experimentation tax credit and extend it to a greater number of enterprises     a provision that also appears in the Invest in America Act of 2005  sponsored by Senators Hatch and Baucus with 44 bipartisan cosponsors       I realize our bill is not the only one before the Senate  Several important pieces of legislation that have been introduced  including the PACE package introduced by Senators Alexander and Bingaman  of which I am also a cosponsor         All of these different bills strive toward the same end     the renewal and reinvigoration of America   s historic role as a global leader in innovation that has made our economy the envy of the world   It is my hope that the Commerce committee  the HELP committee  and other committees of jurisdiction will take action soon in this session to report legislation incorporating important ideas from all of these proposals   And it   s my hope that the bipartisan leadership will work together to advance these bills          Finally  I also want to commend the private sector  the academic sector  and the many outside organizations for their contributions to and support for this effort as was evidenced so eloquently by the testimony today       Thank you Mr  Chairman       30
