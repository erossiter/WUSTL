                                                      WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today declared his intention to vote against the nomination of Judge Samuel Alito for the U S  Supreme Court   Lieberman said he has too many doubts about Alito   s commitment to individual liberties to confirm the nominee for a lifetime appointment   The full statement is below           Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman on the Supreme Court Nomination of Judge Samuel Alito       Mr  President  I rise to discuss the nomination of Samuel Alito to be Associate Justice of the Supreme Court        This is the sixth opportunity I have had as a United States Senator to consider a President   s nominee to the High Court   It is surely one of the most awesome and important responsibilities of members of this body because of the uniquely powerful and autonomous role the Supreme Court has in our governmental system and because  once confirmed Supreme Court Justices serve for life with accountability only to the Constitution  as they read it        Like most of my colleagues I have judged the nominees based on four factors  1  their intellect and ability  2  their experience  3  their character  and  4  their judicial philosophy        On the first three factors     intellect  experience  and character  I conclude Judge Alito more than passes the test   But on the fourth factor  judicial philosophy  I am left with just too many doubts to vote to confirm this nominee for a lifetime of service on the United States Supreme Court         Let me now go over these four areas of consideration        First intellect and ability   In the meeting I had with him  in the legal quality of his opinions over 15 years as a judge  in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee  I believe Judge Alito has shown that he is a person of considerable intellect and ability        Second  experience  Judge Alito   s curriculum vitae itself depicts his excellent and relevant experience as a law clerk  federal government attorney U S  Attorney  and Appellate Judge on the Third Circuit        Third  character   Judge Alito was questioned aggressively at the Judiciary Committee   s confirmation hearings and elsewhere with regard to his character   But I thought he emerged with his integrity and honor intact   The ABA Standing Committee confirmed that judgment when it concluded that he    is an individual of excellent integrity    and that was based on more than 300 interviews with professional colleagues        Fourth  judicial philosophy  Here is where  for me  the problems with this nomination begin and  in some senses  end  Judge Alito brings to this nomination process a more lengthy record of judicial opinions than any of the previous five nominees to the United States Supreme Court that I have had the privilege to consider   In his fifteen years on the Third Circuit Court  Judge Alito has written more than 350 opinions   Together  these opinions leave me with profound doubts about whether Judge Alito would protect and advance the special role the Constitution gives the Supreme Court    as the single institution in our government that our Founders freed forever from popular political passions so that it could protect the rights our founding documents give to every American   Personal freedom and equal opportunity are America   s core ideals  and our Courts have been and must be the great advancers and protectors of those ideals          To me  that work defines the vital mainstream of American jurisprudence   Based on his personal statements during the 1980s when he was a government attorney  and particularly on his 15 years of judicial opinions  I am left with profound concerns that Judge Alito would diminish the Supreme Court   s role as the ultimate guarantor of individual liberty in our country   This is not about a single issue but about an accumulation of his opinions that leads me to a preponderance of doubts        For example  in civil rights cases  Judge Alito has repeatedly established a very high bar  an unusually high bar  for entrance to our Courts for people who believed they   ve been denied equal opportunity and fair treatment based on race or gender        In one case  Bray vs  Marriott Hotels  the majority of his colleagues on the court said     Title VII  of the Civil Rights Act  would be eviscerated if our analysis were to halt where the dissent  of Judge Alito  suggests           Judge Alito   s narrow reading of the Commerce Clause as exemplified by his dissent in the case of U S  vs  Rybar  casts a shadow on federal legislation passed to protect the rights of individual Americans which has been  and will be  based on the Commerce Clause        When asked at his confirmation hearings about the question of personal privacy  Judge Alito accepted the 1965 decision of Griswold v  Connecticut as settled law but  when asked over and over again  refused to say the same of the 1973 decision in Roe v  Wade   On that most difficult and divisive question of abortion  I personally believe that Roe achieved a just balance of rights and reflected a societal consensus that has continued and deepened in our country for more than three decades   I was left with serious concerns that Judge Alito would not uphold the basic tenets of Roe and that is a very troubling conclusion        Every time I have voted to confirm a nominee to the United States Supreme Court as I have with Justices Souter  Breyer  Ginsberg  and Roberts     two appointed by Republican presidents  two appointed by a Democratic president     I did so knowing as we all do that I was taking a risk because I could never know exactly how the particular Justice would rule on the many cases that would come before him or her in a lifetime on the bench   But I ultimately concluded based on their records and their testimony that those four Justices would more likely than not uphold the unique responsibility the Supreme Court has as the most important guardian of the freedom  opportunity  and privacy for every single American   Unfortunately  I have not been able to reach the same conclusion about Judge Alito  and so I will respectfully vote no on his nomination        30
