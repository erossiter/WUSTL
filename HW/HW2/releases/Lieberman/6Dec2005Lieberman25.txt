friend for your generous introduction and for your continuing public service and let me join you in thanking Dr  Andy Krepanevich and the Center for all that he and it has contributed to American thinking and policy on defense  and in this case particularly on the war in Iraq   I am honored to join both of you in this discussion this morning   Before Andy offers his latest insights on Iraq  which I look forward to  I in some sense want to set the context   I want to say a few things about what I believe is on the line there in Iraq  about how we are conducting ourselves here in Washington  and how what happens here affects what will happen there        The title of this program is    How to Win in Iraq      That was the title of Andy   s seminal article in the journal Foreign Affairs earlier this fall  and it seems to me that is ought to be the focus of Congressional discussions about the war from now until its conclusion   The most important debate going on currently here about the war in Iraq is between some people who are focused on withdrawal of our forces regardless of conditions on the ground and the rest of us who believe that our goal in Iraq is not to withdraw but to win  so we can leave with the mission accomplished        This is a serious and significant debate and in the vitality and health of our democracy will continue to go on  I hope it goes on with a recognition that there are Republicans and Democrats on both sides and that it should be conducted in a spirit of mutual respect and national interest        For my part  I agree with Dr  Krepinevich s observation that     The war  in Iraq   which arguably began as a    war of choice    has become a    war of necessity    we cannot afford to lose   The costs of victory in Iraq will be large for the U S   But the costs of defeat would be disastrous for the U S   Iraq  the Middle East  and most of the world        The costs of victory will be high in American lives lost and American money spent   But the costs of defeat would be disastrous     they include the collapse of the new Iraqi regime  civil war  regional war  a victory for Zarqawi and Al Qaeda  which will embolden them to attack both other Arab countries and our American homeland  the rollback of democracy in the region  and the painful realization that the lives of American soldiers who have died in Iraq were given in vain          Defeat in Iraq would also carry a heavy cost of lost opportunities   We are there not just to defeat the terrorists     not even mostly to defeat the terrorists     we are there to provide the security for a self government by the Iraqis where the creation of a modern  open  thriving state in this historic center of the Arab and Islamic worlds   If we accept defeat in Iraq we will have lost the opportunity to create within this great nation a larger victory in the so called war    for the hearts and minds    of people in the Islamic world and that lost opportunity would be a large cost and a disaster           It is probably these enormous costs of failure in Iraq that explain why so few in Congress have joined the calls for a preset  timed withdrawal   Last Wednesday  the President laid out his strategy for victory in Iraq in a speech at the Naval Academy and accompanying 35 page white paper   It described a plan that has developed over the last two and half years since Saddam Hussein was overthrown   It is a plan that has resulted from trial and yes  many errors   It describes the strategy  the tactics  that I saw in Iraq two weeks ago and that I believe are creating progress there         The response of leading Democrats to the president s proposal last week I thought was important and instructive   Most leading Democrats     and I include here the statements made by my colleagues Senators John Kerry and Jack Reed     did not call for an arbitrary time to withdrawal  but instead questioned some of the Administration s tactics and asked the Administration to go to the next level of detail on its proposals and plans         The President   s description of our    clear  hold  and build    strategy for victory in Iraq and the tactical response of most Democrats suggests that there may be more agreement here than meets the eye and ear in the dueling partisan press conferences that characterize public discourse in Washington today   What I am suggesting here  as I listen and read the statements made  is that there is broad bipartisan agreement on the goals  on the strategic interest we have in the successful completion of our mission in Iraq  there are disagreements about tactics   Accepting this reality and the urgency of the moment in Iraq calls us  I believe  to remember the famous counsel of Senator Arthur Vandenberg  Republican of Michigan that    Politics must stop at the water   s edge           Vandenburg of course  played an instrument role in the post WWII period in building bipartisan support for Presidents Truman   s post WWII  early Cold War foreign policy   The full  actual statement of the imperative that Vandenburg stated  that politics must stop at the water   s edge  is altogether relevant to our current circumstances           To me  bipartisan foreign policy means a mutual effort under our indispensable two party system  to unite our official voice at the water   s edge so that America speaks with maximum authority against those who would divide and conquer us and the free world           Those last words of Vandenberg   s exactly describe the goals and methods of the Islamist terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 01 and fight us in Iraq today   They aim to    divide and conquer us and the free world      Vandenburg   s preceding words defining a bipartisan foreign policy should remind us of how much stronger we would be in this critical fight if we    seek national security ahead of partisan advantage           That is why I feel so strongly that it is time for us to set aside for now the arguments about why we got into Iraq so that we can work together on how we can get out best in victory and honor with the job done        With the consequences of victory or defeat in Iraq so large for our future safety  and liberty  and with the lives of 160 000 Americans in uniform on the line there everyday  it is urgent that all of us who want to complete our mission successfully and do not favor an arbitrary timetable for withdrawal put the national goals we hold in common ahead of the party labels that too often divide us        I recall here the wisdom of Secretary of War  Henry L  Stimson  who served our country during World War II and the beginning of the Cold War   Stimson said that sometimes the best way to make a person trustworthy is to trust him   There is wisdom there   It is time that America   s leaders  in the White House and Congress  Republicans and Democrats  who agree on our goals in Iraq but disagree on tactics to start trusting each other again so that we can work together again  The distrust is deep and I know it will be difficult to overcome  but history will judge us harshly if we do not stretch across the divide of distrust and join together to complete our mission successfully in Iraq        It is time for Democrats who distrust President Bush to acknowledge that he will be Commander in Chief for three more critical years  and that in matters of war we undermine Presidential credibility at our nation   s peril          It is time for Republicans in the White House and Congress who distrust Democrats to acknowledge that greater Democratic involvement and support in the war in Iraq is critical to rebuilding the support of the American people that is essential to our success in that war        It is time for Americans and we their leaders to start working together again on the war on terrorism   To encourage that new American partnership  I propose that the President and the leadership of Congress establish a bipartisan Victory in Iraq Working Group  composed of members of both parties in Congress and high ranking national security officials of the Bush Administration   This group would meet regularly  I would hope at least weekly  to discuss conditions and progress on the ground in Iraq and ways to alter or improve our strategy for victory   It would carry forward the cooperative spirit of the Warner Levin amendment which recently passed the Senate   In our form of government  it would be one of the closet structures we could create to replicate a unity government or a war cabinet that exists in other democratic systems        I know that some will say that proposing a forum for bipartisan cooperation on the war is  in the current intensely partisan environment in Washington  na  ve and impractical   Perhaps they are right   But what is not na  ve or impractical is my conclusion that the return of such bipartisanship in the conduct of this war would raise popular support at home  encourage our brave troops in the field  discourage our vicious enemies  and strengthen the resolve of the Iraqi people and the hundreds of millions of others in the Islamic world who want a better way forward than the hatred and death Al Qaeda offers        In 1941  Winston Churchill came to Rochester  New York and said           When great causes are on the move in the world    we learn that we are spirits  not animals  and that something is going on in space and time which  whether we like it or not  spells duty           My friends  great causes are clearly on the move in the world today    We were attacked by Islamist terrorists     attacked here at home   The centers of American power  our great cities  were attacked  The main battleground in this war is now Iraq  So I would say  in Churchill   s phrase  that duty calls us now to take ourselves above the ordinary partisan debates of this capital city  to unite for victory  to walk the course together until our mission is completed  our security is protected  and the forces of freedom have once more emerged triumphant from the battlefields of power and of principle       Letters regarding Iraq
