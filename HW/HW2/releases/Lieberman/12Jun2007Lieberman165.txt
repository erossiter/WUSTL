to the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation Annual Dinner  where he presented the Truman Reagan Medal of Freedom in honor of the late Senator Henry Scoop Jackson  Anna Marie Laurence accepted the award on behalf of her father  Below is the full text of the speech  as prepared for delivery  Randal   thank you for that kind introduction  I am privileged to be in the presence of so many friends who have made a difference for freedom  I would be remiss in doing my job as a Senator representing Connecticut if I did not specifically recognize one of my state s genuine treasures   Bill Buckley  Bill and his late  blessed wife Pat made freedom s cause their own  For decades  Bill has stood athwart history yelling stop to the enemies of liberty  He is truly deserving of the honor that he will receive on this wonderful and important night  Some people suggest that there are abstract  inexorable forces that determine history  They claim that events are in the saddle  I disagree  I believe that leadership matters  I believe that great leaders can change the course of history  History is made not by abstract  inexorable forces  but by individuals  Courageous and determined leadership can fortify a people to fight in the face of extraordinary odds  Lincoln saved the Union and ended the scourge of slavery  Churchill and FDR were the essential leaders in prevailing over fascism  Truman stood tall to halt the forward march of communism  Sakharov  whose brave wife is with us tonight  spoke truth to power and helped topple an empire  These leaders provided the strength  the courage and the inspiration for free people to defeat the enemies of liberty  Last week  I had the privilege to address an extraordinary conference of dissidents from throughout the world who assembled in Prague  The conference was organized by three great leaders  Natan Sharansky  Vaclav Havel and Jose Maria Aznar  and was a testament to the transformative power of democratic ideals and to the power of brave people of principle to change history  That conference in Prague would not have been possible without the efforts of one of the men who we honor tonight  Senator Henry Jackson helped change history  He was a hero of the long twilight struggle that is known as the Cold War  To this day  even many who never personally knew him view him as an inspiration for all those who cherish freedom  I know that because I count myself as a follower  That s why we call ourselves Scoop Jackson Democrats  Scoop Jackson Republicans  and in my case a Scoop Jackson Independent  Scoop represented that proud American political tradition which understands that to be a true progressive you must advance liberal ideas internationally as well as at home  and that the cause of democracy and justice does not end at the waters edge  I must admit that these days I wish I had Scoop Jackson at my side on the Senate floor  He rightly believed that petty partisanship should have no place when it came to the defense of liberty  He was the embodiment of a strong  non partisan foreign and defense policy  As Scoop once wisely observed  in matters of national security  the best politics is no politics  Why are we inspired by Senator Jackson s life and legacy  We are inspired because he was not afraid to challenge conventional wisdom and take on the enemies of freedom  In the seventies  when the prevailing sentiment was to accommodate Soviet imperialism and tyranny  Scoop opposed the policy of dtente  When others refused to make human rights the center our strategy to communist totalitarianism  Scoop took up the cause of the dissidents  including oppressed Soviet Jewry  Those brave heroes who were jailed in the Gulag were heartened by the efforts of two great American leaders   President Ronald Reagan and Senator Henry M  Jackson   on their behalf  Although they were silenced by their jailers  the dissidents knew that Reagan and Jackson would give voice to their cause  They knew that they and their allies would be undaunted in confronting totalitarian evil  Listen to what Natan Sharansky has written  For me  and for many other dissidents  the two men leading the forces of confrontation in America were Senator Henry Jackson and President Ronald Reagan  One a Democrat  the other a Republican  their shared conviction that the individual s desire for freedom was an unstoppable force convinced them of the possibility of a democratic transformation inside the Soviet Union  Crucially  they also believed that the free world had a critical role to play in accelerating this transformation  Their efforts to press for democratic reform did not stem solely from humanitarian considerations  Like Sakharov  these men understood that the spread of human rights and democracy among their enemies was essential to their own nation s security   Unlike his ally Ronald Reagan  however  Scoop Jackson did not live to see that great day when the Wall fell  But  he surely played a pivotal role in tearing down Soviet communism  As we today pay tribute to the victims of communist terror  we salute a hero who helped ensure the end of that terror  Today  once again we are engaged in a struggle against an evil totalitarian enemy  Islamist extremists fight and kill for a world in which the progressive values of personal liberty  tolerance  and justice are all extinguished  At this critical moment  we must draw from Scoop Jackson s example that we must be bold and undaunted in promoting our values against evil forces who would deny the primacy of individual freedom  Scoop is not with us  but his spirit is  We are inspired and strengthened by his legacy and that is why we honor him tonight  Two men embodied the leadership that helped win the Cold War   one a Democrat and one a Republican  Harry Truman stood strong at the beginning of the long twilight struggle against Communism  He understood that our liberal values and security interests were one in the battle against a totalitarian foe  Ronald Reagan led us to the final triumph over this evil  One might even call President Reagan a Harry Truman Republican  Indeed  the battle against totalitarianism then and today is not a partisan cause  but rather it is freedom s cause  It is quite appropriate that we honor these two heroes of that struggle with the Truman Reagan Medal of Freedom  Anna  your father was one of the great statesmen in the history of the United States Senate  and I am privileged to present you with the Truman Reagan Medal in his honor    30
