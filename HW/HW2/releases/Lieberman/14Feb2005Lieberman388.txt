                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Monday delivered the following prepared statement on the Senate floor in favor of Michael Chertoff   s nomination to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security       Mr  President  I rise today to express my support for the nomination of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security         Judge Chertoff has an impressive record and has served his country well as a prosecutor  an Assistant Attorney General  and a federal judge   He comes with a reputation as a strong  intellectually demanding leader   characteristics that will serve him well if he is confirmed  as I believe he should be  for the job to which he is nominated    Judge Chertoff   s dedication to public service is demonstrated by his willingness to give up a lifetime appointment to the Federal bench and take on this challenge   I respect him for that and appreciate his dedication to our country  and to the security of the American people        Homeland Security Secretary is clearly one of the most difficult jobs in Washington today  not only for the awesome responsibility it carries to safeguard the American people from terrorist attack  or natural catastrophe    but also because of the serious work that still needs to be done to make the Department the success it must be        Since it was created two years ago  the Department has become the leader among government agencies protecting Americans here at home  Secretary Ridge launched this process and admirably led the Department through the initial pain of merging 22 separate agencies and programs with different cultures  structures  and priorities     the largest government reorganization in half a century  We knew this transformation would be a monumental task and that it would take time for the Department to emerge as a well run  coordinated bureaucracy   even more so after it became clear that the Administration was not providing the resources and attention that were needed        Understandably  the Department and its 180 000 employees still faces significant challenges in everything from its strategic vision to its day to day operations       The lack of a focused  long term homeland security strategy is one of the greatest disappointments to me   No organization     especially one as large and complicated as this one     can succeed without one   Given the importance of the Department   s mission  the new Secretary will immediately need to develop an updated strategy that clarifies not only the Department   s priorities  roles  and responsibilities  but those of other key partners  as well   Consultation will have to occur with others in the Administration   at Defense  Health and Human Services  and Justice     to ensure an integrated and overarching vision of how the government will tackle its role of defending the homeland       One of the changes recommended by experts is the creation of an Under Secretary for Policy and Planning to perform the kind of long range thinking within DHS that has been in short supply   I am pleased this development is underway  and it should ease the new Secretary   s burden considerably        If confirmed  Judge Chertoff and his key deputies will need some very basic tools that are now lacking     for example  professional staff   The Secretary and the Deputy Secretary of the Department must have sufficient numbers of assistants to manage 180 000 employees   We heard testimony before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee that the Deputy Secretary   s office currently has five staff members  Senator Warner  a member of the Committee and a former Deputy Secretary of the Navy  recalled that he had a well over 100 staff members  DHS employees must also be adequately trained to perform new and more complex tasks than they performed before the Department was created         Looking beyond these internal problems  the Department must also step up its efforts to eliminate persistent vulnerabilities in a variety of sectors     both public and private   The security of our borders and ports  within our rail and transit systems  and at the nation   s core energy  telecommunications  water  transportation  and financial networks is not what it should be three years after the most horrific attack on American life and property in our nation   s history       The Coast Guard is in dire need of a modern fleet   At the current rate of funding  it will take 20 years to complete the necessary upgrades   The Administration absolutely must do more to prepare the nation for a possible bioterror attack  which could put millions of citizens at risk   And we must do a better job of enlisting the private sector as a necessary partner in our shared security since the private sector controls 85 percent of our critical infrastructure        We know  for example  that an attack on a chemical facility could put the lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens at risk  on a scale even larger than September 11   We know that al Qaeda has examined information about U S  chemical facilities   Yet  according to Richard Falkenrath  who served as deputy homeland security adviser to the President  we have done essentially nothing to reduce the inherent insecurity of our chemical facilities       Mr  President  we have the most advanced and powerful and effective military in the history of the world   One of the reasons is because we have invested trillions of dollars over the years  So we must also invest in our homeland security if it  too  is to be the best in the world   Last year  regrettably  the Administration proposed unconscionable cuts   government wide   for first responders   They have further reduced first responder funding for Fiscal Year 2006  and that is absolutely the wrong direction to be going in       We are all aware of the funding realities and we know it is impossible to protect every potential terrorist target   But our first responders in particular   who risk their lives so the rest of us may be safe     deserve the training and equipment they need to do their jobs   And they must have the basic capability to talk to one another  To do that  they need interoperable communications equipment to coordinate within and between jurisdictions in the event of a large or widespread catastrophe  or even to respond effectively to day to day emergencies         This is a daunting list  but somehow we must regain the sense of anger and urgency that propelled us forward in the aftermath of the September 11 attacks so that we can check each item off as having been improved    I am confident that Judge Chertoff too feels that sense of urgency        That was the impression I got when he appeared before the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last week to answer a battery of questions from Committee members    including several on his role in the administration   s prosecution of the war on terror and the advice he provided on anti torture laws when he was head of the Justice Department   s Criminal Division       Judge Chertoff assured us that he was mindful of the historic tension between two values  two attributes that define us as a nation     life and liberty     and the need to protect ourselves against those who would deny us those freedoms  His exact words were  and I quote     I believe that we cannot live in liberty without security  but we would not want to live in security without liberty          Striking the right balance will be an ongoing challenge   I am pleased that those who know him best say Judge Chertoff is more than up to the task        His background in the law prepares him to balance security and liberty  When our colleague and friend Senator Corzine introduced his friend before our Committee when we held the nomination hearing  he referred to Judge Chertoff   s work with the New Jersey state Senate investigating and legislating against racial profiling         Senator Corzine described that experience as  and here I   m quoting     a test of balancing protecting the American public or protecting the Jersey public and our civil liberties      No one  he said  could have balanced those competing interests    more intelligently    than Judge Chertoff had        I also welcomed Judge Chertoff   s expression of his belief that the Office of Legal Counsel   s definition of torture     as described in an August 2002 memo written by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee     was too narrow       I am  however  troubled by how the Justice Department handled the detention of hundreds of Muslim men rounded up in the aftermath of September 11   It has been extensively documented that many of the detainees were held under quite flimsy pretexts  were incarcerated far too long without having their cases investigated  and were often denied access to lawyers and family members   Many were even physically abused by guards       Judge Chertoff has acknowledged that mistakes were made in the detention and treatment of those detainees   I wish the Department of Justice had acknowledged the same failures when the Department of Justice Inspector General released its report in 2003  and I hope and have confidence that the Department of Justice has learned a lesson  Failing to do so would be a lost opportunity to show the world that the principles of our democracy are continually being renewed       But there are also lessons I know others  including Judge Chertoff can take  as well   In his previous position at the Department of Justice  Judge Chertoff was responsible for running a criminal division   As Secretary of DHS  he will be running a Department with many different agencies  with many different missions   Included within the Department are the agencies that deal with our nation   s immigrant community  and that relationship must not be based primarily on a law enforcement mentality   DHS must strive to forge a strong relationship with the nation   s immigrants  one based on respect       So  Mr  President  I am voting for Judge Chertoff because I believe he is the right man for this job   But I do not want my comments about him and my vote for him to obscure the fact that I share some of the objections Senator Levin talked about regarding the Justice Department   s and the FBI   s unwillingness to share with us an uncensored version of the document Senator Levin referred to earlier   I have long had a concern about this Administration   s reluctance to share information with Congress   It   s a problem we   ve encountered on our Committee since this Administration took office   Whether conducting oversight or considering nominations  Senators have a right to see the material they believe necessary to discharge their Constitutional functions  barring a Presidential invocation of executive privilege or some other clear statutory prohibition        In this case  the President has not claimed privilege and the statute the Justice Department cites     the Privacy Act     simply doesn   t apply   Indeed  as Senator Levin has pointed out  to accept the Justice Department   s position that the Privacy Act requires the Administration to withhold the name of a high level government official from a document simply mentioning that official   s attending of a official meeting would be to allow for a stunning expansion of the Privacy Act that could thwart even the most basic of Congressional oversight activities  I hope every Senator will pay attention to what Senator Levin has said because it does undercut Congress        Now  having said that  why do I nonetheless go ahead and strongly support Judge Chertoff  Because I believe that Judge Chertoff  in his testimony before the Committee  responded to concerns that something in that redacted document might disqualify him for this position   First  he was not at the meeting  Second  he specifically said under oath he was never informed while head of the Criminal Division of the Justice Department that there was any mistreatment of detainees at Guantanamo   I accept that statement  given by a federal judge under oath       These are not ordinary times and they demand extraordinary commitment from those who have chosen public service   Judge Chertoff has an admirable record of serving the American public  and I believe he is a very strong choice to lead the Department of Homeland Security   s continuing transformation into a strong  cohesive  well operating force in securing the safety of the American people   I urge my colleagues to support his nomination  Thank you  Mr  President       30
