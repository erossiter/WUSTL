Consideration of Immigration Reform Legislation                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON     On Tuesday  April 4  2006 Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  made the following remarks on the Senate floor regarding the immigration reform legislation pending in the U S  Senate        Remarks of Senator Joe Lieberman      April 4  2006       Mr  President  I rise to support the Judiciary Committee s superb product  this immigration reform bill   I also want to speak  before I go to the bill overall  on an amendment that Senator Brownback  the Senator from Kansas  and I intend to introduce  I gather we re not introducing it now but this is an opportunity to speak to this amendment  This would address America   s treatment of people who come here seeking asylum         I m very pleased to be working on this with Senator Brownback  Over the years my colleague from Kansas has done so much good work to protect the rights of refugees overseas and those who seek asylum on our shores for the host of reasons that they might  to escape persecution  for reasons of faith or politics  So Senator Brownback is a partner that I   m truly proud to be working with on this matter         Mr  President  this amendment rises out of a report that was issued in February of last year by the U S  Commission on International Religious Freedom  It is a commission established by law  by an act of Congress  One of its duties is to issue at least annual and often more frequent reports  This report last February raised very serious concerns about insufficient protections for asylum seekers arriving in this country         The Commission reported an unacceptable risk that genuine asylum seekers were being turned away because their fears and the real dangers of being returned to their home countries were not fully considered         The Commission also found that while asylum seekers are having their applications considered  they are often detained for months in maximum security prisons without ever having had a chance to request release on bond before an immigration judge  The Commission described conditions of detention that are completely unacceptable for a just nation to impose on people who are trying to escape war  oppression  religious persecution  even torture         My amendment  the one that I   m honored to be introducing with Senator Brownback  will implement the Commission   s recommendations  It calls for sensible reforms that will safeguard the nation s security  improve the efficiency of our immigration detention system and ensure that people fleeing persecution are treated in accordance with this nation s most basic values         Remember our purpose was stated in the original American document  the Declaration of Independence  that said the government was being formed to secure rights  liberty and the pursuit of happiness  which were the endowment of our Creator  not just to every American but to every child of God   And this nation has been  over the decades  a land of refuge for people seeking freedom and sanctuary from the deprivations that they endured in the countries they were in  And it is our attempt in this amendment to revitalize and make more credible and honest and true the asylum processes that our country has to implement those ideals         The amendment that Senator Brownback and I are introducing would implement quality assurance procedures to ensure that government employees carefully and accurately record the statements of people who say they have a fear of returning to their countries          Aliens not subject to mandatory detention would be entitled to a hearing  basic American due process  to determine whether or not they could be released  Providing bond hearings for low risk aliens will also free up space for the cases that really ought to be incarcerated  The amendment also promotes secure alternatives to detention of the type that the Department of Homeland Security  I   m pleased to say  has already begun to implement         These new programs and procedures would also make our use of detention space more effective and efficient   At an average cost of  90 per person per day  but of course that s the average  often it s much higher  detention beds have always been scarce  Provisions in the legislation before us  the Judiciary Committee proposal  would vastly increase the number of aliens being held in detention  The underlying bill  which I strongly support  is a tough bill and it is so tough that it will inevitably increase the number of people who are not in legal status who will be held in detention  Our immigration system will need to prioritize available space because it s limited         For aliens who pose a risk of flight  a threat to public safety  or otherwise are subject by law to mandatory detention  for those who must remain detained  we are obliged as a just society to provide appropriate conditions at immigration facilities and jails used by the Department of Homeland Security  The amendment that Senator Brownback and I are introducing includes modest requirements to ensure decent conditions consistent with our best American values  especially for asylum seekers  families with children  and other vulnerable populations  It requires improvements in key areas such as access to medical care and limitations on the use of solitary confinement  And it creates a more effective system within the Department of Homeland Security for overseeing and inspecting these facilities         Mr  President  the United States has been  is  and hopefully always will be a land of refuge for those seeking liberty  Many of our nation s founders of course fled here themselves to escape persecution for their political opinions  their religious beliefs or even their ethnicity  Since that time the United States has honored its history and its founding values by standing against persecution around the world  offering refuge to those who flee from oppression and welcoming them as contributors to American society         That brings me now briefly to the larger immigration debate before us this week  Mr  President  I want to start with a bit of history  It was in March of 1790 that the first Congress of the United States began debating an Immigration and Naturalization Act that would spell out how new arrivals could become citizens of our new nation         The main requirement of the law finally approved was that an immigrant needed to live here in the United States for two years  and in the state in which he settled for one year to obtain legal status         The senator from Pennsylvania at the time  Senator William Maclay  thought immigration would be such a benefit to the new nation that he wanted those residency requirements removed  Senator Oliver Ellsworth of Connecticut  who I believe occupied the chair  the seat in the Senate that I   m honored to occupy now in the succession   wanted the residency requirement kept in         Senator Maclay of Pennsylvania lost the debate and  frustrated  wrote in his diary afterward     We Pennsylvanians act as if we believe that God made of one blood all families of the earth  But the Eastern people     parenthetically I say he must have been referring to us Nutmeggers from Connecticut     the Eastern people seemed to think he made none but New England folks   I   m sure that Senator Ellsworth would have objected to that diary entry on behalf of himself and those from the East         Today this Senator from Connecticut is proud to stand with one of the two Senators from Pennsylvania  the chairman of the Judiciary Committee     Senator Specter     and my fellow New Englander  ranking member of the Judiciary Committee     Senator Leahy     in supporting the balanced  strong  practical  progressive immigration reforms that they have reported out of the Judiciary Committee  I thank them  I congratulate them on this balanced and bipartisan bill         I also want to give special tribute to Senators Kennedy and McCain for all that they did in introducing their initial legislation  which I was proud to be an original cosponsor of  much of which has been embraced in the Judiciary Committee bill         The proposed legislation before us     the underlying bill     would enhance our national security  promote our economic well being and create a fair and just path to citizenship for those who come here to work hard  pay their taxes  respect the law  and learn the English language         We all agree that we ve got to do more to secure our borders and control illegal immigration  This has to be about fixing that problem  That means it will never fix our broken borders  in my opinion  without fixing our broken immigration system  People talk about this as a choice between border security     better border security     and immigration reform  That   s a false choice  Not only do we need both  unless we have both  we will not achieve either better border security or the practical immigration reform that we need         The bill reported out of the Judiciary Committee contains all of the essential security and enforcement provisions as the bill introduced by the Senate Majority Leader  Both bills substantially increase border patrol  detention beds  border fences and resources for border security systems and technologies  Both bills create new criminal penalties or make existing penalties more severe  Both bills establish new mandates and authorities for detaining and deporting aliens         However  the Judiciary Committee bill omits a couple of parts of the Leader s bill which ought to be omitted  Those that criminalize the so called Good Samaritan behavior toward undocumented immigrants and those that would criminalize the 11 million undocumented immigrants we have  To me  that is just foolish  It won t work  In fact  it will push the undocumented immigrants further into the shadows  because their undocumented status would not only be a violation of immigration law  but would be a crime  It would subject them to much greater exploitation by employers in this country and in that sense actually constitute increasingly difficult competition for Americans who want to work         But overall  this bill contains all the provisions except those two in the Senate Majority Leader s proposal to toughen border security  I think history should have told us something  that as important as tough border security measures are  they re not going to solve the problem of illegal immigration because people want so desperately to come here  I ve said before and I   ll say it again  with very  very  very few exceptions  the apparently 11 million undocumented immigrants that we have in the country today came to America for the same reasons that my grandparents did  But my grandparents just had to arrive at Ellis Island and they were let in         And why did they come  Why did the undocumented come today  For freedom  for opportunity  for a better life  for their children  to be Americans  Think about it   That s what we re about  freedom  opportunity and a better life for our children  Those are American values and the American dream         And I think what history has shown is that border security ought to be toughened  but it s not going to stop this flow  Let me just cite this statistic for you to prove it in recent times  From 1993 to 2004  the number of border patrol agents was tripled because of concern about illegal immigration  Spending on border enforcement quadrupled  We have 10 835 border patrol agents and almost  4 billion a year spent     quadrupled     on border enforcement         What s happened to the number of undocumented immigrants in that time  It s doubled from 4 5 million to 9 3 million  And the reason  obviously  is that as long as we fail to provide legal channels for these people who desperately want to come to this country  they re going to find some way to come here illegally and they re going to come here to work         You ve all seen the Pew Trust studies which show almost 95  of the working age men who are undocumented have full time jobs  In fact they make up 5  of the American work force overall  The reforms that this bill adopts create a path to earned citizenship   Not only is it the right thing to do for our economy  but it is consistent with our values  It is also the most practical thing to do to deal with the problem of illegal immigration and border security and as others have said would free up resources at the border to stop the few who come over for bad reasons  particularly  of course  to focus on potential terrorists and those who want to deal in controlled substances     drugs     here in this country         Mr  President  I want to wrap up now because I see my friend and colleague and fellow supporter of this legislation  the Senator from Colorado  on the floor         I support it strongly  I think we have an extraordinary opportunity this week in the Senate to do something right and to do something practical  to fix the immigration crisis in our country  The immigration system is not working now  and this bill gives us an opportunity to make it work         I know there s been discussion of possible compromises  I think the Judiciary Committee bill itself is a compromise and a good one  a strong one  But  though the particular compromises that have been floated in the last 24 hours I don t accept  I   m encouraged by them because they speak to momentum in favor of a coming together across party lines  regional lines  every line you could imagine as Americans  to do what s right and to do what s practical and to assist our security and our economy         I close with a wonderful quote we found from Thomas Jefferson  going back to the initial days of immigration when he said     Born in other countries  yet believing you could be happy in this  Our laws acknowledge  as they should  your right to join us in society            It s that spirit     that Jeffersonian beginning of the American experience     that I think both challenges us and informs and elevates the proposal before us  I think we have a real opportunity to act on that ideal this week  I can t help but go back to what the senator from Pennsylvania once said that God in fact did make all the families of earth one blood         I yield the floor and thank the chair        30
