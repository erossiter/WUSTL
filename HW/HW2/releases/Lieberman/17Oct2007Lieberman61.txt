Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Wednesday raised questions about the Department of Homeland Security s overreliance on the use of contractors to support inherently governmental work     A new report by the Government Accountability Office   requested by the Committee and released at a hearing on the subject   examined documents for 117 contracts and examined nine contracts in detail  GAO found that DHS has not revisited its original justification for relying on contractors   the need to stand up the Department quickly   and has not conducted a comprehensive assessment of the appropriate mix of federal employees and contractors   GAO also found that a majority of the contract officials and program managers interviewed were unaware that federal procurement policy requires heightened oversight when contractors perform professional and managerial services  Furthermore  none of the oversight plans reviewed by GAO contained specific measures for assessing contractor performance               The report found  for example        The Coast Guard hired a contractor to help manage its competitive sourcing program which means that it hired a contractor to help determine whether existing DHS jobs should be contracted out        One  42 4 million contract to support DHS s Information Analysis and Infrastructure Protection Directorate was so broad that it covered 58 different and distinct tasks  ranging from acquisition support  intelligence analysis  budget formulation  and information technology planning   There was only one DHS employee assigned to help the contracting officer provide technical oversight of this enormous job        The contractor supporting TSA s employee relations office provided advice to TSA managers on dealing with personnel issues  including what disciplinary actions to take   the very same function that TSA employees were already being paid to perform themselves in that very office        The overuse of contractors raises the risk that DHS is not creating the institutional knowledge needed to be able to judge whether contractors are performing as they should  meaning the agency may pay too much for services  or may not receive the best possible services for its money   Lieberman said   There is also the risk that DHS will lose control over its own decision making  And the Department may become so dependent on contractors that it simply has no in house ability to evaluate the solutions its contractors propose or to develop options on its own accord       The GAO report we receive today delivers a troubling judgment  especially when so much of DHS service contracting comes very close to the performance of  inherently government functions   said Senator Collins   To address reports of contracting failures like those identified in this and other GAO reports  Senator Lieberman and I introduced S  680  the Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007  That bill  which was reported unanimously by the Committee  would reform contracting practices  strengthen the procurement workforce  introduce new safeguards against waste  fraud  and abuse  and provide increased oversight and transparency in the federal government s dealings with contractors   Also important  the bill would also limit the duration of non competitive contracts     a problem identified by GAO in this report  as many DHS service contracts were extended well beyond the original period of need      Witnesses at Wednesday s hearing   entitled  Is DHS Too Dependent on Contractors to do the Government s Work    were John Hutton  Director of Acquisition and Sourcing Management at the Government Accountability Office  Elaine C  Duke  Chief Procurement Officer at the Department of Homeland Security  and Steven L  Schooner  Co Director  Government Procurement Law Program at George Washington University   The hearing was the third contracting hearing the Committee has held this year  In August  the Committee passed unanimously  S  680  the  Accountability in Government Contracting Act of 2007        The GAO Report can be found      30
