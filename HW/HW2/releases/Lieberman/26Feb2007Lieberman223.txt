Below is the complete text of the op ed           The Choice on Iraq      By JOSEPH LIEBERMAN      Two months into the 110th Congress  Washington has never been more bitterly divided over our mission in Iraq  The Senate and House of Representatives are bracing for parliamentary trench warfare    trapped in an escalating dynamic of division and confrontation that will neither resolve the tough challenges we face in Iraq nor strengthen our nation against its terrorist enemies around the world       What is remarkable about this state of affairs in Washington is just how removed it is from what is actually happening in Iraq  There  the battle of Baghdad is now under way  A new commander  Gen  David Petraeus  has taken command  having been confirmed by the Senate  81 0  just a few weeks ago  And a new strategy is being put into action  with thousands of additional American soldiers streaming into the Iraqi capital       Congress thus faces a choice in the weeks and months ahead  Will we allow our actions to be driven by the changing conditions on the ground in Iraq    or by the unchanging political and ideological positions long ago staked out in Washington  What ultimately matters more to us  the real fight over there  or the political fight over here       If we stopped the legislative maneuvering and looked to Baghdad  we would see what the new security strategy actually entails and how dramatically it differs from previous efforts  For the first time in the Iraqi capital  the focus of the U S  military is not just training indigenous forces or chasing down insurgents  but ensuring basic security    meaning an end  at last  to the large scale sectarian slaughter and ethnic cleansing that has paralyzed Iraq for the past year       Tamping down this violence is more than a moral imperative  Al Qaeda s stated strategy in Iraq has been to provoke a Sunni Shiite civil war  precisely because they recognize that it is their best chance to radicalize the country s politics  derail any hope of democracy in the Middle East  and drive the U S  to despair and retreat  It also takes advantage of what has been the single greatest American weakness in Iraq  the absence of sufficient troops to protect ordinary Iraqis from violence and terrorism       The new strategy at last begins to tackle these problems  Where previously there weren t enough soldiers to hold key neighborhoods after they had been cleared of extremists and militias  now more U S  and Iraqi forces are either in place or on the way  Where previously American forces were based on the outskirts of Baghdad  unable to help secure the city  now they are living and working side by side with their Iraqi counterparts on small bases being set up throughout the capital       At least four of these new joint bases have already been established in the Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad    the same neighborhoods where  just a few weeks ago  jihadists and death squads held sway  In the Shiite neighborhoods of east Baghdad  American troops are also moving in    and Moqtada al Sadr and his Mahdi army are moving out       We of course will not know whether this new strategy in Iraq will succeed for some time  Even under the most optimistic of scenarios  there will be more attacks and casualties in the months ahead  especially as our fanatical enemies react and attempt to thwart any perception of progress       But the fact is that we are in a different place in Iraq today from even just a month ago    with a new strategy  a new commander  and more troops on the ground  We are now in a stronger position to ensure basic security    and with that  we are in a stronger position to marginalize the extremists and strengthen the moderates  a stronger position to foster the economic activity that will drain the insurgency and militias of public support  and a stronger position to press the Iraqi government to make the tough decisions that everyone acknowledges are necessary for progress       Unfortunately  for many congressional opponents of the war  none of this seems to matter  As the battle of Baghdad just gets underway  they have already made up their minds about America s cause in Iraq  declaring their intention to put an end to the mission before we have had the time to see whether our new plan will work       There is of course a direct and straightforward way that Congress could end the war  consistent with its authority under the Constitution  by cutting off funds  Yet this option is not being proposed  Critics of the war instead are planning to constrain and squeeze the current strategy and troops by a thousand cuts and conditions       Among the specific ideas under consideration are to tangle up the deployment of requested reinforcements by imposing certain  readiness  standards  and to redraft the congressional authorization for the war  apparently in such a way that Congress will assume the role of commander in chief and dictate when  where and against whom U S  troops can fight       I understand the frustration  anger and exhaustion so many Americans feel about Iraq  the desire to throw up our hands and simply say   Enough   And I am painfully aware of the enormous toll of this war in human life  and of the infuriating mistakes that have been made in the war s conduct       But we must not make another terrible mistake now  Many of the worst errors in Iraq arose precisely because the Bush administration best cased what would happen after Saddam was overthrown  Now many opponents of the war are making the very same best case mistake    assuming we can pull back in the midst of a critical battle with impunity  even arguing that our retreat will reduce the terrorism and sectarian violence in Iraq       In fact  halting the current security operation at midpoint  as virtually all of the congressional proposals seek to do  would have devastating consequences  It would put thousands of American troops already deployed in the heart of Baghdad in even greater danger    forced to choose between trying to hold their position without the required reinforcements or  more likely  abandoning them outright  A precipitous pullout would leave a gaping security vacuum in its wake  which terrorists  insurgents  militias and Iran would rush to fill    probably resulting in a spiral of ethnic cleansing and slaughter on a scale as yet unseen in Iraq       I appeal to my colleagues in Congress to step back and think carefully about what to do next  Instead of undermining Gen  Petraeus before he has been in Iraq for even a month  let us give him and his troops the time and support they need to succeed       Gen  Petraeus says he will be able to see whether progress is occurring by the end of the summer  so let us declare a truce in the Washington political war over Iraq until then  Let us come together around a constructive legislative agenda for our security  authorizing an increase in the size of the Army and Marines  funding the equipment and protection our troops need  monitoring progress on the ground in Iraq with oversight hearings  investigating contract procedures  and guaranteeing Iraq war veterans the first class treatment and care they deserve when they come home       We are at a critical moment in Iraq    at the beginning of a key battle  in the midst of a war that is irretrievably bound up in an even bigger  global struggle against the totalitarian ideology of radical Islamism  However tired  however frustrated  however angry we may feel  we must remember that our forces in Iraq carry America s cause    the cause of freedom    which we abandon at our peril       30
