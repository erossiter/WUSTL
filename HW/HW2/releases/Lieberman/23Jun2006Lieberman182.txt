D CT  today lauded Senate approval of a  517 6 billion blueprint for the nation   s armed forces that expresses Congress    support for the necessary tools for our military fighting throughout the world  As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  Lieberman played a leadership role in shaping the measure in a way that will make our soldiers safer and more effective and also strongly benefit Connecticut   s defense workers and economy           It is critical that our military invest more resources for training  weapons  and technology to meet the new demands placed on it by the War on Terror     Lieberman said   We need to keep investing in our defense programs that have worked well in the past  We must also make sure that we provide enough resources for research and development  which will insure that our servicemen and servicewomen are equipped with the best weapons possible  I am proud of the many Connecticut defense companies that meet both of these critical demands  Last year  we successfully fought efforts to close Submarine Base New London  because closing the base would have been a threat to our national security and would have put the most skilled defense workers in the world out of work  These Connecticut workers are responsible for promoting our national security and developing important innovations that will help protect the lives of our military personnel  and we will continue to fight to keep their jobs in Connecticut           Lieberman authored several amendments that were included in the Defense Authorization bill  including an amendment he co sponsored with Sen  Barbara Boxer  D CA  to ensure that our soldiers receive the mental health care they need and deserve   The amendment creates a detailed and comprehensive screening process to assess the mental health status of individual soldiers before they are deployed to combat zones and ensures that a soldier who is determined to have symptoms of a mental health condition will be referred to an appropriate qualified mental health care professional for further evaluation   It also mandates timely access to mental health services if requested by a member of the armed forces before  during  or after deployment to a combat zone     within 72 hours after making the request or as soon as possible and requires consent from a qualified mental health care professional before a soldier deemed to have a duty limiting mental health condition is sent to a combat zone           Senators Boxer  Kennedy  Clinton  and I introduced this amendment to protect the health and safety of service members and their units  similar to the ones The Hartford Courant has written about     Senator Lieberman said     The military mental health amendment has two purposes  First  it is meant to keep these courageous young men and women out of the way of any further harm  Second  we must make certain that our units have the strongest and healthiest soldiers and this amendment moves us in the right direction  I thank both Senators Levin and Warner for adopting this amendment into the Defense Authorization Bill for 2007 and I encourage the conferees in both Houses to maintain the provisions of this amendment to ensure we keep our troops strong and healthy         Lieberman co sponsored an amendment that enables the Air Force to enter into a multiyear contract beginning in FY 2007 for 60 F 22 aircraft over  three years   This means workers at Pratt   Whitney will be producing up to an additional 133 F 119 engines  which power the F 22   And  moving to multiyear contract will save American taxpayers more than  250 million        Lieberman also co sponsored an amendment with Senators Debbie Stabenow  D MI  and Frank Lautenberg  D NJ  to ensure military families do not have to face the burdens of rising pharmaceutical co pays for TRICARE  the armed forces health care plan  next year   The amendment prohibits increasing retail pharmacy copays for TRICARE beneficiaries through fiscal year 2007  The President   s budget submission proposed raising copays from  3  generic  and  9  brand name  to  5 and  15  respectively        The Senate today approved the Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2007  which sets funding levels and overall strategic goals for defense personnel  facilities  and weapons systems  The defense authorization bill sets forth Congress    priorities in supporting our military today and in the future   Differences between the Senate and House passed versions of the bill will be resolved in a conference later this year  As the ranking member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Airland Forces  Lieberman advocated aggressively during committee debate to fund efforts to transform the military to keep pace with the security needs of the 21st century and to provide tools effective to our Army and Air Force today         The bill bolsters federal funding for military housing  training  and compensation as well as providing strong support for critical weapons systems produced by Connecticut companies  Particularly important this year are additions to submarine design programs and construction at U S  Submarine Base New London  It provides  75 million in additional funding for submarine design   65 million for improvements to the Virginia class submarine and  10 million to begin design for the replacement of the nation   s Ohio class ballistic missile submarine  This addition will help submarine designers at EB  The addition of  9 6 million for a small craft maintenance facility is an important step in upgrading the submarine base         The bill also contains the following provisions of importance to Connecticut   s defense economy        Groton  Electric Boat              2 6 billion to procure
