Immediately       WASHINGTON  DC   Following repeated requests from Member of Congress  including Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  that the Department of Defense immediately release all documents related to the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  process  the Senators today sent a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld demanding immediate release of the documents         In a letter to Secretary Rumsfeld  dated Friday  May 27  the Senators reminded Rumsfeld of the Department   s statutory obligation to release the documents   The Senators  who have the authority to subpoena such documents  said that they would exercise that authority of necessary         Should the Department continue to violate its statutory obligation and refuse to produce all such information  related to BRAC  immediately and completely  the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will act pursuant to its authority under the Rules of the United States Senate to investigate the Department   s decision making process underlying its recommendations for potential improprieties        As part of that investigation  the Committee will issue a subpoena to the Department to compel production of the information required by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act     wrote the Senators in their letter      The Senators  both of whom represent states that are disproportionately affected by BRAC closures  said that only a complete release of data   including emails  memoranda  spreadsheets  analyses  raw data  handwritten notes and telephone logs  for example   would be acceptable          The integrity of the BRAC process depends on the release of these documents  In addition  it is unfair to bases that have early visits from BRAC Commissioners  such as those in Connecticut and Maine  to not have immediate data available to them     said Senators Collins and Lieberman      Earlier today  the Senators also sent a letter to President Bush requesting that he intervene and demand that the Department of Defense release the documents in question      The full text of the letter to Secretary Rumsfeld is as follows        May 27  2005      Dear Secretary Rumsfeld       We are writing to demand that the Department of Defense comply with its statutory obligation to disclose to Congress all the information underlying its recent recommendations for military base closures and realignments    The Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990 as amended  the  Act   requires that the Department  mak e  all information used by the Secretary to prepare the recommendations     available to Congress  including any committee or member of Congress   to enable Congress to conduct a substantive review of the Department   s recommendations  Section 2903 c  4   Despite repeated requests from Members of Congress  the Department has thus far refused to make available to Congress this critical information  The Department   s failure to disclose all of this information prevents Congress from conducting a thorough and meaningful review of those recommendations       The Act also requires the Department to release all such information to the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Commission to facilitate the Commission   s assessment of the Department   s recommendations and submission of independent findings and conclusions to the President by September 8  2005  Id        We understand that the Department has failed to disclose all of this information to the Commission despite the fact that the short time frame for the Commission   s work required the Commission to initiate its review immediately following the Department   s release of its recommendations on May 13  2005        The Department was put on notice of this obligation when the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2002 instituted the current round of base closures and realignments  Thus the Department has no excuse for failing to disclose all of the information contemporaneously with the release of its recommendations and for the continuing delay       The integrity of the base closure and realignment process depends upon openness and transparency  The absence of these qualities due to the Department   s failure to abide by its statutory obligation to disclose information undermines our confidence in the Department   s decision making process and undoubtedly raises similar concerns across the American public        To be clear about our understanding of the Department   s statutory obligations  we believe that the text of the statute    all information used by the Secretary to prepare the recommendations    means literally all information  We therefore expect that the information disclosed by the Department in fulfillment of its statutory obligation will include not only all documents  e g   email traffic  memoranda  spreadsheets  analyses  raw data  handwritten notes  and telephone logs  related to the Department   s decision making process as set forth in the Act but also all documents that might reflect the influence or consideration of factors not authorized in that Act  Only a complete disclosure will suffice to begin restoring public confidence in the Department   s decision making process       Should the Department continue to violate its statutory obligation and refuse to produce all such information immediately and completely  the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs will act pursuant to its authority under the Rules of the United States Senate to investigate the Department   s decision making process underlying its recommendations for potential improprieties  As part of that investigation  the Committee will issue a subpoena to the Department to compel production of the information required by the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act        Sincerely        Susan M  Collins      Joseph I  Lieberman
