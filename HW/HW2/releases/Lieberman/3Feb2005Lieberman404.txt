today made the following floor statement on the nomination of Alberto Gonzales to be Attorney General  Lieberman voted in favor of Gonzales   s nomination  which passed the Senate today by a vote of 60 to 36        FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN      February 3  2005       I thank the chair  Mr  President  I rise to speak in regard to the nomination of Judge Gonzales to be the Attorney General of the United States         Mr  President  in reviewing Judge Gonzales    record and thinking about what my own conclusion about it would be I concluded that since this is all about justice  I should try to reach a just result     one that seemed just to me         Each of us  in the fullness of our heads and hearts  has to decide what is appropriate  I was reminded of the famous saying from the Bible     Justice  justice shalt thou seek     I remember asking why the repeat of the word justice  It means that not only should you pursue justice but you should pursue it in a just way  I ve had that in my mind as I considered this nomination and others over my 16 years here in the United States Senate         Throughout my tenure here  I voted on hundreds of Presidential nominations  In each case  I have adhered to a broadly deferential standard of review  To me that seems to be the just process to follow  As I explained in my very first speech on the Senate floor  which for better or worse  was on the nomination of John Tower to serve as Secretary of Defense  a nomination which I opposed  the history of debates at the constitutional convention make clear to me that the President is entitled to the benefit of a doubt in his appointments to his cabinet         The question I concluded I should ask myself in considering nominees is not whether I would have chosen the nominee but rather whether the President s choice is acceptable for the job for which the nominee as been chosen   That obviously does not mean that the Senate should always confirm a President s nominees  Were that the case  the framers would have given the Senate no role in the appointments process  no power to advise and consent  Instead  the Senate   s constitutional advice and consent mandate obligates us to serve as a check at the margins on the President s power to appoint    a power that a sitting President wins by virtue of his selection by the people of the country         As I put it in my statement on Senator Tower s nomination  I believe this requires Senators     or this Senator     to consider several things  First  the knowledge  experience  and qualifications of the nominee for the particular position for which he or she has been nominated  Second  the nominee   s judgment as well as his personal behavior  Third  the nominee   s ethics         In unusual circumstances Senators can also consider fundamental and potentially irreconcilable differences of policy between the nominee and the mission of the agency he or she is called upon to serve   As a result of that personal process that I   ve followed for nominations  on a very few occasions during my 16 years in the Senate  I have determined that the views of certain nominees  usually on one end of the political spectrum or the other  fell sufficiently outside the mainstream to compel me to oppose their nominations  In other words  I give a presumption in favor of the nominee unless there s a reason to decide otherwise         In this case  I   ve met with Judge Gonzales  I ve reviewed his record throughout his career  I m familiar with his life story   I   ve reviewed the proceedings before the Judiciary Committee    the comments made by many on the Committee in explaining their votes  as well as Judge Gonzales    testimony there   I have concluded that this nominee deserves to be confirmed and  therefore  I will vote to confirm the nominee         I need not labor on the details of the first three points  knowledge  experience and qualifications  judgment and personal behaviors  and nominee   s ethics  I believe that this nominee  as everyone has said  including those who are opposed the nomination  has a remarkable life story that speaks to his strength  to his balance  to his values  He has acted under pressure and gives me the confidence that he would do the same as Attorney General  He has spoken quite eloquently in his testimony before the Judiciary Committee that he understands that his first accountability as Attorney General will be to the Constitution and to the people of this country         I know there are some who question his independence of opinion and judgment because he s had a close relationship with the President of United States   But as some on this floor have said  more often than not the President chooses as Attorney General someone close to him  President Kennedy obviously chose his brother Robert  who was a great Attorney General  President Reagan  if I remember correctly  chose his personal lawyer to be his Attorney General  President Carter chose Griffin Bell from Atlanta  who was extremely close to him  So it goes throughout most of our history         It seems to me as I followed the debate in the Committee and on the floor that there are two or three elements that have troubled my colleagues enough to decide to vote against this nomination  And I believe that in fairness  I   ve got to consider these seriously but consider them in the context of Judge Gonzales  entire career  The two most significant points of contention are Judge Gonzales   s work as White House Counsel early in 2002     the memo he wrote and the involvement he had in the policy with regard to the application of the Geneva Convention   And secondly  what relationship he had with the memo of Mr  Bybee  head of the Office of Legal Counsel at the Justice Department  with regard to the definition of torture under the Convention Against Torture          In both of these cases  it seems to me that  as I listened to my colleagues who are opposed to the nomination  they take both of these areas to be indications of perhaps his lack of independence  lack of good judgment  which they believe disqualifies him for this position   And some  I try to be fair here  raise questions about whether both of these memos  certainly the second one     the Bybee memo     in any way contributed to the horrific behavior we saw in the prison abuse scandals at Abu Ghraib         I want just briefly to speak to both  The first is the work that Judge Gonzales did early in 2002 within months after the attack against us of September 11 and the initiation of our own war against terrorism in Afghanistan   I know people have quoted from the memo he wrote with some derision  and I think you ve got to appreciate the context   As I look back post September 11  what seems to be in Judge Gonzales   s memo and memos submitted by the State Department  by the Defense Department and others  there is a very serious and classically American debate going on about how to handle al Qaeda and the Taliban     prisoners taken from their membership  And what is the relevance of the Geneva Convention to those people  It is the argument of a nation that cares about the rule of law         You can agree with Judge Gonzales   s position in this matter or not  I happen to agree with the ultimate decision made  And the decision was  in my opinion  a reasonable one  and ultimately a progressive one  The decision was that under the terms of the Geneva Convention  al Qaeda simply is not a state party to the Convention  is a terrorist group and as such its members were not entitled to prisoner of war status  And there s a sentence in Judge Gonzales   s opinion that has been quoted with great derision  laughter  as if it was over the edge  He wrote     The new paradigm war on terrorism renders    quaint    some of the provisions requiring that a captured enemy be afforded such things as commissary privileges  script advances of monthly pay  athletic uniforms and scientific instruments           I think Judge Gonzales was being restrained and diplomatic in using the word    quaint    to offer these benefits    access to a canteen to purchase food  soap and tobacco  a monthly advance of pay  the ability to have and consult personal financial accounts  the ability to receive scientific equipment  musical instruments or sports outfits   Giving these benefits to Khalid Sheikh Mohammed  who planned the attacks against us on September 11  wouldn t be quaint  It would be offensive  It would be ridiculous   It would be ultimately unjust         A conclusion    a different  interesting kind of conclusion was reached about the Taliban  which is  as the summary of the opinion says     Although we never recognized the Taliban as a legitimate afghan government  Afghanistan is a party to the Geneva Convention and  therefore  the President has determined that the Taliban are covered by that Convention     But then they decided under the terms of the convention  Taliban detainees do not qualify for prisoner of war status         Then  in the progressive part of this opinion  coming out in February of 2002  even though the detainees are not entitled to prisoner of war privileges  they will be provided many POW Privileges as a matter of policy  All detainees at Guantanamo are being provided three meals a day that meet Muslim dietary laws  water  medical care  clothing and shoes  shelter  showers  soap and toilet articles  foam sleeping pads and blankets  towels and wash cloths  the opportunity to worship  correspondence materials and a means to send mail  the ability to receive packages of food and clothing subject to security screening  The detainees will not be subjected to physical or mental abuse or cruel treatment  That is the policy that Judge Gonzales helped them form  That is the policy that our government issued  To me  it is a remarkably just policy  and I see no basis in anything in the record of Judge Gonzales   s participation in this that would lead me to override the presumption in his favor         The Bybee memorandum from August of 2002 is a separate matter  It is very important to say that this memo was written by the independent Office of Legal Counsel at the Department of Justice  with a proud record of independence of opinion  You may disagree with its conclusions  I disagree with a lot of its content and conclusions    with a lot of its content and conclusions  But it is a lengthy  50 plus  single spaced document  over 25 footnotes  as I recall  and offered to Judge Gonzales in his role as counsel to the President  I want to repeat again  this was not Judge Gonzales   s memo  It was the Office of Legal Counsel memo  It is not clear what Judge Gonzales had to do with this memo  He refused at his hearing before the Judiciary Committee to reveal exactly what he advised the President about the memo  That was frustrating to the committee members  and I understand that  But I must say  as a former attorney general  a lawyer  I respect the right of the counsel to the President to keep private  for reasons of precedent and executive privilege  the private counsel he gives to the President of the United States         So I repeat again  there are parts of that Bybee memo that I find profoundly offensive  but it was not the Gonzales memo  and on the record  we do not know what he advised the President as a result of it  In questions and answer before the committee he said he agreed with the conclusion but not all the analysis in it  Hard to know what that means  What we do know is that in June of last year  presumably after the Abu Ghraib scandal broke  the Attorney General and White House Counsel were asked to reconsider and withdraw the opinion of August 2002   They issued the opinion in December of 2004 with just about all of the objectionable material taken out of it     the material that was objectionable to me and I presume to most others  So it is no longer a prevailing memo         Again  Justice Gonzales said repeatedly at the hearing that he would not countenance torture  repeated what is the fact that the Administration made very clear  presumably with his Counsel  that the rules of the Geneva Convention applied to the Iraq war because Iraq was a duly formed government  a sovereign state  and a party to the Geneva Convention  And what happened at Abu Ghraib was embarrassing  was hurtful to our cause in the world  and was offensive  It is being dealt with within the military justice system  as we have seen         Questions are raised about the connection  I suppose  between the Bybee memo  whatever involvement Judge Gonzales had in it  and the events at Abu Ghraib  There is simply no evidence to make a connection certainly between Judge Gonzales and what happened at Abu Ghraib  And any of the independent reviews that have gone on  most particularly Mr  Schlesinger s independent review  said that there was no connection between so called higher ups and what happened at Abu Ghraib         So  in the end  I have to ask myself  because of a memo written by somebody else    Mr  Bybee at the Office of Legal Counsel    which has in it material that I find  as I   ve said  profoundly offensive  that judge Gonzales received and did something with  am I prepared to vote to deny him confirmation as Attorney General of the United States  And to me  personally  that would be an unjust result  And that is why I will vote to confirm  I understand the frustration of members of the Judiciary Committee about some of the answers      many of the answers that Judge Gonzales gave at the hearing  Some of them were evasive  some were legalistic  but that wouldn t be the first time that a witness before a committee had proceeded in that particular way  particularly one who has privileges that he occupies and lives under as Counsel to the President of the United States         That is why I   m going to vote for Judge Gonzales and confirm his nomination  because nothing that I see in the record rises to a level high enough to overcome the presumption in favor of him as a nominee of the President  He has many outstanding qualities   I don t know if others have mentioned in this debate  but he has a certain independence of spirit  which I don t think has been much commented on  I remember reading in the press a moment ago when his name was mentioned as a potential nominee to the Supreme Court that some people felt that he wasn t a likely nominee because there were people    and I   ll be explicit     in the Republican Party who thought he had a little too much independence on some issues that were central   I think that should be remembered as we cast the vote        The final point I wanted to make is this     and I will state that this had nothing to do with the standards that I apply to voting on a confirmation of a nominee  but to me it is a kind of bonus associated with this nomination     Judge Gonzales  if confirmed  would be the first Hispanic Attorney General in the history of the United States  That is a fact  It s not reason  of course  to vote for him  if there were reasons to vote against him  But to me it is both a bonus and an extra measure of encouragement about the kind of Attorney General he will be         I have been in positions myself when I   ve had the chance in the true spirit of the American dream to break some barriers  and so I probably have a special sensitivity to others who have the opportunity to break barriers  When I had that opportunity myself  somebody said to me that another racial group was thrilled with what had just happened to me because they believed in America when a barrier falls for one group  the doors of opportunity open wider for every other American  I believe that  And I think that s a bonus that comes with this nomination  I can t help but also note the broad base of support that Judge Gonzales has received from the Hispanic community  from elected officials  and generally nonpartisan Hispanic organizations  They speak to the significance beyond the merits but built on merits that this nomination has to a group of Americans that are playing an increasingly important role in the life of this country         And that encourages me about the kind of job he will do because I think the experiences that he has had  the road that he walked to get to where he is  the extraordinary hard work he did to do that  the pride that he has in his family  in his heritage  will quite simply make him sensitive to the most fundamental values of equal opportunity  of the rule of law  of an absence of discrimination of any kind  So for all of those reasons  I shall vote  aye  on the nomination of Judge Gonzales to be our next Attorney General         I thank the chair  I yield the floor           30
