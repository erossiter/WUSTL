                                                         WASHINGTON   Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   sent the following letter Wednesday to Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   requesting the Committee issue subpoenas to the White House and other federal agencies to ensure that the Committee has a complete understanding of the federal government s actions in preparing for and responding to Hurricane Katrina  The Committee has been conducting an extensive investigation into the government s preparedness for and response to Hurricane Katrina and is planning to produce a detailed report on its findings later this month       March 15  2006      The Honorable Susan M  Collins   Chairman   Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs   461 Dirksen Senate Office Building   Washington  DC 20510      Dear Susan        I am writing to ask that the Committee immediately issue subpoenas to the White House and other federal departments compelling them to produce documents and witnesses to aid the Committee   s investigation into the preparedness for and response to Hurricane Katrina   I understand that our staffs have had extensive discussions about these issues  but I wanted to lay out for you the reasons why I believe subpoenas are appropriate      As you know  you and I sent a letter to White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card on October 7  2005  asking for the Executive Office of the President   s  EOP   s  assistance in helping the Committee learn what the White House did to prepare for and respond to Katrina and what role the White House played in the broader federal effort with respect to that catastrophic event   When  nearly three months after sending our letter  we received only a fraction of the information we requested  we sent a second letter on January 12  2006   That letter noted the paucity of the White House   s response to date and took issue with White House actions that effectively thwarted the Committee   s ability to obtain information related to the White House from executive branch agencies   In an effort to work with the White House  the Committee prioritized its requests and asked it to focus first on producing a portion of the material requested in the Committee   s original letter and to provide four individuals for Committee interviews       In response  we received a letter from Deputy White House Counsel William Kelley   Mr  Kelley declined to provide the bulk of the documents we requested or to offer any of the witnesses sought for Committee interviews   Instead  he offered a second briefing by Deputy Homeland Security Adviser Ken Rapuano and a small number of documents  virtually all of which we already had obtained from other agencies and which offered little new insight into the White House   s particular activities   For example  we asked for all White House documents related to the deployment of federal troops to the Gulf Region   The documents we received consisted mainly of situation reports  most of which were already produced to us by the Pentagon and did not address the issue of troop deployment       Like the White House   s earlier productions  this one shed no new light on what the White House did with  and in response to  the information it received  and Mr  Rapuano   s briefing offered few additional specifics on the White House   s particular activities   In short  having now received the briefing and the additional documents  I still believe that the White House   s production thus far has left the Committee without much of the information it needs to understand and assess the specific roles played by specific EOP officials and the specific actions taken by the EOP       At the same time  recent hearing testimony has both offered new information about the White House   s involvement in the preparations for and response to Katrina and raised a number of questions the Committee must answer if its investigation is to be complete   As you recall  on Friday  February 10  former FEMA Director Michael Brown appeared before the Committee and shortly thereafter sat for a more detailed  transcribed interview with our staff   In both instances  Mr  Brown made clear that he saw the White House as a critical player in the preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina       Mr  Brown testified that he expressed to the President before landfall that the storm could be catastrophic depending on where it hit   He also told the Committee that he believed that on August 29  the day of Katrina   s landfall  he spoke with Deputy White House Chief of Staff Joseph Hagin on at least two occasions to inform him of the situation on the ground in New Orleans   Mr  Brown testified that in a call with Mr  Hagin     placed after Mr  Brown received FEMA employee Marty Bahamonde   s eyewitness account of the extent of the devastation        I think I told  Hagin  that we were realizing our worst nightmare  that everything we had planned about  worried about  that FEMA  frankly  had worried about for 10 years  was coming true      According to Mr  Brown   s interview with staff  there was no doubt that by Monday evening  Mr  Hagin knew from Mr  Brown that the 17th Street Canal levee had broken and that New Orleans was flooding   Moreover  at approximately 10 p m  that night  an email exchange between Mr  Brown and White House Chief of Staff Andy Card had Mr  Card informing Mr  Brown that Mr  Hagin had kept him    well informed    of Mr  Brown   s reports  and Mr  Brown telling Mr  Card that     t his is a bad one          Just as importantly  Mr  Brown made clear that  from his standpoint at least  he saw informing the White House and seeking action from it as capable of producing faster results than contacting the designated leader of the federal response  Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff   Given what our investigation has already revealed about the federal government   s activities during the week after landfall  it is clear that the White House played a significant role in coordinating and helping to manage the response to Katrina   The Committee would be remiss if it were not to follow up on the multiple questions regarding White House action left unanswered by Mr  Brown   s testimony and the rest of our investigation       During our months of efforts to obtain the information we seek from the EOP  we have not received a satisfactory reason for the dearth of the White House   s response   Mr  Kelley   s January 27  2006 letter suggests that our requests implicate    very important Executive Branch interests     including    avoiding the burden on officials most directly supporting the President  threatening to impair the President   s ability to discharge his constitutional duties  preserving the confidentiality required to support Presidential decision making  and adhering to the course of dealings between the branches  in analogous contexts  regarding the occasions for broad inquiry into EOP policymaking and deliberations      It is out of a desire to take into account such interests that the Committee sought to prioritize its requests in early January  but that prioritization has yielded precious little additional information in return   Perhaps even more importantly  the EOP   s remedy for protecting its asserted interests is to assert a virtual immunity from our inquiry  a level of immunity that is far out of proportion with the interest asserted and highly inconsistent with the manner in which Congressional investigations have been conducted in the past       As you know  our Committee  among others  has repeatedly conducted investigations touching on or directly involving the EOP   Yet I have never before seen the EOP take the position asserted here  under which the Committee has not only been denied most relevant material and information directly from the White House  but also has been precluded     at White House direction     from receiving from other agencies most material relating to the White House   s involvement with Hurricane Katrina   In Mr  Kelley   s January 27  2006 letter  he asserts that the White House is giving the Committee access to material involving    factual and operational communications involving nearly all EOP personnel other than a relatively small number of officials most directly involved in supporting the President   s actions and determinations      This exception  however  swallows the rule in one gulp  virtually everyone in the White House who had anything of operational significance to do with the preparation for and response to Katrina falls into the category put off limits to us   And  of course  we have been denied our requested interviews with even those lower level employees about whom the White House says it is willing to give us information   This has left us unable to obtain any real sense of what the White House did or didn   t do to run or aid the federal response to Katrina   And it has kept us from obtaining key information from executive branch agencies about the government   s response to Katrina   Members of both of our staffs have repeatedly and for months asked White House staff for precedent for the White House   s sweeping assertion of near immunity from inquiry   To date  we have been given none         It is not only our experience that tells us that the White House   s position is wrong  it is the non partisan Congressional Research Service   According to a February 9  2006 memorandum CRS prepared for the Committee       the Supreme Court has held that     t he scope of  Congress     power of inquiry       is as penetrating and far reaching as the potential power to enact and appropriate under the Constitution        encompasses inquiries concerning the administration of existing laws as well as proposed or possibly needed statutes     and is at its peak when the subject is alleged waste  fraud  abuse or maladministration   citations omitted   In the last 80 years  Congress has consistently sought and obtained documents and testimony that reflects deliberations in agencies  including almost every office and bureau in the Department of Justice and the Executive Office of the President  EOP    There have been some 75 instances in which EOP officials have testified before congressional committees  a list that includes chiefs of staff to the President  White House counsels and National Security Advisers   emphasis added        In short  while I certainly recognize that there are important Executive Branch interests at stake whenever the Congress seeks to conduct oversight     interests which I believe we have tried to accommodate     the EOP has failed to recognize in return that there are countervailing and constitutionally based Legislative Branch interests at stake as well  the uncontested authority of the Congress to inquire into the Executive Branch   s administration of federal programs         It is the historical  and as far as I know  unbroken view of the Congress that where a Congressional Committee believes that it needs particular information  whether from the EOP or elsewhere in the Executive Branch  the only basis on which the Executive Branch may ultimately resist such a Congressional demand is through an assertion by the President of executive privilege   This Constitutional safeguard ensures that where the legislative branch determines that discharging its constitutional functions requires it to obtain information  such a determination may be outweighed only if the President is willing to conclude and assert that his constitutional interests demand otherwise   Of course  even then  the privilege is a qualified one and may be overcome  but the issue of weighing the competing interests is not even reached if the President is unwilling to meet Congress   s assertion of Constitutional authority with a equivalent assertion of his own   In the words of our former Chairman Fred Thompson  when addressing the previous Administration   s efforts to resist a document request on a basis short of executive privilege       If the President is claiming special status because he is President  then his assertion is really one of executive privilege and not attorney client privilege  While I can still remember Sam Ervin s repeated admonitions that no man is above the law and that we are entitled to every man s evidence  I still concede that executive privilege can be a valid claim  under some circumstances  However  the President must assert it     12 20 95 Cong  Record  p  S18971   emphasis added        This is a point we recognized just recently when Mr  Brown testified   Having asked the White House whether the President wished to assert executive privilege and having heard that it did not  you instructed Mr  Brown to answer questions regarding his contacts with the White House     the first time in the course of our investigation that we have received significant first hand testimony regarding the White House   s activities during Katrina         In short  the Committee needs the information and documents we have been seeking for five months now from the White House if it is to be able to fully discharge its mandate of investigating the preparedness and response to Katrina   We have received far less cooperation from the White House in this investigation than in any in which I have previously participated during my seventeen plus years in the Senate  despite the fact that this is likely one of the most significant investigations a Senate committee has conducted in years   Nothing less than the future preparedness of our nation to respond to a terrorist attack or another catastrophic natural disaster is at stake  and the White House   s refusal to allow the Committee appropriate insight into the workings of the entity within the federal government that was ultimately responsible for coordinating and leading the federal response cannot  I believe  be permitted to stand   Although I believe it was appropriate to attempt to work out these issues with our co equal branch  I have concluded that the time has come to take more aggressive action       I therefore ask that the Committee issue subpoenas        1 to all federal departments and agencies to whom we sent request letters for the immediate production to the Committee of any document thus far withheld from the Committee on the ground that it refers or relates to EOP or OVP personnel        2 to the White House for the production of the following witnesses for depositions with Committee staff no later than Wednesday  March 22           Kirstjen Nielsen  Special Assistant to the President and Sr  Director for Preparedness and Response           Ken Rapuano  Deputy Assistant to the President for Homeland Security and Executive Secretary           Andrew H  Card  Jr   Chief of Staff          Frances Fragos Townsend  Assistant to the President for Homeland Security          Joseph Hagin  Deputy Chief of Staff       3 to the White House for the production of all documents related to the priority topics listed in our January 12  2006 letter  and       4 to the White House for all documents           produced  sent or received by the EOP or any of its employees or officials between August 26  2005 and August 31  2005 that refer or relate to  a  actual or potential breaching or overtopping of the levees in or around New Orleans or  b  flooding in or around New Orleans  and          related to the 11 13 AM White House Homeland Security Council spot report stating that there was a report of a levee breach  including any and all documents stating or relating to the source of the report of a levee breach   If no such documents exist  please identify the source of that report       As you know  I greatly appreciate your leadership throughout this truly bi partisan investigation  and I am very sorry that the White House   s lack of cooperation with our investigation has forced me to make this request   I appreciate your consideration of it  and would be happy to discuss it further with you       Sincerely                                                        ______________________________  Joseph I  Lieberman
