William Wehrum to the Position of Assistant EPA Administrator                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT   a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee  submitted the following statement today at the EPW Committee   s hearing on the nomination of William Wehrum to the position of Assistant Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency        Statement of Senator Joseph Lieberman Regarding the Nomination of  William Wehrum to the Position of Assistant EPA Administrator       Mr  Wehrum comes before the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee today as President Bush   s nominee to the position of assistant administrator for air and radiation at the Environmental Protection Agency   For several years now  Mr  Wehrum has been an influential attorney in the EPA air office   In that role  he has shaped and promoted a series of agency decisions that needlessly threaten to prolong and even increase the high concentrations of industrial air pollution that millions of Americans are forced to breathe   Unfortunately  a review of even just a sample of the harmful initiatives that have emanated and continue to emanate from EPA   s air office with Mr  Wehrum   s active participation and support raises troubling concerns about this nomination   These episodes and several others will be the subject of written questions that I will submit to Mr  Wehrum          By his own account  Mr  Wehrum was deeply involved in developing the so called    Clean Air Mercury Rule    that EPA issued on March 15  2005   That rule rescinded the agency   s prior commitment to mandate that  within three years  coal fired power plants control their toxic mercury air pollution to the maximum extent achievable   In place of that unmet promise  which would have yielded eighty to ninety percent cuts in mercury emissions at each of the nation   s coal fired plants by 2008  EPA left the public with a rule that will take until sometime after 2026 to reduce coal plant mercury emissions by seventy percent   Moreover  the rule will allow many coal plants to avoid substantial control by buying mercury emissions credits from cleaner plants   In a study recently conducted at a site in the Ohio River Valley  seventy percent of the mercury found in the rainwater originated at nearby coal burning plants   The fact that mercury emissions might decrease elsewhere in the country will be no consolation for the families living near plants that buy permission to keep their emissions high          Mr  Wehrum was also a central participant in EPA   s October 2003 promulgation of an    Equipment Replacement Provision    that dramatically expanded a regulatory exemption from the Clean Air Act requirement that large industrial facilities accompany emissions increasing renovations with the installation of up to date pollution controls   Two months before EPA issued the final provision  the General Accounting Office determined that EPA   s stated reasons for the change were based on self serving  unsubstantiated industry anecdotes  rather than on reliable data   Shortly after EPA published its rule change  the U S  Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia stayed the action after finding that it was likely unlawful and would cause irreparable harm to the public if allowed to take effect   Nine months later  EPA   s inspector general found that the agency   s support for the expanded exemption had already    seriously hampered    Clean Air Act enforcement against coal fired power plants and that the exemption would    result in significant amounts of lost emissions reductions           Despite mounting condemnations from both within and outside of EPA  Mr  Wehrum and his colleagues refused to rescind the expanded exemption   On March 17  2006  however  a unanimous panel of the D C  Circuit found the EPA rule unlawful and vacated it   The panel wrote that EPA   s attempted legal defense of the rule     a defense crafted in no small part by Mr  Wehrum     would make sense     o nly in a Humpty Dumpty world             Rather than abandoning its misguided effort to undermine the Clean Air Act  Mr  Wehrum   s air office is forging ahead with a new proposal to neutralize the same pollution control requirement that it unsuccessfully targeted in its 2003 rule   EPA   s stated goal for the new rule is conformity with the result of a decision by the U S  Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit  which rejected EPA   s longstanding interpretation of key Clean Air Act language   That Fourth Circuit interpretation was later superseded  however  by a D C  Circuit holding that upheld the erstwhile EPA position in a decision that  by law  establishes the governing rule across the entire country   Thus  EPA is ignoring a binding court decision in order to bring air quality protection across the entire country down to the level prescribed by a ruling that never applied outside of one region and is in any event no longer controlling law   Mr  Wehrum   s office is again pursuing an approach that would make sense only in a Humpty Dumpty world   And the current  ill conceived EPA air initiative  like the one in 2003  is having a negative impact even before it becomes a final rule   Just last week  the power company defendant in one of the largest ever Clean Air Act enforcement suits filed a brief in the U S  Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit arguing that it should not be liable for its pollution increasing activities since  under EPA   s new proposed rule  those activities would not trigger the Clean Air Act   s control requirements        I cannot close without briefly mentioning two additional  related examples of the work that Mr  Wehrum has done in EPA   s air office   Mr  Wehrum has been an enthusiastic advocate of a multi pollutant power plant bill that fails to address carbon dioxide pollution   He has also helped to craft a recently issued EPA interpretation of the Clean Air Act that makes it easier for companies building new coal fired power plants to avoid using technology that sequesters carbon dioxide waste so that it can be placed into permanent storage   Carbon dioxide pollution from power plants is contributing to man made climate change on a global scale   We must start achieving substantial cuts in that pollution now if we are to avoid devastating harm to our economy and the health and the wellbeing of our population   I find deeply disappointing the persistent aversion of senior EPA officials to meaningful action to address this problem   As for EPA   s steps to hinder the spread of technology that could allow us to continue relying on coal without worsening global warming  those actions simply defy explanation        I urge Mr  Wehrum  in responding to my questions and concerns  to indicate whether he has changed any of the views that led him to advocate policies that I find starkly antithetical to the Environmental Protection Agency   s mission   I also encourage him to pledge specific steps that he would take as assistant EPA administrator to return the agency   s air office to the task of achieving the dramatic reductions in industrial air pollution that  as EPA   s own studies show  return benefits to the American public far in excess of the costs those cuts impose on industry        30
