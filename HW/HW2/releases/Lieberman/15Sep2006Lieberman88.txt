September 11th  reform advocate Mary Fetchet addressed students Friday at Fairfield University on the unfinished business of the 9 11 commission and the future of fighting terrorism and securing the American people here at home                    While noting significant progress in securing the homeland since the September 11th attacks  Senator Lieberman said he was    not yet satisfied that we have made Connecticut safe enough from those who would gladly give their own lives to kill innocent people here                      Fetchet   s son Bradley was killed in the attacks on the World Trade Center  Senator Lieberman thanked her for her dedicated efforts as Founding Director of  Voices of September 11 and for her instrumental help in the creation of the 9 11 Commission and enactment of the Commission   s recommendations                   Fetchet said      The fifth year anniversary has heightened everyone s focus on evaluating how safe we truly are five years after 9 11   I commend Senator Lieberman for his ongoing commitment to work in a bi partisan manner for necessary government reform   Although we have made some progress  Democrats and Republicans alike  on all levels of government  must demonstrate a sense of urgency by fully implementing the 9 11 Commission recommendations  In memory of my son and all those who perished on 9 11 I have made a personal commitment to educating the general public about these important reforms and Voices of September 11th will support that effort                         Lieberman praised Senate passage Thursday of the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006  which he co sponsored  as an important step toward closing one of our most significant remaining security gaps  but stressed other areas that remain vulnerable                           In the five years since September 11  2001  we have made real progress in strengthening our homeland security  and I am privileged to have had a role in bringing about that progress     he said     But I am not yet satisfied  We have brought many members of al Qaeda and other terrorist groups to justice  but Osama bin Laden is still free and fomenting hatred against the United States  We have formed important strategic alliances to fight terror  but this Administration has alienated many potential friends who could help in this fight against our common enemy  We came together to create the Department of Homeland Security and passed other measures to strengthen our preparedness  but we remain too divided as a nation and spend too much time fighting each other in Congress rather than uniting to make progress for America                      Lieberman specifically discussed the need for better chemical  port  and rail and transit security  adequate funding for first responders  for intelligence and law enforcement agencies at the federal  state  and local levels to share information more readily  and the need to reach out to the Muslim world through scholarship  exchange  and free media programs                                   Our intelligence agencies  the FBI and DHS must work cooperatively and share information among themselves and state and local officials as needed  And they   re not doing as well as they should     he said     Our national anti terror efforts must reach right down into our hometowns because it is our police  firefighters and other rescue workers who are on the front lines     We need to make it a national priority that the men and women of our local police and fire departments have the kind of equipment and training they need  And that must include communications gear that both allows emergency workers to talk to each other in a crisis     but survive and function after a disaster   And that means increasing federal aid                          Let us remember that we share a common purpose and that we serve this purpose best when we bring our disagreements to the table and try to work them out   That   s what Mary Fetchet and I did to help convince a reluctant Congress and White House to support the 9 11 Commission  and pass its transformational proposals                         I intend to keep working every day to make sure America s government fulfills its first responsibility to provide for the common defense  and secure the lives of the American people  so that we may enjoy the liberties that are our birthright           30
