Amendments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  made the following statement on the floor of the United States Senate late yesterday evening regarding two proposed amendments to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill            Mr  President I rise to oppose the amendments introduced by the Senator from Michigan and others  and  the other amendment introduced by the Senator from Massachusetts and Wisconsin and others  because they both would direct  in different ways  the withdrawal of American Forces from Iraq without regard to the real conditions on the ground  Mr  President  let me begin first with the harsh and familiar lesson history has taught us and that we are experiencing again in Iraq   War is hell   Precious lives are lost  blood is spilled  treasure is spent  countries  communities  and families are deeply pained and disrupted   But history also teaches us that there are times when wars must be waged and won to prevent even more awful hell  to overthrow an evil leader  or protect the noble causes of human freedom  opportunity  and peace                        Mr  President at the outset of the war in Iraq coalition forces  led by our own brave and brilliant American men and women in uniform succeeded with remarkable speed to achieve a most worthy goal  overthrow an evil leader  Saddam Hussein  and  the opening of the opportunity for freedom  opportunity for the people of Iraq and broader peace in the region    After that  I would say  and I think all who support that war must admit  that mistakes were made on our side  some of them big  and the difficulty in Iraq increased   As others have said before me the war in Iraq  to overthrow Saddam Hussein  may have been a war of choice  it is now a war of necessity  We must win it  Why  Because the consequences of an American retreat and defeat there would be terrible for the safety and security of the American people here at home whom we have a constitutional responsibility to protect                       I must say I also approach these two amendments with a sense of legislative history   They evoke debates that have occurred many times in the Senate   We had it just a decade ago on this floor about how long our Armed Forces should stay in Bosnia   Some wanted to set a deadline for withdrawal   A date  Others    including myself     argued successfully that setting a date for automatic withdrawal was dangerous and wrong because it would discourage our allies and encourage our enemies   Our withdrawal should be consistent with the achievement of the goals we have set for the mission  I remember in that debate quoting the Biblical wisdom and warning     If the sound of the trumpet is uncertain who will follow into battle      I suppose in our time we might amend that to say     If the sound of the trumpet is uncertain who would stay in battle     I remember arguing that a nation  I thought  should only set an unconditional date for withdrawing troops if all hope of victory was already lost  which it was not then in Bosnia and is not now in Iraq  and unless the consequences of a too early American withdrawal by calendar instead of conditions were acceptable to our country  which it was not then in Bosnia and is not now in Iraq                         The Kerry Feingold amendment directs that all American troops be withdrawn from Iraq by the middle of next year  regardless of the intervening events  The Levin Amendment is more complicated and I have spent some time studying it since it was made public on Monday  The Levin amendment directs that a withdrawal of American troops from Iraq begin by the end of this year  2006  without regard to the conditions on the ground there   And  so  for that reason  consistent with what I have just said about legislative history and my own previously stated strong position I cannot support either of these amendments   Mr  President  I personally hope  as I am sure all members of the Senate do  and I believe  that we will be able to withdraw a significant number of our men and women in uniform from Iraq by the end of this year and even more by next year  And I express that optimism based on the election and formation of the new Iraqi unity government  the increasing capacity of the Iraqi security forces to protect their own people  and the commitment of the new government to disarm the sectarian militias                       General Abizaid and General Casey have said that it is their hope to begin withdrawing more troops by the end of 2006  and even more next year  But I want them to decide based on the realities on the ground  in Iraq  not on their hopes  or my hopes  or the shared hopes of the American people that we will soon be able to bring our Armed Forces home from Iraq  and I don   t want those distinguished American generals and the brave and steadfast American men and women serving under them to be directed by this Congress to exit before they conclude and recommend to us and the President that withdrawal is justified                        My own opinion is that the sooner the Iraqis take control of their own defense and destiny the better it will be for them and for us   But  if we leave too soon it will be disastrous for them and for us                         Sponsors of the Kerry Feingold amendment have stated a very clear and direct purpose  I disagree with it  Sponsors of the Levin Amendment have argued on behalf of their amendment that they believe we must direct the beginning of a withdrawal of American troops without condition by December 31 of this year to make clear to the Iraqis that our commitment to them is not open ended  I believe the Iraqis know very well that our commitment is not open ended and is not a blank check           I will tell you that I personally said that to their leaders directly every time I have met them here or there  I know that many of my Senate Colleagues of both parties and leaders of the Administration have said the same openly and directly to the Iraqi leaders and Iraqi people  and the Iraqis have said over and over again that they know our commitment is not unconditional   Just yesterday in an op ed piece in the Washington Post the National Security Advisor of Iraq made clear that his government wants the American military out of Iraq as much as we want our men and women to come home to America   He and the rest of the Iraqi leadership don   t need a Congressional directive to convince them of the desirability of American Forces leaving Iraq             What will be lost by it  Well I will answer that in a moment  I will say that in the interest of Iraq   s security and ours it should only happen  that is the withdrawal  as the Iraqis  step by step  are more and more ready to stand on their own   As the amendment introduced by Senator Levin states  the Iraqis are making good progress in exactly that direction   As the amendment itself reports more than two thirds of the operational Iraqi Army combat battalions    are now either in the lead or operating independently      That   s significant progress   A national unity government has been formed   It took too long  but that also is an enormous achievement  But of course there is much work yet to be done  as the amendment states  to amend the Iraqi Constitution  Section 1209  b  10  to get more help from International donors  Section 1209 b 11   and as it states  and I quote from the Levin amendment  to    promptly and decisively disarm the militias and remove those members of the Iraqi security forces whose loyalty to the Iraq government is in doubt                            But  then the Amendment goes on to direct the beginning of the withdrawal of American forces by the end of this year  regardless of whether that work is done or those militias are disarmed  And that  it is where  I believe respectfully  it errs                        In doing so  we will not just underline the message the Iraqi leadership already has received  accepted  and shares  that America   s military commitment to Iraq is not open ended and unconditional   I fear it would also send another message to our terrorist enemies and to the sectarian militias in Iraq that America is not prepared to see this fight through until the Iraqis themselves can take over   That will naturally encourage the terrorists to accelerate their cruel and inhuman attacks and it will signal the sectarian groups to hunker down and rearm their militias to strengthen themselves for the civil war that they fear will follow a premature American retreat  and that might well create conditions that none of us want  which is to say chaos  and civil war  in Iraq  and even regional war in the Middle East  And the terrorists who attacked us on 9 11 being able to claim victory in Iraq  and going on emboldened to attack us again here at home and to bring their terrorism to more Arab countries in the Middle East   That is why I said the war in Iraq  whatever anyone thinks of how we got there  is now a war of necessity  a war we must help the people of Iraq win  or the security of we  the people of America  our children  and grandchildren will be gravely endangered                        Mr  President section 2 on page 4 of the amendment the Senator from Michigan has introduced says that    the current open ended commitment of U S  forces in Iraq is unsustainable      As I have said  our current commitment is not and should not be open ended   It is conditional on the Iraqis working hard to move themselves forward on the path to self government and self defense and in fact as the amendment states they are doing that   And this conditional commitment of ours to them is surely militarily sustainable and must be honored                       The failure to do so  I believe  would have terrible consequences for our credibility in the world and our success in the long conflict ahead against radical Islamist terrorists who declared war against us and much of the rest of the world during the 1990s and carried out a brutal act of war against our people on September 11  2001   We cannot and must not concede any battlefield to our enemy in this most unconventional but deadly serious war   I do not think it is an overstatement to say that our freedom and security and that of most of the rest of the world  Muslim and non Muslim  depends now     as it has at critical moments in the past     on American persistence and fortitude in this painful  awful  essential worldwide war                       For these reasons  Mr  President I will respectfully oppose the Levin amendment and the amendment introduced by Senators Kerry and Feingold                       I thank the Chair and I yield the floor            30
