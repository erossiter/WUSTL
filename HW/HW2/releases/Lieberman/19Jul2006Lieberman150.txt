Uncovered Numerous Cases of Wasteful Spending  Abuse by DHS                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman today led a committee hearing to discuss the findings of a recent Government Accountability Office  GAO  investigation into the misuse of government purchase cards by the Department of Homeland Security during the months immediately preceding and following Hurricane Katrina   The hearing  titled    DHS Purchase Cards  Credit without Accountability     focused on investigative work that was requested by the Senators    The GAO found numerous cases where questionable items  such as iPods and a 63 inch plasma television  were purchased using the cards  as well as instances where DHS was unable to account for items such as flat bottom boats and laptop computers        Witnesses included Managing Director of GAO   s Forensics Audits and Special Investigations  Greg Kutz  and DHS Chief Financial Officer David Norquist        Following initial news reports of the GAO   s findings and prior to the Committee hearing this morning  a DHS official notified Committee investigators that the Department was able to locate some of the items that it was unable to find during the course of the GAO   s investigation           I am convinced that the items identified in the GAO report would still be missing were it not for this GAO investigation and our Committee   s hearing     said Senator Collins   She added     The American people expect the federal government to spend their tax dollars wisely   especially in this time of great fiscal pressures and a large budget deficit  That is why it is so disturbing that this new GAO investigation uncovered yet more evidence of wasted taxpayer dollars following Hurricane Katrina  DHS lacks the most basic safeguards to prevent waste  fraud  and abuse in the purchase card program and has left the door wide open for these abuses           Senator Collins and Senator Lieberman opposed the increase of the purchase card threshold from  2 500 to  250 000 that was authorized after Hurricane Katrina for fear that it would leave open opportunities to wasteful spending and were successful in their efforts to lower the spending limit on the cards back to  2 500     GAO   s investigation indicates that my fears were warranted     Senator Collins said          Senator Lieberman said     GAO has uncovered a number of inexcusable abuses of the purchase cards which are symptomatic of the larger problems the Department of Homeland Security has with management controls and financial oversight   Our task now is to ensure that DHS does what is necessary to prevent abuse of the cards and takes appropriate disciplinary action against those who use the cards fraudulently   The reputation of DHS and the confidence of Congress and the taxpayers in the Department depend upon these needed reforms            Highlights of the GAO   s investigation include                  Overall poor management and oversight by DHS of the purchase card program                 The GAO found that  of the cases it examined  45 percent of purchase card transactions failed to have written authorization and 63 percent did not have evidence that the goods and services were actually received                 A cardholder purchased 20 flat bottom boats for  280 000   twice the retail value                 A cardholder purchased a 63 inch plasma big screen TV that investigators found in its original box six months after it was purchased                 Laptop computers that were purchased but never inventoried                 A cardholder purchased meals ready to eat for a total cost of over  464 000 including  30 000 in shipping costs  Yet many of the MRE   s were never used and ended up in warehoused across the country  including one in El Paso  Texas  Had they been purchased through a known vendor or the Defense Logistics Agency  taxpayers might have been saved  100 000                A cardholder spent over  7 000 on 54 iPods for data storage even though such data could be stored using other  far less expensive alternatives        During the hearing  Norquist assured Committee members that he was working to ensure that all DHS cardholders  as well as those of agencies that fall under the jurisdiction of DHS  be required to follow guidelines set forth in a manual that is now applicable only to cardholders at DHS headquarters          In addition  Senators Collins and Lieberman pointed out that the GAO investigation demonstrates the need for the    Purchase Card Waste Elimination Act     which was coauthored by Senator Collins and cosponsored by Senator Lieberman and other Committee Members  The bill was approved last month by the Senate but has not yet been voted on in the House  The measure would require that the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  issue guidelines to assist agencies in improving the management of purchase card programs  that the General Services Administration identify additional opportunities to achieve savings  and that OMB report annually to Congress on the progress agencies are making on both of these fronts        30
