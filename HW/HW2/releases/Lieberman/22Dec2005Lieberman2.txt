D CT  today celebrated Senate passage of two bills which will provide the necessary funding to better equip America   s armed forces to fight and win the global war on terrorism   Late last night  the Senate passed the FY 2006 Defense Appropriations Conference Report by a vote of 93 0  after Lieberman led a successful fight to remove a provision added to the bill by Senate Republican leaders  which would have opened up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  for exploratory drilling   Later  the Senate passed the Department of Defense Authorization Conference Report  which approves the projects on which the appropriations money can be spent  by voice vote             As our troops gain ground in the war against terrorism  it is critical we not lose ground in our on going efforts to strengthen and transform America   s armed forces  which is why I fought so hard to remove the unnecessary and controversial ANWR provision from this bill     Lieberman said      From New London to Baghdad  I have seen first hand how our servicemen and women are fighting with brilliance and bravery   But they are being stretched  and need our support   This defense spending plan will provide them with the reinforcements     in terms of technology  training  equipment  pay and family support     they require           The new version of the FY 2006 Defense Appropriations Conference Report will now be sent back to the House of Representatives for approval   If the House approves the measure  the bill will go to the President for his signature and the senate will adjourn for the year   If the House fails to approve the conference report  the Senate will re convene at 8 p m  this evening to consider the matter         As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee  Lieberman helped craft key provisions of the Authorization Bill to better arm and protect our soldiers  sailors  airmen and Marines  to care for their families  and to benefit Connecticut   s defense workers and economy        Lieberman said the bills approved last night contain several provisions that reaffirm the Connecticut defense industry   s place as cornerstone of our national security   This funding is in addition to the  4 6 million secured in November for the construction of an indoor submarine crane facility to enable critical submarine maintenance to be conducted year round at Sub Base New London             I am pleased and proud of our success in securing significant funding increases for vital Connecticut defense priorities so far     Lieberman said      The projects funded by these bills should keep Connecticut   s defense workers busy building the best            The bills increase the federal investment in
