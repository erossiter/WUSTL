  WASHINGTON  Today Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  offered a Senate Record statement praising the Senate   s reauthorization of the historic Voting Rights Act  In a statement prior to the vote  Lieberman  a co sponsor of the reauthorization bill  cited the importance of the legislation in ensuring that every American has the right to vote   The Senate reauthorized the Voting Rights Act today by a vote of 98 to 0   The House reauthorized the legislation last week  and the bill will now go to the President to be signed into law        Lieberman   s full record statement is below          Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  on the Voting Rights Act renewal             Mr  President  I rise today to speak in support of the vital need to reauthorize key provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  among the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation Congress has ever passed            As we are approach the 41st Anniversary of the Act  perhaps it is important to remember the words of President Lyndon Johnson who signed this bill into law on Aug  6  1965  as Dr  Martin Luther King Jr  looked on           Johnson   s words spoke to all Americans     then and now     about the importance of the right to vote  He said            The central fact of American civilization     one so hard for others to understand     is that freedom and justice and the dignity of man are not just words to us   We believe in them                 Every family across this great  entire  searching land will live stronger in liberty  will live more splendid in expectation  and will be prouder to be American because of the Act you have passed and that I will sign today              Now is the time to renew that pledge for freedom by reauthorizing the Voting Rights Act and I am proud to cosponsor this legislation           I want to thank Chairman Specter and Ranking Member Leahy for their efforts to report this legislation out of their Committee with unanimous support yesterday   I hope the full Senate will show the same level of support when the bill is voted on this afternoon           The importance of renewing this Act was driven home to me yesterday when  like many of my colleagues  I met with a delegation from my state   s chapter of the NAACP     here for the annual NAACP meeting and to visit with their Congressional delegation           The meeting was not only a wonderful opportunity to see about 40 old friends  it was a demonstration of the fundamental Constitutional principle that powers our Republic     the right to petition the government about the issues that matter most            Of course  it strikes me that 40 years ago  while senators on the floor of this very chamber debated the original Voting Rights Act  some of those constituents    own parents and grandparents could not even cast a vote without fear for their own lives   And that was for one reason     because they were black   Those were tragic times for America           I remember my own trip to Mississippi in 1963  as a senior in college when I joined with friends on a trip to Mississippi to draw attention to the cause of enfranchising African American voters   Our goal  like others who made similar journeys  was to support the fight of the young heroes of the civil rights movement     black men and women who sat at lunch counters  who refused to move to the back of the buses  who peacefully but powerfully demanded the most basic rights every American deserves     including the right to cast a vote                   I like to believe our trip to Mississippi was a small step in the march toward equality that Dr  King and other civil rights leaders  like Representative John Lewis from Georgia  who sat at those lunch counters  pressed upon the American conscience in those heavy days          But my meeting with the Connecticut chapter of the NAACP reminded me the march toward equal rights is not over           In my meeting  one woman asked     Why does Congress even have to extend the Voting Rights Act  Why is the law not permanent                I explained that Congress passes legislation that automatically expires because it is important to assess whether a law is working as intended  whether it needs changing to address new concerns  or whether it is needed at all           Thanks to the Voting Rights Act of 1965  every American now has the opportunity to vote and any American can come to Washington to meet with his or her senators  and I am grateful so many people do   Across the country  the number of African American elected officials has increased from just 300 in 1964 to more than 9 thousand today  including 43 members of Congress          But with some regret  we must conclude that the Voting Rights Act is as necessary today as it has ever been   For as long as the law continues to be violated  we still need that law           Since 1982  when the Act was last extended  there have been more than 1000 complaints of violations of the Voting Rights Act all across the country   Just last month  the Supreme Court struck down parts of the redistricting plan in Texas because the court ruled that the plan disenfranchised large numbers of Hispanic voters              As long as there are efforts to dilute the votes of some or to make it more difficult for any of our fellow citizens to vote  we need the Voting Rights Act and the provisions that are set to expire next year           I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today because the march toward equality must continue   But I look forward to the day when it is no longer needed because we have achieved the ideal where each and every vote cast in this great democracy of ours has the same voice and carries the same weight and that everyone who wants to vote can do so with ease and without fear of discrimination             I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation today because the civil rights march must continue  because we cannot confuse progress with victory           As Martin Luther King said on the front steps of the Lincoln Memorial  a speech I heard in person  we can never be satisfied until every citizen can vote and every citizen has something to vote for           And when that day comes     when we have achieved full voting rights and civil rights for all Americans     Dr  King can look down from Heaven     his mission finally fulfilled     and call out           Free at last  Free at last  Thank God almighty  they are free at last              Mr  President  I yield the floor           30
