WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today expressed his deep disappointment that the Senate defeated an amendment he co sponsored that would strip language from the Budget Resolution that allows oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge   The Cantwell Amendment failed by a vote of 49 to 51   In a floor statement before the vote Lieberman appealed to his colleagues to meet their moral obligation to protect the Arctic           For me this all began at the beginning with the Bible and with the instruction that God gave to Adam and Eve that they should both work and guard the Garden of Eden  which is to say that they should not only develop and cultivate it  but also protect it     Lieberman said             We come to this day with a judgment having been made   Ninety five percent of the North Slope in this part of Alaska is open for oil exploration  for potential drilling   We drew a line   Our predecessors drew a line   This five percent should be preserved as a wildlife refuge  a small piece of Eden  preserved in this magnificent state  And now  we are going to break that line   We are going to destroy that remaining part and have an inevitable negative consequence  both in the wilderness and also in the native people that depend on it and whose heritage it is part of             Lieberman also objected to the precedent set by sneaking the drilling provision into the budget      It does set a precedent where anything else where the generation of revenues is merely incidental  whether on environmental matters or anything else  and something that hasn   t been able to obtain the super majority at 60 will be able to be adopted by 51 when its put on a budget resolution           The full text of Lieberman   s floor statement is below        Floor Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman      March 16  2005       Mr  President  I come to this debate with some long history here  as other members of the Senate have as well   This was one of the reasons why I actually ran for the Senate  I was so troubled by the plans to drill for oil in the Arctic Refuge it was an issue in my 1988 campaign   I   ve been battling this ever since        Why does it matter so much to me  Sure it relates to our national energy policy   Does it develop enough oil to really matter to price or availability  No   Can we drill our way out of our energy dependence on foreign oil  No   We   ve got to think and innovate and entrepreneur ize our way out of it  But honestly for me this all began at the beginning with the Bible and with the instruction that God gave to Adam and Eve that they should both work and guard the Garden of Eden  which is to say that they should not only develop and cultivate it  but also protect it  We are here for a short time   The Psalms tell us that the earth is the Lord and the fullness thereof  We   ve got a responsibility to protect the beauty of nature that has been given to us   Some places  for the generation that will follow us  to work and to guard        Now let me come right to the North Slope  We come to this day with a judgment having been made   Ninety five percent of the North Slope in this part of Alaska is open for oil exploration  for potential drilling   We drew a line   Our predecessors drew a line   This five percent should be preserved as a wildlife refuge  a small piece of Eden  preserved in this magnificent state  And now  we are going to break that line   We are going to destroy that remaining part and have an inevitable negative consequence  both in the wilderness and also in the native people that depend on it and whose heritage it is part of          We go back and forth about which side the native people are on  Let me just submit for the record  ask unanimous consent  a letter from Robert Thompson  Tactovic Artic Adventures  containing a petition drive and it has secured 57 signatures from the people in Tactovic  likely a majority of the voting adults there support Senator Cantwell   s proposal         But let me come to the process while I   m on the Bible   I was taught as a kid those famous words     Justice  justice shall thou seek      And why the double mention of justice   I was told     You have got to pursue what you believe is just in a just way      Now we have different idea of what a good result is here  but I want to speak to the method and that is to do this as part of a budget resolution which clearly is an end run around the existing rules   It end runs the healthy  fair fight we   ve been having about whether oil drilling should be allowed in Arctic Refuge  and the 60 vote requirement has stopped that from happening  That is why the filibuster is there  People talk about the nuclear option with regards to the judicial nomination   We have been looking over in this direction   The nuclear weapons have been fired from over here   This is the nuclear option   It sets a precedent   It allows anything that generates revenues  whether incidental or at the heart of the purpose  to be attached to the budget resolution and only require 51 votes         Now listen to the advocates my dear colleagues  respected friends  of the drilling in the Arctic Refuge   They are not talking  really  about generation of revenue as its main purpose   They are talking about provision of oil  provision of jobs  energy independence   We can debate that  but the revenues obtained here are incidental   Our rules make clear when that is so this kind of provision should not be on this budget bill   And it does set a precedent where anything else where the generation of revenues is merely incidental  whether on environmental matters or anything else  and something that hasn   t been able to obtain the super majority at 60 will be able to be adopted by 51 when its put on a budget resolution         Incidentally what effect does it have   The budget process here in Congress is effectively broken down   We don   t pass budget resolutions any more  And if we start putting  what I believe  respectively  are extraneous amendments  substantive battles  on the budget resolution it is going to be harder and harder to follow the orderly budget process that the law and the rules provide to us         So for reasons of substance and reasons of procedure  I ask my colleagues to support the Cantwell amendment  I thank the chair  and I yield the floor         30
