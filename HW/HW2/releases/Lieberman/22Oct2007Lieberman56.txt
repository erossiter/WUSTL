awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his tireless work to call attention to one of the most serious threats we face  global warming     Vice President Gore has sounded the alarm  now we must heed his call     For more than a decade  I have worked with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to convince other senators that we must act to reduce U S  pollution enough to avert catastrophic global warming  without harming America s economy or imposing hardship on our citizens  Each year  we have had increasing bipartisan support      This week  John Warner  R Va   and I introduced America s Climate Security Act   a bill that will meet those goals   along with a bipartisan group of co sponsors     With all the irrefutable evidence that climate change is real  dangerous and proceeding faster than many scientists predicted  this is the year for Congress to move this critical legislation  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change   the worldwide consortium of scientists that shared the Nobel with Vice President Gore   concluded there is a greater than 90 percent chance that greenhouse gases released by human activities including burning oil in cars and coal in power plants are causing most of the observed global warming     The U S  Fish and Wildlife Service identified a warming climate  and the resulting melting of sea ice  as the reason polar bears may be threatened as a species  The U S  Center for Disease Control s National Center for Environmental Health cited global warming as the largest looming public health challenge  And President Bush called global warming a serious challenge that we need to confront      Indeed  if we fail to start substantially reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the next couple of years  we risk catastrophic damage  Insect borne diseases such as malaria will spike as tropical ecosystems expand  hotter air will exacerbate the pollution that sends children to the hospital with asthma attacks  food insecurity from shifting agricultural zones will spark border wars  and storms and coastal flooding from sea level rise will cause mortality and dislocation      Our bill works in several ways to reverse the destructive impact of global warming     The greenhouse gas emissions cap in the climate security act covers electric power  transportation and manufacturing sources that account for 75 percent of the these emissions in the United States      In addition to tightening emissions cap standards annually on electric power  transportation and manufacturing sources  the climate security act increases energy efficiency requirements for appliances and buildings in order to curb commercial and residential emissions that are not covered by the cap      Together  the gradually tightening cap and the supplemental provisions in the act are projected to reduce total U S  greenhouse gas emissions by as much as 19 percent below the 2005 level in 2020 and by as much as 63 percent below the 2005 level in 2050      In July 2007  the Environmental Protection Agency found that if the U S  achieves emissions reductions at that level  then   making conservative assumptions about the pace of emissions reductions in the rest of the world   the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will remain below 500 parts per million at the end of this century  According to the scientists of the IPCC  keeping the concentration below 500 ppm will avoid a high risk of global warming that would cause severe effects      Using market forces  the climate security act controls compliance costs by allowing companies to trade  save and borrow emission allowances  and by allowing them to generate credits when they invest in uncapped businesses  farms and other emitters to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions or capture and store greenhouse gases  By creating a market for pollution reductions  the bill would not only lower costs  but spur technological innovation that would boost our economy     From the very start of the program  the legislation holds 55 percent of the emission allowances back from emitters and instead uses those allowances to accelerate the deployment of climate friendly technologies  to help low income energy consumers and for other important public policies  Within 25 years of the start of the program  100 percent of the allowances are held back from emitters and used for those public policies     Congress must move forward  Democrats will not enact a strong climate law without the help and support of their Republican colleagues  Working in a bipartisan fashion  Congress will enact a law that curbs global warming even as it strengthens the economy     Joseph Lieberman is an independent Democratic senator from Connecticut
