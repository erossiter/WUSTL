    WASHINGTON   Senators Susan Collins  R Me   and Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  are urging the Administration to Akeep the war on terror on track by fulfilling its obligations under the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004       In a letter to White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card  the Senators asked the Administration to redouble its efforts to meet a number of report and implementation deadlines required by the law passed last year with overwhelming support from the Congress  the White House  and the 9 11 Commission        The legislation we enacted has the potential to substantially enhance our defenses against terrorist attacks  but only if the Executive Branch works with Congress to implement effectively its provisions   the Senators wrote    In a number of cases agencies have already missed implementation deadlines contained in the Act   We regard this as a troubling sign  especially as many important provisions are expected to be completed by June 15  2005  and in subsequent months        The Senators expressed concern about the Administration s recent steps in establishing an Information Sharing Environment intended to improve cross agency communications about terrorists and they noted that the decision to place the ISE program manager in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  rather than establishing it as a government wide position  could undermine the initiative  And they noted a series of reports  strategic plans  and preliminary actions whose deadlines have come and gone   Among them are                 The National Transportation Strategy                The first step toward streamlining the federal security clearance process                A number of port security strategic plans                Aviation security staffing standards                A baggage screening cost sharing plan                 Three reports on diplomatic initiatives to root out terrorists       On June 15  the Administration will be required to complete a series of strategic plans vital to terrorist travel  border security  transportation security  and information sharing           As we saw with 9 11  in the war on terrorism delay can be a form of failure   the Senators wrote  AInitial stumbles in implementing new programs can be corrected  but problems often snowball if neglected    We urge the Administration to devote high level attention to ensuring the war on terrorism remains on track                   Following is a copy of the Senators letter          June 10  2005      Andrew H  Card  Jr    Chief of Staff   The White House   1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW   Washington  DC 20500       Dear Mr  Card        We are writing to express our concern about Administration delays in complying with mandates in the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  P L  108 458   which President Bush signed into law on December 17  2004   The legislation we enacted has the potential to substantially enhance our defenses against terrorist attacks  but only if the Executive Branch works with Congress to implement effectively its provisions   In a number of cases agencies have already missed implementation deadlines contained in the Act   We regard this as a troubling sign  especially as many important provisions are expected to be completed by June 15  2005  and in subsequent months   We request the Administration re double its efforts to ensure that the Act s goal of better protecting our nation  a vision shared by Congress  the 9 11 Commission  and the Administration  is fully realized        We have written previously concerning several important statutory provisions whose implementation is overdue   The development of a National Strategy for Transportation Security was a central recommendation of the 9 11 Commission  and Congress required the strategy to be completed by April 1  2005   The Department of Homeland Security  DHS  has indicated it needs more time to complete this critical effort   We expect DHS to promptly produce the much needed roadmap for improving and coordinating transportation security across all modes       We have also written to urge speedier implementation of an effective Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board   On June 10  2005  the Administration nominated or appointed five board members  however  we remain concerned about the insufficient budget request for the Board and look forward to your response on this issue       Recent developments have called into question the Administration s strategy to execute the provisions of the Act relating to information sharing   The Act requires the rapid implementation of an information sharing environment  ISE  to facilitate the governmentwide sharing of information about terrorist threats   Based on a key recommendation of the 9 11 Commission  the creation of the ISE envisions an ambitious and coordinated effort by myriad agencies involved in the war on terrorism   Important mandates related to the ISE will be due in mid June  requiring the ISE program manager to report on his plans for addressing key technological and policy issues  to complete a review of the federal government s data sharing capabilities  and to establish electronic directory services to help locate information about terrorist threats         These mandates  and the many that follow  will require that the program manager work with agencies across the federal government and with state and local officials   We are concerned that the recent decision to locate the ISE s program manager within the Office of the Director of National Intelligence  ODNI   where he will report to the Director of National Intelligence  will impede the development of this coordinated effort  furthermore  the decision could undermine Section 1016 of the Act  which states that the program manager is to have and exercise governmentwide authority    Because of the placement within the ODNI  the program manager is likely to face greater challenges in implementing an information sharing network that includes agencies outside the intelligence community   Indeed  we question whether the ISE program manager can provide the effective leadership and governmentwide management required of him under these circumstances   If the Administration does not commit ample resources and high level leadership to the effort  the ISE will fail   The Administration should demonstrate its commitment to effective information sharing by reconsidering its decision to place the program manager in the ODNI  and by clearly establishing the program manager s strong lines of authority over all relevant agencies       In addition  a variety of other provisions from the Act have come due without adequate implementation by the Administration   For example  Section 3001 b  of the Act requires the President to designate by March 15  2005  an Executive Branch agency to oversee the security clearance process   The 9 11 Commission identified the unwieldy system for granting security clearances as a threat to national security   Establishing uniformity and efficiency in our security clearance process will be a major challenge  and it s disappointing that the Administration is already well behind schedule on this first step       Section 4023 of the Act mandated that by March 15  2005  DHS develop standards for determining the aviation security staffing for all airports at which screening is required   These standards will be an essential determinant for efficient and effective deployment of screeners  yet we are unaware of any progress the Department has made towards completing the standards   Under Section 4019 d  the Department was also required to submit to Congress a cost sharing study that would propose an equitable division of costs for deploying in line baggage screening equipment  reflecting the benefits to the government and the private sector of the equipment   The provision could free up badly needed homeland security funds for other missions  but its implementation is now months overdue   Under Section 4072 the Department was required to submit by March 15  2005  a series of strategic plans and reports relevant to port security  including a comprehensive management plan for the Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  program   We understand that the plans and reports required by Section 4072 have not been completed       The 9 11 Commission recognized that the fight against Islamic terrorism starts overseas  and the Act implemented the Commission s recommendations with a number of provisions establishing diplomacy initiatives and targeting terrorist havens   Unfortunately  the President has failed to submit a report  due last February under Section 7104 i   on the Administration s efforts to encourage other countries to participate in expanded peacekeeping and security operations in Afghanistan   Similarly  the Departments of Defense and State were required to submit a report under Section 7104 j  on illegal drug production in Afghanistan and its relationship to terrorist organizations by mid April  2005   This report has not been submitted yet   The State Department has also not submitted to Congress a report  due May 31  2005  on the feasibility of coordinating with other countries to share information on lost and stolen passports  as a possible tool in tracking the travel of suspected terrorists       Congress  the Administration  and the 9 11 Commission all understood that the war on terrorism must be fought simultaneously and effectively on many fronts   That s why the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act directs actions and reforms in so many components of our government  on an accelerated timetable   There are many challenges in simultaneously implementing these anti terrorism initiatives  but the consequences of failure are unthinkable    And as we saw with 9 11  in the war on terrorism delay can be a form of failure   Initial stumbles in implementing new programs can be corrected  but problems often snowball if neglected   On June 15  2005  the Administration will be required to complete a series of strategic plans vital to transportation security  terrorist travel  border security  and information sharing   We urge the Administration to devote high level attention to ensuring the war on terrorism remains on track       Sincerely       Susan
