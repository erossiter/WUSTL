                                                                                                                                         Trascript of Senator Lieberman s Testimony Before BRAC Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            SENATOR LIEBERMAN   Members of the    commission  Chairman Principi  General Newton     General Turner  Congressman Bilbray  Secretary    Skinner   I know we re coming to the end of our    time   I want to briefly summarize   I promise you    that I will not indulge myself in the God given    right every senator has to filibuster today   I want to thank you for your attention to    the argument that we have made on behalf of    Submarine Base New London and the Bradley Air    National Guard base   I want to thank you more    generally for the seriousness of purpose with which    you have gone forward  for the independence of    spirit  for the transparency and openness of the    process that you are conducting   It is clear to me    and all of us that you understand the enormous    responsibility that you have under the law to    determine which of the military installations the       Pentagon has recommended for closure you will allow    to be closed  and which you will stop from being    closed in the interest of our national security  The power you have literally is    life and death power over these military    facilities  and perhaps  Commissioners  that s why    today  in summarizing and closing our argument  I    feel less like the senator from Connecticut than a    defense attorney  The prosecutor here  the Pentagon  has    recommended a death sentence for Submarine Base New    London   You are the jury   And I urge you to apply    the same kind of standards a jury would in a    capital case  that to close this extraordinary    national asset  never to be opened again  you    should feel  beyond a reasonable doubt  that you    will not thereby jeopardize America s security   I feel very strongly that if you take the    eight criteria that the law sets out to guide your    judgments  that today Mr  Markowicz  Mr  Stern  the    state commmissioners  the others    I ve been    referring to Mr  Markowicz   I think a few of you    were in my generation   Maybe you remember Joe    Friday  Dragnet  just the facts   I think with the    facts that have been set before you today  we have       demonstrated that the Pentagon underestimates the    military value of Submarine Base New London     underestimates the cost of closing it  particularly    the environmental costs  and grossly underestimates    the cost of relocating this base   Remember  this    is not a situation where you ve got two or three    bases with redundant facilities so you decide to    consolidate in one or two    A decision to close Submarine Base New    London requires the relocation of that base     including its extraordinary Submarine School       given no points  as Mr  Markowicz pointed out       unfairly no points in the Pentagon s military    evaluation  Members of the commission  I believe that    we have put so many holes into the Pentagon s case    for closing Submarine Base New London that it looks    like a piece of Swiss cheese with more holes than    cheese left in it   I don t believe the Pentagon    has sustained the burden of proof it has under the    law   I believe we ve shown clear substantial    deviation  on not just one point or two  but    several points from the criteria that the law sets    out   Your decision is final   It is terminal     This is not like a family leaving a home for a       summer vacation and turning the water off  knowing    when you come back you can turn the water back on     You turn this base off  it s never going to be    rebuilt again anywhere   Why take the risk   Why    take the risk in the middle of the global war on    terror   Why take the risk as we watch China rising    as a submarine power  soon to have    apparently    having more subs out there than we do   Why take    the risk as we watch Russia resurging as a    submarine power   Why base this judgment on a    number of    an estimate of a submarine fleet which    has the Government Accountability Office    not    just our witnesses    the Government Accountability    Office says the basic premise here on which the    Navy based its recommendation to close submarine    base 11    37 or 41 subs is unsettled  unsettled by    the President  unsettled by the Congress    A final word to each one of you   I know    some of you personally   It s an honor to know you     I know the records for the rest of you  and I know    that each and every one of you have given most of    your adult lives to service for your nation   I    know your commitment to America s fighting men and    women in uniform   I know your commitment to our    national security   I know you understand the       importance of the relationship between our military    and the people in this great democracy of ours   I    have confidence  therefore  that you have noted    that the impact of the Department of Defense    recommendations this time around in BRAC would be    to remove the operational Navy from New England  to    break the contact between the people of New England    and the Navy with  I believe  dire consequences for    improvement and equally dire consequences for the    place of the military in the minds of the people    all over America  which is so fundamental to our    democracy   I am confident in all I know about each    one of you that you will not allow this base to be    closed because you have reasonable doubts about    whether it is the right thing to do for your    country     And so  with thanks for your attention  we    rest our case    not just for Submarine Base New    London and the Bradley Air National Guard  but for    America s future national security    in your    thoughtful  responsible  and patriotic hands     Thank you very  very much    30
