                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday delivered the following statement at the Committee   s 17th hearing on the preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina        Thanks Madame Chairman   Today   s hearing     our 17th in the Committee   s investigation     offers us an opportunity to examine a critical question about what role do we want our military to have in dealing with the most catastrophic of national disasters     whether natural or inflicted by terrorists   The answer to that question has both practical and constitutional implications       Despite its designation as a supporting agency under the National Response Plan  the Defense Department   s preparations and initial response to Hurricane Katrina were unfortunately as passive as most other federal agencies  But when the military did engage  it engaged with full force and great effectiveness   It took on the responsibilities of many other agencies at different levels of our government  By Thursday of the week of landfall  FEMA essentially turned over its logistical obligations to the military  resulting in a  1 billion mission assignment  the largest in the history of FEMA mission assignments       I frequently say that the United States has the best military in the history of the world     because of the men and women who comprise it  but also because we invest in them and it  In the days after Hurricane Katrina  we are reminded again and again of the wisdom of this investment   The military   s contribution to the rescue of the communities along the Gulf Coast that were hit by Katrina is yet another testament to the fact that we not only have extraordinary men and women serving in the military but the Defense Department alone has the best communications equipment  the logistical ability  the helicopters  the planes  the boats  the medical teams  and other resources necessary to respond to a catastrophe   The question is when and how we use those assets       Today  we will hear from two panels of witnesses  the senior uniformed officers who led the operations on the ground in Louisiana and New Orleans and the top civilians and uniformed officers who set the policies and implemented the full military response       With a few individual exceptions  the Pentagon   s preparations for this cataclysmic storm in the days before landfall were slow and unsure  Situational awareness was poor  and the Pentagon was hesitant to move necessary assets unless they were requested  Our military is superb at planning for different threat situations   But it appears that the Pentagon did not do much planning in advance of Katrina to anticipate the challenges of an    incident of national significance    as defined under the National Response Plan        On Tuesday of Katrina   s week one  the military recognized that the rescue of the Gulf Coast was uncertain and foundering under the administration of the Department of Homeland Security   We are especially indebted to Deputy Secretary of Defense Gordon England  who  because he was watching Katrina   s impact on television  concluded that troops and equipment needed to be deployed immediately without the normal paperwork   We also thank Lt  General Blum for orchestrating the deployment of thousands of National Guard troops to the Gulf Coast  and to Admiral Keating for ordering the deployment of 22 000 soldiers  sailors  airmen  Marines and the materiel to support them         We are also indebted to the men and women in the trenches  Under the most difficult of circumstance  Major General Landreneau ably led the Louisiana and other National Guard troops  which swelled from a force of 5 000 to an eventual force of 30 000 literally from every state in the union  Lt  General Honore is from Louisiana and had experienced the 2004 hurricane season   As Katrina approached  he was at his command in Atlanta  he followed the weather forecast   He asked the Pentagon to identify equipment and assets he knew he would need   He went to Louisiana and he filled a large and visible leadership role when he arrived in New Orleans  Mayor Nagin likened him to John Wayne   General Honore   s conduct is a model of what the public seeks from a leader in a time of crisis  His forceful and decisive manner reassured all who saw him  as a city plunged deeper and deeper into crisis   He took command of the active duty troops and bridged the gap between them and the Guard       But the power of your personality  General Honore  also highlights the critical constitutional issues at stake here  How much authority should the Title X  regular military have in domestic affairs   We   ve heard much of Posse Comitatus   And this country has a strong aversion to military control in civilian settings  These are difficult questions that must be studied in a thoughtful manner  and resolved in advance  not in the heat of crisis  as appears to have happened here        As we learned from Governors Blanco and Barbour last week  when disaster strikes a state  no governor will willingly cede authority over their National Guard to the federal government  But what if there is a catastrophe so great that the National Guard is as overwhelmed as the New Orleans police and firefighters were  What if  God Forbid  the disaster is an unexpected terrorist attack  without the warning the weather experts gave us about Hurricane Katrina  Is federalization then necessary  to bring all the resources of the military to bear   Katrina showed us that we need to define where that line is drawn       Governor Blanco told us of the extreme pressure she felt from the White House to federalize her National Guard troops  She said she thought the pressure resulted from political considerations rather than military ones  calling it  and I quote here     posturing instead of a real solution      End quote  I hope Lt  General Blum  chief of the National Guard Bureau  can help us better understand what happened and why       Katrina also revealed some uncertainties and tensions between the Pentagon and NORTHCOM and the National Guard Bureau regarding the military   s role in domestic crises   Our Committee has learned through interviews and documents of some disagreements about the degree to which the Defense Department should operate on U S  soil   And these disagreements may have limited the military   s response time and effectiveness in this case because of the initial hesitation to deploy active duty troops and to pre position assets before Hurricane Katrina made landfall          Once again  the fictional Hurricane Pam exercise made clear that local and state resources would be immediately overwhelmed by a Category 3 or higher storm  which Katrina was   The National Response Plan was in place to guide all federal agencies in the event of such a catastrophe   But instead of using the NRP to address in advance these matters related to a catastrophic event  resolve bureaucratic differences  and construct a comprehensive action plan  the federal government appeared to be operating on the fly  and the roles of the military     National Guard and active duty     appear to have been part of a response that was cobbled together as the week went on   However successful the execution proved to be later  that is no way to manage a crisis of this magnitude  It is not what we envisioned with the creation of the Homeland Security Department   In the end  the lack of a plan led to unnecessary confusion  unnecessary bureaucratic struggles  and more human suffering than should have been  This hearing must help us resolve these questions so that we do better the next time  when we may not have advance notice of the coming catastrophe         30
