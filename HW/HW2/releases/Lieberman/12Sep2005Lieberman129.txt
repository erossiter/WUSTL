rate increase

delegation today sent a letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Joseph T  Kelliher to express their strong opposition to the application of the Locational Installed Capacity  LICAP  rate schedule in Connecticut and in the New England region  that would artificially increase the rates that consumers and businesses in Connecticut and across New England will pay for electricity   The delegation also expressed its support for the appeal of this rate increase decision filed by State of Connecticut and others   The full text of the letter is below         September 12  2005         The Honorable Joseph T  Kelliher      Chairman      Federal Energy Regulatory Commission      888 1st St  NE      Washington  DC  20426       Dear Chairman Kelliher                    We are writing to express our strong opposition to the application of the Locational Installed Capacity  LICAP  rate schedule in Connecticut and in the New England region  and in support of the appeal  by the State of Connecticut and other appellants  of the Administrative Law Judge   s approval in this matter                    LICAP represents a fatally flawed policy  imposing unnecessary  staggering costs on Connecticut businesses and consumers with no promise of achieving its avowed objective of stimulating investment in new generation capacity in areas of need                    Current estimates place the cost of LICAP at  3 7 billion for Connecticut alone and  13 billion across New England   These costs will come in addition to rising energy costs consumers are all but sure to face as a result of increases in natural gas and home heating oil costs     increases now magnified by the damage inflicted by Hurricane Katrina on oil and natural gas facilities in the Gulf Coast region                      This money will flow from ratepayers    pockets to those of electricity generators     including existing generators that have already been remunerated fully for capacity costs and stranded costs   There is no indication that these additional funds will be used to accomplish the stated goal of LICAP     building new generation capacity   In fact  there is little to suggest that it is electricity rates by themselves that are the key to inducing investment in new generation   In contrast  it appears that other factors  such as transmission capacity  that create key obstacles to investment in new generation   At present  transmission system upgrades are not scheduled for completion until 2009 or 2010  even if the new rates did create an incentive effect  companies would have no means to respond to those incentives for several more years  Thus  the result of LICAP will be simply to damage the economy of Connecticut and New England while accomplishing little beyond the further enrichment of existing electricity generators                    That is why the comprehensive federal energy legislation enacted just last month included Sense of the Congress language directing FERC to consider the New England Governors    objections that LICAP would not provide adequate assurance that LICAP would yield the necessary electric generation capacity or reliability  while imposing high costs on consumers and threatening significant negative economic impact                    To the extent that Connecticut   s economy may demand a combination of new generation  increased transmission capacity and enhanced energy efficiency and conservation  we fully support the State   s request for additional full hearings to evaluate alternative approaches that can address these needs cost effectively                    In addition to expressing support for the submissions of the State of Connecticut in this matter  we  as legislators  are also obliged to examine the central policy issues raised by LICAP and other ratemaking approaches  such as Locational Marginal Pricing  LMP   now being practiced by Independent System Operators  with the support or acquiescence of the FERC   Our preliminary review suggests that current ratemaking approaches may be uneconomic and may fail to reflect sound market based principles  resulting in unnecessary  high costs to electricity ratepayers  not only in New England  but elsewhere in the country   As a result  we and our Congressional colleagues  whose states face similar economic challenges because of these ratemaking approaches may be forced to take up this issue via legislation     especially at a time when the issue of rising energy costs is becoming more and more critical to the public and political leaders                    We respectfully urge you to grant the relief sought by the State of Connecticut in this matter                    Thank you for your consideration in this matter                                                                      Sincerely          Chris Dodd      UNITED STATES SENATOR        Joe Lieberman      UNITED STATES SENATOR        Nancy Johnson      US
