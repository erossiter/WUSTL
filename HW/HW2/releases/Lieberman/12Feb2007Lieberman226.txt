                                                                                                                                           Munich  Germany  In an address to the Munich Conference on Security Policy Sunday  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  responded to President Putin s comments on Saturday to the conference   Senator Lieberman stated   President Putin said yesterday that there is  one single center of power  in the world today  He is correct  But that power is not the United States  It is the power of freedom       Freedom speaks all languages and knows no borders  Walls and prisons cannot contain it  and totalitarianism cannot defeat it       But the cause of freedom does not belong to one nation alone  On the contrary  the greatest triumphs of democracy in the twentieth century were achieved by the strength of our alliances  including particularly NATO        In his speech  Senator Lieberman stressed the importance of ideas in the battle against radical Islamists  Senator Lieberman remarked        Today  a vast number of nations in the world find themselves part of a global struggle with Islamist extremism  It stretches from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq  from the cities of Western Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia  Although this enemy has headquarters in Waziristan and Teheran  it is neither a monolithic movement nor a single organization that can be isolated and destroyed by military force alone  Terrorism is its chosen method  but not its primary motivation       What we are fighting is an ideology   the totalitarian ideology of radical Islam  as brutal and hostile to personal freedom as the fascism and communism we fought and defeated in the last century       To prevail against an ideology requires more than battlefield victories  it demands we fight  and win  a larger  longer  harder war of ideas and values  competing with Islamist extremism for the hearts and minds of Muslim men and women across the greater Middle East and throughout the world  including here in Europe        Senator Lieberman also recommended broadening membership in NATO   I want to ask you to consider today if it is now time not just for a transatlantic organization capable of acting globally  but a more formal global alliance that binds together democratic nations  irrespective of where they are located         NATO is the gold standard for the security of free nations  but freedom s cause does not and cannot end at Europe s or America s borders  On the contrary  as our current struggle against radical Islam is global  our alliance must be global  In the Black Sea region  in the Middle East  in Central Asia  and beyond  NATO must be prepared not only to act  I ask that we also begin to consider welcoming new members  beyond Europe  that are willing to meet the high political and military standards of our alliance        Senator Lieberman also challenged the critics of America s role in the world        As we have seen in Iraq  America is capable of mistakes large and small  but we are a principled nation  not a pariah nation       Surely principled in the sense that America remains the indispensable nation in the fight for freedom throughout the world  precisely because we are willing to put our powers   economic  diplomatic  and  yes  military   in pursuit of our principles        Below is the entire prepared for delivery text of Senator Lieberman s speech to the conference          Distinguished delegates       As the discussions at this important conference have made dramatically clear  we gather at a time of grave and deepening dangers to our community of nations  Since meeting here a year ago  there have been disappointing developments in the war we are in with radical Islam and more directly  the civil war within Islam  against radical Islam  The insurgency in Afghanistan has strengthened  The situation in Iraq has grown worse  Iran continues to develop its nuclear weapons program  Despite hopes of a thaw in the political order across the greater Middle East  the forces of extremism are surging now in Lebanon and in Palestine        In the face of these setbacks  the clarion calls for democratization heard just a short while ago have grown quieter  Where once we spoke confidently about more political and economic liberty as the best response to the violence of radical Islam  we now hear far less of that   Others go further  They look at the violence in Iraq and say that not only has democracy failed to be the solution  it is a significant cause of the problem  They look at the election of Hamas in the Palestinian Territories and conclude that the people of the Middle East are not ready for the democracy so much of the world enjoys    This morning I want to explain why I believe these arguments  and the approach they counsel  are mistaken  why they misunderstand the nature of the terrorist threat we face  and ignore the larger war of ideas we must fight and win    Today  a vast number of nations in the world find themselves part of a global struggle within Islam  It stretches from the mountains of Afghanistan to the deserts of Iraq  from the cities of Europe to the jungles of Southeast Asia  Although this enemy has headquarters in Waziristan and Teheran  it is neither a monolithic movement nor a single organization that can be isolated and destroyed by military force alone  Terrorism is its chosen method  but not its primary motivation         What we are fighting is an ideology   the totalitarian ideology of radical Islam  as brutal and hostile to personal freedom as the fascism and communism we fought and defeated in the last century         To prevail against an ideology requires more than battlefield victories  it demands that we fight  and win  a larger  longer  harder war of values and ideas  competing with Islamist extremism for the hearts and minds of Muslim men and women across the greater Middle East and throughout the world  including right here in Europe        Radical Islam has positioned itself carefully in this ideological contest  It has effectively exploited a deep reserve of anger  frustration  and disappointment about the status quo  It has tapped into local grievances   about economic inequality and corruption  about political oppression and disenfranchisement   and attempted to globalize them         In this sense  the war of ideas I am talking about is an asymmetric war  against us  which goes around our vast military capabilities  The movement of ideas cannot be tracked like the march of armies  the shipment of weapons  or the flow of money  Ideology cannot be intercepted by force of arms  And when ideas clash  the outcome is both unpredictable and opaque  unfolding on a battlefield where culture  psychology  history  religion  and education provide the most critical terrain         My point is that to defeat the ideology of radical Islam we must not just fight for our security against terrorism  we must argue for our ideas and values against the totalitarian ideology that animates terrorism  To discredit a totalitarian vision committed to the use of violence  we must offer our own  more powerful shared vision of freedom  justice  and opportunity         These values are not just Western values  They are universal values  In fact  of the three largest democratic states in the world today  two are not Western   namely India and Indonesia  No single culture or civilization has a monopoly on the principles of liberal democracy  as their advance around so much of the globe  including Europe  has shown during the past half century    They are  however  the ideals that have guided much of American foreign policy from the inception of our republic  and they are the ideals that animate America s most important and lasting relationships in the world today  They are at the core of the transatlantic alliance  They are at the core of the global partnerships we are building in this new century  And so  too  they belong at the center of the long  difficult global struggle ahead against Islamist extremism        We cannot win this larger war of ideas with totalitarianism  however  if we lose confidence in our own democratic values  That is why I believe the backlash against democracy promotion at the core of our war against Islamist extremism is so misguided and self defeating    After opening the door to greater political freedoms and economic opportunities in the Muslim world  the worst thing we could do today is to slam it shut  Democracy means more than elections  But it also means  at times  that people we do not like   and who do not like us   will win an election  Every nation s circumstances are different  and every nation s path to freedom is unique  But the presumption should always be against those who argue in favor of the  stability  of dictators and against the basic rights of mankind  That was certainly the presumption that formed the foundation of NATO at the dawn of the Cold War and that has sustained our alliance         Nearly sixty years after its creation  it is easy to forget just how audacious an idea the transatlantic alliance was at the time it was proposed  The United States had a long tradition of avoiding entangling alliances  The countries of Western Europe had a recurring history of falling into war with one another         And yet  the founders of our alliance believed they could transcend these differences and divisions   with an architecture designed not merely around our shared security interests  but also around our shared values  Thus it presented something new  a promise not just of security  but of a better  freer way of life  In fact it promised security because of our shared values       Our present war of ideas demands boldness in equal measure  The fact is  we lack the means to wage a long  ideological struggle in the Muslim world  I believe that our vulnerability in this regard lies not in the content of our convictions  but in the constraints of our institutions         We need new capabilities to win this war of ideas  and that means dramatic reforms  Many of these reforms must involve innovative changes in the way our governments are organized  improving our capacity to reach out and make real the practical dividends of democracy to millions of Muslims worldwide         It also may require bold changes to our international institutions  NATO itself is in the midst of a transformation  from a regional defense pact to a global security organization  capable of operating out of area  As we discussed yesterday  the alliance has assumed new responsibilities over the past decade   first in Bosnia  then in Kosovo  and now in Afghanistan  It is entering into new dialogues and partnerships with nations in the Mediterranean  the Persian Gulf  and the Pacific  And it has welcomed numerous new members   with more soon to follow        I believe  however  we must begin to think about going further        I want to ask you to consider today if it is now time to go beyond a transatlantic organization capable of acting globally  to some form of global alliance that binds together democratic nations   irrespective of where they are located    NATO is the gold standard for the security of free nations  but freedom s cause does not and cannot end at Europe s or America s borders  On the contrary  as our current struggle against radical Islam is global  I ask  shouldn t our alliance be global  Shouldn t we consider welcoming new members  beyond Europe  that are willing to meet the high political and military standards of our alliance         On the one hand  this means a willingness to include strong democratic states like Japan and Australia with which we are already partnering and that can make major contributions to our capabilities as an alliance         But it may also mean opening the door to membership to fledging democracies like Georgia and Afghanistan  bringing them under our collective security umbrella         By providing a formal guarantee that free nations will stand united  a global NATO would profoundly reshape the ideological battlefield of the twenty first century         Much as the founding of NATO in 1949 put to rest doubts about America s long term commitment to the security of Europe  so too would a global NATO end any uncertainty that exists today about the West s long term commitment to democracy in nations around the world  including  particularly  in the Muslim world  It would make clear that our presence in places like Afghanistan is not just a temporary arrangement  subject to changes in public opinion and the leaders of the moment  but part of a deeper  formal alliance bound by common principles from which we cannot and will not withdraw   These are the same principles enshrined in the original NATO charter  which declares the alliance is  founded on    democracy  individual liberty  and rule of law         These principles know no borders   and they are under attack today across many borders  Our enemies are clear about who they are  Radical Islamists have stated openly  in the words of one jihadist group   We have declared a bitter war against the principle of democracy and all those who seek to enact it         I cannot speak about the global war of ideas without also acknowledging our struggle in Iraq    I understand the frustration and anger that the Iraq war has created in America and toward America throughout the world  but I ask that those understandable reactions not blind our friends to the larger truths about the enemy we are fighting  and about our shared interest in its defeat        We are fighting in Iraq against the same violent ideology of radical Islam that NATO is fighting in Afghanistan and against which so many of our societies  particularly within the Muslim world  are struggling  The asymmetrical war of ideas I have discussed is irretrievably bound up in the outcome of the war in Iraq  as our common enemy keenly appreciates   at times it seems  better than we do         As we have seen in the conduct of the war in Iraq  America is capable of mistakes large and small  but it is in no one s interest for America to be thought of or described as a pariah nation  It would be more accurate from our history to say that we are a principled nation  no more perfect than the rest of humankind  but committed in our Declaration of Independence to a principle  the self evident truth that all of humankind is created equal and endowed by our Creator to the rights of life  liberty  and the pursuit of happiness  This is a very universal declaration of human rights   American history  I am proud to say  shows a remarkable willingness to put our lives and our treasure behind our principles  as the people of Europe well know        President Putin said yesterday that there is  one single center of power  in the world today  He is correct         But that power is not the United States  That power is the power of freedom and democracy    Freedom speaks all languages and knows no borders  Walls and prisons cannot contain it  and the totalitarianism of today cannot defeat it        The cause of freedom does not belong to one nation  On the contrary  as history makes clear  the greatest triumphs of democracy in the twentieth century were achieved by the strength of our alliances  including particularly NATO   Today once again our community of democratic nations faces profound challenges and dangers  and we have had setbacks  But these challenges and dangers must call us now to remember who we are and what we stand for and to summon the will to defend both together        Rather than falling victim to doubt or exhaustion or division  let us sustain and strengthen our faith in all that binds and moves us   the values of freedom and tolerance and justice and democracy  Let us move forward  united and confident in our ultimate victory   a victory not of any single country  but of our shared cause which is freedom and democracy        Thank you        30
