That Sends Work Out of Connecticut

company officials  Connecticut Senators Christopher Dodd and Joseph Lieberman and Representatives Rosa L  DeLauro  Christopher Shays and John B  Larson today urged the company to reverse its decision to send work out of Connecticut   Yesterday  the company announced it had applied to the Federal Aviation Administration for permission to build the S 92 and S 76 commercial helicopters at its Keystone Helicopter unit in Pennsylvania   The decision comes as the strike at Sikorksy s Connecticut facilities nears its seventh week          The situation seems to have been further aggravated with your recent announcement that Sikorsky will begin moving commercial work outside of Connecticut to a workforce lacking the experience and proven skill of Sikorksy s current workers   wrote the lawmakers    We request that you reconsider this decision to outsource Sikorsky s commercial work  and clarify for us whether the decision was related to the strike  or whether the move is part of a broader effort to take work out of Connecticut   We do not believe that you will find the same highly skilled workforce that already exists in Connecticut   The track record of these employees speaks for itself    they delivered 49 commercial S 92 and S 76 model helicopters last year alone        The full text of the letter follows         March 30  2006      Mr  Jeff Pino                                           Mr  George David      President                                               CEO      Sikorsky Aircraft                                       United Technologies Corp       6900 Main Street                                        United Technologies Building       Stratford  CT 06614 1385                                Hartford  CT 06101       We write to urge you in the strongest terms  to resume contract negotiations with employee representatives and to reconsider the decision to move commercial work out of the state               Recent news reports show that the current situation  in addition to taking its toll on the company s bottom line  the workers and area businesses  may soon affect the preparedness of the Navy s helicopter fleet   In addition  the current dispute between Sikorsky and its workers stands to affect our ability as legislators to advocate on behalf of the company s critically important products   In fact  as the stalemate nears its seventh week  it will become increasingly difficult to assure our colleagues of the reliability and quality of product orders produced by the same skillful and experienced workforce that the United States Armed Forces have depended on for decades  and could impact Sikorsky s promotion of the H 92 as the Air Force evaluates requirements for its new Combat Search and Rescue aircraft               The situation seems to have been further aggravated with your recent announcement that Sikorsky will begin moving commercial work outside of Connecticut to a workforce lacking the  experience and proven skill of Sikorksy s current workers   We request that you reconsider this decision to outsource Sikorsky s commercial work  and clarify for us whether the decision was related to the strike  or whether the move is part of a broader effort to take work out of Connecticut   We do not believe that you will find the same highly skilled workforce that already exists in Connecticut   The track record of these employees speaks for itself    they delivered 49 commercial S 92 and S 76 model helicopters last year alone               Further  we cannot understand the timing of this announcement   In our view  such a decision is ill  advised especially when the two sides are still within reach of a resolution to this strike   You have told us that Sikorsky seeks a quick end to this strike   We believe that you were   and remain   sincere in this regard   However  yesterday s announcement sends the opposite signal   We fear this decision may lengthen the strike rather than lead to a prompt resolution   Given how close the two sides  most recent proposals appeared to be  it is clear to us that further negotiating   not rash action by either side   would be the best way to resolve this strike                 We again urge you   as we have urged the Teamsters   to remain at the bargaining table until an agreement is reached   The strike must end so that Sikorsky and its workers can get back to the business of making the best helicopters in the world  Sikorsky must continue to do that work in Connecticut  with its highly skilled  well trained workforce   We look forward to your response        Sincerely         ROSA L  DELAURO                                          CHRISTOPHER DODD       JOSEPH LIEBERMAN                                         CHRISTOPHER SHAYS       JOHN B  LARSON        cc      Mr  George David  President and CEO of UTC              Mr  Harvey Jackson  President of Teamsters Local 1150      30
