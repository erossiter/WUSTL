Arctic Wildlife Refuge Drilling Provision in Defense Spending Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             The U S  Capitol  Washington  D C                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      First let me thank Maria Cantwell for her steadfast and principled leadership in this fight        My own involvement in this concern goes back 18 years to when I began my first campaign for the United States Senate in 1987   And I said that one of the reasons I wanted to go to the Senate was to fight to protect the Arctic Refuge  the Arctic plain  from being used to drill for oil  for two reasons   One was that it would destroy a most magnificent piece of America that I wanted to preserve for future generations of Americans  just as God created it   The second reason was that drilling for oil in ANWR perpetuates a dangerous myth  which is that we can drill our way out of dependence on foreign oil   We cannot         As you all know  if the drilling went forward  when it was completed  America around 2020 or a little bit afterward  instead of being 62 percent dependent on foreign oil would be 60 percent dependent on foreign oil   Our economy constantly at the whim of unstable and often unfriendly governments  our national security threatened by actions that they may wish to take        So I fought hard with my colleagues here over the years and we ve won along the way   We won when we were playing by the rules fair and square   But over the last couple of years  those who want to drill for oil in the Arctic refuge in Alaska have been willing repeatedly to fight outside the rules   And we were all raised to believe  in this country particularly  that when you believe in something  you fight hard for it but you fight fair and you fight by the rules  and you depend on your opponents to do the same   So win or lose  you know it has been a fair fight         Earlier this year  a very unfair tactic was taken to break out of the normal rules of the budget resolution and budget reconciliation   And they were able to insert the drilling of ANWR in those measures where it doesn t belong  according to our rules  earlier this year   I was pessimistic   I thought after all these years  simply because they weren t willing to play by the rules  they were going to do something that was not in our national interest        But then in the House  a courageous band of moderate Republicans stood up and said   This is wrong   and they stopped it from happening   And what did the people on the other side     our opponents  in this case over the drilling in ANWR    do   They find another way to break the rules   And they do it on the defense appropriations bill on the assumption that though they are being irresponsible  we will be responsible   They thought we would be intimidated because they ve had the gall to put the drilling of ANWR    totally unrelated    onto the defense appropriations bill  that we would just bow our heads and walk away   We re not going to do that   This is too outrageous and too important   We re going to continue to fight  and fight fair        I heard Senator Stevens say on the floor earlier this morning    he s not breaking the rules  he said   There ll be a point of order   He    and I presume everybody else    assumes that the chair will rule that what they are trying to do here violates Rule 28   And then Senator Stevens or Senator Frist will appeal the ruling of the chair   They expect    again  because they ve had the gall to put this on the bill that funds our men and women in uniform    that we will not have the nerve to fight something we think is wrong   Well  they re wrong   We re going to fight it and hope that a majority of our colleagues stand with us in protecting the rule and standards of fairness in the conduct of the Senate s business        But we have rights too  if I may echo Senator Stevens   And our final right is the right that 14 of us in the so called Gang of 14 fought hard on a bipartisan basis to preserve against Senator Frist s threat of a nuclear option earlier this year   the right to demand that 60 senators vote before anything become law   This is the moment for that right  which was put there to protect the country from either the passion of the moment or an attempted abuse of power by some people to run through the Senate and into law   This is a tough fight   But it is a fight worth waging and a fight worth fighting fairly        Now  some people would say to me    one or two already have     Senator Lieberman  you re so strong in support of our military   How can you jeopardize funding for the military over this matter    Let s be honest about it   Let us assume  as I hope and believe  that we block cloture on this bill on Wednesday morning   Does anyone really think this Congress and this Administration will allow funding for our military to stop   That s ridiculous   Trust me  we will find a way to continue to support our men and women in uniform  and we will do it generously        Secondly  as somebody who supports the military  I am not going to allow this precedent to be set that every year we adopt a defense appropriations bill  somebody with a pet project who happens to be in a position of power is going to attach it at the last minute to the Defense Appropriations Conference Report   If we let this happen  it puts in perpetual danger the funding for our military in the years forward        And a final substantive point  in some ways  where I began this fight 18 years ago   Senator Stevens said this morning and he ll say it again  this amendment of his to drill in ANWR belongs in the defense appropriations bill because it s about national security   On its face  that s wrong   But I honestly believe that the argument can be turned against him   I was privileged recently with a bipartisan group of senators  Senator Brownback and I the lead co sponsors  to put in legislation inspired by a group called Set America Free        This is a group of defense hawks  Jim Woolsey  Bud McFarland  George Schultz  you could go through the list   And these folks have decided that no matter how strong our military is  if we are dependent on foreign oil to run our country  America can be brought to its knees   And their point to us is  the most significant thing we can do for national security apart from supporting the military is to support bold and aggressive efforts to break our dependence on foreign oil by increasing the use of hybrids  hybrid plug ins and biofuels in our vehicles   So  in all these ways  I would say this amendment does not support our national security  it endangers it        This is a fight worth waging   I m proud to be on the battlefield with this distinguished group of fighters   And I go into battle because I am so confident that we are right  also confident that we will prevail
