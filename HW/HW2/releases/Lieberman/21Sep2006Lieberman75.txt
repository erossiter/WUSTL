                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday criticized Congressional leadership for undermining an    historic opportunity    to enact comprehensive immigration reform this year and said he would oppose efforts to close off debate on an ineffective border security bill if leaders barred amendments to it                   Lieberman called the Secure Fence Act  which would add billions of dollars to extend a fence across the southern border with Mexico     punitive and ineffective       a far cry from the bipartisan reform the Senate passed in May   Lieberman joined Senators Ken Salazar  D Colo   Ted Kennedy  D Mass   Harry Reid  D N V   and Richard Durbin  D Ill   in co sponsoring an amendment to attach the Senate passed comprehensive reform to the narrower bill                      The Senate is now considering abandoning that truly comprehensive and bipartisan solution to a festering national problem and replacing it with an election year wedge issue intended only to sow division and inflame passions     Lieberman said in a statement                       The cost of these fences is conservatively estimated at  2 2 billion  but could easily double  And for this price America will be no more secure  its borders no more protected  and illegal immigration still out of control  The money squandered with this bill could be used in much more effective ways to bolster our borders and strengthen our security                      The bipartisan legislation approved by the Senate 62 36 on May 25  but thwarted by House Republicans  would have called for extensive improvements to border security and immigration enforcement including more Border Patrol and immigration agents  more detention beds  new technologies  and new legal authorities  But  as a counterweight to the enforcement provisions  it would also have addressed future immigration by creating a guest worker program leading to citizenship for those who qualified                      Now  instead of doing our Constitutional duty and hammering out our differences  Congressional leadership has declared that reform is dead for this year and instead says the best we can do is build fences in the desert and create a mirage of security  This is a tragedy     the Senator said                   Lieberman said if Senate Republican leaders insisted on disallowing amendments to the Secure Fence Act  he would vote against cloture     a parliamentary term that brings floor debate to an end  moving the bill toward a final vote                   The Senator   s full statement follows                    Mr  President  with so many important questions facing this Senate  and so little time left before we adjourn before the fall elections  I   m dismayed that we are considering this    so called       Secure Fence Act            I say this as a supporter of the bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform we passed in May       I say this as one of many who followed the leadership of Senators Frist and Reid  Specter and Leahy  McCain and Kennedy  when 62 Senators voted to for true reform legislation                   And now look where we are  After a great success  the Senate is now considering abandoning that truly comprehensive and bipartisan solution to a festering national problem and replacing it with an incomplete  ineffective response to our broken immigration system       How did we come to such a low point this fall  after such promise this spring   I   ll tell you how  The opponents of reform obstructed and delayed  They refused to enter into a conference     even to discuss the possibility of reconciling House and Senate legislation       Instead we watched the opponents of reform roll out a farcical road show of hearings designed to distort the facts  confuse the issues and roil the waters to create a national anxiety that need not exist       With that out of the way  these same obstructionists have now re introduced large portions of the punitive and ineffective House legislation the Senate already rejected earlier this year   Without deliberation or debate they are attempting to add their measures onto appropriations legislation already in conference     contradicting the views of a majority of Senators                    One of those measures sent from the House is this legislation to build fences across specific sections of our southern border  The cost of these fences is conservatively estimated at  2 2 billion  but could easily double  And for this price America will be no more secure  it   s borders no more protected and illegal immigration still out of control       As Ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  I am more focused on protecting Americans from harm than I am on any other issue   Effective border security is a vital national priority     not just to stop the flow of illegal immigration into this country  but also to keep terrorists and criminals from entering the US through our airports and seaports  and across our land borders   We will continue to push for better border security  but this is not the way to do it       The money spent on this bill could be used in much more effective ways to bolster our borders and strengthen our security   In fact  Congress has already significantly expanded funding for border security     for Border Patrol officers  detention beds  and new equipment and technology       This year the Senate already provided the Department with funds to build sections of fence where it makes a difference    in heavily populated areas   But an additional few hundred miles of fence along small portions of our vast desert border will do virtually nothing to stop illegal immigration                    Building a few more sections of fence and saying we   ve solved the problem of illegal immigration doesn   t make sense        The President said it himself in a speech days before the Senate passed its immigration bill in May        He said     and I quote         An immigration reform bill needs to be comprehensive  because all elements of this problem must be addressed together  or none of them will be solved at all                      That is what the Senate did  And we are on the verge of losing this historic opportunity to address this border challenge the American people expect us to fix                   Let   s remind ourselves of what is contained in the Senate   s immigration bill     and let   s be proud of our work       The Senate legislation authorized extensive enhancements of border security and immigration enforcement     many more Border Patrol officers  immigration agents  detention beds  new technologies  and new legal authorities                   The Senate bill cracks down on unscrupulous employers who would hire and exploit undocumented workers  by creating verification systems that would leave those employers no excuse for hiring the undocumented and punish them if they do       But what made the Senate bill so forward looking was our bipartisan decision that an enforcement only bill would not solve the problem of illegal immigration       To control future immigration  we also created a guest worker program that will channel future immigrants into legal avenues  where they will be screened to make sure they pose no threat to public safety and will not take jobs from American workers       And for immigration reform to work we had to squarely face the fact that there are approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants already working in the United States  Many have lived here for years and have children who were born in this country and are American citizens       We wisely decided that criminalizing these 11 million people was not going to happen  We couldn   t jail that many people  We couldn   t deport that many people        We knew that the vast majority of undocumented immigrants living in this country came here to work hard  support their families  pay their taxes and obey the law       Those are the kind of people we want here        Yes  they are here illegally and that can   t be treated lightly  And we didn   t  The Senate bill does not offer amnesty or a free pass to anyone  If you want to stay here  you have to earn it        Under the comprehensive  bipartisan Senate bill  undocumented immigrants who have been present in the U S  for at least five years would be able to apply for a work visa lasting six years  They would also pay thousands of dollars in fines  clear background checks and must remain gainfully employed and law abiding         They would go to the back of the line behind those already waiting for their applications to be judged       After six years of working in the U S  on a temporary visa  an immigrant could apply for permanent residency     a process that takes five years     provided he or she paid an additional fee  proved payment of taxes and could show knowledge of English and United States civics         Only after a combined period of 11 years could the immigrant apply for U S  citizenship         Those who have been here between two to five years would have to apply through a stricter guest worker program  and would have to wait even longer before they could win legal residency         We should have rolled up our sleeves long ago to pass realistic and compassionate immigration reform  And the Senate finally has  But the House has shirked its responsibilities with its enforcement only focus       Now  instead of doing our Constitutional duty and hammering out our differences  Congressional leadership has declared that reform is dead for this year and instead says the best we can do is build fences in the desert and create a mirage of security         This is not sensible or right  But we must not give up   We must fight     and I will continue to fight     for true reform        We must do the job the American people sent us here to do     solve the tough problems without falling into divisive  partisan posturing        That   s why I hope and expect that we will be allowed to offer true immigration reform amendments to this bill   If we are not allowed to offer immigration reform amendments  I will oppose cloture on this bill  and I hope all my colleagues who support reform will do the same       Thank you         30
