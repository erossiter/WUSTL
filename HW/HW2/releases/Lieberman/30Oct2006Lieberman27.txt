Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D CT  are calling on the Secretaries of Defense  State  and Army to examine the practice by Kellogg  Brown and Root Services  Inc   KBR  of inappropriately labeling as proprietary information it provides to the government  thereby making review of its contracts difficult for government auditors                                   In letters to Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld  Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice  and Secretary of the Army Francis J  Harvey  the Senators wrote     KBR   s practice of apparently routinely marking much of the information that it provides to the government as proprietary  even when the data marked does not relate to internal contractor information such as indirect costs  labor rates  or internal processes  is not consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations  This practice inhibits the transparency of government activities  makes it more difficult to determine whether taxpayer funds have been used consistent with the terms of the contract  and places an unnecessary burden on the government to challenge inappropriate proprietary markings  which in turn wastes taxpayer dollars                             Senators Collins and Lieberman are calling this practice    unacceptable     and have asked the Secretaries to work to find a solution that would bring more transparency to the process to better enable government auditors to do their jobs efficiently and effectively                          The Senators    request was made following a recent audit report released by the office of the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR  indicating that the audit was difficult to complete because of KBR   s misuse of proprietary data                         In addition  Senators Collins and Lieberman reported that they are working on legislation along with Senator Feingold to extend the expiration date of the SIGIR  which is currently slated to expire October 1  2007                    A full text of the Senators    letter to Secretaries Rice and Rumsfeld is as follows        Dear Secretary Rice and Secretary Rumsfeld                    The Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee is investigating the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstruction   s  SIGIR  findings in an interim audit report that Kellogg  Brown and Root Services  Inc    KBR  has been inappropriately using proprietary data markings on information provided to the government under the Logistics Civil Augmentation Program  LOGCAP  Task Order 103                    KBR   s practice of apparently routinely marking much of the information it provides to the government as proprietary  even when the data marked do not relate to internal contractor information such as indirect costs  labor rates  or internal processes  is not consistent with the Federal Acquisition Regulations   This practice inhibits the transparency of government activities  makes it more difficult to determine whether taxpayer funds have been used consistent with the terms of the contract  and places an unnecessary burden on the government to challenge inappropriate proprietary markings  which in turn wastes taxpayer dollars   The inappropriate use of proprietary designations obstructs the ability of the SIGIR   s office to audit contracts thoroughly   We are also concerned to learn that KBR refused to provide the SIGIR   s office with data in their original format  in effect impeding the office   s ability to review this information   This is obviously unacceptable                    We have asked the Secretary of the Army  Francis Harvey  to personally involve himself in resolving this issue   Because the SIGIR reports administratively to both of you  we urge you to ensure that this unacceptable practice  which has impeded the work of the Special Inspector General  is ended and that a review of previously marked    proprietary    information is undertaken        On a related matter  we believe the SIGIR has done exceptional work and that his continued oversight of Iraq Relief and Reconstruction Funds  IRRF  is crucial   This is why we expect to introduce legislation to repeal the premature expiration date for the SIGIR   s mandate recently enacted as part of the Defense Authorization bill   We believe it is appropriate to return to the previous language that would have his office continue until ten months after 80 percent of the IRRF has been expended   We hope you will both support this initiative
