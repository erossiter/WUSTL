WASHINGTON    Senator Joe Lieberman  a senior member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee  today joined a bipartisan group of Senate colleagues in calling on the Bush Administration to crackdown on mercury emissions   In a letter to the Acting Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency  Stephen Johnson  the Senators urged EPA to implement a more rigorous mercury rulemaking process and adopt a rule that adequately protects public health and the environment           We have a responsibility to do all that we can to protect Americans from domestic sources of mercury pollution and we must be world leaders in controlling this persistent toxic global pollutant     the letter said     The technology to dramatically clean up these power plants is available and affordable   EPA has already delayed a rule to regulate mercury under the Clean Air Act by at least six years   There should be no further delays            The full text of the letter is below        March 7  2005        The Honorable Stephen Johnson  Acting Administrator  U S  Environmental Protection Agency  1200 Pennsylvania Ave   N W   Washington  D C  20460    Dear Administrator Johnson        We are writing to urge you to take immediate action to address serious problems in EPA   s proposed rule on mercury emissions from power plants  so that a better and legally defensible rule to expeditiously reduce those emissions can be promulgated by the settlement agreement deadline of March 15  2005   We are also gravely concerned that the rulemaking process has not been open and transparent to the public and may not have adhered to proper and statutory guidance           A similar letter was sent to former Administrator Michael Leavitt on April 1  2004  expressing our belief that EPA   s mercury proposals fell far short of what the law requires and that the proposed approach fails to protect the health of our children and our environment   The issues raised in the 2004 letter are bolstered by a recent report from the EPA Inspector General  IG  and a draft report from the Government Accountability Office  GAO    The IG and GAO reports severely criticize EPA   s rulemaking process saying it violated EPA policy  OMB guidance  Presidential Executive Orders and  in some instances  important provisions of the Clean Air Act        Both reports highlight serious deficiencies in EPA   s analysis for children   s health impacts and the lack of transparency in the regulatory process   Due to the known serious and persistent effects of mercury on people and the environment  EPA   s final rule on mercury air emissions must be protective of children   s health   The Agency   s failure to comply with Executive Order 13045 on Children   s Health nor to even estimate the value of the health benefits directly related to decreased mercury emissions concerns all of us   Today  45 states have fish warnings for mercury  and EPA and the Food and Drug Administration warn women of childbearing age  nursing mothers and young children from eating more than six ounces a week of fish caught in local waterways        Recent studies indicate that at least one in six women of child bearing age in the United States carry enough accumulated mercury in her body to pose risks of adverse health effects to her children should she become pregnant   The National Academy of Sciences has confirmed scientific research demonstrating that maternal consumption of unsafe levels of mercury in fish can cause serious neurodevelopmental harm resulting in children that suffer from learning disabilities  poor motor function  mental retardation  seizure disorders and cerebral palsy          The lack of analysis of the health impacts of mercury on children by EPA in this rulemaking process is alarming and should be corrected before EPA issues a final rule on mercury air emissions          Unfortunately  the IG and GAO found other serious concerns with EPA   s rulemaking process on mercury   The IG found that        EPA senior management instructed EPA staff to develop a maximum achievable control technology  MACT  standard for mercury that would result in national emissions of 34 tons annually  instead of basing the standard on an unbiased calculation of what the top performing units were achieving in practice   EPA IG report     Additional Analysis of Mercury Emissions Needed Before EPA Finalizes Rules for Coal Fired Electric Utilities     Feb  3  2005  p  11        By instructing EPA staff to ignore the top performers and to base the standard on an arbitrary 34 ton annual emissions limit  these EPA senior managers failed to carry out the MACT requirement under the Clean Air Act  directing staff to be arbitrary and capricious in arriving at a standard   These actions violate sections 112 d  and 307 b  of the Clean Air Act        Both the IG and GAO criticized EPA for failure to follow Executive Order 12866 on Regulatory Review  which requires agencies to analyze and present cost and benefit estimates for all regulatory alternatives   GAO writes        EPA   s initial economic analysis of the two policies that it is considering has a number of shortcomings   Specifically  because EPA did not analyze and document the economic effects of each policy option by itself    the results cannot be meaningfully compared  Further  without monetary estimates of the human health benefits of mercury emissions reductions     a primary purpose of a mercury regulation   over the full implementation period of each option  or at a minimum  qualitative comparison of these benefits  EPA   s analysis does not provide decision makers with a strong basis for comparing the net benefits   Unless EPA conducts and documents further economic analysis  decision makers and the public may lack assurance that the agency has evaluated the economic tradeoffs of each option and taken the appropriate steps to identify which mercury control option would provide the largest net benefit      GAO Report    Clean Air Act Observations on EPA   s Cost Benefit Analysis of Its Mercury Control Options     p  16         We request that EPA take action on the recommendations in both the IG and GAO reports   These recommendations request that EPA       Re analyze mercury emissions data for an updated MACT       Consistently analyze options and provide estimates of costs and benefits for each proposal in a comparative manner      Strengthen mercury controls      Fully assess the potential for hot spots of mercury contamination      Conduct integrated analysis to determine the option that is most protective of children and subsistence fishermen and their families  including Asian Americans and Native Americans  and     Provide full disclosure and transparency throughout the process as required by EPA policy  OMB guidance and the Clean Air Act        We have a responsibility to do all that we can to protect Americans from domestic sources of mercury pollution and we must be world leaders in controlling this persistent toxic global pollutant   The technology to dramatically clean up these power plants is available and affordable   EPA has already delayed a rule to regulate mercury under the Clean Air Act by at least six years   There should be no further delays           Accordingly  we urge you to include in the final rulemaking the analysis that the law and the Executive Orders require and to issue a mercury rule that gets real and timely reductions on schedule for the health of the children of our nation            30
