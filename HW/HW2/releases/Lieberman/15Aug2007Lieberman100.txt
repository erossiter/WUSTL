Monitors

    WASHINGTON   Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   along with Senator Daniel Akaka  D Hawaii  House Committee on Homeland Security Committee Chairman Bennie G  Thompson  D Miss   and Congressman James Langevin  D R I   Wednesday called on the Department of Homeland Security to hold off on a  1 2 billion acquisition of nuclear radiation monitors until questions about their reliability  performance  and effectiveness have been addressed     In a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff  the lawmakers identified persistent concerns raised by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  about the testing and evaluation of the monitors by the DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office  DNDO   In May  Congress requested a comprehensive audit by GAO to verify the reliability of the portal screening program in realistic operational settings to ensure that American taxpayer dollars are spent effectively     As promising radiation detection technologies move through DNDO s evolutionary spiral development pipeline toward maturity  the office will need the flexibility to address unexpected issues  the letter said  We believe GAO can make a singular contribution by verifying the reliability  objectivity and validity of DNDO testing procedures  data  results  and DNDO evaluations or reports based on those test results that are submitted in support of certification     In the DHS FY 2007 budget  Congress provided funding for DNDO to begin buying so called Advanced Spectroscopic Portal radiation detection sensors  However  as a result of questions GAO raised about a June 2006 Cost Benefit Analysis that DHS had submitted in support the ASP procurement  the FY 2007 Conference Report required that the Homeland Security Secretary personally certify that the new monitors will provide a significant increase in operational effectiveness over current radiation portal monitors that use a different technology to detect nuclear smuggling     As a result of those questions  Secretary Chertoff recently decided to have technical experts from outside DHS conduct an independent review of the reliability of the detection monitors  In the letter to the Secretary  the lawmakers applauded this decision  but urged him to carefully consider the findings of the simultaneous GAO audit as well     We understand the technical nature of these systems and therefore applaud your decision to use an independent review team to assist you and the DHS Investment Board in your decision making  It is our view  however  an independent evaluation by GAO will best serve the oversight responsibilities of Congress and ensure public confidence in your ultimate decision  they wrote     The full text of the letter is below     August 15  2007    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  D C  20528    Dear Secretary Chertoff     Preventing a nuclear terrorist attack against the United States is the highest priority of the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   Consequently  it is vitally important to the nation s security that the first major investment by the DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection Office  DNDO  succeed in significantly improving the operational capacity of portal radiation monitors to detect nuclear smuggling  DNDO is a national level  joint  interagency office that was established in April 2005 to serve as the primary entity of the United States Government to further develop  acquire  and support the deployment of an enhanced domestic nuclear detection system and be the single accountable organization within DHS for accelerating the development  improvement and effective use of radiation detection technologies  The purpose of this letter is two fold  First  we write to express our support for your recent decision to have technical experts from outside DHS conduct an independent review of the reliability of DNDO test procedures  test results  associated technology assessments and the cost benefit analyses prior to your certification of the  1 2 billion Advanced Spectroscopic Portal  ASP  acquisition  We agree with you that a first generation spectroscopic portal monitor equipped with Sodium Iodide crystals will be a fundamentally new type of portal radiation monitor and this important investment requires careful consideration     Second  we ask that prior to your certification of the merits of the ASP procurement or DHS Investment Review Board approval for Full Rate Production of the new systems  you carefully consider the findings of a review by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  of audit issues associated with the reliability and objectivity of DNDO testing of ASP monitors earlier this year and the adequacy of Field Validation and Operational Assessments of ASP Low Rate Initial Production models in realistic operational settings     Persistent uncertainty about DNDO testing has delayed ASP acquisition    DNDO was established in April 2005 and reports directly to the DHS Office of the Secretary  The primary mission of DNDO is to serve as a trusted agent for the development  testing and acquisition of advanced radiation detection equipment on behalf of DHS agencies and to design a global nuclear detection architecture  The Safe Ports Act of 2006 transferred all DHS radiological and nuclear detection testing authority and funding to DNDO  giving the office end to end control of DHS radiation detection research  development  testing  evaluation and acquisition activities at DHS     This pivotal role has made DNDO the primary source of cost  benefit  performance and technology assessment data that DHS provides to Congress in seeking funding for major investments planned and managed by DNDO  This holistic approach has its strengths  but DNDO s stand alone design makes it essential that DNDO testing and evaluation practices are guided by a structured  knowledge based methodology that is scientifically sound and transparent     Recognizing the need for objective assessments of the readiness  maturity and performance of promising radiation detection technologies  the DHS Congressional Budget Justification for FY 2007 emphasized that DNDO procurements will be anchored by an independent assessment of technologies at the Nevada Test Site and other venues by DNDO working in partnership with National Laboratories and the National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST      Despite these assurances  GAO has identified persistent concerns about DNDO testing and evaluation practices  As a result  the FY 2007 DHS Appropriations Conference Report  which supported continued testing of Sodium Iodide based ASP prototypes  prohibited the Department from moving forward with full scale manufacture and deployment of first generation ASP radiation monitors until the DHS Secretary personally certifies and reports that a significant increase in operational effectiveness merits such a decision     Limitations on NIST role during DNDO testing in 2007    During comprehensive tests of radiation portal monitors in 2004 by the DHS Directorate of Science and Technology  ST  and an initial test campaign by DNDO in 2005  DHS took the prudent step of contracting with NIST to analyze the test data and write a final report on the test results  In both instances  NIST produced comprehensive final reports that ranked the systems according to various test criteria  documented the analysis of test data and  where relevant  disclosed test execution problems and limitations in the quality of the test data    However  for the testing this year at the Nevada Test Site of ASP Engineering Development prototypes  the role of NIST was limited to data reduction and statistical analysis  According to the January 12  2007  DNDO Test Plan In Support of Advanced Spectroscopic Portal Production Decision Conducted at the Nevada Test Site  DNDO Test Plan   the DNDO staff planned to use the NIST data tables and statistical analysis to produce a final report that combined the results of testing at the Nevada site and other venues     Reliability of spectroscopic technology in extreme climates is unknown    We welcome recent statements that no ASP Full Rate Production models will be deployed for operational use until CBP is satisfied with their reliability and performance  but we are concerned about the effort to limit the amount of field validation testing conducted in realistic operational environments  We are informed that the ASP system will be the first commercial portal radiation monitor that uses Sodium Iodide crystals or a similar technology based on High Purity Germanium crystals    While DNDO has succeeded in developing a Low Rate Initial Production version of crystal based spectroscopic systems  it is presently unknown whether they can be used reliably for the new mission of screening cargo containers and trucks at domestic ports of entry  especially under extreme temperatures or operating conditions  The reliability and maintainability of either Sodium Iodide or High Purity Germanium crystals will have a direct bearing on the life cycle costs to maintain and operate the new system     Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  PNNL  has been the primary contractor of the Radiation Portal Monitor Program and  since 2002 has deployed 1 000 Poly Vinyl Toulene  PVT  radiation portal monitorsa reliable plastic based system that detects radiation inside cargo containers  but cannot identify the type of radioisotope  After the initial installations of PVT in 2003  the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection  CBP  directed PNNL to begin developing a crystal based spectroscopic portal monitor that could detect radiation as well as a PVT  but could also discriminate between radioisotopes     In technical documents for CBP  PNNL described the potential of Sodium Iodide crystals or High Purity Germanium crystals to improve identification  but cautioned the no commercial version of a spectroscopic portal radiation monitor had been built using the crystals  A June 11  2004 paper by PNNL cautioned that Sodium iodide is also notorious for being prone to internal cracking along crystal cleavage planes either as a result of mechanical or thermal shock     The only way to be sure of the readiness of the technology for successful application to the new mission of high volume cargo screening at ports of entry  PNNL counseled  was to deploy a limited number of advanced prototypes in all or most domestic ports of entry  and have CBP officers operate the new systems for an extended period of time under a variety of conditions  Before any ultimate decisions are made  a first commercial system must be built and extensively tested in order to determine if there is sufficient benefit to justify the greatly increased cost  the PNNL paper said     On December 20  2004 CBP approved Version 4 0 of the Radiation Portal Monitor Program Project Execution Plan that outlined how an all spectroscopic system with Sodium Iodide crystals could be developed and deployed  A site by site deployment plan called for initial testing in January 2005 of three ASP prototypes  followed by a phased deployment over two years of 56 systems of various designs  At the end of two years  PNNL planned to use the performance data and knowledge gained from operating the systems in a variety of locations through a full cycle of seasons to revise the performance specifications for a finished production model that would then replace all PVT systems     Limited evaluation of ASP monitors in realistic operational settings     The Jan  12  2007 DNDO Test Plan established four types of tests to support certification  Each test addressed one of four Critical Operational Issues  three of which were said to include Field Validation  The schedule allowed one month for Field Validation  from April 16 through May 14  with CBP officers operating ASP Low Rate Initial Production models at four domestic ports of entry  The schedule said that on June 5  DNDO would request approval to proceed to Full Rate Production of ASP systems  In April and May DNDO officials provided briefings to Congressional staff and members of Congress regarding the results of the testing at the Nevada Test Site in February and March  2007 of three ASP Engineering Development Models and a production version of the PVT and the schedule for the certification process  During a briefing April 27  2007 with the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  a DNDO official said that the Field Validation period in realistic operational settings at four domestic ports might be limited to two or three weeks  On May 25  2007  DNDO submitted briefings slides with a new schedule that allowed for three weeks of Field Validation followed by a request for approval of full scale production on July 24     Concerns expressed by Bureau of Customs and Border Protection    During this period  senior officials with the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection  CBP  told GAO and investigators from the Senate Committee on Homeland Security that it was critical to verify the reliability of the first generation ASP system in realistic operational settings  While they were uncertain how long the Field Validation process would take  based on the agency s experience with the initial installation of PVT systems in 2002 and 2003  CBP officials stated it could be many months before the agency was comfortable with the reliability of the new system     On May 14th  we asked that GAO audit the ASP certification process in a request letter that was co signed by chairmen or ranking members in the Senate and the House of Representatives  We questioned whether a few weeks of testing in operational settings will be sufficient to determine the readiness of the ASP systems for full deployment and emphasized Congress s need for timely GAO findings regarding the validity of the DHS certification process     On June 5  DNDO provided the Committee with an amended plan for ASP certification that added a fifth stage to the testing process for certification  Critical Operational Issue 5  which would address Availability during an unspecified period after deployment  In the context of testing and evaluation  the term Availability refers to the operational reliability  maintainability and down time of a new system based on how often it is out of service for maintenance or repairs and how long it typically takes to replace critical components that fail     On June 29  the Committee was notified that DNDO had tasked Pacific Northwest National Laboratory  PNNL the prime contractor for ASP installationsto conduct a three phase Operational Assessment of ASP Low Rate Initial Production models installed at four domestic ports  PNNL briefing slides showed a revised timeline that moved the date for certification to early September  with the third phase Field Validation of Enhanced LRIP ASP Systems being deferred until October     Importance of ensuring reliable DNDO testing and technology assessment    DNDO has been given a large and complex task  As promising radiation detection technologies move through DNDO s evolutionary spiral development pipeline toward maturity  the office will need the flexibility to address unexpected issues  At the same time  the complexity of this venture and the present uncertainty about the readiness of new radiation detection technology applications  such as Sodium Iodide crystals or High Purity Germanium crystals  require a disciplined  structured and knowledge based approach that includes strong systems engineering  reliable technology assessments and external review     We applaud your recognition of the Department s need for an independent review of DNDO s testing and for an assessment of DNDO s efforts associated with the ASP acquisition  We appreciate the assurance that the Committee will be provided with a copy of the panel s report prior to a decision on certification  We have been informed that the team will be lead by the Defense Threat Reduction Agency  Assuming the review panel also includes a cross section of experts from such trusted entities as the National Laboratories and the National Nuclear Security Administration  NNSA  and has full access to DNDO documents and test data  the review should enhance Executive Branch stewardship of this important acquisition     Importance of GAO review to long term success of ASP acquisition    Under the circumstances  however  we believe GAO can make a singular contribution by verifying the reliability  objectivity and validity of DNDO testing procedures  data  results and DNDO evaluations or reports based on those test results that are submitted in support of certification  Presently  GAO is proceeding with two audit engagements related to DNDO  An audit for the House Committee on Energy and Commerce is focused on issues associated with DNDO testing and evaluation activities  a second audit being conducted on behalf of our Committees is focused on the certification process  the design of the nuclear detection architecture and Department s management of this critical mission     With respect to the ASP acquisition  we intend that GAO provide Congress with objective and thorough audit findings regarding the extent to which DNDO testing and evaluation practices   1  are reliable and scientifically sound   2  have confirmed that the first generation ASP systems will provide a significant operational improvement in the ability of CBP officers to detect nuclear smuggling at domestic ports of entry   3  have identified any serious limitations in the capability of ASP systems to detect and identify nuclear threat material in cargo containers  and  4  have established the reliability and availability of ASP systems and their underlying crystal based technologies for use in demanding cargo screening environments     GAO assurances review of testing will not delay ASP acquisition     Our May 14th audit request asked that GAO notify the Committee of any delays in gaining access to documents or information regarding DNDO  We are informed that in recent weeks DNDO has provided GAO with numerous documents  including a report on the results of one phase of the tests conducted at the Nevada Test Site and additional data regarding previously undisclosed blind tests that were not described in the Test Plan  We appreciate this cooperation     We understand that GAO is still awaiting DNDO material that includes the final results of previously undisclosed blind tests DNDO has told GAO were conducted at the Nevada Test Site  the results of a Phase 3 of the Nevada tests  the results of Field Validation and Availability evaluations of ASP Low Rate Initial Production models in realistic operational settings  and any Cost Benefit Analysis or other document based on the test results that DNDO submits to you in support of certification or to the DHS Investment Review Board to obtain Key Decision Point 3 approval to move to Full Rate Production  During recent meetings with the House Committee on Homeland Security and the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  DNDO Director Vayl S  Oxford said that once all test data is analyzed  DNDO will provide GAO the balance of test data  test results and documentation for testing and evaluation conducted of ASP and PVT systems during 2007     Senior GAO officials have assured the Committee staff that their review will not delay the certification process  Once auditors have the test data  test results and other documentation in hand  GAO officials state that this aspect of their audit work can be completed in a matter of weeks and will not delay procurement  DNDO s current schedule calls for seeking Secretarial certification in September  which will allow ample time for GAO to complete this aspect of the audit engagement     To carry out this important exercise of Congressional oversight  GAO has assembled a multi disciplinary audit team that includes senior auditors from GAO s Natural Resources Division  Acquisitions and Sourcing Management Division and Applied Research Methods Division who have extensive experience auditing major military and civilian acquisition programs that entail the new application of advanced technology  including radiological and nuclear technologies  Should any aspect of the DNDO audit engagements require highly specialized or technical expertise  GAO has in place a contract with the National Academy of Sciences to provide GAO with technical support from an independent panel of experts     In closing  we understand the technical nature of these systems and therefore applaud your decision to use an independent review team to assist you and the DHS Investment Board in your decision making  It is our view  however  that an independent evaluation by GAO will best serve the oversight responsibilities of Congress and ensure public confidence in your ultimate decision     Thank you for your consideration of this request     Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman U S  Senator    Daniel K  Akaka U S  Senator    Rep  Bennie G
