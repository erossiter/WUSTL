Congress        WSJ Op Ed  Today  Gen  David Petraeus  commander of our forces in Iraq  returns to Washington to report on the war in Iraq and the new counterinsurgency strategy he has been implementing there  We hope that opponents of the war in Congress will listen carefully to the evidence that the U S  military is at last making real and significant progress in its offensive against al Qaeda in Iraq     Consider how the situation has changed  A year ago  al Qaeda in Iraq controlled large swaths of the country s territory  Today it is being driven out of its former strongholds in Anbar and Diyala provinces by the surge in U S  forces and those of our Iraqi allies  A year ago  sectarian violence was spiraling out of control in Iraq  fanned by al Qaeda  Today civilian murders in Baghdad are down over 50      As facts on the ground in Iraq have improved  some critics of the war have changed their stance  As Democratic Congress man Brian Baird  who voted against the invasion of Iraq  recently wrote after returning from Baghdad   T he people  strategies  and facts on the ground have changed for the better  and those changes justify changing our position on what should be done     Unfortunately  many more antiwar advocates continue to press for withdrawal  Confronted by undeniable evidence of gains against al Qaeda in Iraq  they acknowledge progress but have seized on the performance of the Iraqi government to justify stripping Gen  Petraeus of troops and derailing his strategy     This reasoning is flawed for several reasons     First  whatever you think of the performance of Iraq s national leaders  the notion that withdrawing U S  troops will shock them into reconciliation is unsupported by evidence or experience  On the contrary  ordering a retreat will only serve to unravel the hard fought gains we have won     The recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq was unequivocal on this point  Changing the mission of Coalition forces from a primarily counterinsurgency and stabilization role  the Petraeus strategy  to a primary combat support role for Iraqi forces and counterterrorist operations  which most congressional Democrats have been pressing for  would erode security gains achieved thus far     This judgment is echoed by our commanders on the ground  Consider the words of Maj  Gen  Rick Lynch  commander of the 3rd Infantry Division  who is leading the fight in central Iraq  In my battlespace right now  if soldiers were to leave       having fought hard for that terrain  having denied the enemy their sanctuaries  what happens is  the enemy would come back     In addition  while critics are right that improved security has not yet translated into sufficient political progress at the national level  the increased presence of our soldiers is having a seismic effect on Iraq s politics at the local level     In the neighborhoods and villages where U S  forces have moved in  extremists have been marginalized  and moderates empowered  Thanks to this changed security calculus  the Sunni Arab community  which was largely synonymous with the insurgency a year ago  has been turning against al Qaeda from the bottom up  and beginning to negotiate an accommodation with the emerging political order  Sustaining this political shift depends on staying the offensive against al Qaeda  which in turn depends on not stripping Gen  Petraeus of the manpower he and his commanders say they need     We must also recognize that the choice we face in Iraq is not between the current Iraqi government and a perfect Iraqi government  Rather  it is a choice between a young  imperfect  struggling democracy that we have helped midwife into existence  and the fanatical  al Qaeda suicide bombers and Iranian sponsored terrorists who are trying to destroy it  If Washington politicians succeed in forcing a premature troop withdrawal in Iraq  the result will be a more dangerous world with our enemies emboldened  As Iran s president recently crowed  soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region        and  we are prepared to fill the gap     Whatever the shortcomings of our friends in Iraq  they are no excuse for us to retreat from our enemies like al Qaeda and Iran  who pose a mortal threat to our vital national interests  We must understand that today in Iraq we are fighting and defeating the same terrorist network that attacked on 9 11  As al Qaeda in Iraq continues to be hunted down and rooted out  and the Iraqi Army continues to improve  the U S  footprint will no doubt adjust  But these adjustments should be left to the discretion of Gen  Petraeus  not forced on our troops by politicians in Washington with a 6 000 mile congressional screwdriver  and  perhaps  an eye on the 2008 election     The Bush administration clung for too long to a flawed strategy in this war  despite growing evidence of its failure  Now advocates of withdrawal risk making the exact same mistake  by refusing to re examine their own conviction that Gen  Petraeus s strategy cannot succeed and that the war is lost  despite rising evidence to the contrary     The Bush administration finally had the courage to change course in Iraq earlier this year  After hearing from Gen  Petraeus today  we hope congressional opponents of the war will do the same     Mr  McCain is a Republican senator from
