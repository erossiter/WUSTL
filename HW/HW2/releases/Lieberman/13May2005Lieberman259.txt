today asked the White House for a timeline for establishing the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in the Executive Office of the President and expressed concern that the Chairman and Vice Chairman have not yet been nominated         In a letter to Chief of Staff Andrew Card  Assistant Democratic Leader Senator Dick Durbin  D IL   Homeland Security Committee Chair Susan Collins  R ME   Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D CT   and Judiciary Committee Ranking Member Patrick J  Leahy  D VT  called on the White House to provide them with a    timeline and milestones for establishing the Board  including appointing Board members  hiring an Executive Director and other staff  and securing office space          The Privacy and Civil Liberties Board was statutorily required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004  signed by President Bush in December  The Board would    ensure that privacy and civil liberties concerns are appropriately considered in the Executive Branch   s implementation of all laws  regulations  policies  and procedures related to efforts to protect the Nation against terrorism     the Senators wrote       The Senators concluded     As the 9 11 Commission made clear  a strong and independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is a critical component of the enhanced system of checks and balances needed to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of life   Accordingly  we urge the White House to take the steps necessary to allow the Board to begin functioning effectively as soon as possible          The full text of the letter is below       Andrew H  Card  Jr   Chief of Staff  The White House  1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC  20500      Dear Mr  Card       On December 17  2004  the President signed into law the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  P L  108 458     This historic legislation reorganized the intelligence community for the first time in more than 50 years       In response to the 9 11 Commission   s recommendation  Section 1061 of this Act established a Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board in the Executive Office of the President   The Board is to ensure that privacy and civil liberties concerns are appropriately considered in the Executive Branch   s implementation of all laws  regulations  policies  and procedures related to efforts to protect the Nation against terrorism   Further  the Board is empowered to advise Executive Branch agencies in their development of all such regulations  policies  and procedures       We would appreciate if you would provide us with an update on the implementation of Section 1061   In particular  please inform us of the timeline and milestones for establishing the Board  including appointing Board members  hiring an Executive Director and other staff  and securing office space   We are concerned that  as of the date of this letter  the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Board have not been nominated   We urge that this be done as quickly as possible so the Board   s important work can begin       In addition  the Board   s proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2006 is only  750 000   We are concerned that this is an inadequate level of funding for the Board to carry out its broad statutory mandate   By way of comparison  the proposed budgets for other offices within the Executive Office of the President are  4 million for the Council of Economic Advisors   24 million for the Office of Drug Control Policy   6 million for the Office of Science and Technology Policy  and  39 million for the Office of the United States Trade Representative   In addition  the Department of Homeland Security   s Officer for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties  who is charged with addressing civil liberties issues facing one department  not the entire Executive Branch  has a proposed budget of  13 million       Please provide us with details of the proposed budget for the Board and describe how the Board will set up a new office  hire the requisite staff  carry out its statutory mandates  and otherwise function effectively with this level of funding   Please inform us how many Full Time Equivalents will be dedicated to the Board and its staff       As the 9 11 Commission made clear  a strong and independent Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board is a critical component of the enhanced system of checks and balances needed to protect the precious liberties that are vital to our way of life   Accordingly  we urge the White House to take the steps necessary to allow the Board to begin functioning effectively as soon as possible       Thank you for your time and consideration       30
