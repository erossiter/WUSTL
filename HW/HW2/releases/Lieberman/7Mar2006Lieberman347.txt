CT  today vowed to fight for energy independence as a matter of national security   The full text of his testimony is below       Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources       March 7  2006       Mr  Chairman and Members of the Committee   Please accept my thanks for the opportunity to submit this statement as part of the record of today   s hearing in the issue of oil dependence     or  as President Bush put it  our    addiction    to oil   I am especially grateful that so soon after your own Herculean efforts to enact Energy legislation last year  you and the Committee are plunging into this vital issue in such a serious way   I hope that we will be able to work together closely to enact legislation     this year     that will put America on a path to energy security        My testimony will focus on the emerging crisis we as a country face and on the legislation that I believe can unleash the technologies  fuels and strategies we must use to deal with that crisis        At the outset  let me be clear that I am under no illusions that our economy can be completely energy independent in the literal sense of that term   We can  however  ensure that our economy grows while becoming less and less oil intensive   We have the technology to do it  we have the homegrown fuels to do it and  more and more  I believe we have the will to do it   And  if we succeed we will be making our economy more and more resilient against the dangers and shocks of the global oil system  while freeing our national security and our foreign policy from the very real threats and distortions that our oil dependence imposes         On November 16 of last year  I introduced as part of a bipartisan group of 10 Senators representing the American Northeast  South  Midwest and West  S 2025  the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act         We chose this title because nothing less than our national security is at stake         Besides myself  the rest of the   Gang of Ten    or the   Energy Security Ten    as some call us are Senators Sam Brownback of Kansas  Evan Bayh of Indiana  Norm Coleman of Minnesota  Lindsey Graham of South Carolina  Ken Salazar of Colorado  Jeff Sessions of Alabama  Bill Nelson of Florida  Richard Lugar of Indiana and Barack Obama of Illinois   Since then  we have been joined by Senators Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Lincoln Chafee of Rhode Island  and we expect even more of our colleagues from both sides of the aisle will be joining us soon         I hope that in the future we all look back on the day this bill was introduced as the beginning of a major shift in our national security strategy  I hope that history will say we saw a challenge to our national security and prosperity and then met it and mastered it         While geologists and economists can debate when the oil supply will    peak     what is indisputable is that demand is now exploding as developing nations such as India and China increase consumption          A recent report by the International Energy Agency  IEA  sums up the urgent need for our legislation         According to the IEA  global demand for oil  now about 85 million barrels a day  will increase by more than 50 percent to 130 million barrels a day between now and 2030 if nothing is done         The industrialized world s dependence on oil heightens global instability  The authors of the IEA report note that the way things are going   we are ending up with 95 percent of the world relying for its economic well being on decisions made by five or six countries in the Middle East           The recent attack on the Abqaiq oil processing facility in Saudi Arabia reminds us not only of our dangerous dependence on foreign oil  but that that vulnerability is recognized by our enemies          Besides the Mideast  I would add that Nigeria is roiled by instability  Venezuela s current leadership is hostile to us and Russia s resurgent state power has ominous overtones         In fact  we are just one well orchestrated terrorist attack or political upheaval away from a  100 a barrel overnight price spike that would that would send the global economy tumbling and the industrialized world  including China and India  scrambling to secure supplies from the remaining and limited number of oil supply sites          History tells us that wars have started over such competition         Because oil is traded globally  prices are set by the global market   While the US can not unilaterally dictate the prices set on the global market  we can reduce our dependence on those prices by diversifying our energy portfolio  particularly in the transportation sector        Left unchecked  I fear that we are literally watching the slow but steady erosion of America s power and independence as a nation  our economic and military power and our political independence         We are burning it up in our automobile engines and spewing it from our tailpipes because of our absolute dependence on oil to fuel our cars and trucks         That dependence on oil  and that means foreign oil because our own reserves are less than 1 percent of the world s oil reserves  puts us in jeopardy in three key ways  a convergence forming a perfect storm that is extremely dangerous to America s national security and economy         First  the structure of the global oil market deeply affects  and distorts  our foreign policy  Our broader interests and aspirations must compete with our own need for oil and the growing thirst for it in the rest of the world  especially by China and India         As a study in the journal Foreign Affairs makes clear  China is moving aggressively to compete for the world s limited supplies of oil not just with its growing economic power  but with its growing military and diplomatic power as well         Second  today we must depend for our oil on a global gallery of nations that are politically unstable  unreliable  or just plain hostile to us         All that and much more should make us worry because if we don t change  it is within their borders and under their earth and waters that our economic and national security lies         Doing nothing about our oil dependency will make us a pitiful giant  like Gulliver in Lilliput  tied down by smaller nations and subject to their whims  And we will have given them the ropes and helped them tie the knots         We can take on this problem now and stand tall as the free and independent giant we are by reducing America   s dependence on oil   Fortunately  the US    oil intensity     the amount of oil used to generate each dollar of GDP  has decreased 50  in the last 30 years   Further reducing our oil intensity is the key to reducing our vulnerability to oil supply shocks  and bolstering our national and economic security          There is only one way to do this  We need to transform our total transportation infrastructure from the refinery to the tailpipe and each step in between because transportation is the key to energy independence         Barely 2 percent of our electricity comes from oil         Ninety six percent of the energy used to power our cars comes from oil  literally millions of barrels of oil per day  This is unsustainable and dangerous         The Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act aims to strengthen America s security by transforming transportation from the refinery to the tailpipe and each step in between  thus breaking our dependence on foreign oil         We start by making it our national policy to cut consumption by 10 million barrels a day over the next 25 years         First  we need to rethink and then remake our fuel supplies  Gasoline is not the only portable source of stored energy  Tons of agricultural waste and millions of acres of idle grassland can be used to create billions of barrels of new fuels         Our farmers could soon be measuring production in barrels of energy as well as bushels of food        Then we must remake our automobile engines as well  Vehicles that get 500 miles per gallon  or that use no refined crude oil  are within our grasp  I know that sounds unbelievable  I am going to tell you how we can do it         To help us get there  our bill also requires that by 2012  10 percent of all vehicles sold in the U S  be hybrid  hybrid electric plug in or alternative fuel vehicles  That number will rise by 10 percent a year until it reaches 50 percent in 2016         It will take time to change the composition of the US automobile fleet   The average American automobile might remain in operation for 15 years or more   This means that it is essential that we begin immediately to deploy oil saving technologies          To help spur this market along  our bill amends our current energy policy to require that one quarter of federal vehicles purchased must be hybrids or plug in hybrids         Our bill will detail how we can get there with available technology and previously unavailable Federal Government leadership  Coupling these new programs with the explicit oil savings goals for the Federal Government is the key to the effectiveness of this proposal         I can almost hear colleagues murmur  So  Senator Lieberman  what else is new  We ve been hearing this for years and nothing has happened         I can t blame you if you are skeptical  The struggle for oil independence has been going on at least since Jimmy Carter was President         But things have changed since the days of Jimmy Carter and even since last summer  There is a new understanding of the depth of the crisis that our oil dependence is creating         Last summer s doubling of gasoline and crude oil prices hit tens of millions of Americans with the global reality of oil demand and pricing  And Hurricane Katrina reminded us how vulnerable our supplies can become         This reality is bipartisan  And  along with my colleagues cosponsoring this bill  I think Americans are ready to set the serious goals that eluded us in the past and take the bold steps necessary to reach those goals         Now let me give you more details         No single technology will resolve all our energy needs in the foreseeable future   Instead  we rely on a wide array of fuel and automotive technologies that are already on the shelf or in development          The bill that we proposed puts our Nation s transportation system on a new road  a road where the tanks are filled with more home grown fuel  and I do mean grown  not just American corn  but from American sugar  prairie grass  and agricultural waste         We will push harder for more and quicker production and commercialization of biomass based fuels        The Energy bill signed into law last summer created a new set of incentives for these fuel alternatives  including their commercial production         What our bill would do  again  by including a mass production mandate for alternative fuel vehicles  is ensure that the investments would be made in the facilities to produce and market these new fuels by providing big demand for them         The bill would also create a program to guarantee that filling stations had the pumps to provide the fuel to keep pace with the growing alternative fuel fleet produced by the mandate         Is there a model to give us confidence we can achieve this transformation  Yes         Brazil is now enjoying substantial immunity from current high world oil prices  thanks to a long term strategy  launched during the oil shocks of the 1970s  to integrate sugar cane ethanol into its fuel supply  They started initially with a mandate that all fuel sold in the country contain 25 percent alcohol  They are now up to 40 percent biofuels         In addition to the fuel mandate  Brazil offered low interest loans and tax breaks for the building of distilleries and subsidized a fuel distribution network         Brazil has the advantage of a substantial sugar cane industry already in place  But we have our own vast potential to develop our own biofuel supply  using feedstock like corn  crop waste  switch grass  sugarcane and fast growing trees and shrubs such as hybrid poplars and willows         According to the Department of Energy  if two thirds of the Nation s idled cropland were used to grow these kinds of energy crops  the result could be dramatic  Those 35 million acres could produce between 15 and 35 billion gallons of ethanol each year to fuel cars  trucks  and buses         That is about 2 2 million barrels of fuel a day from right here in the U S A         What Brazil offers us  more importantly  is a case study of government leadership to combine technology mandates and subsidies to wean its transportation sector from foreign oil to a domestic alternative         The Congressional Research Service estimates that in the year 2005  we sent almost  225 Billion out of the country to purchase oil  while the Brazilians are now relying on home grown fuel         The key to their success is that they responded 30 years ago to the first storm warnings  We did not  and now the storm is at our shores  slapping against the levees of our economic strength and national security  We have to mobilize and lead a similar response as Brazil did         If we do this right  our farmers could soon be measuring production in barrels of energy as well as bushels of food  Our energy would be guaranteed   Made in America   and the profits would be guaranteed   Kept in America           For all these new fuels to be effective  we need the flexible fuel vehicles that can take advantage of them         As I said earlier  our bill also requires that 50 percent of all vehicles sold in the U S  be hybrid  hybrid electric plug in  or alternative fuel vehicles by 2016         Sound ambitious  It is not  It has already happened in Brazil  Several automakers selling cars in Brazil  including our own General Motors and Ford  already manufacture a fleet that is more than 50 percent flexible fuel cars that can run on any combination of gasoline and biofuels        The technology exists now and adds a negligible cost  about  150  to the price of each vehicle  For this we get the flexibility to power a car with fuel made from corn  prairie grass  or agricultural waste from our own heartland that will cost a lot less than gasoline does today        Maximizing fuel efficiency and promoting energy independence even further would be a new generation of flexible fuel hybrid cars known as plug ins because you can plug them in at night to recharge the battery        Hybrids that use both a gasoline engine and electric motor for power are already getting 50 miles per gallon  Making them flexible fuel cars  as I ve already said  can save us more than 2 million barrels of gasoline a day        But we can do even better  dramatically better  with the plug in hybrid that is just now on the threshold of commercialization  Like the present hybrids  it would use both a gasoline and electric motor  But the plug in hybrid would be able to use the battery exclusively for the first 30 miles of a trip        Think of that for a minute  Although Americans drive about 2 2 trillion miles a year  according the Census  the vast majority of those trips are less than 15 miles        That means a plug in hybrid would use zero  zero  gallons of gas or any combustible fuel for the vast majority of its trips  And experts tell me it could effectively get the 500 miles per gallon on longer trips        Plugging in your car during off peak hours  when power is in surplus and cheaper  would soon just become part of the modem daily routine  like plugging in your cell phone or PDA before you go to bed        And off peak electricity can be the equivalent of 50 cent a gallon gasoline  I repeat  the equivalent of 50 cent a gallon fuel is feasible        Of course  electricity does not come magically through the wires to our homes  That power would come from coal  natural gas  nuclear  solar  wind or other sources  sources that we have in abundance here at home  and a little  very little  would come from oil        This isn t pie in the sky  These vehicles could be in your garage within a couple of years  Some of the incentives for achieving this were included in the Energy bill signed into law in August  But they did not go nearly far enough        We need to couple these incentives with real performance standards and sales requirements to ensure that as soon as possible new cars are running not just on gasoline but on biofuels and electricity        As always  there is a do nothing crowd that says the ever rising price of gasoline and crude oil are the cure  that with higher prices people will reduce consumption and the market will respond with greater investments in the supply of oil to bring prices down        But all that would do is perpetuate the problem  Market driven oil dependency is still dependency on foreign oil  driving us further down the current path toward national insecurity and economic and environmental troubles        Some say that we can ease the crisis through greater domestic drilling  in places like the Arctic Refuge and other public lands or off our shores        But that won t make a dent in the problem  In the world of oil  geology is destiny and the U S  today has only 1 percent of the world s oil reserves  And that small new supply wouldn t matter much in the global market  since the price of oil produced within the United States rises and falls with the global market  regardless of where it is produced        We just don t have enough oil in the U S  anymore  And no matter how much more we drill  we will still be paying the world price of oil  not an American price        Our present energy and transportation systems were born at the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th centuries with the twin discoveries of oil extraction and the internal combustion engine  Those systems have served us well bringing growth to our Nation and the world        But it is now the 21st century  and it is time to move on  The era of big oil is over  It is time to revolutionize our entire energy infrastructure  from the refinery to the tailpipe  and begin a new era of energy independence        It is time to set America free by cutting our dependence on foreign oil and by doing so strengthen our security  preserve our independence and energize our economy        30
