Improve Communications for First Responders

Sustainable  Interoperable Communications Equipment       WASHINGTON  DC     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  have introduced legislation to help ensure that our nation   s first responders have the most up to date communications systems possible with the ability to communicate with one another during emergencies  The bill would provide  400 million in grant dollars to states and communities the first year  with gradual increases over the next five years  to assist in the sustainability and compatibility of communications systems   The bill is expected to be considered by the Committee at a business meeting on Thursday         One of the many lessons we can take from the Hurricane Katrina disaster is that many communities throughout the nation still do not have the communications infrastructure in place for first responders to communicate with one another during an emergency  We have heard from community leaders throughout the nation that this is a major concern  which should be immediately addressed   Our legislation builds on work that we have done in the past on this matter  It will help ensure that our first responders have effective and interoperable communications systems  which are critical during any emergency     said Senators Collins         This bill takes an important step towards improving emergency communications nationwide so no community experiences the communications failure we saw in parts of the Gulf Coast in the wake of Hurricane Katrina     said Senator Lieberman      The attack of 9 11 highlighted the problem of interoperability  dramatically showing how vulnerable our first responders are in an emergency when police and firefighters are unable to communicate with each other   Hurricane Katrina spotlighted an even more severe problem     operability     the need for systems that themselves can survive a disaster  either natural or manmade  Katrina has shown us that without a working communications system a coordinated response to an emergency becomes close to impossible   This bill addresses the challenges of both interoperability and operability         Senators John McCain  R Ariz   Carl Levin  D Mich   and Daniel Akaka  D Hi   are co sponsors      Collins and Lieberman  who coauthored the intelligence reform legislation last year  pointed out that the 9 11 Commission report cited the inability of emergency responders to communicate with one another as a serious problem  Four years later  and following the worst natural disaster in our nation   s history  communications among emergency responders still have proven to be a problem      The    Assure Emergency and Interoperable Communications for First Responders Act of 2005     or EICOM Act would provide dedicated funding  strengthen federal leadership and fortify outreach and technical assistance to state and local first responders so that police officers  firefighters  and emergency medical workers can talk to one another across jurisdictional  departmental  and geographic boundaries     even in the wake of a disaster       Specifically  the bill         establishes an Office for Emergency Communications  Interoperability and Compatibility  within the Department of Homeland Security charged with promoting interoperability and finding ways to establish emergency communications capabilities when a terrorist attack or natural disaster has damaged or destroyed usual communications and electrical infrastructure           directs the Secretary of DHS to establish a comprehensive  competitive research and development program to identify and answer the policy and technology questions necessary to sustain emergency communications capabilities and achieve interoperability        directs the Secretary of DHS to establish at least two pilot projects to help develop and test working emergency communications systems for first responders and government officials that will survive a natural disaster or terrorist attack        establishes a dedicated grant program for states and localities to assist them in developing and implementing emergency and interoperable communications capabilities  Total grant amounts would start at  400 000 000 for fiscal year 2006  rising to  1 billion by 2010       30
