resolution  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  will propose a tax to fund the military costs of the war against Islamist terrorism and to fund the health care needs of our soldiers and veterans   The amendment calls for the government to raise an additional  250B in revenues   50B per year for 5 years  and to spend it for National Defense and for Veterans  Benefits and Services       Senator Lieberman states   Every American has a responsibility to share in the burden that our soldiers are now carrying in defense of our freedom   and that means paying the costs of this war more adequately and equitably than we are today    Because we are each threatened by this inhumane enemy  each of us should contribute a little bit more to guarantee its defeat  The support our troops tax I envision would be a small  progressive increase for all Americans who pay income taxes        Senator Lieberman continues   My amendment today and the tax increase it proposes will not weaken our resilient economy  It will not deprive the American people of the many comforts they enjoy  But it will begin to restore a sense of shared service and sacrifice to our people  and a sense of fiscal responsibility to our government   and it will begin to provide all that is required by our military to achieve victory in the long struggle ahead against radical Islam         We all prefer lower taxes  But we live at a time in history that requires more than what we prefer   a moment when we must appreciate what kind of nation we are and understand what we must do together to preserve the security and freedoms we cherish        Concluding his remarks  Senator Lieberman does not call for a vote for the amendment  but remarks   I am not asking for a vote on this amendment today  I have filed it as a plea to my colleagues to join with me in truly giving our troops and veterans the support they deserve  My purpose is to begin a legislative effort that will ultimately succeed in securing the additional revenues our troops and veterans need  We will not solve this problem today  but we cannot afford to put it off for much longer  It is imperative that this Congress address this issue of shared sacrifice  in order to prevail in the long war that we are fighting  Let us truly put meaning in the declaration that we    each and every American    support our troops  as they put their lives at risk for us        Below is the full text of Senator Lieberman s remarks  as prepared for delivery       Mr  President  on September 11  2001  our nation was attacked by radical Islamist terrorists  and a long war began       It is a war different than any we have fought before because of the willingness of our enemies to attack innocent American civilians here at home by killing themselves  They hate us more than they love their own lives       But it is also a war that is like other  long wars we have fought throughout our history  in which we were pitted against a great evil   an evil that threatened not just the security of our society  but the ideals and values that form the bedrock of our way of life        In the Civil War  we fought against the evil of slavery   in World War II  against the evil of fascism   in the Cold War  against the evil of communism  Today we are fighting against the evil of Islamist extremism       In each of these past struggles  our nation fully mobilized  We rallied as only a free people are capable of doing  millions of citizens bound together  shoulder to shoulder  in defense of our freedom  with a shared sense of service  sacrifice  and support of our troops       Our sacrifices went far beyond the battlefield  They suffused our society  In each of these past struggles  those Americans who were not asked to put on a uniform nonetheless shared in the burdens imposed by war  That is how democracies should go to war       Today  we find ourselves engaged in another global struggle for freedom   a struggle that stretches from the mountains of Afghanistan to the streets of Baghdad  from the jungles of Southeast Asia to the deserts of Somalia  from the nightclubs of Bali to the subways of London       Our military is fully engaged in this war  but most of the rest of America is not  Five years after September 11  very little has been asked of the American people        Instead of mobilizing as a nation  the burden of this war has fallen disproportionately on the few    on our soldiers  our brave men and women in uniform  They are the ones who have put their lives on the line so that freedom may prevail       In this chamber  and across our land  there have been great differences of opinion about how we should pursue the war in Iraq  but there has been great unity of opinion that our troops there should be honored  We must support them        That has been the common banner under which all of us have rallied time and again  We support our troops  We say it on the floor of this chamber almost every day  We support our troops  We say it on television and the radio  We support our troops  We put it on the bumpers of our cars  We support our troops       But can we honestly say that we have all done all we can to support our troops and our veterans  No  we cannot       Our Army and Marine Corps are stretched to the breaking point  short on personnel  equipment  and training        Our Navy has fallen dangerously below 300 ships  Our Air Force is being forced to cut 57 000 personnel in the next five years  And every person in this chamber knows about the terrible conditions at Walter Reed Building 18   and the larger crisis in health care for our soldiers and our veterans lurking just beneath it       No one can possibly look at our troops or veterans today and feel satisfied that we are doing all that we can to support them       Some say these problems are only temporary   that once we leave Iraq  everything will be fine for our military        But this war is not just about Iraq  It is a global conflict with Islamist extremists who have declared war on most of the rest of the world       Even if the war in Iraq ended tomorrow  tens of thousands of our soldiers will still be needed in Afghanistan  throughout the Middle East  in the Balkans  in the Horn of Africa  and everywhere where freedom is being challenged        Even if the war in Iraq ended tomorrow  our military will still be twice busy as it was during the Cold War  confronting the inhumane and brutal threat of radical Islam and guarding against the rise of a hostile superpower elsewhere in the world        During the Second World War  our government raised taxes and we spent as much as 30 percent of our Gross Domestic Product to defeat fascism and Nazism  During the war in Korea  we raised taxes and spent fourteen percent of GDP on our military  During Vietnam  we raised taxes and spent nine percent of GDP on the war        Today  in the midst of a war against a brutal enemy in a dangerous world  we have cut taxes and are spending less than five percent of GDP to support our military        Mr  President  we need to confront the reality that the defense of freedom is not cheap  Our soldiers know that  Their families know that  But we as a society don t seem to know that  We are failing to pay the full price that we are obligated to pay to protect our security and our liberty        In contrast to past wars  we are failing as a society to share in shouldering the costs of this war against Islamist extremists       In his 1942 State of the Union address  just a few weeks after the deadly attack on Pearl Harbor  Franklin Roosevelt spoke to our nation about the sacrifice demanded of a democracy that is sending its bravest into harm s way  to defend its way of life        War costs money   President Roosevelt said   That means taxes and bonds and bonds and taxes    In a word  it means an  all out  war by individual effort and family effort in a united country          Mr  President  we have a responsibility in this Congress to give our troops the support they need in the world war we are in against the terrorists who attacked us on September 11  2001   and that means  an all out war by individual effort and family effort in a united country         Every American has a responsibility to share in the burden that our soldiers are now carrying in defense of our freedom   and that means paying the costs of this war more adequately and equitably than we are today       It is not an acceptable answer to push the sacrifice of this war against terrorism onto our children and grandchildren through deficit spending  as we have been doing  And it is not an acceptable answer to pay the costs of this war by squeezing important domestic programs  as we have been doing       It is a false choice to suggest we must skimp at home in order to protect our security abroad  We are a great nation  a great economy  and we are capable of doing both        That was the America of Franklin Roosevelt  the America of Harry Truman  the America of John F  Kennedy  and the America of Ronald Reagan  And that must be the America of today       Everyone here supports our troops  Now it is time to translate that support into national policy  It is the time to put our money where our mouth is        And that is why I have filed an amendment to enact a support our troops tax to help pay for the war against radical Islamists       Because we are each threatened by this inhumane enemy  each of us should contribute a little bit more to guarantee its defeat  The support our troops tax I envision would be a small  progressive increase for all Americans who pay income taxes       The revenues from this tax can only be spent for our troops and our veterans  and must be on top of any other funds that would otherwise be appropriated for them       My amendment today and the tax increase it proposes will not weaken our resilient economy        It will not deprive the American people of the many comforts they enjoy  But it will begin to restore a sense of shared service and sacrifice to our people  and a sense of fiscal responsibility to our government   and it will begin to provide all that is required by our military to achieve victory in the long struggle ahead against radical Islam        We all prefer lower taxes  But we live at a time in history that requires more than what we prefer   a moment when we must appreciate what kind of nation we are and understand what we must do together to preserve the security and freedoms we cherish       I am not asking for a vote on this amendment today  I have filed it as a plea to my colleagues to join with me in truly giving our troops and veterans the support they deserve        My purpose is to begin a legislative effort that will ultimately succeed in securing the additional revenues our troops and veterans need  We will not solve this problem today  but we cannot afford to put it off for much longer        It is imperative that this Congress address this issue of shared sacrifice  in order to prevail in the long war that we are fighting  Let us truly put meaning in the declaration that we    each and every American    support our troops  as they put their lives at risk for us        30
