                                                                                                                                             Opposes Republican special interest giveaway to insurance companies            WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today joined four other Democratic Senate colleagues in standing up for safeguards that protect patients in Connecticut and across the country   At a Capitol Hill press conference  Lieberman and Senators Patrick Leahy  D VT   Patty Murray  D WA   Thomas Carper  D DE  and Maria Cantwell  D WA  expressed their opposition to S  1955  the Health Insurance Marketplace Modernization and Affordability Act offered by Senator Mike Enzi  R WY    The Senate is expected to vote on invoking cloture on the Enzi bill later today and Senator Lieberman will be joining his Democratic colleagues in voting to oppose cloture        According to a study conducted by Families USA  the Enzi bill  which is the centerpiece of the Senate Republicans       Health Week     would cause nearly 1 1 million small business employees in Connecticut and more than 85 million throughout the nation to lose important consumer protections and benefits  which now apply to their health insurance   Those lost benefits would include contraception  emergency services  hearing aids and mammography screening   The Enzi bill also makes it easier for insurance companies to    cherry pick    or discriminate against workers that are older  sicker  or have chronic diseases  Some estimate these people will have to pay up to 26 times more than people that are younger and healthier for coverage           This bill takes a bad situation     the 46 million Americans who have no health insurance     and makes it worse by reducing the level of guaranteed care  increasing the price and eliminating consumer protections for all existing health care insurance policies     said Lieberman      By doing so  this bill actually violates the prime tenet of heath care  which says     First  do no harm      But the Republicans think this is such a good idea they made it the centerpiece of their    so called    health week  rather than extending the Medicare Part D deadline  or allowing the Department of Health and Human Services to negotiate for better drug prices for Medicare            Lieberman and other Democrats offered their own small business health care plan  the Small Employers Health Benefits Program  SEHBP     SEHBP  introduced by Senators Dick Durbin  D IL  and Blanche Lincoln  D AR   would make health care more affordable to small businesses and their employees without stripping away these critical consumer protections that would safeguard nondiscriminatory regulations in the insurance industry   The proposed SEHBP bill aims to address the barriers to small businesses in purchasing health insurance for their employees  The legislation would connect small businesses and their employees across America in one insurance pool  similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program  FEHBP   and decrease the cost of their health insurance   In addition  SEHBP would authorize the Office of Personnel Management  OPM  to administer the program and enter into risk sharing contracts with insurance companies  as it does for federal employees  and offer tax subsidies as high as 25  of the cost of the premium to small businesses that participate in SEHBP         By contrast  the Enzi bill being considered by the Senate would make it more difficult for states to protect consumers from insurance fraud  unfair denials of care  and marketing abuses  The bill would also create a new national commission that would be responsible for writing rules that threaten to make it more difficult for states to protect consumers from insurers   Six of the 14 voting members of the commission will come directly from the insurance industry  while no consumer representative will be allowed to vote        The Families USA study found that the Enzi bill bars states from enforcing laws that would                      Mandate coverage of benefits                     Prevent discrimination against providers or require coverage of providers    services                     Limit rates charged by small group market insurers                     Set standards for insurers    filing of forms and rate information                    Set standards for review of insurers    conduct                     Require prompt payment of claims  and                    Set standards for how insurers handle claims and respond to consumers    appeals of denials of care           I know this is a bad bill     Lieberman said      As Attorney General of Connecticut  I stood with consumers and took the insurance industry to court over issues like anti trust  discrimination against women and mental health benefits   I wouldn   t have been able to do that under this bill  This bill wipes out all state insurance regulations in favor of rules that will be written by a new national commission made up largely of insurance industry representatives           Click  to see the impact of the Enzi bill on Connecticut         30
