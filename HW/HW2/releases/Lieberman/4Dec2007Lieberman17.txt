                                                                                                                                        Having spent much of the past year mired in legislative trench warfare over Iraq  advocates in Congress seeking a mandatory withdrawal of troops are now refusing to pass funding for our forces deployed in Iraq or Afghanistan     For Congress to fail to provide the funds needed by our soldiers in the field is inexcusable under any circumstances    but it is especially disappointing right now  coming at the very moment when Gen  David Petraeus and his troops are achieving the kind of progress in Iraq that few would have dared imagine possible just a few months ago     We recently traveled to Iraq  where we saw and heard firsthand about the remarkable transformation that our brave men and women in uniform have succeeded in bringing about this year     As every major news outlet now acknowledges  security has improved dramatically across Iraq since Gen  Petraeus took command and began implementing a bold new counterinsurgency strategy    the so called  surge   Today  rocket and mortar attacks have dropped to their lowest levels in 21 months  Car bombs and suicide attacks in Baghdad have plummeted 70 percent  Iraqi civilian casualties are sharply down throughout Iraq  And the number of U S  soldiers killed in action has fallen for five straight months and is now at the lowest level in nearly two years     Simply put  a year ago  al Qaida was winning in Iraq  Now we are     Our soldiers know they have seized the momentum in this fight     Idealistic and innovative  they rightly recognize what has happened this year under Gen  Petraeus as one of the most extraordinary turnarounds in American military history     As a result of the hard won gains our troops have secured  Gen  Petraeus has been able to initiate a drawdown of U S  forces  The first 5 000 American troops are now on their way out of Iraq  with more likely to follow in the months ahead  However  we should not have an automatic timetable for withdrawing brigades  Gen  Petraeus should decide the size of the force he needs to maintain security and keep our enemies on the run     The success that Gen  Petraeus and his troops have achieved could provide the foundation for a new bipartisan consensus about Iraq in Washington  All of us  after all  want our troops to succeed in Iraq so that they can begin to come home with honor     Unfortunately  too many Democrats have thus far been reluctant to welcome the reality of progress    instead searching for ways to deny or disparage it     In particular  Democrats have seized on the lackluster performance of the Iraqi government to insist that we should abandon Gen  Petraeus  successful strategy and withdraw far more of our troops  far faster  than he recommends   This would be a terrible mistake     There is no question Iraq s national leaders must do more to promote reconciliation and improve governance in the months ahead     But the fact is  there has been enormous political progress in Iraq at the local and provincial levels thanks to the surge  as Sunni and Shiite leaders have stepped forward to fight against the extremists in their communities   Building on these gains is going to require deft diplomacy and subtle statecraft from the United States    not declarations of defeat     And whatever the failings of the imperfect  fledgling democracy in Baghdad  they do not justify abandoning it to the al Qaida fanatics and Iranian backed terrorists who are trying to destroy it     And make no mistake  Despite the progress we have achieved this year  there is no cause for complacency  Just as we have managed to turn failure into success in 2007  we can likewise turn success back into failure in 2008  if we are not careful     As Brig  Gen  Joe Fil  the commander of U S  forces in Baghdad  recently put it  al Qaida in Iraq is now off balance  but they will come swinging back at us  if we give them the chance     That is why Congress  failure to fund our troops is so profoundly reckless     Nine months ago  when Gen  Petraeus took command in Baghdad  people of good conscience could disagree about whether his new counterinsurgency strategy would succeed  After so many mistakes and missteps by the Bush administration in Iraq  many Americans were understandably skeptical about the possibility of success   Now  however  the evidence is unequivocal  The surge is working     Rather than holding hostage the funding for our troops in the field and writing off the hard won gains they are secured  it is time for Democrats and Republicans alike to recognize the extraordinary progress that Gen  Petraeus  strategy has achieved    and build a new political consensus around it     Just as we demand Iraqi leaders take advantage of the success of the surge to set aside their sectarian agendas and pursue peace  so too it is time for Congress to stop playing senseless partisan games and instead fund our troops    who have accomplished so much    without delay  They deserve nothing less    Sen  John McCain is a candidate for the Republican nomination for President
