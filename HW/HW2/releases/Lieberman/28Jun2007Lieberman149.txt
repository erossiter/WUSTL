embarked on a process within their subcommittee of drawing upon existing bills and new ideas to construct a new  bipartisan  economy wide  cap and trade climate bill over the weeks ahead      I believe that Senator Warner s commitment to this effort represents a true breakthrough   said Lieberman    In our meetings on this issue  Senator Warner has impressed me enormously   as he always has in our years here together   with his common sense  his concern for the long term wellbeing of the American people  and his apolitical  fact based approach to problem solving      This innovative bipartisan endeavor has already garnered praise from several leading business and environmental groups     Steven Kline  Vice President of Environmental and Federal Affairs for PG Corporation   PG

legislation  We welcome the opportunity to work with the senators and the committee in support of their efforts to develop meaningful legislation to address this pressing issue      The Clean Energy

being done in a bipartisan way by two very thoughtful Senators  which gives us confidence they will draft policy worthy of the challenge     Fred Krupp  President of Environmental Defense   This helps put the Senate right where it needs to be   on track with the mainstream of Americans and U S  business leaders calling for action   We need to get on the path to emissions reductions now   not in the

gets us where the science says we need to be     Steve Cochran  National Climate Campaign Director at Environmental Defense   This is huge  Joe Lieberman and John Warner are clearing the path for a bill that protects the climate and strengthens the economy  and that s the kind of plan both sides of the aisle can support     David Hawkins  Director of the National Resources Defense Council s
