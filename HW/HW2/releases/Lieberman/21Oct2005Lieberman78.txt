Study of Globalization   s Conference     Looking Beyond Kyoto       New Haven  Connecticut                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As prepared for delivery        Good afternoon  I want to thank Center Director and former President of Mexico Ernesto Zedillo and the Yale Center for the Study of Globalization for hosting this conference and inviting me to join you        It   s a pleasure to have this chance to speak     right here at my alma mater and in my hometown     with this distinguished group of scientists  scholars and researchers from around the world about our shared challenge     global warming        I   d like to welcome you all with the words of my fellow Connecticut Yankee  Mark Twain  who once said     The domain of science is a republic  And all its citizens are brothers and equals           Of course  the Republic of Science     like any good republic     can be a cluttered  clattering place as ideas and counter ideas are debated hotly and openly among those equals         But in science  ideas are accepted  discarded or improved upon based upon evidence  not oratory        This process     this scientific method     has always tended to lead us toward the truth and a better understanding of our world     our universe     and our place in it  It has also  of course  protected us from danger and enabled us to realize extraordinary progress        The theory of global warming is one of these ideas and has been debated since it was first proposed around the beginning of the 20th Century  But after a century of debate  the evidence is in  Global warming is real  And it is significantly manmade         That makes the topic of this conference        Looking Beyond Kyoto        all the more compelling because the industrialized and newly industrialized nations together face a staggering challenge  To deal with global warming we must remake global energy policy        It   s a challenge that should excite the mind of everyone in this room and the people of all the nations you represent because it can engage the better angels of our nature with this chance to build a better  safer world        I see within our reach a world where the clear skylines of the world   s great cities are lit with clean power as automobiles pass in the streets below leaving little or no emissions behind        We can do it  In fact  must do it        The phrases    global warming    and    climate change    are almost too tame for the challenge that actually confronts us         Yes  global warming is an environmental problem  But at its core it is also an unprecedented opportunity to build a framework for mutual security among the world   s nations as well        Left unchecked  our common energy demands already have us on a collision course for scarce energy sources that could lead to greater diplomatic and military tensions around the world     including wars     as the oil dependent nations compete for secure energy supplies from the oil exporting nations        World oil demand is now about 83 million barrels a day     and growing     with the United States using about 20 million of those now     and growing        Couple that competition with the predicted environmental consequences of unchecked global warming  and we could also find the world   s nations in competition for food  fresh water  medicine and other basic necessities of life on earth        Wars have begun over such competition as well         And nature doesn   t care about the competition among nations  When it comes to the environment     and the wise use of energy     the Earth has a way of showing us our folly not in enigmatic whispers but in hard declarations that come with punishing consequences and care nothing for international borders        Civilizations that ignored nature   s warning in the past have vanished  And we put ourselves in peril if we ignore the signs we see today         Recently released climate data show that 2005 is on track to be the hottest year on record  with a companion record shrinking of the Arctic sea ice and unprecedented high ocean temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico        We just had the most active Atlantic hurricane season in more than 70 years that included the catastrophic Hurricane Katrina         Now while you can   t single out any single event  like Hurricane Katrina  and say it   s due to global warming  the statistical evidence for the theory keeps piling up         Today we can see the problem is no longer just a theoretical warning from scientific models but is coming as a relentless force of nature        I commend the 140 nations     many represented here today     that ratified the Kyoto Protocol and brought it into force        It   s time for the United States to step up and do its part         If the leadership of the United States does not come to grips with the facts that we need a new energy policy     a policy that moves us away from oil     and a policy that reduces the carbon emissions that cause global warming     we are not only putting this nation   s security  economy and public health at risk     but the world   s as well        Fortunately I think things are changing in the United States         This summer   s twin calamities of Hurricane Katrina and high gasoline prices reminded Americans that global warming will have catastrophic consequences for us and that our total dependence on oil to fuel our transportation system will leave our economy forever vulnerable to markets beyond our control     and with ever higher prices guaranteed        There are two pieces of legislation I will be pushing that will both lower carbon emissions and reduce oil dependence in the United States        The first is the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act sponsored by Senator John McCain and me that would rollback greenhouse gas emissions in the U S  to 2000 levels by the end of this decade        The goals of the Climate Stewardship Act are not as ambitious as those set out in the Kyoto Protocol   But it does put in place a cap and trade system  similar to Kyoto   s and to the European Union   s emissions trading system  which would help integrate U S  efforts to curb global warming with those of the rest of the world        And just getting a U S  cap and trade system in place would at least get this nation into the fight and could be made more aggressive over time        America s adoption of its own cap and trade program will go a long way to creating the next steps for Kyoto  With the U S  joining the climate fight  and a robust greenhouse emissions market going forward  other high emitting countries  not now part of Kyoto  may also join the fight to create a truly global regime for combating climate change        As many of you may know  earlier this year we offered the Climate Stewardship Act as an amendment to national energy legislation         Although it was defeated by a vote of 60 to 38  the Senate passed a resolution that endorsed the fundamental principals of our legislation  including mandatory cuts in U S  greenhouse gas emissions        That was a significant first statement by the Senate about where this nation must go     a turning point I believe        So we will try again next year  And we will keep trying until it becomes law         Beyond the need to fight global warming  we need a new energy policy     both for U S  national security as well as mutual global security     that will move the U S  away from our near total dependence on oil to fuel our transportation systems        There is only one way to do this  We need to transform the total U S  transportation infrastructure from the refinery to the tailpipe and each step in between        The bill I plan to soon introduce     with bipartisan support     begins with two mandates on energy and vehicles        First  that the United States save 5 million barrels of oil a day within 10 years  and 10 million barrels a day within 20 years        Second  that within two years  10 percent of new cars sold in the U S  be hybrid  hybrid electric plug in or alternative fuel vehicles and that within seven years 50 percent of the new cars sold in the U S  be made up of those combinations        To reach these goals  first we need to rethink and then remake our fuel supplies  Gasoline is not the only portable source of stored energy         Tons of agricultural waste and millions of acres of idle grassland can be used to produce between 15 to 35 billion gallons of ethanol each year  which could lead to an eight to 10 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions as well        But we must remake our automobile engines as well  For instance  plug in hybrid vehicles     now nearing the threshold of commercialization     would be able to use their batteries exclusively for the first 30 miles of a trip        Think of that for a minute  Although Americans drive about 2 2 million miles a year  the vast majority of those trips are less than 15 miles  That means a plug in hybrid would use zero     ZERO     gallons of gas or any combustible fuel for the vast majority of its trips  And it could effectively get 500 miles per gallon on longer trips        This is not fantasy  These vehicles could be in our garages in a few years        Of course  electricity to charge the batteries of a plug in hybrid does not come magically and pollution free through the wires to our homes  That power would come from coal  natural gas  nuclear  solar  wind or other sources that make up the U S  power grid        But studies have shown that even when you factor in the increased demand for electricity  plug in hybrids will still generate 35 percent less carbon emissions than a standard hybrid and 65 percent less than the average car        Can we do it  Of course we can  And the United States     as the world   s leading energy consumer and source of carbon emissions     must play a leading role         We cannot stand aside from the rest of the world and say     Okay  You first     That timidity is bad for America and bad for the world        Frankly  we don   t have a choice  History offers us a lesson right here on the North American continent of the costs of sticking with the status quo when nature has told us to change        The future can be as fragile as our timidity or as bold as our imagination and resolve if we work together to meet this global challenge       And we are going to depend on you     the Republic of Science     and meetings like this to help guide our actions and also inform public opinion about the need for change        The status quo is not our friend  Rather it must be the constant casualty of time and leadership as we move ahead     not as individual nations but as a global community solving a global challenge with the United States taking its rightful     and needed     place as a leader         Thank you and now I   d be glad to take some questions         30
