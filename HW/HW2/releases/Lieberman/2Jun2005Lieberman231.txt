delegation is strongly urging the Federal Aviation Administration to reconsider its announced plan to privatize the jobs of 2 500 air traffic specialists     over 50 of whom are employed in Connecticut       In a letter to FAA Administrator Marion C  Blakey  the state   s two Senators and five Representatives argued that the security nature of the air traffic specialists    duties are    inherently governmental    and should not be    subject to private sector pressures               We strongly believe that aviation safety and security considerations should be addressed by federal government employees working locally  and not subject to private sector pressures     the delegation wrote      The closing of the Connecticut Station jeopardizes aviation safety            Air traffic specialists provide flight advisory and weather pattern information to general aviation pilots  and ensure that airspace for private and corporate aircraft remains safe  As part of its privatization plan  the FAA plans to close 38 air traffic centers nationwide   This would mean the loss of over 50 jobs in Connecticut  effective October 1  2005  and the transfer to Virginia of the regional hub now located at Sikorsky Airport in Stratford        Other air traffic specialist locations in Maine  Vermont  New York  Pennsylvania and New Jersey will also be closed  leaving a location in Long Island temporarily open as the only operating facility providing pertinent flight advisory information and weather reports to pilots in the Northeast           It does not make sense to us for someone in Virginia to provide this kind of local flight information for the New England area     the letter said     Knowledge about local conditions  weather  and geographic considerations are an instrumental part of providing aviation safety and security services           If the FAA   s plan is carried out  many of the air traffic specialists at Sikorsky stand to lose their retirement and health benefits  the lawmakers warned   They asked Administrator Blakey to review the contract to ensure it protects benefits the workers have rightfully earned       The delegation is also behind legislation to block implementation of the FAA proposal       Following is a copy of the letter       June 1  2005      The Honorable Marion C  Blakey  Administrator  Federal Aviation Administration  800 Independence Ave   S W   Washington  D C  20591      Dear Administrator Blakey       We are writing to express our strong opposition to the Federal Aviation Administration   s  FAA   s  decision to privatize the vital work performed at Automated Flight Service Stations  AFSSs  across the country   The decision will cause the termination by FAA of thousands of dedicated air traffic controllers  on whom pilots have relied for decades for information essential to flight safety   For years many of us in Congress have argued that the sensitive function performed by these air traffic controllers is inherently governmental  and should not be put up for bid to private sector contractors   It is not too late for the agency to reverse its flawed decision   We request that you cancel the contract award and ensure that air traffic control specialists remain trusted public servants        The decision to privatize this work would result in the closing of the FAA   s AFSS in Stratford  Connecticut   The Stratford AFSS advises pilots about factors such as pre flight and in flight weather information  suggests routes of flight  altitudes  and indications of turbulence or icing  and provides pilots with information about temporary flight restrictions around restricted and prohibited areas          The FAA recently conducted a public private competition for the provision of services to the aviation industry  and the National Airspace System  by FAA Air Flight Service Stations   The FAA awarded a 5 year contract  with an option for 5 more years  valued at  1 9 billion dollars to Lockheed Martin to operate the FAA   s AFSSs   The contract would close 38 of the current 58 AFSSs  of which Stratford is one and more than 50 jobs for Connecticut workers will be lost       The Stratford AFSS opened in March 1984 and was the nation   s first automated station   In 2003  it provided more than 500 000 flight services and was the 15th busiest in the nation   The Stratford AFSS serves Connecticut  Rhode Island and the eastern two thirds of Massachusetts  Should the Lockheed contract award stand  we understand that the flight service work will be taken over from the Connecticut Air Traffic Control Specialists  ATCSs  and moved to workers in Virginia   It does not make sense to us for someone in Virginia to provide this kind of local flight information for the New England area   Knowledge about local conditions  weather  and geographic considerations are an instrumental part of providing aviation safety and security services   We strongly believe that aviation safety and security considerations should be addressed by federal government employees working locally  and not subject to private sector pressures         Should this contract award go forward  we are very concerned about the affected employees    retirement and health benefits and ask that you review the contract   s impact on these benefits   Specifically  the following issues have been brought to our attention        1          As we understand it  ATCSs can retire with a guaranteed annuity of 50  of their high three salaries provided they meet one of two criteria   a  They can retire at any age but must have performed ATCS duties for minimum of 25 years  or b  They must be 50 years of age or older and have performed ATCS duties for 20 years       As we understand it  on the October conversion date of AFSSs moving to private control  an ATCS who does not meet the above criteria will lose substantially all their retirement contributions because of the application of penalties for failure to achieve minimum terms of service or age  They will also be deprived of federal health insurance benefits    These penalties will accrue to ATCSs because of government actions  not actions taken by the employees  It is wrong that the actions taken by your agency to privatize will have the impact of depriving long standing federal personnel in good standing of substantial retirement and health benefits  We are concerned about how severely the Connecticut employees may be penalized because of their inability to achieve full service time and age requirements       As we understand it  a parallel situation may occur with employees enrolled in the FERS retirement program who suffer the same time problems for service and age requirements       2          ATCS    contribute an extra  5  to fund their ATCS retirement  over the amount that other federal employees pay   PL 108 176 modified the formula used for all ATCS   including supervisors and managers   except personnel working at AFSSs as ATCSs  to an annuity amount calculated as 1 7  average of the high 3 salary years times the number of year employed        While we have received conflicting views on how this provision is to be interpreted  if this provision is interpreted to exempt employees from the 1 7  annuity figure  the formula that would be used for an ATCS would be 1 0  of the high three salary yearly average times the number of years employed   This would occur despite the fact that they have paid in higher contribution levels in order to achieve the 1 7  annuity figure        For the reasons above  we request that you cancel the contract to privatize the ATCS    jobs and leave the Stratford  Connecticut AFSS open   The closing of the Connecticut Station jeopardizes aviation safety         We appreciate your consideration of our request                                                                               Sincerely       Joseph I  Lieberman  United States Senator                                                Chris Dodd  United States Senator      Rosa L  DeLauro  United States Representative                                          Nancy L  Johnson
