Conference on Democracy and Security in Prague  Czech Republic on June 4  2007   Below is the full text of the speech  as delivered        Thank you so much for that kind introduction  Natan  I cannot tell you how grateful I am for all of your work  and the work of Vaclav Havel and Jose Maria Aznar  to bring together the remarkable group of individuals who are assembled in this room  these fighters for freedom  from around the globe        I know that many of you traveled here at great personal risk and in the face of great obstacles  It is a privilege and an honor for me to stand with you        The existence of this conference is itself a testament to the transformative power of the ideals that have brought us together  to the power of brave people of principle to change history  Who would have dreamed two decades ago that democratic dissidents from all over the world would be able to gather in Prague  at the invitation of men who were themselves prisoners of the totalitarian regime that had long ruled this half of Europe  and that many assumed would do so forever  Instead  today  Stalin and Brezhnev are in the dustbin of history  and Havel and Sharansky survive and flourish       The freedom fighters from all around the world who are gathered here today follow in the heroic footsteps of Havel and Sharansky  these two great men who are now taking the candles they lit in the darkest days of communist dictatorship and giving them to you to carry in your struggles against repression and tyranny       We do not doubt for a moment that your struggles are the struggles of heroes        You show fearlessness in the face of regimes built on fear  You find the courage of your convictions to follow the consequences of your convictions        That is why dictators and despots fear you   because you have chosen not to fear them       The choice to confront tyranny is not an easy one  Indeed  you know better than most how difficult it can be for freedom to triumph over fear  for democracy to replace dictatorship  You also know the suffering and setbacks that are part of the march toward freedom  as well as how cruel and tenacious the forces of totalitarianism can be in resisting its advance        But you also know the miraculous expansion of freedom that we have witnessed over the past thirty years  as democracy has spread to regions and countries where many doubted it could ever take root       And you know that in your often lonely  always difficult quest  you are on the right side of history   and I am here to tell you that the United States of America must and will stand by your side as well       It is America s responsibility and purpose as a nation to do so  inscribed for posterity by our founders  who proclaimed that the rights to life and liberty are the endowments of our Creator to every individual human being        I recognize that are those in the United States today who question the wisdom of a commitment to freedom in our foreign policy  who claim it is naive  even dangerous  In particular  I know there are those who will argue that everything that will be said and done at this conference can be refuted by a single word  Iraq        There are voices who will claim that the violence we now see in that country disproves the case for democracy and demonstrates that some people are not ready for the freedoms we enjoy elsewhere in the world  They will say that America s foreign policy should be less principled and more pragmatic  less focused on honoring eternal  universal values and more focused on satisfying shifting national interests        These arguments are gravely mistaken  They misunderstand fundamentally what is happening in Iraq  and they derive precisely the wrong lessons from our experience there  Even more importantly  they profoundly misunderstand America   our ideals  our identity  our very soul as a nation       I have just spent the past ten days traveling in the Middle East  including in Iraq  I met with Arab leaders across the region as well as our military commanders and diplomats there  I also had the privilege of walking the streets of Baghdad and Ramadi with the brave American soldiers who are risking their lives to defend the freedom and safety of the people living there       In the course of this trip  one thing has emerged clear to me       What is happening in the Middle East today is not simply a battle between the United States and its enemies in one particular country  but a much larger struggle between freedom and fear  in which Iraq happens to be the central front  On the one side of this conflict are the latest in a long line of totalitarians  a loose alliance of terrorists and tyrants every bit as fanatical as the fascists and communists with whom they share a hatred of America and the values for which it stands        Terrorism is their preferred weapon  but it is not their ultimate aim  Their vision is far more ambitious and terrifying  a vision of hatred and conquest  in which billions of people fall under a jihadist jackboot of vicious and repressive rule       On the other side of this fight are the overwhelming majority of Arabs and Muslims   a largely silenced majority of people whom I am convinced desire most of all a better life for themselves and for their children  people who like any of us would choose freedom over fear  hope over hatred  justice over tyranny  if given the chance       The outcome of the struggle in Iraq will go a long way towards determining whether our future in Europe  and America  and throughout much of the world belongs to these totalitarians  or to democrats who seek the consent and consensus of the governed        Iraq is about the survival and success of the very ideal of freedom not only in Iraq  but in Iran  and Syria  and the rest of that region  and in a very real way  in the rest of the world       There are some in America today who acknowledge the stakes at play in Iraq  but who then claim that the war there has been too costly  the burden too great  for us to continue to shoulder it  They claim that they support democracy  but just not in Iraq  just not right now       The truth of the matter  however  is that freedom is not divisible  You cannot claim to support the spread of democracy  but profess ambivalence about its fate in Iraq       On the contrary  we have a responsibility to support the forces of freedom not only when it is easy  but when it is hard  Here in Prague  especially  we should remember what happens when the democratic world does not stand united  when its leaders decide that there are places and peoples whose freedom is not worth defending  and abandon them to the forces of tyranny       Today  the choice we face is not simply whether we support the advance of democracy in the abstract  but at what cost we are willing to fight for it       Each of you has an especially important role to play in helping the rest of us   and America in particular   rise to this challenge  Dictators  after all  depend not only on the fear of their victims  but on the indifference of outsiders  and it is the unique power of dissidents to break that spell of indifference       The fact of Soviet tyranny was known to the world long before we first heard the names of Vaclav Havel and Natan Sharansky and Andrei Sakharov  but it was the heroism of these men in the face of Soviet injustice that kindled our moral imagination to see the sufferings of millions more        From their example  we know that a single human face can tear down the faceless inhumanity of an entire system  We know that every dissident has the potential to change history  because history is made not by abstract  inexorable forces  but by human beings like yourselves       And so I say to those in America who insist our foreign policy should be narrowly focused on the pursuit of stability  not freedom  who argue pragmatism and principle are opposing values  and that benign dictatorship is preferable to the disorder of democracy       Look around this room at the faces of the freedom fighters who are here  Look at the faces of the dissidents   and you will have to conclude that you are wrong       There is no such thing as benign dictatorship  and to be a genuine realist today  there is no choice but to heed the call of freedom   for as Natan Sharansky has written  the advance of democracy is the only guarantor of national and international security       We have been blessed throughout American history with leaders who have recognized these powerful truths  A generation ago  it was Ronald Reagan and Senator Scoop Jackson who came to the side of the dissidents in their fight against Soviet totalitarianism  Today  as well  we are fortunate to have a president  George W  Bush  who has given voice to the cause of freedom fighters from Iraq to North Korea to Cuba to Iran and beyond        And he is not alone  Many in Congress of both parties  including myself  are determined to ensure that America s freedom agenda advanced under President Bush continues long after he leaves office       I hope that each of you consider this meeting as the beginning of a partnership for freedom  and I invite each of you to contact me and my office whenever you need our help       History and the heroes in this room tell me that the future does not belong to despots and dictators  It belongs to a labor activist from Teheran  to a journalist from Moscow  to a blogger to Cairo  to a human rights advocate from North Korea  and to countless others whose names are not yet known  but which will someday be inscribed alongside those of Havel and Sharansky and Sakharov in the kingdom of conscience and courage to which all freedom fighters belong       May God bless all of you  and give you strength and success in your endeavor  which is the greatest of all human endeavors   the pursuit of freedom  Thank you         30
