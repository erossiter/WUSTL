today introduced bipartisan legislation aimed at improving the current No Child Left Behind law   Lieberman  along with Senators Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Norm Coleman  R MN   sponsored the All Students Can Achieve Act of 2007  ASCA   which focuses on improving teacher effectiveness and raising education standards for America s students        Last month  the Senators were joined at a press conference on Capitol Hill by former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes of the Aspen Institute s Commission on No Child Left Behind  Chancellor Joel Klein of the New York City Public Schools and Chancellor Michelle Rhee of the Washington  DC Public Schools to show their support for the proposal       No Child Left Behind  which Congress must now reauthorize  provides a foundation  but we now must take new  bold steps in order to fulfill the national commitments we first made five years ago   said Lieberman    That is why today we are presenting a significant reform proposal  which we are calling    All Students Can Achieve     to make the law more parent friendly  more student friendly   and  above all  more results friendly          ASCA contains a number of reforms intended to advance the quality of education in America s public schools   First  ASCA aims to enhance academic student growth by focusing on what s most important   getting the best teachers where they are most needed    that is  those teachers with a demonstrated ability to achieve results in the classroom   Second  the bill seeks to encourage high standards throughout the country and better align the curriculum of schools across America   And  third  the proposal focuses on closing the achievement gap by holding schools accountable for the performance of all students and providing resources to address this gap         The legislation offered by Lieberman  Landrieu and Coleman has been endorsed by the Aspen Institute s bipartisan  independent Commission on No Child Left Behind   Last year  the Commission held numerous public hearings and roundtables across the country and collected written testimony and research from many parents  teachers and administrators   These hearings played a critical role in helping to shape many of the proposals contained in ASCA      Below is a summary of the bill s highlights       Focusing on the achievements of all students                     To ensure parents that all students are achieving  states must create comprehensive data systems that track students  academic progress and other factors that affect their success                        One of the most important factors in school and student achievement is teachers   The quality of teachers should be determined by their effect on students  learning  not just their qualifications   All students should have effective teachers   Thus  these data systems must link student achievement data to teachers  allowing states to measure teacher effectiveness                        States should be held accountable for student achievement   However  students do not progress at the same pace or start in the same place   Thus  states are allowed the flexibility to measure student academic growth  rather than looking at absolute test scores   States are also encouraged to look at merit pay including getting the best teachers to teach in the poorest schools          High expectations for all students                       To ensure that all elementary through secondary school students  regardless of where they live  are prepared for success in college or the workplace  states must set high expectations for all students   Academic standards must be designed to prepare students to succeed and assessments must be effective tools to measure students  progress toward meeting these standards   Currently  states often weaken standards and assessments so that more schools and students appear to meet requirements                       Voluntary American standards and assessments in reading  math and science would help raise the standards and assessments in states that have set their expectations too low   States will have the flexibility to adopt or adapt the American standards  thereby freeing up state resources for other educational needs  or keep their own standards  which the Secretary of Education would compare with the American standards                      In order to ensure that high expectations are held for students from before they begin school to after they graduate  states must establish P 16 Commissions to ensure that state curriculum is aligned to standards that are at an optimum level   This will help to ensure that students graduating from high school succeed in college or the workplace         Closing the Achievement Gap                     States need to focus resources on closing the achievement gap   This includes directing their attention to comprehensive interventions where more than 50  of students are not making Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  or focused interventions where less than 50  of students are not making AYP   Federal support for these interventions will increase                    New approaches need to be taken to close the gap   Thus  incentive grants will be awarded for innovative teacher and school programs                    To ensure that all students are properly measured  current loopholes in the law that allow states to avoid counting students  especially students with disabilities and English language learners  or skew achievement data  are closed                   Another important measure of academic achievement is high school graduation rates  which should be tracked and reported for all groups of students      30
