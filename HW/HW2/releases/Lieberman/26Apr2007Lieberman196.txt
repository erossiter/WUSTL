Supplemental Appropriations Bill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  today addressed the Iraq withdrawal provision in the supplemental appropriations bill on the floor of the U S  Senate         Below is the full text of Senator Lieberman s speech  as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  the supplemental appropriations bill we are debating today contains language that would have Congress take control of the direction of our military strategy in Iraq       Earlier this week the Senate Majority Leader spoke at the Woodrow Wilson Center and laid out the case for why he believes we must do this   why the bill now before this chamber  in his view  offers a viable alternative strategy for Iraq       I have great respect for my friend from Nevada  I believe he has offered this proposal in good faith  and therefore want to take it up in good faith  and examine its arguments and ideas carefully and in depth  for this is a very serious discussion for our country        In his speech Monday  the Majority Leader described the several steps that this new strategy for Iraq would entail  Its first step  he said  is to  transition the U S  mission away from policing a civil war   to training and equipping Iraqi security forces  protecting U S  forces  and conducting targeted counter terror operations        I ask my colleagues to take a step back for a moment and consider this plan        When we say that U S  troops shouldn t be  policing a civil war   that their operations should be restricted to this narrow list of missions  what does this actually mean        To begin with  it means that our troops will not be allowed to protect the Iraqi people from the insurgents and militias who are trying to terrorize and kill them  Instead of restoring basic security  which General Petraeus has argued should be the central focus of any counterinsurgency campaign  it means our soldiers would instead be ordered  by force of this proposed law  not to stop the sectarian violence happening all around them   no matter how vicious or horrific it becomes        In short  it means telling our troops to deliberately and consciously turn their backs on ethnic cleansing  to turn their backs on the slaughter of innocent civilians   men  women  and children singled out and killed on the basis of their religion alone  It means turning our backs on the policies that led us to intervene in the civil war in Yugoslavia in the 1990s  the principles that today lead many of us to call for intervention in Darfur       This makes no moral sense at all       It also makes no strategic or military sense either       Al Qaeda s own leaders have repeatedly said that one of the ways they intend to achieve victory in Iraq is to provoke civil war  They are trying to kill as many people as possible today  precisely in the hope of igniting sectarian violence  because they know that this is their best way to collapse Iraq s political center  overthrow Iraq s elected government  radicalize its population  and create a failed state in the heart of the Middle East that they can use as a base        That is why Al Qaeda blew up the Golden Mosque in Samarra last year  And that is why we are seeing mass casualty suicide bombings by Al Qaeda in Baghdad now        The sectarian violence that the Majority Leader says he wants to order American troops to stop policing  in other words  is the very same sectarian violence that Al Qaeda hopes to ride to victory  The suggestion that we can draw a bright legislative line between stopping terrorists in Iraq and stopping civil war in Iraq flies in the face of this reality        I do not know how to say it more plainly  it is Al Qaeda that is trying to cause a full fledged civil war in Iraq       The Majority Leader said on Monday that he believes U S  troops will still be able to conduct  targeted counter terror operations  under his plan  Even if we stop trying to protect civilians in Iraq  in other words  we can still go after the bad guys       But again  I ask my colleagues  how would this translate into military reality on the ground  How would we find these terrorists  who do not gather on conventional military bases or fight in conventional formations       By definition  targeted counterterrorism requires our forces to know where  when  and against whom to strike   and that in turn requires accurate  actionable  real time intelligence        This is the kind of intelligence that can only come from ordinary Iraqis  the sea of people among whom the terrorists hide  And that  in turn  requires interacting with the Iraqi people on a close  personal  daily basis  It requires winning individual Iraqis to our side  gaining their trust  convincing them that they can count on us to keep them safe from the terrorists if they share valuable information about them  This is no great secret  This is at the heart of the new strategy that General Petraeus and his troops are carrying out       And yet  if we pass this legislation  according to the Majority Leader  U S  forces will no longer be permitted to patrol Iraq s neighborhoods or protect Iraqi civilians  They won t  in his words  be  interjecting themselves between warring factions  or  trying to sort friend from foe        Therefore  I ask the supporters of this legislation  How  exactly  are U S  forces to gather intelligence about where  when  and against whom to strike  after you have ordered them walled off from the Iraqi population  How  exactly  are U S  forces to carry out targeted counter terror operations  after you have ordered them cut off from the very source of intelligence that drives these operations        This is precisely why the congressional micromanagement of life and death decisions about how  where  and when our troops can fight is such a bad idea  especially on a complex and changing battlefield       In sum  you can t have it both ways  You can t withdraw combat troops from Iraq and still fight Al Qaeda there  If you believe there is no hope of winning in Iraq  or that the costs of victory there are not worth it  then you should be for complete withdrawal as soon as possible       There is another irony here as well        For most of the past four years  under Defense Secretary Rumsfeld  the United States did not try to establish basic security in Iraq  Rather than deploying enough troops necessary to protect the Iraqi people  the focus of our military has been on training and equipping Iraqi forces  protecting our own forces  and conducting targeted sweeps and raids   in other words  the very same missions proposed by the proponents of the legislation before us       That strategy failed   and we know why it failed  It failed because we didn t have enough troops to ensure security  which in turn created an opening for Al Qaeda and its allies to exploit  They stepped into this security vacuum and  through horrific violence  created a climate of fear and insecurity in which political and economic progress became impossible       For years  many members of Congress recognized this  We talked about this  We called for more troops  and a new strategy  and   for that matter   a new secretary of defense       And yet  now  just as President Bush has come around   just as he has recognized the mistakes his administration has made  and the need to focus on basic security in Iraq  and to install a new secretary of defense and a new commander in Iraq   now his critics in Congress have changed their minds and decided that the old  failed strategy wasn t so bad after all        What is going on here  What has changed so that the strategy that we criticized and rejected in 2006 suddenly makes sense in 2007       The second element in the plan outlined by the Majority Leader on Monday is  the phased redeployment of our troops no later than October 1  2007        Let us be absolutely clear what this means  This legislation would impose a binding deadline for U S  troops to begin retreating from Iraq  This withdrawal would happen regardless of conditions on the ground  regardless of the recommendations of General Petraeus  in short regardless of reality on October 1  2007       As far as I can tell  none of the supporters of withdrawal have attempted to explain why October 1 is the magic date   what strategic or military significance this holds  Why not September 1  Or January 1  This is a date as arbitrary as it is inflexible   a deadline for defeat       How do proponents of this deadline defend it  On Monday  Senator Reid gave several reasons  First  he said  a date for withdrawal puts  pressure on the Iraqis to make the desperately needed political compromises        But will it  According to the legislation now before us  the withdrawal will happen regardless of what the Iraqi government does        How  then  if you are an Iraqi government official  does this give you any incentive to make the right choices        On the contrary  there is compelling reason to think a legislatively directed withdrawal of American troops will have exactly the opposite effect than its Senate sponsors intend        This  in fact  is exactly what the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq predicted  A withdrawal of U S  troops in the months ahead  it said  would  almost certainly lead to a significant increase in the scale and scope of sectarian conflict  intensify Sunni resistance  and have adverse effects on national reconciliation        Second  the Majority Leader said that withdrawing our troops  and again I quote  will  reduce the specter of the U S  occupation which gives fuel to the insurgency        My colleague from Nevada  in other words  is suggesting that the insurgency is being provoked by the very presence of American troops  By diminishing that presence  then  he believes the insurgency will diminish       But I ask my colleagues   where is the evidence to support this theory  Since 2003  and before General Petraeus took command  U S  forces were ordered on several occasions to pull back from Iraqi cities and regions  including Mosul and Fallujah and Tel Afar and Baghdad  And what happened in these places  Did they stabilize when American troops left  Did the insurgency go away       On the contrary   in each of these places where U S  forces pulled back  Al Qaeda rushed in  Rather than becoming islands of peace  they became safe havens for terrorists  islands of fear and violence        So I ask advocates of withdrawal  on what evidence  on what data  have you concluded that pulling U S  troops out will weaken the insurgency  when every single experience we have had since 2003 suggests that this legislation will strengthen it        Consider the words of Sheikh Abdul Sattar  one of the leading Sunni tribal leaders in Anbar province who is now fighting on our side against Al Qaeda  This is what he told the New York Times when asked last month what would happen if U S  troops withdraw   In my personal opinion  and in the opinion of most of the wise men of Anbar   he said   if the American forces leave right now  there will be civil war and the area will fall into total chaos        This is a man whose father was killed by Al Qaeda  who is risking his life every day to work with us   a man who was described by one Army officer as  the most effective local leader in Ramadi I believe the coalition has worked with    in Anbar  since  2003        In his remarks earlier this week  the Majority Leader observed that there is  a large and growing population of millions   who sit precariously on the fence  They will either condemn or contribute to terrorism in the years ahead  We must convince them of the goodness of America and Americans  We must win them over        On this  I completely agree with my friend from Nevada  My question to him  however  and to the supporters of this legislation  is this  how does the strategy you propose in this bill possibly help win over this population of millions in Iraq  who sit precariously on the fence        What message  I ask  does this legislation announce to those people in Iraq  How will they respond when we tell them that we will no longer make any effort to protect them against insurgents and death squads  How will they respond when we declare that we will be withdrawing our forces   regardless of whether they make progress in the next six months towards political reconciliation  Where will their hopes for a better life be when we withdraw the troops that are the necessary precondition for the security and stability they yearn for       Do my friends really believe that this is the way to convince Iraqis  and the world  of the goodness of America and Americans  Does anyone in this chamber really believe that  by announcing a date certain for withdrawal  we will empower Iraqi moderates  or enable Iraq s reconstruction  or open more schools for their children  or more hospitals for their families  or freedom for everyone       Mr  President  with all due respect  this is fantasy       The third step the Majority Leader proposes is to impose  tangible  measurable  and achievable benchmarks on the Iraqi government        I am all for such benchmarks  In fact  Senator McCain and I were among the first to propose legislation to apply such benchmarks on the Iraqi government       But I don t see how this plan will encourage Iraqis to meet these or any other benchmarks  given its ironclad commitment to abandon them   regardless of how they behave       We should of course be making every effort to encourage reconciliation in Iraq and the development of a decent political order that Sunnis  Shiites  and Kurds can agree on       But even if today that political solution was found  we cannot rationally think that our terrorist enemies like Al Qaeda in Iraq will simply vanish        Al Qaeda is not mass murdering civilians on the streets of Baghdad because it wants a more equitable distribution of oil revenues  Its aim in Iraq is not to get a seat at the political table        It wants to blow up the table   along with everyone seated at it  Al Qaeda wants to destroy any prospect for democracy in Iraq  and it will not be negotiated or reasoned out of existence  It must be fought and defeated through force of arms  And there can be no withdrawal  no redeployment from this reality       The fourth step that the Majority Leader proposed on Monday is a  diplomatic  economic  and political offensive    starting with a regional conference working toward a long term framework for stability in the region        I understand why we are tempted by these ideas  All of us are aware of the justified frustration  fatigue  and disappointment of the American people  And all of us would like to believe that there is a quick and easy solution to the challenges we face in Iraq       But none of this gives us an excuse to paper over hard truths  We delude ourselves if we think we can wave a legislative wand and suddenly our troops in the field will be able to distinguish between Al Qaeda terrorism and sectarian violence  or that Iraqis will suddenly settle their political differences because our troops are leaving  or that sweet reason alone will suddenly convince Iran and Syria to stop destabilizing Iraq       Mr  President  what we need now is a sober assessment of the progress we have made and a recognition of the challenges we face  There are still many uncertainties before us  many complexities  Barely half of the new troops that General Petraeus has requested have even arrived in Iraq  and  as we heard from him yesterday  it will still be months before we will know just how effective his new strategy is        In following General Petraeus  path  there is no guarantee of success   but there is hope  and a new plan  for success       The plan embedded in this legislation  on the other hand  contains no such hope  It is a strategy of catchphrases and bromides  rather than military realities in Iraq  It does not learn from the many mistakes we have made in Iraq  Rather  it promises to repeat them       Let me be absolutely clear  In my opinion  Iraq is not yet lost   but if we follow this plan  it will be  And so  I fear  much of our hope for stability in the Middle East and security from terrorism here at home        I yield the floor           30
