Sudden Oak Death in Connecticut

today called for more action by the federal government to contain the spread of Sudden Oak Death  a plant disease that may have infected thousands of plants in Connecticut   In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Mike Johanns  Lieberman said that the U S  Department of Agriculture  USDA  has not done enough since it announced in December that as many as 10 000 rhododendrons from a nursery infected with Phytophthora ramorum  the organism that causes the dangerous Sudden Oak Death  have come into Connecticut  and that all but 114 of these have been sold            It took months for the USDA to track the infected plants that have been shipped across the country and sold  many to families who probably planted them in their yards     Lieberman said      As a result Connecticut residents must worry now about the precious old oak trees that shades their homes and the beautiful oaks and laurel that decorate our state   s forested lands   We need to do better and I urge the USDA to consider my recommendations for strengthening current efforts             In 2004 infected plants were shipped from California and Oregon to 39 states  including Connecticut   Sudden Oak Death is particularly worrisome because over 65 species of plants are susceptible  tens of thousands of tanoak and oak trees in California and Oregon have already been killed  and nursery and landscape businesses could be hurt   In his letter to Johanns  Lieberman suggested several actions that should be taken immediately to stem the spread of the disease        The full text of the letter is below        February 3  2005       Mike Johanns  Secretary                                         U S  Department of Agriculture      1400 Independence Avenue  NW      Washington  D C  20250       Dear Secretary Johanns        I write with great concern about the detection of the organism causing Sudden Oak Death  SOD  in rhododendrons in Connecticut   I understand that over 10 000 rhododendrons came into Connecticut from an infected nursery over the past year  and that all but 114 of these have been sold and are likely planted in yards across our state   This appears to be a widespread problem  as I understand that plants from infected nurseries were shipped to at least 39 states over the last year          In December  APHIS announced its latest emergency order to restrict the movement of nursery stock from areas in Oregon and Washington in addition to its previous rules for California   I am concerned  however  that this order has still not gone far enough to stop the dispersion of infected stock   In particular  I would like to inquire whether you have considered any of the following steps to strengthen your controls on the spread of plants infected with SOD  and if so  whether your have taken any action to implement them                      Improve communications by having a national coordinator for the SOD program                     Create a science panel to advise the regulatory process                      Spot test with PCR or culture tests  not just visual inspection  prior to certifying nurseries for interstate sales                      Require that receiving state authorities be notified when shipments are coming in from an infected area  allowing for further spot checking and testing before sale to the public                      Develop a national tracking system that would indicate where each plant was grown  the point of origin  at the wholesale level and if possible expand this to the retail level   Such bar codes would be affixed along with the bar codes used for inventory   This would make it possible to quickly identify the source of a contaminated plant and make it easier to locate all plants on the market from that nursery                      Work with states to develop an education and outreach plan to inform the public about SOD in regions newly exposed last year   Provide general information about SOD and why there is concern as well as more specific information on how to identify an infected plant  and what to do about it if a plant is suspect                       Expand efforts to develop certified testing labs in regions that received infected plants in 2004 to accommodate new testing that will be required to track and remove infected plants in the these new regions                    Development of a compensation program for land owners that must remove infected plants and surrounding vegetation          I am deeply concerned that SOD represents an urgent threat to the health of our forests and nursery industry   I therefore would request that you expedite your response to my inquiry so I can consider how Congress may assist in responding to the threat   Please contact Lydia Olander or Tim Profeta of my staff at 202 224 4041 if you have any questions about this letter          Thank you for your assistance         Sincerely         Joseph I  Lieberman      UNITED STATES SENATOR         30
