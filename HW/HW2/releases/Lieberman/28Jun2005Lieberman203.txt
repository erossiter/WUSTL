                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              STAMFORD     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  delivered the following eulogy at his mother   s funeral Tuesday       A week ago Sunday  Mom rose from her hospital bed and sat up straight in a chair like a different person than the one who had spent the rest of the day in a deep  difficult  blood transfusioned sleep   She and we knew she was near the end of her time on earth but suddenly that evening she didn   t look like it   We had a great conversation  When Hani went over to give her Baba a goodbye hug and began to sob  Mom said    Don   t cry Hani  Don   t cry  I have had a wonderful life  with a wonderful family and friends   I have done things and gone places I never dreamed I would  so don   t cry for me sweetheart   Everything must have a beginning and an end      And my sister Rietta said     a new beginning      And Mom said     Yes          In that spirit  though we mourn her death today  I want to honor and celebrate the life and times of Marcia Manger Lieberman  I want to express the gratitude we all feel to have had her as a mother  a grandmother  a great grandmother  and a friend       Her 90 years spanned most of one century and brought us into a new one   Born to immigrant parents in 1914  with World War I erupting in Europe  she lost her father in an accident when she was a young child and went to work after school at the age of 12 to help her family   She graduated from high school in the midst of the Great Depression and married as war and a Holocaust began in Europe   She saw her husband off to war and ran the business while he was away   After the war  everything changed   She and Pop raised a family in booming post war America  were thrilled by the establishment of the modern state of Israel  and taught their children this essential lesson  faith  family and good deeds matter most  and anything was possible for anyone     including us     in this great country if we worked hard enough for it   Her life was always a model of what she taught  My mother pushed herself forward with unbelievable strength through the loss of her parents  sisters  brother  and most difficult  in 1986  the loss of the love and partner of her life  our Pop  Henry Lieberman   And yet  she seemed to grow not weaker but stronger as her life lengthened  stronger certainly in purpose and wisdom  lifted by fate at the turn of the new century onto the national stage and rising to it with ease  spreading her strength  warmth  wit  and love across America   Was anyone surprised that they loved her everywhere she went  Will we ever forget that national television interview when she answered Larry King   s question    What do you say to your son when you think he   s made a mistake  Marcia     with her own question     Mistake  Larry          There were so many times in her life when she could have become depressed or embittered by loss but she never was   After what might today be described as a deprived and difficult childhood  she emerged so bright and magnetic a light that Pop was first drawn to her at a Purim dance at the Stamford Jewish Community Center when she entered the hall  and he realized he was not alone as he watched people swarm around her       Several years ago when her osteoarthritis had become truly painful  I called her one night and she told me she was going with friends the next day to a concert at Tanglewood   I said    Mom  are you sure you   re up to that long a ride      And she said     If I get up tomorrow  I   ll be up to it          Just a few weeks ago when her pulse suddenly surged to 190 and the doctors rushed her to the I C U   she asked the cardiologist    What causes such palpitations     and he said  apparently sensing her personality     Sometimes it   s love     and she said    But I just met you      Some would call that Reaganesque but I would call it Baba esque       What gave her that resilience  that capacity to laugh in the face of life   s troubles  that desire to greet each new day as a new opportunity to enjoy life       Probably her faith  probably her family  or maybe it was just the gift of nature that God had given Marcia Lieberman and thereby blessed all the rest of us who knew and loved her       There is no question she was strengthened and regularly renewed by her belief in God and her love of traditional Torah Judaism   She was deeply religious in her observance of the rituals and her adherence to the values of her faith   For her three children  eight grandchildren  seven great grandchildren and generations of relatives  friends and visiting strangers  her home was defined by the essential peace and purpose of Shabbat as well     needless to say     as its unique tastes  sounds and aromas   As Ethan Tucker wrote in an email     Baba always had room for one more person at her table      But her faith went way beyond chicken soup         Without a lot of fanfare or rhetoric she did a lot of mitzvot     a lot of good deeds   Private charity for the needy  honesty in her and Pop   s business dealings  fidelity and purity in their personal life  and an unmatched ability to see the best in everyone she loved and thereby evoke the best in each of us   She made so many people feel confidence they had never felt before because she loved them   She made so many of us so much better than we otherwise would have been         Her supply of love seemed inexhaustible  like the light of a candle that can spread its flame to many other candles and yet not lose any of its own light and warmth   She had many adopted daughters and sons with whom she spent much time and whose lives she changed   It struck me recently that Rietta  Ellen and I never resented her relationships with all of you because they never diminished in the slightest the love we received from her       She just loved people  all of God   s children with a love as equal and open as God   s love for all of us   Mom was     to say the obvious     very Jewish  but her heart and home were open to everyone regardless of who they were  where they came from or what they believed  I never heard Mom say a bigoted word       Yes  Mom was loving  but she was also demanding   She was remarkably capable of unconditional love but she was not unconditionally happy with everything those she loved did   And she let us know that   It   s important to remember that as we seek to draw lessons from her life   She has left us very clear directions about how she would want us to live   To me they are  To have faith in God and the values religion brings  And to uphold and carry forward the legacy of Torah Judaism in all its ethical and ritualistic strength and splendor       To take care of each other  as she told our extended family in that magnificent matriarchal oration at her ninetieth birthday party  to take care of each other  in the immediate family  the extended family  and the human family         And finally she calls us to always try to do the right thing  the kind of thing that would make your mother proud       The earthly life of Marcia Manger Lieberman has come to an end but her strong light has not gone out   She believed with a powerful faith in the promise of eternal life   I am confident and I hope you are that there is about to be a new star in the heavens  a new light   an    Ohr Chadash    now in the world to come   And here on Earth each of us in our own lives  by our own actions  can and must keep the light of her candle  which she so lovingly passed on to so many of us  burning bright  so that we may pass it on now to others       May choirs of angels sing this great lady to her eternal home       30
