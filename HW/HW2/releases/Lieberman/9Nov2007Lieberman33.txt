CT  addressed a Center for Politics and Foreign Relations Financial Times breakfast at The Johns Hopkins University Paul H  Nitze School of Advanced International Studies  The subject of Senator Liebermans talk was The Politics of National Security  in which he spoke about the future of the Democratic Party and its response to the threat of Iran   In the address  Senator Lieberman stated  Since retaking Congress in November 2006  the top foreign policy priority of the Democratic Party has not been to expand the size of our military for the war on terror or to strengthen our democracy promotion efforts in the Middle East or to prevail in Afghanistan  It has been to pull our troops out of Iraq  to abandon the democratically elected government there  and to hand a defeat to President Bush   Iraq has become the singular litmus test for Democratic candidates  No Democratic presidential primary candidate today speaks of Americas moral or strategic responsibility to stand with the Iraqi people against the totalitarian forces of radical Islam  or of the consequences of handing a victory in Iraq to al Qaeda and Iran  And if they did  their campaign would be as unsuccessful as mine was in 2006  Even as evidence has mounted that General Petraeus new counterinsurgency strategy is succeeding  Democrats have remained emotionally invested in a narrative of defeat and retreat in Iraq  reluctant to acknowledge the progress we are now achieving  or even that that progress has enabled us to begin drawing down our troops there   Senator Lieberman also indicated  there is something profoundly wrongsomething that should trouble all of uswhen we have elected Democratic officials who seem more worried about how the Bush administration might respond to Irans murder of our troops  than about the fact that Iran is murdering our troops   There is likewise something profoundly wrong when we see candidates who are willing to pander to this politically paranoid  hyper partisan sentiment in the Democratic baseeven if it sends a message of weakness and division to the Iranian regime   Below is the full text of his remarks  as prepared for delivery   Thank you so much  Bob  for that kind introduction  It is a pleasure to be here this morning at the Paul Nitze School of Advanced International Studies   SAIS bears the name of a great American statesman and strategist  Paul Nitze served in six presidential administrations  from the outbreak of World War II through the twilight of the Cold War  As the principal author of NSC 68  he quite literally wrote the road map that guided America to victory in our long struggle against the Soviet Union   Nitze is a figure of particular resonance for me  and his career provides an ideal starting place for the subject of my talk todaythe politics of national security   As many of you know  Paul Nitze was a Democrat  but he worked for Republican presidents as well as Democratic ones  He did so because he understood that  whatever domestic political differences divide us  they must never blind us to the far more profound national security challenges we face together from abroad   Throughout his long career  Nitze put country before party  policy before politics  Although he was a Democrat  he did not look to the Democratic Party to tell him how or what to think about foreign policy   The foreign policy convictions that animated Nitze  it so happened  were also the convictions that animated the Democratic Party from the 1940s through the early 1960s  Confronted by the totalitarian threats first of fascism and then of communism  Democrats under Franklin Roosevelt and Harry Truman and John F  Kennedy forged a foreign policy that was simultaneously principled  internationalist  and tough minded   This was the Democratic Party I grew up ina party that was unafraid to make moral judgments about the world beyond our borders  to draw a clear line between what Nitze in NSC 68 called the free world of the West and the slave society behind the Iron Curtain  It was a party that grasped the inextricable link between the survival of freedom abroad and the survival of freedom at homethat recognized  as Nitze wrote  that the idea of freedom is the most contagious idea in the world  And it was also a party that understood that a progressive society must be ready and willing to use its military power in defense of its progressive ideals  in order to ensure that those progressive ideals survived   This was the worldview captured by President Kennedy  when he pledged in his inaugural address that the United States would pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe  to assure the survival and the success of liberty   That Democratic foreign policy traditionthe tradition of Roosevelt  Truman  and Kennedycollapsed just a few years later  in the trauma of Vietnam  And in its place  a very different worldview took root in the Democratic Party   Reflexively skeptical about Americas authority to make moral judgments about the rest of the world  inclined to see the planets leading problems as more often the result of American involvement than American disengagement  and viscerally opposed to the use of military force  this rival worldview was in many respects the polar opposite of the self confident and idealistic internationalism that had  just a few years earlier  animated the Democratic Party under President Kennedy   Nitze was among those who courageously fought against this turn in the Democratic Party  He was a critic of the anti war  isolationist candidacy of George McGovern in 1972 and later broke with Jimmy Carter over his arms control policy  which Nitze felt was weak and misguided  With Eugene Rostow  Nitze reestablished the Committee on the Present Danger  to keep alive the principled  internationalist  and muscular foreign policy tradition that had once lay at the heart of the Democratic Party   Throughout this period  although Nitze remained a Democrat  he did not hesitate to challenge Democrats with whom he disagreed  or to work with Republicans with whom he agreed  One of the Republicans that Nitze came to support  in fact  was Ronald Reagan  himself a former Democrat  who welcomed Nitze to his foreign policy team after winning the presidency in 1980   Reagan was the last president Nitze would serve  but in the proud legacy he has left  Nitze offers us important lessons for our own time about the politics of national security   I arrived in Washington  D C   as a first term Senator in January 1989  just as Paul Nitze was departing government to return to his office here at SAIS  As I began to make foreign policy decisions in the Senate  I found myself drawn to the Democratic tradition of my youththe morally self confident  internationalist  and muscular tradition of Truman and Kennedy  whose inaugural address had inspired me to be a Democrat in the first place   By the late 1980s  that tradition had been out of fashion in Democratic circles for twenty years  But then  Democrats had also been out of power for most of those twenty yearssomething that struck me and many others as more than coincidental  Simply put  the American people didnt trust Democrats to keep them safe  and the McGovernite legacy was a big reason why   By 1989  historic changes were taking place in the world that made the strong  self confident foreign policy that linked Democrats like Truman and Kennedy to Republicans like Reagan look increasingly justified  Although too many Democrats had grown accustomed to criticizing Reagans approach to the Cold War as simplistic and dangerous  now the Soviet Union was implodingeconomically and ideologically   The collapse of communism emboldened those of us who felt that the McGovernite legacy had been a disastrous detour for the Democratic Party  and that it was time to reclaim our own lost tradition of strength abroad   Then in 1991  Americas stunning victory in the first Gulf War presented anti war Democrats with graphic proof of why their reflexive opposition to the use of military force was substantively wrong and probably politically wrong too   It was not until the Clinton Gore administration  however  that a tectonic shift really began inside the Democratic Party about foreign policy  In particular in the Balkans  as President Clinton and his advisers slowly came to recognize that American intervention  and only American intervention  could stop Slobodan MilosevicDemocratic attitudes about the use of military power began to change   Ironically  just as Democrats in the White House were growing more comfortable with the idea of an interventionist foreign policy  Republicans in Congress were moving in the opposite direction  In the absence of the Soviet Union  Republicans in the 1990s too often defined their own foreign policy vision as instinctive opposition to whatever President Clinton was doing in the world   It is worth remembering  however  that some Republicans rose above this partisan reflex  Senator John McCain and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole courageously championed our intervention in the Balkans  without regard to domestic politics  But many others didntand by the time of the 2000 presidential contest  it was the Democratic Party that was the more hawkish and internationalist  not the Republicans   And in the 2000 campaign  it was Vice President Gore  who championed a values based foreign policy  confident of Americas moral responsibilities in the world  and unafraid to use our military power  He promised  50 billion more in new defense spending than his Republican opponentand  to the dismay of the partys left  made sure that the Democratic Partys platform that year endorsed a national missile defense   Incidentally  he also chose a hawkish Democratic senator from Connecticut as his running mate   Governor Bush  by contrast  campaigned for the presidency promising a humble foreign policy  criticizing the peacekeeping operations in Bosnia and Kosovo  He signaled his intention to appoint as his secretary of state a retired general  who had counseled against military intervention both in Iraq and in Bosnia  One of his top foreign policy advisers warned that Americas armed forces are not a global police forcea line that another prominent Republican noted was closer to the spirit of George McGovern than Ronald Reagan   In the politics of national security  it seemed  Democrats and Republicans had traded places   Certainly no one listening to George W  Bush in the fall of 2000 could have imagined that  scarcely four years later  this same man would stand on the west front of the Capitol building and pledge  in his second inaugural address  that it is the policy of the United States to seek and support the growth of democratic movements in every nation and culture  with the ultimate goal of ending tyranny in the world   Indeed  as Yale historian John Lewis Gaddis has written  it is easy to imagine these words being spoken by Franklin Roosevelt or Harry Truman or John F  Kennedy or Bill Clinton  But it was George W  Bush  whoin the aftermath of September 11responded to the attacks with a national security strategy not of isolationism or realpolitikbut by drawing on the same morally self confident  internationalist  and muscular foreign policy tradition he had once scorned   In particular  President Bush defined the nature of this new conflict in quintessentially liberal termsas a struggle for freedom against tyranny  Like the Cold War  he described the war on terror as ultimately between two fundamentally different visions of humanity  On the one side of this struggle are the Islamist extremists who promise paradise  but deliver a life of public beheadings and repression of women and suicide bombings  And on the other side  are huge numbers of moderate men and women in the Muslim world  who believe that every life has dignity and value that no power on Earth can take away   That is why  to defeat radical Islam  President Bush has repeatedly argued that we must simultaneously fightand fight hardto uproot their networks  while offering our own  more powerful vision of the future  based on the universal values of freedom and justice and opportunity   In this regard  the Bush administrations post 9 11 ideological conversion confronted Democrats with an awkward choice  Should we welcome the Presidents foreign policy flip flop  Or should Democrats match it with a flip flop of our own   Between 2002 and 2006  there was a battle within the Democratic Party over just how to answer this questiona battle I was part of   I felt strongly that Democrats should embrace the basic framework that the President articulated for the war on terror as our ownbecause it was our own  It was our legacy from Roosevelt  Truman  Kennedy  and Clinton   We could rightly criticize the Bush administration when it failed to live up to its own rhetoric  or when it bungled the execution of its policies  But I felt that we should not minimize the seriousness of the threat from Islamist extremism  or the fundamental rightness of the muscular  internationalist  and morally self confident response that President Bush had chosen in response to it   But that was not the choice most Democrats made  Instead  they flip flopped   It did not happen all at once  In the weeks and months after September 11  Democrats and Republicans put aside our partisan divisions and stood united as Americans  As late as October 2002  a Democratic controlled Senate voted by a wide bipartisan margin to authorize President Bush to use military force against Saddam Hussein   As the Iraq war became bogged down in a long and costly insurgency  however  and as President Bushs approval ratings slipped  Democrats moved in a very different directionfirst in the presidential campaign of 2004  where antiwar forces played a decisive role in the Democratic primaries  As you may recall  they also prevailed in Connecticuts Democratic U S  Senate primary last year   Since retaking Congress in November 2006  the top foreign policy priority of the Democratic Party has not been to expand the size of our military for the war on terror or to strengthen our democracy promotion efforts in the Middle East or to prevail in Afghanistan  It has been to pull our troops out of Iraq  to abandon the democratically elected government there  and to hand a defeat to President Bush   Iraq has become the singular litmus test for Democratic candidates  No Democratic presidential primary candidate today speaks of Americas moral or strategic responsibility to stand with the Iraqi people against the totalitarian forces of radical Islam  or of the consequences of handing a victory in Iraq to al Qaeda and Iran  And if they did  their campaign would be as unsuccessful as mine was in 2006  Even as evidence has mounted that General Petraeus new counterinsurgency strategy is succeeding  Democrats have remained emotionally invested in a narrative of defeat and retreat in Iraq  reluctant to acknowledge the progress we are now achieving  or even that that progress has enabled us to begin drawing down our troops there   Part of the explanation for this  I think  comes back to ideology  For all of our efforts in the 1990s to rehabilitate a strong Democratic foreign policy tradition  anti war sentiment remains the dominant galvanizing force among a significant segment of the Democratic base   But another reason for the Democratic flip flop on foreign policy over the past few years is less substantive  For many Democrats  the guiding conviction in foreign policy isnt pacifism or isolationismit is distrust and disdain of Republicans in general  and President Bush in particular   In this regard  the Democratic foreign policy worldview has become defined by the same reflexive  blind opposition to the President that defined Republicans in the 1990s  even when it means repudiating the very principles and policies that Democrats as a party have stood for  at our best and strongest   To illustrate my point  I want to talk about a controversy in the current Democratic presidential primaries  in which I have played an unintended part   I offered an amendment earlier this fall  together with Senator Jon Kyl of Arizona  urging the Bush administration to designate Irans Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organization and impose economic sanctions on them   The reason for our amendment was clear  In September  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker testified before Congress about the proxy war that Iranand in particular  the IRGC and its Quds Force subsidiaryhas been waging against our troops in Iraq  Specifically  General Petraeus told us that the IRGC Quds Force has been training  funding  equipping  arming  and in some cases directing Shiite extremists who are responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers   This charge had been corroborated by other sources  including the most recent National Intelligence Estimate on Iraq  the independent assessment of the Iraqi Security Forces led by General Jim Jones  as well as the on the ground reports of our division commanders in Iraq   It was also consistent with nearly three decades of experience with the IRGC  which has been implicated in a range of terrorist attacks against the United States and our allieslong before the invasion of Iraq   In light of this evidence  Senator Kyl and I thought that calling for the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization was a no brainer  Rather than punishing Iranians indiscriminately  it would apply a set of targeted economic sanctions against the part of the Iranian regime that was responsible for the murder of our troops in Iraq   One big reason Kyl and I thought that calling for the designation of the IRGC as a terrorist organization would be politically uncontroversial was because a bipartisan group of 68 senators  including several of the Democratic presidential candidates  had already signed onto a piece of legislation introduced earlier in the year that asked for the IRGCs designation along exactly the same lines as our amendment  Whatever the differences or disagreements on foreign policy or even on Iran  I assumed that tougher  targeted economic sanctions against the IRGC were something that we could all agree on   I was wrong   What happened instead is a case study in the distrust and partisan polarization that now poisons our body politic on even the most sensitive issues of national security   First  several left wing blogs seized upon the Kyl Lieberman amendment  offering wild conspiracy theories about how it could be used to authorize the use of military force against Iran   These were absurd arguments  The text of our amendment contained nothingnothingthat could be construed as a green light for an attack on Iran  To claim that it did was an act of delusion or deception   On the contrary  by calling for tougher sanctions on Iran  the intention of our amendment was to offer an alternative to war   Nonetheless  the conspiracy theories started to spread  Although the Senate passed our amendment  76 22  several Democrats  including some of the Democratic presidential candidates  soon began attacking itand Senator Clinton  who voted for the amendment  In fact  some of the very same Democrats who had cosponsored the legislation in the spring  urging the designation of the IRGC  began denouncing our amendment for doing the exact same thing   The problem with the Kyl Lieberman amendment of course had little to do with its substance  and a lot to do with politics   I asked some of my Senate colleagues who voted against our amendment  Do you believe the evidence the military has given us about the IRGC sponsoring these attacks on our troops  Yes  they invariably said   Dont you support tougher economic sanctions against Iran  I asked  Again  yesno question   So whats the problem  I asked   Its simple  they said  We dont trust Bush  Hell use this resolution as an excuse for war against Iran   I understand that President Bush is a divisive figure  I recognize the distrust that many Americans feel toward his administration  I recognize the anger and outrage that exists out there about the war in Iraq   But there is something profoundly wrongsomething that should trouble all of uswhen we have elected Democratic officials who seem more worried about how the Bush administration might respond to Irans murder of our troops  than about the fact that Iran is murdering our troops   There is likewise something profoundly wrong when we see candidates who are willing to pander to this politically paranoid  hyper partisan sentiment in the Democratic baseeven if it sends a message of weakness and division to the Iranian regime   For me  this episode reinforces how far the Democratic Party of 2007 has strayed from the Democratic Party of Franklin Roosevelt  Harry Truman  John F  Kennedy  and the Clinton Gore administration   That is why I call myself an Independent Democrat today  It is because my foreign policy convictions are the convictions that have traditionally animated the Democratic Partybut they exist in me today independent of the current Democratic Party  which has largely repudiated them   I hope that Democrats will one day again rediscover and re embrace these principles  which were at the heart of our party as recently as 2000  But regardless of when or if that happens  those convictions will continue to be mine  And I will continue to fight to advance them along with like minded Democrats and like minded Republicans   Some of you in this room are students at the beginning of what will be long and distinguished careers in public policy and public service  Chances are  you already have formed some strong convictions about American foreign policy  and for that reason  identify more with one party than the other   But as you consider your future  I ask you to reflect for a moment on the past  and the dramatic shifts that I have described in the foreign policy orthodoxy of Democrats and Republicans alike over the past sixty years   These shifts are almost certain to continue to occur  Just as the foreign policy convictions of the Democratic Party of 2008 are very different from those of the Democratic Party of 2000  so too will the Democratic Party of 2016 and 2028 look very different from the Democratic Party of today   I ask that as future practitioners of foreign policy  you do not become so wedded to a party that you are unwilling to diverge from it  when your convictions diverge from it  Let your views about national security determine your politics  rather than the other way around   If you choose to identify as a Democrat or a Republican  in other words  I encourage each of you to be independent Democrats and independent Republicans   It may mean that you belong to a smaller and  at times  lonelier caucus  You may even find yourself on the losing end of an election or two  But far more important  you will not lose your convictions about what you believe is best for the security of our great countryand that  as Paul Nitze understood  is what matters most   Thank you so much
