Department to recommend the strengthening of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act       WASHINGTON    Senator Joe Lieberman today called on the Bush Administration to extend a critical program  which helps provide insurance against damage incurred by terrorist attacks   In a letter to Treasury Secretary Snow  Lieberman urged the Treasury Department to recommend that Congress not only renew the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act from expiring  but strengthen it  as well            As I know you recognize  9 11 showed that our enemies seek to intimidate us by inciting chaos and creating uncertainty     Lieberman wrote      They are sophisticated enough to know that they can accomplish their aims by making business and property activity uninsurable   A terrorism risk insurance backstop is an integral part of our national planning for protecting our immediate homeland security and fundamental to ensuring our long term national security and ensuring that terrorists do not achieve their aims               The full text of the letter is below     June 24  2005    The Honorable John Snow   Secretary of the Treasury   1500 Pennsylvania Ave   NW   Washington  D C   20220    Dear John     I am writing to you with a sense of urgency and concern about our homeland security and the potential economic aftershocks of terrorism   As you prepare to provide Congress with an assessment of the Terrorism Risk Insurance Act  TRIA  and its impact on private markets  I want to encourage your attention to the primary role that the TRIA backstop has played to enable business and property owners of all sizes and in all market sectors to buy insurance against the risk of economic damages caused by an attack on the United States          We know that the availability of insurance is critical to American businesses  and insurers are able to provide some measure of terrorism risk coverage to their customers today because the TRIA backstop helps them to contain their own risk of catastrophic losses          The private sector continues to be on the front lines of terrorism risk management today because of the TRIA backstop  not in spite of it as some are suggesting   We must use the entrepreneurial private sector to our advantage  but this is only possible if we provide the needed TRIA backstop   In my view  those who advocate a withdrawal of the backstop do not understand why TRIA was enacted in the first place or why it has worked so well   Their viewpoint is based on ideology  not practical experience with these markets        The fact is that the 9 11 losses were the greatest in insurance industry history and it is not reasonable to assume that the industry will expose itself to them again without the backstop against catastrophic losses   We cannot demand that it offer coverage of risks that only U S  national intelligence may posses and it would be imprudent for them to do so without the backstop   There is insufficient private reinsurance capacity to help primary insurers spread and manage terrorism risk effectively because the peril remains unpredictable and the potential damage could be catastrophic         The recent RAND study on terrorism insurance provides important new analysis and concludes  1  our nation s economy remains vulnerable  2  addressing this vulnerability should be part of our homeland security effort  and 3  Congress should strengthen TRIA instead of allowing it to expire   We can all agree on the need to encourage the maximum possible role for the private sector  but we cannot afford to proceed with an attitude that expects the insurance industry to extend coverage beyond its capacity to assess and manage the risk prudently and efficiently          Just as it would be irresponsible for any insurer to overextend itself and risk insolvency  I believe it would be irresponsible for the federal government to walk away from its partnership role in buttressing our economy against future terrorist attacks          As I know you recognize  9 11 showed that our enemies seek to intimidate us by inciting chaos and creating uncertainty   They are sophisticated enough to know that they can accomplish their aims by making business and property activity uninsurable   A terrorism risk insurance backstop is an integral part of our national planning for protecting our immediate homeland security and fundamental to ensuring our long term national security and ensuring that terrorists do not achieve their aims        As we have discussed in recent months  I look forward to working with you and the President to improve and extend the TRIA backstop without further delay   We need to enact a substantial extension  not a stopgap   We need to do so on an expedited schedule because many policy holders are already receiving notices that their coverage for acts of terror may expire  We need a strong report and then we need decisive and public leadership from the Department and Administration to ensure that TRIA is extended and that the current uncertainty is lifted   Businesses must plan and government action is required so that it can do so  otherwise we risk a market disruption         Thank you for your attention to this critical issue        Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman   United States Senator       30
