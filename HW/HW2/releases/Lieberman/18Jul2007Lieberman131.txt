of 2007       WASHINGTON  D C    At a press conference on Capitol Hill today  Senators Joseph Lieberman  ID CT   Mary Landrieu  D LA  and Norm Coleman  R MN  unveiled legislation aimed at improving the current No Child Left Behind law  The Senators announced they will introduce the All Students Can Achieve Act of 2007  ASCA   which focuses on improving teacher effectiveness and raising education standards for America s students  The Senators were joined at the press conference by former Georgia Governor Roy Barnes of the Aspen Institute s Commission on No Child Left Behind  Chancellor Joel Klein of the New York City Public Schools and Chancellor Michelle Rhee of the Washington  DC Public Schools  No Child Left Behind  which Congress must now reauthorize  provides a foundation  but we now must take new  bold steps in order to fulfill the national commitments we first made five years ago  said Lieberman  That is why today we are presenting a significant reform proposal  which we are calling   All Students Can Achieve     to make the law more parent friendly  more student friendly   and  above all  more results friendly  This bill makes necessary changes to the No Child Left Behind Act  NCLB  to give every child the chance to succeed  said Landrieu  It holds public schools accountable for students who are not making adequate progress and provides them with the tools to meet their students  needs  It also pushes our public schools to close the achievement gap and ensures our foster children don t fall through the cracks  I am proud that five years ago  I worked with Republicans and Democrats alike to craft legislation that encourages public schools to meet new  higher standards in education for all children  including the most disadvantaged  These improvements work to make our original goals for that legislation a reality  I want to thank Senators Lieberman and Coleman for their commitment to real education reform  Education must be one of our country s top priorities and I am proud to join Senators Lieberman and Landrieu in the fight to educate young America  said Coleman  A quality education is imperative for individuals to succeed in life and for the United States to thrive in the increasingly competitive global market  I support accountability  but also flexibility when it comes to the No Child Left Behind law  Our legislation provides the flexibility educators have been asking for  without sacrificing high quality education for our children  Moreover  it builds upon No Child Left Behind s successes while also addressing its weaknesses  by promoting flexibility while maintaining accountability  high standards  effectiveness  and access to quality resources  ASCA contains three key components for advancing quality education in America s public schools  First  ASCA aims to achieve student growth by focusing on what s most important  achieving results in the classroom and ensuring effective teachers  Second  the bill seeks to encourage high standards throughout the country and better align the curriculum of schools across America  And  third  the proposal focuses on closing the achievement gap by holding schools accountable for the performance of all students and providing resources to address this gap  The legislation offered by Lieberman  Landrieu and Coleman has been endorsed by the Aspen Institute s bipartisan  independent Commission on No Child Left Behind  Last year  the Commission held numerous public hearings and roundtables across the country and collected written testimony and research from many parents  teachers and administrators  These hearings played a critical role in helping to shape many of the proposals contained in ASCA  Below is a summary of the bill s highlights  Focusing on the achievements of all students   To ensure parents that all students are achieving  states must create comprehensive data systems that track students  academic progress and other factors that affect their success   One of the most important factors in school and student achievement is teachers  The quality of teachers should be determined by their effect on students  learning  not just their qualifications  All students should have effective teachers  Thus  these data systems must link student achievement data to teachers  allowing states to measure teacher effectiveness   States should be held accountable for student achievement  However  students do not progress at the same pace or start in the same place  Thus  states are allowed the flexibility to measure student academic growth  rather than looking at absolute test scores  States are also encouraged to look at merit pay including getting the best teachers to teach in the poorest schools  High expectations for all students   To ensure that all elementary through secondary school students  regardless of where they live  are prepared for success in college or the workplace  states must set high expectations for all students  Academic standards must be designed to prepare students to succeed and assessments must be effective tools to measure students  progress toward meeting these standards  Currently  states often weaken standards and assessments so that more schools and students appear to meet requirements   Voluntary American standards and assessments in reading  math and science would help raise the standards and assessments in states that have set their expectations too low  States will have the flexibility to adopt or adapt the American standards  thereby freeing up state resources for other educational needs  or keep their own standards  which the Secretary of Education would compare with the American standards   In order to ensure that high expectations are held for students from before they begin school to after they graduate  states must establish P 16 Commissions to ensure that state curriculum is aligned to standards that are at an optimum level  This will help to ensure that students graduating from high school succeed in college or the workplace  Closing the Achievement Gap  States need to focus resources on closing the achievement gap  This includes directing their attention to comprehensive interventions where more than 50  of students are not making Adequate Yearly Progress  AYP  or focused interventions where less than 50  of students are not making AYP  Federal support for these interventions will increase   New approaches need to be taken to close the gap  Thus  incentive grants will be awarded for innovative teacher and school programs   To ensure that all students are properly measured  current loopholes in the law that allow states to avoid counting students  especially students with disabilities and English language learners  or skew achievement data  are closed   Another important measure of academic achievement is high school graduation rates  which should be tracked and reported for all groups of students  For more information on the All
