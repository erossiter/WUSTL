                                                         WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement Thursday at the Committee   s eighth Katrina investigatory hearing       Thank you Madam Chairman for calling this hearing    We   ve already held several important and informative hearings about Hurricane Katrina     the fate of the levees  the actions of the private sector in the wake of the storm  and the testimony of Marty Bahamonde   s dangerous days as he tried to get help to the thousands stranded in the Superdome    This morning   s witnesses move the Committee   s investigation forward on the path toward finding out what went wrong before and after Hurricane Katrina so that we can make sure it never happens again   I want to thank our witnesses for the testimony they are about to give  Although some of what you say about FEMA   s response to Katrina may well come under criticism today  I know that each of you has a distinguished history of public service and I respect you for that   But  having reviewed your testimony  and other testimony and documents gathered by the Committee so far  I conclude that FEMA is a troubled agency that failed in its prime mission     the mission it draws its name from        Emergency Management      The whole world watched disaster develop in the Gulf of Mexico and move toward the Gulf Coast and listened as forecasters said this was the long dreaded    big one    that could take out the levees and flood the Big Easy    Yet FEMA somehow miscalculated the gravity of the storm coming and failed to realize that doing business as usual would compound the disaster   Katrina simply was not a typical hurricane that allowed FEMA to work off of its typical playbook     but one that required a more aggressive and urgent federal response  Katrina was a catastrophe  It knocked out many of the state and local communications and response capabilities and overwhelmed those that remained  But FEMA seemed to expect this severely damaged state and local response network     itself the victim of the catastrophe     to operate as if it was at full and normal capacity   We have been astonished to learn in the course of the investigation that the battle plan for catastrophes     the National Response Plan   s Catastrophic Incident Annex     was never activated  And FEMA apparently still believes it should not have been   As we will hear today  FEMA deployed too few people to respond to Katrina and deployed them too slowly   Many of those it did deploy apparently failed to appreciate what the breaking of the levees meant  even when they belatedly learned of the breaks     a failure that had disastrous consequences for the people of New Orleans   Let me give an example  As we learned at our previous hearings  New Orleans    Industrial Canal levees were leveled by the storm surge early Monday morning  August 29     That led to almost immediate and catastrophic flooding in the eastern part of the city  including the Lower Ninth Ward     By midday  the Lake Pontchatrain levees were breaking  which led to a much slower flooding of downtown New Orleans     what we so often heard referred to as New Orleans filling like a bowl     Marty Bahamonde told us that he communicated these facts by midday to FEMA and had a conference call with FEMA officials at the EOC  among others  that night     We now know that other sources were providing the same information throughout the day to the Baton Rouge Emergency Operations Center where FEMA   s top regional operators were stationed   Yet  as we will hear from one of our witnesses today  Mr  Parr  who led the FEMA emergency response team sent to the Superdome  the team didn   t depart Baton Rouge for New Orleans until noon Tuesday     almost a full day after the hurricane had passed     By that time  Lake Ponchatrain had been dumping its waters into downtown New Orleans for hours  making it impossible for the FEMA team to bring its vital communications tractor trailer     wonderfully named    Red October        into the city    This left the team without any reliable means of communications and reduced its effectiveness in New Orleans by some 90 percent  according to Mr  Parr   s testimony   But this wasn   t the only costly delay    We   ve learned from other witnesses that the Coast Guard was performing rescue missions as soon as hurricane force winds abated on Monday afternoon    The State sent its rescue boats out late Monday afternoon  But FEMA   s search and rescue teams didn   t arrive in New Orleans until Tuesday morning  Again  given the catastrophic nature of Katrina   s damage     something well understood by these other agencies     I find it impossible to understand why FEMA wasn   t prepared to move sooner   And the worst part of it all is not just that this was all foreseeable   In fact  it had been foreseen  This precise disaster scenario used in the Hurricane Pam planning exercise conducted in June 2004  It had also been the topic of numerous media stories and Hurricane Conferences for years  This was not a failure of imagination  as some in our Federal response apparatus want to label it   It was a failure of realization     realization that the catastrophe  about which they had been long warned  was about to occur and that they needed to move quickly to address it   Under these kinds of catastrophic conditions  FEMA should not have seen its role as a butler waiting in the wings to assist when called    Rather  it needed to be a battler  anticipating the problems and making the bureaucracy move quickly for the safety and security of the people of the Gulf Coast   Yes  a disaster like Hurricane Katrina is an Act of God that cannot be prevented  Yes  there will be confusion in such natural disasters  Yes  mistakes made by well intentioned people   But adequately preparing for and responding to a disaster of this magnitude required a well led  well trained and well drilled FEMA that had a plan in place and a sense of mission to guide its actions   All these things seemed to have been lacking as disaster swept across the Gulf Coast region last August   Thank you Madam Chairman       30
