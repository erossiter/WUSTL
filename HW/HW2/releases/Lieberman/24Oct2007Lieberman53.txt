 and Chris Dodd  D CT  took a significant step forward in the fight to prevent the Social Security Administration  SSA  from closing its field office in Bristol   The Senate unanimously passed an amendment introduced by both Senators to the appropriations bill that funds the Departments of Education  Labor and Health and Human Services  HHS  that would not allow SSA to close the Bristol office until they meet certain requirements  outlined below    The bill now must go to President Bush    SSA could close the Bristol office as early as November 2  if the legislation has not become law   Lieberman  Dodd and Congressman John B Larson  CT 01  are writing a letter to SSA Commissioner Michael Astrue urging him to respect the wishes of Congress and not close the office at least until the requirements of the amendment have been met     The Senate has sent a loud and clear message to the Social Security Administration that they should keep the Bristol office open   Lieberman said    I hope SSA will not rush to disregard the will of the Senate and close the Bristol office before this amendment has a chance to become law      I am pleased that the full Senate agreed that the Bristol Social Security office should remain open   said Dodd   Our senior citizens face enough challenges without having to travel unreasonable distances or conforming to limited timeframes for access to services they need and deserve  I urge the SSA to accept the recommendation of the Senate and keep the Bristol Office open     Congressman Larson  Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus  said   I look forward to working with my colleagues in the Senate in conference to make sure that this amendment is included in any legislation that hits the President s desk  I will also continue to work with the Social Security Administration  which has been greatly under funded  to keep the Bristol office open   The Bristol Social Security Office is vital to the residents of the community   We are doing everything within our power in Congress to make sure it stays open     The amendment requires SSA to provide the following to Congress before closing the Bristol field office                  A thorough analysis of the criteria used for selecting field offices for closure and how the SSA analyzes and considers factors relating to transportation and communication burdens faced by seniors and the disabled as a result of field office closures                  A cost benefit analysis of closing the office that takes the following into account    o          The savings anticipated by the closure   o          The burdens placed on seniors and the disabled   o          Any costs associated with replacing the services lost by closing the office        Below is the text of the letter sent by Senators Lieberman and Dodd and Rep  Larson to SSA     October 24  2007    Michael J  Astrue  Commissioner  Social Security Administration  6401 Security Boulevard  Baltimore  MD 21235 0001    Dear Commissioner Astrue     We are again writing to ask your reconsideration of the proposal to close the Bristol Office and to bring to your attention an amendment passed today by the United States Senate regarding this proposal       Today  the Senate unanimously adopted an amendment we all supported to prevent any funds from being used to close the Bristol office at this time   We continue to believe that this proposal is ill advised and that the selection of the Bristol office for closure was not based on a sound analysis of the impact on elderly citizens in our state as compared to the relatively minimal savings to be achieved     As we have previously pointed out  the Bristol office serves over 12 000 elderly and disabled citizens each year   According to documents provided by the Social Security Administration  the Bristol office handles 25 to 35 unscheduled walk ins each day  in addition to regularly scheduled appointments   A good many of these walk ins are residents that rely on public transportation   Asking them to travel to New Britain is a hardship   in many cases it would require them to transfer buses or take a taxi each way   We further want to emphasize that this is a population that often is not comfortable negotiating transactions over the telephone  and is not knowledgeable about navigating online services       We continue to believe that the criteria for selecting the Bristol office and other offices for closure has not been articulated and that a comprehensive cost benefit analysis has not been conducted that adequately considers the transportation and communication burdens placed on the elderly   Hence the amendment adopted by the Senate states that the office should not be closed at least until such time as such criteria are identified and such analysis has been submitted     We hope you will honor the will of the Senate   We also hope you will continue to explore with us other options to achieve cost savings while keeping open the Bristol office     Sincerely            Joseph I  Lieberman  UNITED STATES SENATOR    Christopher J  Dodd              UNITED STATES SENATOR    John B  Larson  MEMBER OF CONGRESS
