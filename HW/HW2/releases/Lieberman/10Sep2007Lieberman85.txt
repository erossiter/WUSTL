                                                                                                                                                   CT Post Op Ed       In 1838  Connecticut s first state education secretary  Henry Barnard  looked at our state s failing system of the day and decided reforms were needed to make sure each and every student in the state  regardless of family income  background or neighborhood  received a quality education     Barnard s reforms featured standards to determine whether Connecticut s public schools were achieving their most important purpose  students prepared for life  He wanted testing in core subjects  like reading  writing  history and math  and insisted that core subjects be uniformly taught to all students in the state     This year  I have conducted a listening tour of our state  asking educators  parents and students about the state of education in Connecticut  and I ve had conversations with national leaders in the education reform movement  My conclusion  No Child Left Behind  the landmark legislation enacted over five years ago  was a good first step toward a world class education for all our children  However  further reforms are needed if all our students are going to get an education that prepares them for life in the 21st century  Henry Barnard s solution still makes sense  We need standards for holding our schools accountable for educating all of Connecticut s children     With my colleagues  Sens  Norm Coleman of Minnesota and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana  I have introduced legislation called All Students Can Achieve that will improve accountability  ensure high standards  better gauge teacher effectiveness  make sure our most needy students are being taught by our most effective teachers  and offer schools flexibility as long as they can demonstrate that their students are learning     Consider what s at stake     Across the nation in the past few weeks  close to 50 million students have returned to class in one of our nation s nearly 96 000 public schools  an annual tradition of American renewal that was brought about by reformers like Henry Barnard and Horace Mann  who convinced the nation that a free  quality public education was crucial to America s economic growth and political and civic vitality     That is still true today  The hopes and dreams of those 50 million young Americans in our public schools  and the hopes and dreams of our nation  as well  depend on the education system we create for them     But if present trends continue unchecked  the education many of these students receive will not make the grade  An achievement chasm persists between minority and poor students and all other students  This is the major new civil rights issue of our time  Congress and the Bush administration first recognized this challenge more than five years ago and worked together to pass the No Child Left Behind Act  which is now up for renewal     While we have made progress since that important legislation was signed into law  change has not been significant enough  As the results of the 2007 Connecticut Mastery Test shows  the achievement gaps between white and minority students and between poor and better off students remains unacceptably large  For instance  white students in fourth grade outperform their black and Hispanic peers by 35 to 40 percentage points in reading  writing and math     Our All Students Can Achieve legislation aims to close these gaps by building upon and improving No Child Left Behind in several key ways     We start by allowing schools to use an accountability approach called a growth model that tracks each student s achievement year to year  rather than just comparing one year s class with the previous class  We think this will be a fairer and more meaningful way to determine whether schools are teaching effectively     We then couple the growth model with tracking systems to measure teacher effectiveness by linking individual student growth to individual teachers  Once these systems are in place  we give states flexibility to waive the Highly Qualified Teacher requirements of No Child Left Behind  which often added paperwork requirements without necessarily delivering the best teachers to the classroom  The bill also offers the option of merit pay and other compensation reform proposals for our best teachers     Since our goal is to close the achievement gaps  our bill requires an equitable distribution of the most effective teachers across all schools and also requires that ineffective teachers be transferred away from our most needy schools  Finally  our bill encourages states to adopt high standards in English  math and science  Regardless of a state s decision  parents would be able to use these standards to judge the effectiveness of their neighborhood schools     We believe that these reforms  and other provisions of the bill  will help increase graduation rates  ensure that our students have the skills to succeed  create a strong teacher corps and also give parents  as well as school administrators  school boards and teachers themselves  clear  objective tools they can use to answer the question we care most about  are all students getting the education they need to succeed  Barnard once said  The national education is at once a cause and an effect of the national character  and  offers        an unfailing standard for estimating its advance or retreat upon the line of human progress     Barnard was right  we must establish an unfailing standard for our students and then deliver on that promise  And that standard must be that when any American student graduates from any American school  he or she is prepared for life anywhere in America  and ready to compete and succeed in the world     Joseph I  Lieberman is a U S  senator representing Connecticut
