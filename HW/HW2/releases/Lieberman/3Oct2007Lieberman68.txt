                                                                                                                                        Over the past weeks  the world has watched in awe and admiration as hundreds of thousands of Burmese citizens  led by Buddhist monks  have taken to the streets to protest the vicious dictatorship that rules their country     These courageous individuals have risked their lives for the fundamental freedoms that are the entitlement of all mankind     Last week  the military junta responded to these peaceful protests with indiscriminate violence  shooting into crowds of demonstrators and clubbing and tear gassing others     Although the regime is doing everything in its power to muffle the cries of its victims and suppress the images of their repression  it is clear that hundreds of monks are now in detention  Buddhist monasteries are under siege  journalists have been attacked and arrested   and reports of far  far worse have begun to trickle out     One Burmese general reportedly said   The bodies can be counted in several thousand      Every responsible nation has a duty to send a clear and unmistakable message  The military junta must stop its cruel and bloody war on the people of Burma and begin a peaceful dialogue with the dissidents and democrats it has so brutally oppressed     Unfortunately  the foreign governments with the most leverage over the junta have also been the least willing to use it     The Russian government has defended the dictatorship  issuing a statement last week   just before the bloody crackdown began   that warned against outside  interference  in Burma s  domestic affairs      The performance of the Indian government has also been a disappointment  its army chief of staff just dismissed the junta s repression as an  internal matter      It is the People s Republic of China  however  that enjoys the closest ties with Burma  Beijing is the junta s principal arms supplier  providing 90  of its weapons  and sustains its rulers in power with lucrative business deals and economic assistance  Given this special relationship  the Chinese government has unique authority and ability to restrain its client   or run the risk of being tarred by its sins     Even as we press our foreign friends to do more  however  we must not allow the inaction of other governments to become an excuse for our own inaction  As we learned in the Balkans a decade ago  promises of continuing diplomacy are sometimes not enough  The United States must also think hard about how we can use our own national power to help the Burmese people against their tyrannical rulers     It is encouraging that the U S  government has already doubled its radio broadcasts into Burma through Voice of America and Radio Free Asia     But we must do much more  To begin with  the United States must turn the full spectrum of its intelligence gathering capabilities on Burma to monitor  document and publicize what is happening on the ground     The soldiers who are being ordered to carry out and enforce this bloody crackdown must know that they are being watched and listened to  and their names are being recorded  The men who wear the uniform of this regime must be made to understand that the day will come when they may be judged before a court of their victims  and when that day arrives  there will be ample evidence of the crimes they commit     The Bush administration should also actively investigate how else our military and intelligence capabilities can be used to put additional stress on the regime  The junta has tried to cut off the ability of peaceful demonstrators to communicate to the outside world through the Internet and cell phone networks  we should be examining how the junta s ability to command and control its forces throughout the country might itself be disrupted     Above all  Americans must not forget the faces of the brave men and women who have marched for democracy these past weeks  As the fortunes of freedom in Burma hang in the balance  the United States has a solemn duty to continue to carry the torch of their cause    Lieberman  an independent  is U S  senator from
