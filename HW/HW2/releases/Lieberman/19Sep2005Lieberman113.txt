John McCain  Joseph Lieberman  Jane Harman and Curt Weldon       It was four years ago this month that our brave police officers  firefighters and other emergency response personnel raced into the smoldering buildings of the World Trade Center and the Pentagon to try to save the lives of thousands  Unfortunately  their efforts were hindered by a communications system that failed to allow these first responders to communicate with each other  something known as  interoperability   In some cases  not only could the first responders who entered the twin towers not communicate with each other  they were also unable to reach their base commanders in the lobby or at headquarters because the radio communications could not travel great distances or penetrate the thick steel walls and concrete floors        The Sept  11 commission found   Command and control decisions were affected by the lack of knowledge of what was happening 30  60  90  and 100 floors above  According to one of the  fire  chiefs in the lobby   One of the most critical things in a major operation like this is to have information  We didn t have a lot of information coming in  We didn t receive any reports of what was seen from the       helicopters  It was impossible to know how much damage was done on the upper floors  whether the stairwells were intact or not          People watching on TV certainly had more knowledge of what was happening a hundred floors above us than we did in the lobby           In the past few weeks  we have seen an even more devastating breakdown in emergency communications  as phone lines  cell towers and electrical systems were wracked by Hurricane Katrina  making it nearly impossible at times for many first responders and government officials on the Gulf Coast to talk to each other  Many emergency officials had to resort to runners to communicate with first responders in the field        With all the technology innovations of recent years  how is it that first responders  those we depend on when disaster strikes  are still unable to adequately communicate with each other during an emergency  while we are able to watch the crisis unfold on our television sets  It s because public officials have yet to get serious about developing and funding a safety communications system for all local  state and federal first responders  This reality became all too clear during the bungled response to Katrina        The federal government needs to develop a comprehensive  interoperable emergency communications plan and set equipment standards  fund the purchase of emergency and interoperable communications equipment  and provide additional radio spectrum that will allow first responders to communicate over long distances using the same radio frequencies and equipment        This is not to say that we haven t made some progress  The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  passed last year  required that the federal government take initial steps on both interoperability and public safety spectrum  But we have much more to do  The Sept  11 commission s final report urged Congress to provide more radio spectrum  equipment and funding to first responders for improved communications systems  Since then we have introduced legislation to do so  We believe strongly that such legislation is a life or death matter  But Congress has yet to act        We can only imagine how an improved communications system could have aided rescue workers in their efforts to respond to the needs of citizens after Hurricane Katrina  The federal government has sat by and allowed this problem to remain unresolved for four years following the devastation of Sept  11  2001  even as many predicted another disaster  After watching the horrific communications breakdown that occurred during Katrina  will we wait another four years before acting  How many more lives will be lost  What kind of catastrophic disaster is necessary for Congress to give these heroes the tools they need to save lives        We urge Congress to immediately take up pending legislation that would finally provide emergency first responders with the radio spectrum  equipment and funding necessary to protect themselves as they come to the aid of those they were sworn to protect  When lives are on the line  seconds count  And reliable emergency communications become a matter of
