

the following remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate        I thank the chair   Mr  President  a short while ago I called up amendment number 2732073 which would require a report on support provided by the government of Iran for attacks against coalition forces  American forces  in Iraq   I am going to speak about this now at some length        But let me say at the beginning that I offer this amendment in the hope that it will bring forth a strong unified statement by the Senate of the United States that we have noted the evidence presented by our military about the involvement of the Iranian forces in the training and equipping of Iraqi terrorists who have then gone back to Iraq and are responsible for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers there  and thousands of Iraqi soldiers and civilians as well         So that in the midst of the controversy that exists in our country and that is reflected here in the Senate over the war in Iraq in general  I am hopeful that this amendment will offer an opportunity for us to come together to accept the evidence our military has given us of Iran s involvement in the murder of hundreds of American soldiers and together  and say to the Iranians that this must stop   Here is the evidence  we know what you are doing  this must stop   And then  in an operational clause of the resolution to ask finally  within 30 days after enactment of the act and every 60 days thereafter  the Commander of Multinational Forces in Iraq and the U S  Ambassador to Iraq shall jointly submit to Congress a report describing and assessing in detail external support or direction provided to anti coalition forces by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran or its agents         You know  whether you are pro war in Iraq or antiwar in Iraq  whether you think we ought to mandate a withdrawal of some or all of our troops  or you disagree with that  it seems that every member of this chamber ought to come together around the evidence that our military has provided of what the Iranians are doing to kill our soldiers  and to tell them we know it  and we want them to stop it       Mr  President  yesterday I came to the floor to speak at the beginning of this debate   And I quoted our colleague and friend from Indiana  Senator Lugar  who made a very thoughtful speech  which I agree with in large part  and disagree with in small part   But  I cited with appreciation Senator Lugar s statement and his remarks   And again  we all know that Sen  Lugar is a skeptic when it comes to the strategy we are following in Iraq  Nonetheless  he had a very strong statement in that speech in which he outlined the national security interests in the United States in how the war in Iraq ends   And one of them was to prevent Iran from dominating parts of Iraq and another was to preserve our credibility in the region in the Middle East   the credibility that has been so important in attempting  over decades now  to maintain some minimal level of stability in the Middle East   clearly  a region of the world that is important to us in many ways   In the most direct way  unfortunately because of our failure to adopt an independent energy policy  we continue to depend too much on oil and gas that comes from the Middle East   So we have an interest in keeping it stable   Obviously  we have tremendous spiritual ties to the Middle East  as well as more broadly political and economic ties         I mention this because Senator Lugar did talk about Iran and the importance of maintaining American credibility in the region   To me  nothing illustrates the stakes here and the larger conflict that we re dealing with in the Middle East more clearly than the deadly and destabilizing role that is being played today by the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its agents in Iraq         The fact is  for months and months now  our military commanders and diplomats have been telling us about a proxy war that the Iranians have been waging against our soldiers  other coalition forces and our other allies in Iraq   General David Petraeus  the Commander of Multinational Forces  and others  have spoken bluntly  and publicly and I d say repeatedly  about how the Iranian Quds Force  an elite unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corp  has been training  arming  funding  equipping and directing the extremists in Iraq  terrorists  who then go back into Iraq and attack our troops       This past February  senior military officials of ours in Bagdad  described forensic evidence the implicated Iran at that time in the deaths of at least 170 American service members   And one may assume that the number has gone up significantly since then  170 American service members  killed as a result of the involvement of Iran through Iraqi terrorist allies in Iraq   Lost lives of Americans as a result of what Iran and its proxies are doing       Last week  the United States military spokesman for the Multi National Force Iraq  Brigadier General Kevin Bergner  presented new  and I think stunning details about Iran s complicity in deadly attacks against our service members   And I present this resolution to say to our military  we hear you  But also to also say to the Iranians  we see what you are doing and we are simply not going to accept it         The fact is that the disclosures given by our military about Iranian involvement in Iraq in some sense have drifted up into the media air  which is so cluttered with so much else from the Middle East  from Iraq  so much controversy  that it seems to not have settled into the collective consciousness of members of Congress  let alone the American people about what Iran is doing to our soldiers   our sons and daughters  our husbands and wives  our friends  our neighbors   So it s time for the Senate to say to Iran  we know what you are doing  it is time for you to stop it       Last Monday  according to General Bergner  Iran has been using its territory to train and organize Iraqi terrorists  who then go back and kill Americans and Iraqis in Iraq   General Bergner said that groups of up to 60 Iraqi militants at a time have been taken to three training camps near Tehran   This is more specific information than ever has come out before  publicly   three training camps operated by the Quds Force near Tehran  where these extremists from Iraq have received instruction in use of mortars  rockets  improvised explosive devices  bombs used by suicide bombers or those set off in sophisticated ways from a distance  and other deadly tools of guerrilla warfare  that they then use against our troops in Iraq       Iran is also   General Bergner pointed out  and this I thought was stunning and should not be allowed to just fade  after a day s news cycle  away Iran is also using the Lebanese Islamist terrorist group  Hezbollah  as a surrogate  to help build up its terrorist allies in Iraq   That is what General Bergner  our general  our spokesperson in Bagdad  said         So the Iranians are bringing their Hezbollah terrorist clans from Lebanon  where they are also threatening and fighting the established Siniora Government in Beirut which is our ally   a moderate government   an ally of ours   The Iranians are bringing Hezbollah from Lebanon to Iraq and Iran to train Iraqis to kill Americans and Iraqis   We know this in part  General Bergner made clear  because our forces have captured one of the Hezbollah leaders Ali Moussa Dakdouk   Inside Iraq  he was captured   A Lebanese  Hezbollah  Islamist terrorist leader  captured inside Iraq   And documents were recovered that detail the relationship between the Iranian regime and the extremist groups that they are sponsoring in Iraq  so said  Brigadier General Kevin Bergner  spokesperson for our forces in Iraq         General Bergner also reported last Monday that the U S  military has concluded that the  senior leadership   that s the quote   the senior leadership in Iran is aware of the activities of the Quds Force in sponsoring attacks against our soldiers in Iraq          And that  in his words  it is  hard to imagine   that the Supreme Leader of Iran  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  does not know about them      These are very serious statements  very serious charges  by a respected and authoritative spokesperson of the U S  military   And those who follow the complicated inner world of Iranian government know  that this elite military terrorist group  the Iran Revolutionary Guard Corps  or IRGC  and the Quds Force which is part of it  their leadership is selected and reports directly to the Supreme Leader of Iran Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  not President Ahmadinejad   So there is plenty of basis  and the evidence we have of the involvement of the Quds Force and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps  which we know reports to the Supreme Leader of Iran   that the Supreme Leader of Iran knows what they are doing and presumably has approved it   If he didn t know what they were doing  he certainly does now  because the American military has been telling the world   probably wondering if anyone has been listening for months and months now  that this is exactly what Iran s been doing       Mr  President  it goes without saying  but I want to say it that no one in this chamber is looking for a fight with Iran   But  that does nothing to alter the fact that Iran has  through its proxies  initiated a fight against us   That s a reality that we no longer have the luxury of ignoring   It s a reality we must confront in the defense of the men and women who wear the uniform  the proud uniform of the United States of America in battle in Iraq today         Iran s actions in Iraq today fit squarely within a larger pattern of expansionist  extremist behavior by the Islamic Republic of Iran in the Middle East  over all the years   more than a quarter of a century now   since 1979 when the revolution occurred in Iran  when the American Embassy was seized  when the hostages were held in an outrageous act for more than a year   We know that the Iranian government has used radical Islamist groups throughout the years since then as its regional proxies   We know that these proxies have been dispatched to attack and murder American soldiers and citizens in the past       What am I speaking of   I am speaking of the Marine Corps Barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983   24 years ago  which killed 241  I believe  American Marines   All the evidence that was gathered after that  to me  makes a compelling case  that that attack was carried out by Hezbollah  which is sponsored  supported  equipped  trained  directed  by Iran   And then there was the Khobar Towers attacks in Saudi Arabia in 1996  where American military and other personnel lived   again  American blood on the hands of Iran from all of the evidence that I have seen about the cause of that attack  the perpetrators being agents of the Iranian government         We know that these proxies have worked aggressively and consistently on behalf of the extremist regime in Tehran  to undermine moderate governments in the region and to extend Iranian influence   And Mr  President  it is happening now  in a way that seems to me to be more concerted  more aggressive  than ever before   You can pick your reason for it   Look at Supreme Leader Khamenei and President Ahmadinejad   fanatics  anti Americans  shouting  urging their followers by the thousands to shout  death to America    death to America    they have been doing that since 1979 and they continue to do it   We can t take it as a meaningless chant   You have to take extremists at their word because we ve seen too often in our history most recently  with all that Osama bin Laden was telling us he would do to us in the 1990s  and in fact he did it  most tragically on 9 11       Some would say that this move throughout the region by Iran is to take the mind of the unhappy Iranian majority off of the economic failures of the Ahmadinejad government   Others would say this is the moment when the Iranians think that American and other powers that have helped keep the balance and stability in the region will not respond to their aggression   But regardless of the reason  we ve got to open our eyes and see what is happening in the Middle East today  and see that in addition to sponsoring attacks on Americans and Iraqis in Iraq  Tehran is also training  funding and equipping radical terrorist groups that are working to destabilize Lebanon  the Palestinian Authority and Afghanistan         And  Afghanistan is a fascinating example  because  by the evidence our military has  Iran is now supporting the Taliban  which has historically been its enemy   The Taliban now  according to what our military tells us  appears to be receiving Iranian weapons in their ongoing war against the government of President Karzai   our ally  a hope for a new Afghanistan  and the American and NATO forces there      In fact  in one sense it makes perfect sense that Iran is using Hezbollah to aid extremists in Iraq   The fact is  each of the seeming separate conflicts that I have just described in the Middle East have a connection   They are part of a larger regional war that we are involved in  but so are so many of our allies in the region   Israel  obviously  but also broadly in the Arab world   If you have been to the Middle East  as I have recently  you find that the level of anxiety  beyond concern  anxiety  in the Arab world among our allies  about the movements and intentions of Iran is palpable   The fear of course is that Iran is moving to establish itself as the dominant power in the region and to establish its own brand of Islamist extremism as the dominant ideology in the region        In some sense  this is an undeclared war but it is nonetheless very real   This is a fight that the Iranians want to wage in the shadows I suppose  so they can escape some of the blood on their hands   But it s also evident  as the American military and the governments of Lebanon and Afghanistan and the Palestinian Authority have themselves made clear         Mr  President  in debating this bill  our first and foremost responsibility is to protect national security and to protect our troops who are protecting our national security   If we don t respond to the evidence that has been presented to us about the acts of the Iranian government and their agents  I fear  we will have failed on both counts   Our troops are being attacked and killed by the agents of Iran  The very least we in this chamber can do is to send a clear and unmistakable message to the government in Iran that we know what you are doing and we insist that you stop         That is why I am offering this amendment today to the Defense Authorization Act   I hope my colleagues will see it as a common sense  common ground amendment  that confronts the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  with the evidence of its attacks on American soldiers in Iraq   The amendment details the evidence already in the public record that has been put forward over the past year by General Petraeus and other senior officials about Iran s involvement in violence and other destabilizing activities in Iraq       Mr  President  I repeat what I said at the outset   Whether you are for or against the war in Iraq  whether you are for or against an amendment or timeline for withdrawing our troops  I hope that we all can find common ground in making this statement that we see the evidence of Iran s complicity in the deaths of American soldiers and we insist that they stop   This amendment is not a call for war against Iran   I as all the members of this chamber  I m sure  always favor diplomacy first   But this is a call to defend out troops  and our vital interests which are under attack by Iran   It is a call for all of us to wake up to the outrageous actions that are being undertaken by the extremist government in Tehran       Mr  President  it is important that we no longer deceive ourselves   If Iran can get away with the murder of American soldiers and pay no price  it will do it again and again and again   We cannot allow Iran to have a license to wantonly and deliberately murder out troops   For if we sit silently by  while this is happening  they will continue to take actions that are hostile to us  and the chances of us achieving  what I think everybody in this chamber would want us to achieve  which is to stop the Iranians from developing nuclear weapons  will simply be impossible       The choice with Iran is not a choice between war and peace  it is at this moment a choice between turning a blind eye to the murder of our troops and confronting those who are murdering them   It is a choice between sending a message of determination and deterrence which will hopefully end this action by the Iranians  and sending a message of weakness and appeasement   Just as our men and women in uniform are serving in Iraq to protect and defend all of us  they respond to what their nation asks them to do   So too  do we in this chamber have a responsibility  that I know we all acknowledge   It comes out of this Department of Defense Authorization Bill  loudly and clearly  we accept our responsibility to do everything in our power to defend the men and women who serve us          Support our Troops   I know  is not just a bumper sticker   It is a solemn pledge of this government and everyone who serves it  including those of us who are privileged to serve in this Senate         I also hope this resolution can form the foundation for a larger  longer conversation that we in Congress need to have about the struggle that we are in with Iran regionally   The Iranian government poses a threat to the security not just the soldiers that I have talked about  but to our allies in that region  which I have talked about  and ultimately  I fear  to our country  the United States of America   And the way that our policy must take account of that reality         The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers  lives  our security as a nation and our allies in the Middle East is a truth that cannot be wished or waved away   It must be confronted  and this resolution  this amendment  gives this Senate the opportunity to do that   So let us  then  Mr  President  with one voice  tell the fanatical anti American leaders of the government of Tehran  who I believe do not represent the majority of the Iranian people  that they cannot attack our troops without consequence   Let us  with one voice  tell our brave soldiers in Iraq  that Iran s assault on them with not go unnoticed or unanswered by this Senate         The regime in Iran  I fear  is betting that our political disunity about Iraq will constrain us in responding to its attacks   I don t believe that   For the sake of our nation s security  for the sake of our soldiers  we must  and I am confident  will prove them wrong       I thank chair and I yield the floor         30
