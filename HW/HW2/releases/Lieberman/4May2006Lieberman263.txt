on Imported Oil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lieberman pushes for America to break its addiction to oil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON     In a display of bipartisanship on a critical national issue  Senators Joe Lieberman  D CT   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Evan Bayh  D IN   Norm Coleman  R MN  and Lincoln Chafee  R RI  have joined in putting together legislation aimed at reducing America   s dependence on fossil fuels  especially oil        The Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006  introduced today  will greatly spur energy conservation  with a focus on reducing oil demand through greater fuel efficiency and finding ways to moderate natural gas demand by promoting renewable electricity production   Among the most important provisions of the bill will be an emphasis on an expanded plan for economy wide oil savings that will cut oil use  from projected levels  by 2 5 million barrels of oil per day by 2016  7 million barrels of oil per day by 2026  and 10 million barrels of oil per day by 2031           To free ourselves from recurring gas price spikes  the caprice of volatile and even hostile nations  and the threat of global warming  we must end our addiction to oil     Lieberman said     This legislation would put our economy on an oil reducing diet and push to market the alternative fuels and advanced technologies that will end our oil addiction  It is now time that everyone   including the Bush Administration     take action on one of the biggest economic and national security challenges of our generation             Time is running out in this Congress to take action on energy     Bingaman pointed out      To be effective in responding to our current energy crisis  we must be focused  we must be realistic  and we must be bipartisan   The bill that we are introducing today accomplishes all three goals  and will help consumers by making them more efficient in their use of oil and natural gas              The high gas prices we are facing today can only be addressed by a serious  long term effort to reduce our dependence on foreign oil     Bayh said      Everything from our national security to our economy is impacted by our energy demands  and it will take an effort equal to that of landing a man on the moon to develop a strategy to meet those needs   The bipartisan energy plan we have introduced today represents a real step toward meeting that challenge               With gas prices continuing to rise  the burden of our reliance on foreign oil is now being felt in nearly every household and business   said Coleman    Not only does this reliance result in economic strain  it is a threat to our national security   It   s time we take our energy future out of the hands of foreign nations and implement an aggressive national energy plan that returns Americans to the driver   s seat   This plan will do exactly that            Our nation   s overdependence on oil is a dangerous addiction   It harms our environment  hurts our economy  and imperils our national security     said Chafee      While we must resolve the short term price situation that we are facing today  we also must take a critical look at where we as a nation are going in the longer term   This bipartisan legislation is a promising first step to set America free from its reliance on foreign oil            The legislation includes a variety of initiatives designed to reduce our nation   s nearly total reliance on petroleum products in the transportation sector  including programs that will                   Speed the development of new vehicle technologies such as plug in hybrids and the use of advanced light weight materials in vehicles                  Expand the authority of the Secretary of Energy to provide loan guarantees and competitive grants to automakers and parts manufacturers to convert existing plants or to build new facilities for manufacturing fuel efficient vehicles and vehicle components                  Increase the availability of alternative fuels  such as E85  across the country by providing funding for alternative fueling stations                  Provide funds to states for programs to encourage motorists to retire vehicles that are inefficient  and for programs to reduce school bus idling  and                  Provide incentives for the production of cellulosic ethanol        The bill is similar to legislation that Sens  Lieberman  Bayh  Brownback  and Coleman introduced last year   That bill     S 2025  the Vehicle Fuel Choice Act    provided a mix of energy policy and energy tax incentives aimed at moving our economy toward both more efficient use of oil and a more diverse future mix of transportation fuels  including biofuels   Lieberman and 16 other senators co sponsored that bill         Because S 2025 mixed policy and tax provisions  it was referred to the Senate Finance Committee   Yet  many of the provisions of S 2025 are in the jurisdiction of the Senate Energy Committee   The Enhanced Energy Security Act of 2006 takes those energy provisions and puts them in a bill that will be referred to the Energy Committee          The new bill also includes a number of provisions aimed at relieving demand and price pressure on natural gas  encouraging states to strengthen their programs on demand side management  and better educating consumers about energy efficiency measures that they can take        In addition to this bill  Sen  Lieberman and other senators today introduced  also on a bipartisan basis  legislation that will extend a variety of tax provisions contained in the energy bill enacted last year to encourage efficiency investments and the development of renewables  It also will provide new incentives to help Americans buy more fuel efficient vehicles   The cost of these incentives will be offset by closing various tax loopholes for large oil companies             30
