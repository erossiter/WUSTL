NV  and Joe Lieberman  D CT  today introduced comprehensive bipartisan legislation that will ensure the United States remains the lead in innovation  research and development and the training of scientists and engineers  The National Innovation Act  which is based on    Innovate America     The Council on Competitiveness    National Innovation Initiative Report  focuses on three primary areas of importance to maintaining and improving United States    innovation in the 21st Century   research investment  increasing science and technology talent and developing an innovation infrastructure        Joining Ensign and Lieberman as original co sponsors of the bill were Senators Lamar Alexander  R TN   George Allen  R VA   Evan Bayh  D IN   Jeff Bingaman  D NM   Saxby Chambliss  R GA   John

our legislation is to ensure America   s global role as a leader in technological innovation and to tap into the vast expertise and talent at our disposal     Ensign said      Innovation fosters new ideas and technology which leads to a more prosperous future   I   m proud to be a part of this effort and grateful for my colleagues    enthusiastic support              The number of jobs requiring technical training is growing at five times the rate of other occupations     Lieberman said      However  the average number of students studying and entering these fields is declining and the average age of the U S  science and engineering workforce is rising   Our legislation will significantly increase federal support for graduate fellowship and traineeship programs in science  math  and engineering fields in order to attract more students to these fields and to create a more competitive and innovative American workforce              I want the United States to be the world capitol for innovation     Allen said   The National Innovation Act is a comprehensive initiative investing  incenting  and encouraging Americans into the fields of engineering  science  and technology  I aim to provide strong leadership to motivate Americans to these essential goals for America   s standard of living  national security  and opportunity for all               This bill is critical to fostering cutting edge innovations for Wisconsin manufacturers and keeping America at the head of the pack in research and development     Kohl said         China and India alone graduate 6 4 million from college each year and over 950 000 engineers   The United States turns out 1 3 million college graduates and 70 000 engineers   We live in a global society  and by spurring research and innovation in the U S   we are also insuring that our companies stay competitive internationally and prosper domestically   Lugar said             It   s essential that we invest in the next generation of scientists so we can continue to be world leaders in these fields     and that   s exactly what the National Innovation Act aims to do     Nelson said        Features of the bill include                      Establishes the President   s Council on Innovation to develop a comprehensive agenda to promote innovation in the public and private sectors                        Establishes
