Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday submitted the following statement into the Congressional Record on his support for John Negroponte  confrimed to be the first Director of National Intelligence   Lieberman and HSGAC Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   authored the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004  which established the position   The legislation was signed into law by President Bush December 17  2004        Mr  President  I rise today to express my support for this historic nomination of Ambassador John Negroponte to be the first Director of National Intelligence  DNI  named under the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004     the most sweeping reform of the intelligence community in over 50 years   With this appointment  we will finally have a single official with the authority  responsibility  and accountability to lead a more unified and more integrated intelligence community capable of avoiding the unacceptable intelligence failures recounted in excruciating detail by the independent 9 11 Commission and  more recently  by the President   s WMD Commission    I am confident Ambassador Negroponte is up to this admittedly difficult task   With a career in public service spanning over four decades  Ambassador Negroponte has demonstrated the commitment and determination this post demands   His service in numerous Foreign Service posts across Asia  Europe  and Latin America     and most recently as the U S  Ambassador to Iraq     has certainly provided him with the global perspective of our intelligence needs that the position requires   And  having served in senior positions here in Washington at the State Department and at the National Security Council  Ambassador Negroponte has developed the bureaucratic skills that the DNI must exercise in order to be effective    The most important factor in whether Ambassador Negroponte     indeed  whether the entire intelligence reform effort     succeeds  is the degree of support provided by President Bush and the White House in the early but formative stages of this process   The path toward reform is always a difficult one  particularly with the likely array of bureaucratic and institutional obstacles the DNI is likely to confront   As the WMD Commission candidly recognized     The Intelligence Community is a closed world  and many insiders admitted to us that it has an almost perfect record of resisting external recommendations      It should come as no surprise that the array of strong statutory authorities provided to the DNI under the legislation can  in and of itself  only accomplish so much  implementation will now be the crucial test  and the President must show the same level of commitment he demonstrated during the final push to pass the intelligence reform legislation in the last Congress    I am encouraged in this regard by the President   s remarks in announcing the nomination of Ambassador Negroponte   President Bush said  quote          In the war against terrorists who target innocent civilians and continue to seek weapons of mass murder  intelligence is our first line of defense  If we re going to stop the terrorists before they strike  we must ensure that our intelligence agencies work as a single  unified enterprise  And that s why I supported  and Congress passed  reform legislation creating the job of Director of National Intelligence              As DNI  John will lead a unified intelligence community  and will serve as the principle advisor to the President on intelligence matters  He will have the authority to order the collection of new intelligence  to ensure the sharing of information among agencies  and to establish common standards for the intelligence community s personnel  It will be John s responsibility to determine the annual budgets for all national intelligence agencies and offices and to direct how these funds are spent  Vesting these authorities in a single official who reports directly to me will make our intelligence efforts better coordinated  more efficient  and more effective            Unfortunately  we had no single official who effectively forged unity of effort across the intelligence community prior to September 11   We had no quarterback   Prior to this legislation  the Director of Central Intelligence  DCI  had three jobs    1  principal intelligence advisor to the President   2  head of the CIA  and  3  head of the intelligence community   As the 9 11 Commission concluded      No recent DCI has been able to do all three effectively   Usually what loses out is management of the intelligence community  a difficult task even in the best case because the DCI   s current authorities are weak   With so much to do  the DCI often has not used even the authority he has      The new Director of National Intelligence has two main responsibilities   to head the intelligence community and to serve as principal intelligence advisor to the President   As principal advisor to the President  the DNI is responsible     and accountable     for ensuring that the President is properly briefed on intelligence priorities and activities   The CIA Director will now report to the DNI  who is not responsible for managing the day to day activities of that agency while also heading the intelligence community   In fact  the legislation specifies that the Office of the DNI may not even be co located with the CIA or any other element of the intelligence community after October 1  2008      As head of the intelligence community  the DNI will have     and must effectively use     the wide range of strong budget  personnel  tasking  and other authorities detailed in the legislation to forge the unity of effort needed against the threats of this new century   I am pleased that Ambassador Negroponte  appearing before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence  indicated he has heeded the advice from many quarters  including the President   s WMD Commission  to push the envelope with respect to his new authorities   Perhaps the most significant of these authorities is the DNI   s control over national intelligence funding  now known as the National Intelligence Program  NIP    Money equals power in Washington  or to paraphrase one of the witnesses who testified before the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee as we drafted the intelligence reform legislation  former DCI James Woolsey     The Golden Rule in Washington is that he who has the gold  makes the rules      For instance  with respect to budget development  the bill authorizes the DNI to    develop and determine    the NIP budget     which means that the DNI is the decision maker concerning the intelligence budget and does not share this authority with any department head     Once Congress passes the national intelligence budget  the DNI must    ensure the effective execution    of the NIP appropriation across the entire intelligence community     whether the funds are for the CIA  NSA  the Federal Bureau of Investigation  or any element of the intelligence community   The Director of the Office of Management and Budget must apportion those funds at the    exclusive direction    of the DNI   The DNI is further authorized to    direct    the allotment and allocation of those appropriations  and department comptrollers must then carry out their responsibilities    in an expeditious manner      In sum  the DNI controls how national intelligence funding is spent across the executive branch  regardless of the department in which any particular intelligence element resides   In order to marshal the necessary resources to address higher priority intelligence activities  the DNI has significantly enhanced authorities to transfer funds and personnel from one element of the intelligence community to another   And  in addition to these budget and transfer authorities  the legislation provides the DNI with many new and increased authorities by which to effectively manage the sprawling intelligence community and force greater integration and cooperation among intelligence agencies   The DNI has the power to develop personnel policies and programs  for example  to foster increased    jointness    across the intelligence community     like the Goldwater Nichols Act accomplished in the military context   The DNI also has the authority to exercise greater decision making with respect to acquisitions of major systems  such as satellites  to task intelligence collection and analysis  and to concur in the nominations or appointments of senior intelligence officials at the Departments of Defense  Homeland Security  Treasury  State  and Energy  the FBI  and elsewhere across the executive branch   More important than any individual authority  however  is the sum total   There is no longer any doubt as to who is in charge of  or who is accountable for  the performance of the United States intelligence community   It is the DNI   Until exercised in practice  however  these authorities are simply the words of a statute   And  unless exercised  they will atrophy   Timidity  weakness  even passivity are not an option   History will judge harshly a DNI who squanders this opportunity to spread meaningful and lasting reform across the intelligence community   And our national security depends upon it   I fully anticipate that Ambassador Negroponte will rise to the occasion  He must  and I believe he will  hit the ground running  boldly face the inevitable challenges and frustrations that lie ahead  and aggressively assert the authorities with which he has been provided   But the DNI will not be alone   With the full support of the President  the Joint Intelligence Community Council     composed of the Secretaries of State  Treasury  Defense  Energy  Homeland Security  and the Attorney General     will advise the DNI and make sure the DNI   s programs  policies  and directives are executed within their respective departments in a timely manner   And  if confirmed  the President   s nominee for Principal Deputy DNI  NSA Director Lieutenant General Michael Hayden  will be a most valuable asset in leading the reform effort   We have largely provided Ambassador Negroponte with the flexibility to establish the Office of the DNI as he sees fit in order to accomplish the goal of reform   In addition to his Principal Deputy  he may appoint as many as four other deputies with the duties  responsibilities  and authorities he deems appropriate   And  in addition to the National Counterterrorism Center  which is specifically mandated under the legislation  Ambassador Negroponte is authorized to establish national intelligence centers  apart from any individual intelligence agency  to drive community wide all source analysis and collection on key intelligence priorities   These national intelligence centers have significant potential to shift the center of gravity in the intelligence community from individual stove piped agencies toward a mission oriented integrated intelligence network   In sum  we have provided Ambassador Negroponte with the tools to get the job done   Now  with the backing of the President  he must use those authorities to transform the intelligence community as envisioned by the 9 11 Commission  expected by Congress  and needed for the security of the American people   On September 11  2001  it became painfully evident that the threats we face as a nation had evolved  and that our national security structure needed to evolve accordingly   Ambassador Negroponte will now have the opportunity to help our intelligence community meet these new security challenges   I wish him well        30
