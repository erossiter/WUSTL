                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  today addressed the current Iraq debate on the Senate floor       The text of the speech  as prepared for delivery  is below       Mr  President  the Senate gathers once again to debate the war in Iraq   a debate that has been at the center of our national politics for more than four years        As everyone here knows  we are now in the thick of the battle for Baghdad   a critical battle whose outcome hangs in the balance  A new commander  General David Petraeus  has taken command  having been confirmed by this Senate  81 0  just a few weeks ago  And a new strategy is being put into action        The question we now confront is simple  will Congress give General Petraeus and his troops a fighting chance to succeed       The joint resolution before us would deny them that chance  forcing our troops to break off the battle of Baghdad before it has barely begun  Instead of providing General Petraeus with the necessary reinforcements he has requested   the reinforcements he is counting on   it would begin to strip troops away from him        We need to be clear with ourselves  and with the nation  on this point  the joint resolution we are debating would impose a fixed date for the beginning of a withdrawal  One hundred twenty days after this legislation is passed  American forces would be required by law to begin redeploying out of Iraq  This would happen regardless of conditions on the ground  regardless of the recommendations of General Petraeus  regardless of the wishes of our allies  regardless of whether security is improving or deteriorating        It would bind the hands of General Petraeus  substituting the judgment of Congress for the judgment of our military commanders  our diplomats  and of our friends in the region        Congress has many responsibilities  but the micromanagement of war is not one of them        In fact  the proponents of this resolution make no attempt to justify why 120 days from now is the right time to commence a withdrawal  That is because there is no military or strategic logic at work here  This is a deadline that is as arbitrary as it is inflexible  It specifically denies General Petraeus the room for maneuver that history tells us any successful commander requires       Surely we know better than this  Surely we cannot think that this is a path to success        I remember hearing many of my colleagues arguing against precisely this kind of fixed deadline   some of them right here in this chamber   just a few months ago       I ask my colleagues  what has changed  What is the strategic logic here       We hear opponents of the current strategy insist that our troops should not be  policing a civil war         That position might come as a surprise to the soldiers who have been serving in Bosnia and Kosovo over the past decade  dispatched there under a Democratic President with the support of Democrats in Congress   the support of many of the same colleagues of mine who today are clamoring for withdrawal        I ask you  what has changed       Has security worsened in Iraq since the new strategy began  Has the political situation deteriorated  Have you lost confidence in General Petraeus  whom we appointed just a few weeks ago       The honest answer to all of these questions is of course no       If we were to stop our legislative maneuvering for a moment and actually look at what is happening in Baghdad right now  what would we see        We would see that sectarian fighting between Sunni and Shiites is down between 50 and 80 percent in some districts of Baghdad        We would see that where previously  approximately 20 Iraqi families were fleeing the Iraqi capital every day  now between 600 and 1 000 families have been returning        We would see that Moqtada al Sadr has disappeared  that many of his top lieutenants have been arrested  and that his Mahdi Army   which terrorized Baghdad for the past year   has gone to ground        We would also see signs of political progress  including the passage of the new oil law by the Iraqi cabinet  renewed talks by Sunni insurgent leaders about reconciliation  and word of an impending government shake up  involving the removal of ministers linked to Moqtada al Sadr       And finally  we would see that the military surge has made possible a diplomatic surge  as representatives from neighboring countries gathered in Baghdad last weekend in the first of a series of regional conferences        Mr  President  I do not know if this is success  but it certainly does not look like not failure        Why  in the face of these developments  would this chamber possibly adopt a joint resolution like this  Why  in the face of encouraging developments that suggest that this new plan might be working  would this chamber demand that it end  Why  just weeks after confirming General Petraeus  would this chamber block him from carrying out the strategy he has developed       There is only one justification for Congress to impose this kind of deadline to begin a withdrawal  and that is if we are absolutely convinced that General Petraeus  strategy is doomed to failure  The only way a timetable for withdrawal makes sense is if there is no glimmer of hope that General Petraeus  strategy can succeed        Mr  President  that is simply not a conclusion justified by the facts on the ground       We are in a long and difficult war  and the price paid by our heroic soldiers and their families has been heavy  It is a war in which we have made mistakes  and in which we have experienced setbacks  And it is a war that has stirred feelings of anger and frustration among the American people   feelings that are justified        What is not justified  however  is for Congress to let the passions and politics of the moment blind us to the facts on the ground in Iraq  Our decision making must be driven by the real world conditions in Baghdad  not by minds already made up in Washington       The joint resolution before this chamber fails that test  And that is why it should fail to pass this Senate       No one knows for certain if the new strategy will succeed        General Petraeus says he will be able to see whether his plan is succeeding by the end of the summer        Let us declare a truce in the Washington war until then  For the next six months  let us instead come together around a constructive legislative agenda for our security  authorizing an increase in the size of the Army and Marines  funding the equipment and protection our troops need  monitoring progress on the ground in Iraq with oversight hearings  investigating contract procedures  and guaranteeing Iraq war veterans the first class treatment and care they deserve when they come home        I ask my colleagues to think hard about what we are doing  I ask you to look carefully not at the public opinion polls in Washington  but at the realities on the ground in Iraq  And I ask you to step back from this path   and to vote against this resolution
