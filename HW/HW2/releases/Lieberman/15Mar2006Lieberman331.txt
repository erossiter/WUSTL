blasted Senate Republicans for shortchanging millions of Americans by voting down several Democratic amendments to the FY 2007 Federal budget proposal  These amendments  sponsored by Lieberman and his Democratic colleagues were aimed at helping veterans  providing education and job training  developing renewable energy and promoting fiscal responsibility        Across the board  the budget proposal put forth by Senate Republicans has put special interests ahead of helping hard working Americans and our nation   s neediest citizens     said Lieberman      These are the wrong priorities   By shortchanging veterans  blocking funding for education and job training  refusing to address the need for developing renewable energy sources and rejecting fiscal responsibility  Republicans are failing to uphold their responsibility to the American people  while crippling future generations with the burden of paying the tab         The Democratic budget amendments rejected by Republicans last night include        Veterans Benefits   Senator Lieberman cosponsored Senator Akaka and Senator Murray   s amendment to increase Veterans medical services funding by  1 5 billion in FY2007 to be paid for by closing corporate tax loopholes  The Administration is not funding the VA in their budget proposal fully  but instead proposes to generate revenues by increasing costs to veterans for healthcare  Their proposal would force veterans to pay higher co pays  higher premiums  and enrollment fees for services  The President   s increases are claimed to target    higher income    veterans  however  many of these are veterans make as little  26 902 per year  They simply cannot be considered    higher income     The Akaka Murray amendment would have addressed the President   s gap in funding for veterans    health by making sure our veterans get the healthcare they need and not by shifting costs to them  The amendment would have also increased funding for mental health services  readjustment counseling  and rehabilitative care  including prosthetics  and provided funding for treating OIF OEF veterans        Renewable and Clean Energy   This amendment  offered by Senator Bingaman  and co sponsored by Senator Lieberman  would fully fund  in FY 2007  the energy authorizations in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 by adding  3 549 billion to that function for 2007  in order to promote and accelerate hybrid vehicle technologies and   biodiesel engines   fund federal procurement of fuel cells  and boost authorized vehicle energy efficiency programs    add an additional  500 million in FY 2007 for LIHEAP and extend for 4 years the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit and the companion Clean Renewable Energy Bonds  program  for public power   from their current sunset of December 31  2007 to December 31  2011  all of which assist in the deployment of cellulosic ethanol and wind  solar and biomass energy         Education and Job Training   Education and Job Training   Lieberman co sponsored a budget amendment introduced by Senator Kennedy  that would have helped give Americans the opportunity to attain a college degree and better compete in the global economy by securing  1 8 billion to increase the maximum Pell Grant award to  4 500 and securing  2 4 billion to restore Bush eliminations of TRIO  GEAR UP  LEAP  and Perkins loans  and further increase funding for all student aid programs  including SEOG  work study  and graduate education   It would also have helped to ensure that all Americans have the opportunity to build their skills and get good jobs by restoring the  750 million Bush budget cuts to job training and restoring President Bush   s  1 3 billion elimination of the Perkins Vocational Education program        Pay Go   The Pay Go amendment offered by Sen  Conrad  and supported by Sen  Lieberman and all other Democrats  would have restored true discipline to the federal budget process   It would have required that all spending increases and tax cuts would have to be offset by spending cuts or revenue increases somewhere else in the budget   Currently  tax increases escape the discipline of this process   Sen  Lieberman believes that this Pay Go provision   which Democrats have long fought to enact   is a necessary first step in getting our country   s runaway fiscal policy under control         30
