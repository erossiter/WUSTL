                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON   The Connecticut Congressional Delegation today expressed hope that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission  FERC  would reject the Locational Installed Capacity  LICAP  rate schedule in Connecticut and immediately consider better alternatives  but vowed to pursue legislation to halt LICAP if necessary          The State of Connecticut made the case to FERC Commissioners in a hearing today that implementation of a plan proposed by ISO New England would artificially increase by billions of dollars electric rates paid in Connecticut and across New England  causing a severe financial impact on Connecticut consumers  as well as on Connecticut   s overall economic and business development          The LICAP plan had been scheduled to go into effect this fall throughout New England but amidst heavy opposition from New England state governments and Congressional delegations  FERC decided in August to postpone implementation of the plan until fall of 2006  allowing more time for public hearings on the proposal  including the one held in Washington today          The Connecticut Congressional delegation has repeatedly joined Connecticut state officials in strenuously opposing the proposal   In July  Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman succeeded in getting a    Sense of the Congress    resolution attached to the energy bill asking FERC to reconsider its decision  which would have hiked rates to create over  12 billion of new financial incentives for energy companies to encourage  but not require  them to build more electric generation plants   The delegation vowed to pursue more binding legislation if FERC does not quash LICAP and instead implement a more reasonable plan           Connecticut consumers need an adequate power supply at a fair rate  and frankly  the ISO plan just doesn   t cut it     Dodd said     The FERC Commissioners need to reject this proposal and go back to the drawing board  If not  the Connecticut delegation stands ready  willing  and able to propose legislation to fix this problem              FERC   s pricing scheme is simply unacceptable     Lieberman said     It artificially inflates electricity bills of consumers without any assurance that new capacity will be built  It is simply a windfall to existing generators  Connecticut made a compelling case today and I   m hopeful that the Commissioners will do the right thing and reject this plan for good   But if they do not  we will move swiftly to do so through legislative means              This LICAP proposal imposes new costs on consumers without an increase in energy capacity     Congresswoman Nancy Johnson said     We need a plan that will meet our energy needs reliably and affordably  and the LICAP will not accomplish that goal  FERC should reject this plan for the good of Connecticut electricity consumers              LICAP is a costly and unfair plan and we ll do what it takes to put an end to it     Congressman Christopher Shays said      I m concerned that Connecticut consumers will bear the brunt of the costs  without getting any additional benefits   FERC needs to hear us loud and clear  LICAP is fatally flawed              Connecticut s case against LICAP is very strong  and these oral arguments will hopefully lead to a real discussion about how to solve Connecticut s energy challenges in a way that is good for energy producers and good for consumers     Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said     As a last resort  the delegation stands ready to introduce legislation overturning LICAP if necessary  but it is my hope that FERC will agree that this proposed price hike is misguided and deeply flawed              With a price tag of over  3 billion  LICAP is a costly and ill advised plan that will do nothing to benefit the home and business owners of Connecticut     Congressman John Larson said      Our state needs the opportunity to come up with a better plan  and we are hopeful that FERC will follow our advice and reject this proposal   If it fails to reject this plan  the delegation is ready to take action any action as necessary              Connecticut s elected officials are united in opposition to this costly LICAP pricing scheme     Congressman Rob Simmons said      FERC should reject the current plan and go back to the drawing board and find an alternative   However  if FERC decides to move ahead  the state congressional delegation stands ready  willing and able to move legislation through Congress that protects Connecticut s consumers             30
