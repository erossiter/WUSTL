                                                                                                                                        I recently returned from Iraq and four other countries in the Middle East  my first trip to the region since December  In the intervening five months  almost everything about the American war effort in Baghdad has changed  with a new coalition military commander  Gen  David Petraeus  a new U S  ambassador  Ryan Crocker  the introduction  at last  of new troops  and most important of all  a bold  new counterinsurgency strategy       The question of course is    is it working  Here in Washington  advocates of retreat insist with absolute certainty that it is not  seizing upon every suicide bombing and American casualty as proof positive that the U S  has failed in Iraq  and that it is time to get out       In Baghdad  however  discussions with the talented Americans responsible for leading this fight are more balanced  more hopeful and  above all  more strategic in their focus    fixated not just on the headline or loss of the day  but on the larger stakes in this struggle  beginning with who our enemies are in Iraq  The officials I met in Baghdad said that 90  of suicide bombings in Iraq today are the work of non Iraqi  al Qaeda terrorists  In fact  al Qaeda s leaders have repeatedly said that Iraq is the central front of their global war against us  That is why it is nonsensical for anyone to claim that the war in Iraq can be separated from the war against al Qaeda    and why a U S  pullout  under fire  would represent an epic victory for al Qaeda  as significant as their attacks on 9 11       Some of my colleagues in Washington claim we can fight al Qaeda in Iraq while disengaging from the sectarian violence there  Not so  say our commanders in Baghdad  who point out that the crux of al Qaeda s strategy is to spark Iraqi civil war       Al Qaeda is launching spectacular terrorist bombings in Iraq  such as the despicable attack on the Golden Mosque in Samarra this week  to try to provoke sectarian violence  Its obvious aim is to use Sunni Shia bloodshed to collapse the Iraqi government and create a failed state in the heart of the Middle East  radicalizing the region and providing a base from which to launch terrorist attacks against the West       Facts on the ground also compel us to recognize that Iran is doing everything in its power to drive us out of Iraq  including providing substantive support  training and sophisticated explosive devices to insurgents who are murdering American soldiers  Iran has initiated a deadly military confrontation with us  from bases in Iran  which we ignore at our peril  and at the peril of our allies throughout the Middle East       The precipitous withdrawal of U S  forces would not only throw open large parts of Iraq to domination by the radical regime in Tehran  it would also send an unmistakable message to the entire Middle East    from Lebanon to Gaza to the Persian Gulf where Iranian agents are threatening our allies    that Iran is ascendant there  and America is in retreat  One Arab leader told me during my trip that he is extremely concerned about Tehran s nuclear ambitions  but that he doubted America s staying power in the region and our political will to protect his country from Iranian retaliation over the long term  Abandoning Iraq now would substantiate precisely these gathering fears across the Middle East that the U S  is becoming an unreliable ally      That is why    as terrible as the continuing human cost of fighting this war in Iraq is    the human cost of losing it would be even greater       Gen  Petraeus and other U S  officials in Iraq emphasize that it is still too soon to draw hard judgments about the success of our new security strategy    but during my visit I saw hopeful signs of progress  Consider Anbar province  Iraq s heart of darkness for most of the past four years  When I last visited Anbar in December  the U S  military would not allow me to visit the provincial capital  Ramadi  because it was too dangerous  Anbar was one of al Qaeda s major strongholds in Iraq and the region where the majority of American casualties were occurring  A few months earlier  the Marine Corps chief of intelligence in Iraq had written off the entire province as  lost   while the Iraq Study Group described the situation there as  deteriorating        When I returned to Anbar on this trip  however  the security environment had undergone a dramatic reversal  Attacks on U S  troops there have dropped from an average of 30 to 35 a day a few months ago to less than one a day now  according to Col  John Charlton  commander of the 1st Brigade of the 3rd Infantry Division  headquartered in Ramadi  Whereas six months ago only half of Ramadi s 23 tribes were cooperating with the coalition  all have now been persuaded to join an anti al Qaeda alliance  One of Ramadi s leading sheikhs told me   A rifle pointed at an American soldier is a rifle pointed at an Iraqi        The recent U S  experience in Anbar also rebuts the bromide that the new security plan is doomed to fail because there is no  military  solution for Iraq  In fact  no one believes there is a purely  military  solution for Iraq  But the presence of U S  forces is critical not just to ensuring basic security  but to a much broader spectrum of diplomatic  political and economic missions    which are being carried out today in Iraq under Gen  Petraeus s counterinsurgency strategy       In Anbar  for example  the U S  military has been essential to the formation and survival of the tribal alliance against al Qaeda  simultaneously holding together an otherwise fractious group of Sunni Arab leaders through deft diplomacy  while establishing a political bridge between them and the Shia dominated government in Baghdad   This is a continuous effort   Col  Charlton said   We meet with the sheikhs every single day and at every single level        In Baghdad  U S  forces have cut in half the number of Iraqi deaths from sectarian violence since the surge began in February  They have also been making critical improvements in governance  basic services and commercial activity at the grassroots level       On Haifa Street  for instance  where there was bloody fighting not so long ago  the 2nd  Black Jack  Brigade of our First Cavalry Division  under the command of a typically impressive American colonel  Bryan Roberts  has not only retaken the neighborhood from insurgents  but is working with the local population to revamp the electrical grid and sewer system  renovate schools and clinics  and create an  economic safe zone  where businesses can reopen  Indeed  of the brigade s five  lines of operations   only one is strictly military  That Iraq reality makes pure fiction of the argument heard in Washington that the surge will fail because it is only  military        Some argue that the new strategy is failing because  despite gains in Baghdad and Anbar  violence has increased elsewhere in the country  such as Diyala province  This gets things backwards  Our troops have succeeded in improving security conditions in precisely those parts of Iraq where the  surge  has focused  Al Qaeda has shifted its operations to places like Diyala in large measure because we have made progress in pushing them out of Anbar and Baghdad  The question now is  do we consolidate and build on the successes that the new strategy has achieved  keeping al Qaeda on the run  or do we abandon them       To be sure  there are still daunting challenges ahead  Iraqi political leaders  in particular  need to step forward and urgently work through difficult political questions  whose resolution is necessary for national reconciliation and  as I told them  continuing American support       These necessary legislative compromises would be difficult to accomplish in any political system  including peaceful  long established democracies    as the recent performance of our own Congress reminds us  Nonetheless  Iraqi leaders are struggling against enormous odds to make progress  and told me they expect to pass at least some of the key benchmark bills this summer  It is critical that they do so       Here  too  however  a little perspective is useful  While benchmarks are critically important  American soldiers are not fighting in Iraq today only so that Iraqis can pass a law to share oil revenues  They are fighting because a failed state in the heart of the Middle East  overrun by al Qaeda and Iran  would be a catastrophe for American national security and our safety here at home  They are fighting al Qaeda and agents of Iran in order to create the stability in Iraq that will allow its government to take over  to achieve the national reconciliation that will enable them to pass the oil law and other benchmark legislation       I returned from Iraq grateful for the progress I saw and painfully aware of the difficult problems that remain ahead  But I also returned with a renewed understanding of how important it is that we not abandon Iraq to al Qaeda and Iran  so long as victory there is still possible       And I conclude from my visit that victory is still possible in Iraq    thanks to the Iraqi majority that desperately wants a better life  and because of the courage  compassion and competence of the extraordinary soldiers and statesmen who are carrying the fight there  starting with Gen  Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker  The question now is  will we politicians in Washington rise to match their leadership  sacrifices and understanding of what is on the line for us in Iraq    or will we betray them  and along with them  America s future security       Mr
