disturbing information about the proxy war that Iran is waging against American soldiers and our allies in Iraq       According to Brig  Gen  Kevin Bergner  the U S  military spokesman in Baghdad  the Iranian government has been using the Lebanese terrorist group Hezbollah to train and organize Iraqi extremists  who are responsible in turn for the murder of American service members       Gen  Bergner also revealed that the Quds Force    a special unit of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps whose mission is to finance  arm and equip foreign Islamist terrorist movements    has taken groups of up to 60 Iraqi insurgents at a time and brought them to three camps near Tehran  where they have received instruction in the use of mortars  rockets  improvised explosive devices and other deadly tools of guerrilla warfare that they use against our troops  Iran has also funded its Iraqi proxies generously  to the tune of  3 million a month       Based on the interrogation of captured extremist leaders    including a 24 year veteran of Hezbollah  apparently dispatched to Iraq by his patrons in Tehran    Gen  Bergner also reported on Monday that the U S  military has concluded that  the senior leadership  in Iran is aware of these terrorist activities  He said it is  hard to imagine  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei    Iran s supreme leader    does not know of them       These latest revelations should be a painful wakeup call to the American people  and to the U S  Congress  They also expand on a steady stream of public statements over the past six months by David Petraeus  the commanding general of our coalition in Iraq  as well as other senior American military and civilian officials about Iran s hostile and violent role in Iraq  In February  for instance  the U S  military stated that forensic evidence has implicated Iran in the death of at least 170 U S  soldiers       Iran s actions in Iraq fit a larger pattern of expansionist  extremist behavior across the Middle East today  In addition to sponsoring insurgents in Iraq  Tehran is training  funding and equipping radical Islamist groups in Lebanon  Palestine and Afghanistan    where the Taliban now appear to be receiving Iranian help in their war against the government of President Hamid Karzai and its NATO defenders       While some will no doubt claim that Iran is only attacking U S  soldiers in Iraq because they are deployed there    and that the solution  therefore  is to withdraw them    Iran s parallel proxy attacks against moderate Palestinians  Afghans and Lebanese directly rebut such claims       Iran is acting aggressively and consistently to undermine moderate regimes in the Middle East  establish itself as the dominant regional power and reshape the region in its own ideological image  The involvement of Hezbollah in Iraq  just revealed by Gen  Bergner  illustrates precisely how interconnected are the different threats and challenges we face in the region  The fanatical government of Iran is the common denominator that links them together       No responsible leader in Washington desires conflict with Iran  But every leader has a responsibility to acknowledge the evidence that the U S  military has now put before us  The Iranian government  by its actions  has all but declared war on us and our allies in the Middle East       America now has a solemn responsibility to utilize the instruments of our national power to convince Tehran to change its behavior  including the immediate cessation of its training and equipping extremists who are killing our troops       Most of this work must be done by our diplomats  military and intelligence operatives in the field  But Iran s increasingly brazen behavior also presents a test of our political leadership here at home  When Congress reconvenes next week  all of us who are privileged to serve there should set aside whatever partisan or ideological differences divide us to send a clear  strong and unified message to Tehran that it must stop everything it is doing to bring about the death of American service members in Iraq       It is of course everyone s hope that diplomacy alone can achieve this goal  Iran s activities inside Iraq were the central issue raised by the U S  ambassador to Iraq in his historic meeting with Iranian representatives in Baghdad this May  However  as Gen  Bergner said on Monday   There does not seem to be any follow through on the commitments that Iran has made to work with Iraq in addressing the destabilizing security issues here   The fact is  any diplomacy with Iran is more likely to be effective if it is backed by a credible threat of force    credible in the dual sense that we mean it  and the Iranians believe it       Our objective here is deterrence  The fanatical regime in Tehran has concluded that it can use proxies to strike at us and our friends in Iraq  Afghanistan  Lebanon and Palestine without fear of retaliation  It is time to restore that fear  and to inject greater doubt into the decision making of Iranian leaders about the risks they are now running       I hope the new revelations about Iran s behavior will also temper the enthusiasm of some of those in Congress who are advocating the immediate withdrawal of U S  forces from Iraq  Iran s purpose in sponsoring attacks on American soldiers  after all  is clear  It hopes to push the U S  out of Iraq and Afghanistan  so that its proxies can then dominate these states  Tehran knows that an American retreat under fire would send an unmistakable message throughout the region that Iran is on the rise and America is on the run  That would be a disaster for the region and the U S       The threat posed by Iran to our soldiers  lives  our security as a nation and our allies in the Middle East is a truth that cannot be wished or waved away  It must be confronted head on  The regime in Iran is betting that our political disunity in Washington will constrain us in responding to its attacks  For the sake of our nation s security  we must unite and prove them wrong      Mr  Lieberman is an Independent Democratic senator from Connecticut
