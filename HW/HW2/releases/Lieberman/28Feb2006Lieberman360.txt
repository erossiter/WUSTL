                                            WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  was joined today by Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME   as well as  Senator Daniel Akaka  D HI   Senator Mike DeWine  R OH   Senator Richard Durbin  D IL  and Senator John Kerry  D MA  in introducing the College Pathway Act  Through the assistance of grants  this bill launches voluntary commissions which seek to establish a dialogue between a State   s Preschool     grade 12  higher education  and business communities to ensure high school graduates amass the skills and knowledge they need to succeed in college          This is an important and necessary initiative that will offer states an opportunity to craft a vision that will reach all students over time so that their educational pathway of access to and success in college will be ensured     Lieberman said     We cannot afford to shortchange this critical investment in our children   s future             We all understand how essential higher education is to both the individual success of our children and also to the overall well being of our society   Unfortunately  too many of our high school students lack the skills and knowledge to succeed in college   Many fall behind and are forced to take remedial classes just to keep up   We must do more to help synchronize our high school curriculum with college curriculums     said Snowe      Today  I am please to join my colleague Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  in introducing the College Pathway Act of 2006 that will give students the means of getting on the right track to college success   This legislation provides states with grant funding to establish an education stewardship commission  create an educational database of each student   s academic performance  and requires the Secretary of Education to submit an annual report to Congress on each state   s progress             As a former teacher and school administrator  I have always said that education should be an interconnected pathway  from pre Kindergarten through postsecondary levels and beyond  into the workforce     said Senator Akaka     By encouraging states to establish P 16  or as in Hawaii   s case  P 20 commissions  to align lower  middle  and high school curricular and assessment standards with what is expected in higher education  we will better assure college readiness and reach a fundamental goal   greater rates of college completion             As we pivot toward a new economy  we must ensure that all children have a chance to pursue a higher education   Too many children simply are not graduating from high school and are not going on to higher education   Often  when they do go on to school  they find themselves inadequately prepared for the rigors of post secondary education   This bill would help ensure that our elementary and secondary educators  as well as our college and university professors  are all on the same path  giving our children the tools they need to thrive in the classroom today and to transition smoothly to post secondary institutions and later into high paying jobs tomorrow     said Senator DeWine  a member of the Health  Education  Labor and Pensions Committee           If we want to keep America on the cutting edge of technology and science  we have to invest in the youngest Americans   Our competitiveness in the global marketplace depends on it   From preschool through high school and beyond  this innovative plan will help schools and their communities connect to give our kids the skills they   ll need to thrive   In a high tech area like Massachusetts  the possibilities and promise are endless     said John Kerry       The P 16 commissions would consist of representatives of the P  12 and higher education communities  the governor   s office  appropriate state legislators  members of the business community and other interested stakeholders  The commissions would strive to establish strong communication between P  12  higher education  and business communities in order to articulate  establish  and disseminate college expectations of basic student skills and knowledge  The outcome would permit for well informed and timely educational decisions throughout the educational system  particularly with respect to the critical areas of math  science and engineering         P 16 commissions offer a framework for aligning lower  middle and high school curriculum and assessment standards with postsecondary expectations  Students who are properly prepared before entering college are far more likely to succeed in college   Indeed  many states across the nation are looking to the P  16 concept to improve alignment  Federal funding for establishment of P  16 commissions would allow states to implement or expand their current programs  In addition  many states are attempting to improve data collection systems in order to better evaluate those programs that lead to success  The bill would also offer support to those states which voluntarily seek to enhance and improve the effectiveness of their data systems  By promoting coordination of grades P through 16  states will better align education systems helping to ensure that all students are prepared to successfully engage in and complete postsecondary level course work       30
