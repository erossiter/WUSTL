statement at a Committee hearing entitled     Always Ready   The Coast Guards Response to Hurricane Katrina      The Coast Guard was one of the more successful agencies that prepared for and responded to Hurricane Katrina  and Lieberman said other agencies should learn from the Coast Guard   s successes          Thanks  Madame Chairman  once again  for holding this sixth in a series of hearings examining the preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina on the part of various government agencies           Today  I   m happy to say  we will examine the pre  and post  Katrina efforts of one of the better performing governmental agencies     the United States Coast Guard  The Coast Guard Academy  of course  is located in my home state  and I like to think that the training Coast Guard officers receive there sets them on the course toward heroic accomplishments  like those we witnessed in the wake of Katrina   I want to offer a special welcome to Captain Frank Paskewich  who not only graduated from the academy   as did Rear Admiral Robert Duncan   but who also hails from New London and whose mother still lives in Groton  Welcome to all three of you  and thank you for a job well done           As you gentlemen know  the modern Coast Guard is a combination of several historical agencies  including one once known as the Life Saving Service   In the hours and days after Katrina slammed into the Gulf Coast  the Guard more than lived up to its predecessor   s name   The advance planning  quick decision making  and round the clock effort of the men and women under your command led to the rescue of 33 000 people in a matter of days     eight times the number of search and rescue missions you generally perform in one year   That is a record that deserves hosannas          Why was the Coast Guard able to perform at such a high standard  One of the  most important reasons  I think  was that you were well prepared   As we will hear from our witnesses  the units operating under Rear Admiral Duncan began preparing for Hurricane Katrina several days before landfall  The week before the hurricane struck  for example  the helicopters based at the New Orleans air station were inspected  in anticipation of a heavy workload after the storm   One of the helicopters  in fact  needed a major repair  which was made well in advance of the storm   Who knows how many people might have died in rising flood waters if that helicopter had not been available          With Continuity of Operations plans in place  Coast Guard officers had blueprints to follow  Assuming a worst case scenario  Admiral Duncan  Captain Paskewich  and Captain Jones evacuated their respective staffs and critical assets the weekend before Katrina  and established remote command centers   Admiral Duncan had the additional foresight to request back up helicopters  air crew  and ships   All of these measures were taken well before landfall and well before Department of Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff formally declared an Incident of National Significance on Tuesday  August 30           The Guard was not only prepared but it executed its mission with precision   And I think  in this case  the victims of the hurricane benefited tremendously from quick  on target decisions made by the folks at the scene     Captains Paskewich  Jones and their  colleagues     who knew what and where the problems were and wasted no time in addressing them          In addition to its successful search and rescue missions  the Coast Guard ensured the Mississippi River was navigable as soon as possible after the storm hit  in order to maintain the free flow of commerce on the river   It helped restore navigational aids that were damaged or destroyed on the river and around the Louisiana coast  and worked with the Army Corps of Engineers and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration to make channels navigable again  As soon as the Friday after the hurricane  some traffic was already back on these key waterways          The Guard also assisted with environmental hazards  identifying eight oils spills around New Orleans and working with other agencies and private contractors to clean them up         As well prepared as the Coast Guard was for Katrina  and as well as it performed  there is always room for improvement   Information sharing occurs less often than it should in the federal government and Hurricane Katrina was no exception   For example  the Coast Guard did not send its first written report acknowledging the levee breaks until the early morning hours of Tuesday  August 30   But  the Committee has learned that Admiral Duncan had two phone conversations Monday  August 29  with the Coast Guard Commandant in Washington  And we know the Commandant had phone conversations with Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Michael Jackson on Monday and Tuesday  I am eager to hear about the contents of those conversations because Secretary Chertoff  as well as other top federal officials  have suggested that they were in the dark about the severity of the situation Monday           More thought also should have been given to establishing a temporary means of communication since the flooding took out most telephone communications   We do know the Coast Guard was able to use its own and Customs Department airplanes as temporary communications relay stations  however  there was no specific plan in place and perhaps there should be            Nevertheless  on balance  the Coast Guard performed the way I wish all government agencies had performed   with speed  resourcefulness  bravery  efficiency  and success  You are a model for the rest of government  and I hope other agencies will learn from your achievements           I have written to OMB Director Bolton asking for an additional  500 million for the Coast Guard to cover the costs related to your work in the wake of Katrina   I know many of your facilities have been severely damaged and some were completely ruined   And  obviously  you have expenses related to the evacuation and temporary housing of your staffs and for unanticipated fuel costs            Apparently  OMB plans to include about  270 million in supplemental Coast Guard funding  That just is not enough  and so I urge the Administration to rethink its supplemental budget             Gentlemen  I look forward to hearing your testimony           30
