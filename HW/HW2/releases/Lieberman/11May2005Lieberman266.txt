                                                                                                                                         Lieberman Decries Anti Immigration Provisions                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         But Votes for Spending Plan in Show of Support for Troops       WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   voted Tuesday in favor of a supplemental spending plan for 2005 in a show of support for America   s mission in Iraq  But he voiced strong opposition against anti immigration provisions contained in the legislation                   Lieberman said a portion of the bill  known as the Real ID Act and added to the legislation by the House in conference  would repeal identification security provisions endorsed by the 9 11 Commission and enacted last year as part of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act           Congress has already enacted the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission regarding stricter standards for identification cards  including drivers    licenses     Lieberman said      The Real ID Act would replace those standards with rigid and unworkable federal mandates on state governments that are primarily intended to punish undocumented aliens  and will be less effective in helping prevent terrorism  The state officials who will have to administer these new rules don   t support them and neither should Congress          The Real ID Act also includes punitive immigration provisions that would make it harder for people to gain asylum from repressive regimes and would deny habeas corpus to those slated for deportation   These provisions were rejected by Congress last year       Lieberman  who has just returned from travel in Iraq  said he would vote for the spending bill  however  because he believes    a sustained and visible American commitment    to Iraq is critical at this time          There   s no doubt that the recent spate of suicide bombings has riveted our attention and made us wonder if we will ever see an Iraq where its people can live not just in freedom     but in security as well      Lieberman said      But we cannot allow the day to day political frustrations and the continuing violence by the terrorists to limit our appreciation of the historic transformation underway          Following is Lieberman   s complete statement  as prepared for delivery        Mr  President  I rise today to speak about the supplemental spending bill to be voted on this afternoon       Although I intend to vote for the supplemental spending bill  I wish to note my strong objections to House provisions known as the    Real ID    Act that have been included in the conference report       The Real ID Act will repeal ID security provisions enacted with overwhelming bipartisan support last year at the urging of the 9 11 Commission  and replace them with rigid and unworkable federal mandates on state government for the issuance of drivers    licenses         The conference report also includes punitive immigration provisions that we rejected last year  and that have no place on an emergency spending bill          Our nation is safer if we continue to implement the protections we passed just last December  rather than allow an ideological debate over immigration policy to derail initiatives vital to the war against terrorism       But I have just returned from Iraq and must set aside my deep opposition to    Real ID    because I believe we have reached a tipping point in Iraq that requires a sustained and visible American commitment at this crucial point in time       There   s no doubt that the recent spate of suicide bombings has riveted our attention and made us wonder if we will ever seen an Iraq where its people can live not just in freedom     but in security as well        But we cannot allow the day to day political frustrations and the continuing violence by the terrorists to limit our appreciation of the historic transformation underway         While I was in Iraq  I had lunch with the new Iraqi President  Jalal Talabani in his home  I have known Talabani for years and have deep respect and admiration for him and his courageous work as a Kurdish leader        But to see him sitting there as the new President of the nation     the democratically chosen successor to the tyrant Saddam Hussein     was a very emotional experience for me       The image was unthinkable just a few years ago  Now Talabani sat in front of me as one of the visible symbols of the enormous transformation we have brought about in Iraq and the chance we have to help build a free nation that could become a model for the rest of the Arab and Islamic world       I was impressed by the quality of other Iraqi leaders as well        Prime Minister Ibrahim al Jaafari  who I had never met before  exceeded my wildest expectations  He was thoughtful  strong and clear when he wanted to be  And graciously vague when he needed to be       I pressed him on Iraq   s relationship with Iran and he gave a reasoned  reassuring  and credible answer  Time will tell but I left feeling reassured       While the increase in suicide bombings in Iraq causes grave concern  our military leaders told me that the makeup of the enemy has changed and that could be a good sign in the long run       For some time the military has been saying that the majority of the enemy fighters came from former regime elements  complemented by a minority of foreign fighters associated with Abu Musab Al Zarqawi and Al Qaeda        But they now believe that the number of native Iraqi fighters has dropped significantly       If this is true  it is a huge development  It means the election and the negotiations with the Sunnis to enter the government are creating a tipping point in which the supporters of the former regime want to get on the winning side        We should exploit this moment and act aggressively with the Iraqi government to bring them over     thus isolating the foreign fighters and making it harder for them to move freely and resupply themselves       We should also move aggressively to close the border with Syria to stop the flow of terrorists and further help bring stability to Iraq  Operation Matador  now in its third day in Qaim near the Syrian border  is the kind of sustained military effort we need       Of the American military  I can only say that they are the most impressive  innovative  and inspirational part of this story       Their morale is high  They believe in their mission  And they feel victory is certain       It just made me proud as an American to see them in action        Our engagement in Iraq is crucial and in the best bipartisan traditions of American foreign policy that runs from Democrat Woodrow Wilson through Republican President George Bush       I urge my colleagues to vote yes and I yield the floor         30
