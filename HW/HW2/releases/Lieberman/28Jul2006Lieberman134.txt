Governmental Affairs Committee has approved the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act  cosponsored by Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D CT   which would require the federal government to create and maintain a searchable website where the public can view information on how federal funds are spent          Specifically  the bill would direct the Office of Management and Budget to ensure that a searchable public web site is established that lists federal funding awards  including grants  contracts  and loans   All transactions under  25 000 would be exempted from the reporting requirement  as well as awards that are classified           American taxpayers deserve greater transparency in how their tax dollars are spent  because transparency is a key element of accountability    I believe this bill will aid in making this concept a reality     said Senator Collins            This proposal builds on my E Government Act of 2002 by making government information as accessible as possible to the public     Senator Lieberman said      A searchable database of billions of dollars worth of federal grants  contracts  and loans will increase transparency of federal spending  provide taxpayers with a tool to hold the government accountable  and reduce fraud          The Pets Evacuation and Transportation Standards Act was also approved by
