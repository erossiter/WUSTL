                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON   Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today joined their Democratic colleagues in introducing sweeping new energy legislation    The Clean Energy Development for a Growing Economy  Clean EDGE  act aims to make America energy independent by 2020        Dodd and Lieberman also joined 41 Senate Democratic colleagues in sending a letter to President Bush calling on the Administration to get behind serious legislation aimed at reducing America   s addiction to foreign oil           The American consumer shouldn   t have to take out a massive loan just to fill up their tank  They deserve answers and not double talk from oil executives who appear to be lining their pockets at their expense   said Dodd   This measure provides a comprehensive plan to protect consumers from gouging  make our nation more energy independent  and create cleaner and energy efficient solutions to this problem              To free ourselves from recurring gas price spikes  the caprice of volatile and even hostile nations  and the threat of global warming  we must end our addiction to oil     Lieberman said     It is now time for everyone   including the Bush Administration     to take action on one of the biggest economic and national security challenges of our generation  and enacting this legislation is an important step toward greater energy security for America            The Clean EDGE Act would achieve this goal in a number of ways  including        TRANSFORMING AMERICA   S VEHICLES   INFRASTRUCTURE      Flex Fuel Vehicles   The Clean EDGE Act accelerates the conversion of American vehicles to flexible fuel technology  The legislation mandates that 25 percent of new vehicles sold in the U S  by 2010 be flex fuel capable  rising to 50 percent by 2020   Flexible fuel vehicles can run on higher blends of biofuels  which helps displace petroleum and provide competition at the gas pump    Accelerating Infrastructure Conversion  A major barrier to using flex fuel vehicles to reduce petroleum consumption is the lack of refueling stations that provide biofuels   The Clean EDGE Act sets a national goal of installing alternative fuels at 10 percent of American gas stations by 2015  To help achieve it  the legislation will provide additional tools to individual retailers  along with support to local governments that partner with private industry to establish alternative refueling corridors in different parts of the country   In order to break the oil industry   s lock on the gas pump  it also requires major integrated oil companies that own refueling stations to install alternative fuel pumps       Hybrids and Advanced Vehicle Technology  The Clean EDGE Act will accelerate and extend incentives to purchase and manufacture vehicles that rely on advanced fuel efficiency technologies           PROTECTING AMERICAN CONSUMERS   BUSINESSES      Preventing Gas Price Gouging and Increasing Transparency in the Oil and Gas Industry   The Clean EDGE Act makes gas price gouging a Federal crime  enhances Federal authority to prevent and prosecute manipulation of fuel supplies and anti competitive behavior  and increases the transparency of petroleum markets       Energy Price Relief for Low Income Americans   The Clean EDGE Act will provide additional assistance to Americans struggling under the weight of rising energy costs  by providing flexibility in Food Stamp and Section 8 Public Housing requirements  and a refundable tax credit to LIHEAP eligible households to help cover residential energy costs    Energy Emergency Loans for Farmers and Small Businesses  Volatile prices place an extra burden on businesses that operate close to the margin   The Clean EDGE Act creates disaster loan assistance through the Small Business Administration and USDA  for small businesses and farmers trying to cope with rising energy costs           LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD FOR CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES      Ending Giveaways to Big Oil   The Clean EDGE Act will revoke subsidies for profit rich  major oil companies  and make sure they pay their fair share in royalties owed to American taxpayers for drilling on public lands and in federal waters    Providing Certainty to Emerging Technologies  Rather than subsidizing the mature petroleum industry  the Clean EDGE Act will use these savings to provide greater certainty for clean energy development  by extending incentives for renewable energy and efficiency technologies           REAL GOVERNMENT LEADERSHIP FOR CLEAN AND SECURE ENERGY      A Serious Federal Commitment   The federal government is the single largest energy consumer in America   The Clean EDGE Act requires the Federal government reduce its petroleum consumption by 20 percent in five years and 40 percent by 2020  increase its renewable electricity use to 10 percent of total consumption by 2013  and employ advanced  efficient  and renewable technology to help drive innovation and jumpstart markets    Innovative New Tools for States  The Clean EDGE Act provides enhanced bond issuing authority to states and local governments  for projects to reduce oil consumption and greenhouse gas emissions  to develop non petroleum fuels  invest in efficient vehicles  alternative infrastructure and transit            DIVERSIFYING AMERICAN ENERGY SOURCES  INVESTING IN THE FUTURE      Renewable Electricity   To help reduce America   s reliance on fossil fuels and reduce greenhouse gas emissions  the Clean EDGE Act sets a national renewable portfolio standard requiring that 10 percent of all electricity produced in the country come from renewable sources by 2020     ARPA E   The Clean EDGE Act will create an Advanced Research Projects Agency for Energy  ARPA E  to develop cutting edge technologies that will reduce oil consumption  improve electricity efficiency and reliability  and reduce greenhouse gas emissions    Investing in American Jobs and Industry   The Clean EDGE Act will create a clean energy investment administration to help deploy new  on the ground solutions   It will also invest in education programs to develop a skilled domestic workforce in advanced energy technologies            The full text of the letter is below        May 17  2006      The President      The White House      Washington  D C  20500       Dear Mr  President        We are writing to reiterate our belief that America s dependence on oil is one of the greatest economic and national security challenges faced by our generation  The status quo is simply not an option  The cost of our dependence on oil is being borne by families  farmers and businesses across America  In the words of Energy Secretary Bodman  it has become a    crisis    for our nation   s consumers  Recent events must serve as a long overdue wake up call  to spur real action that sets our nation on the path toward energy independence        It is crucial that the United States sets a national goal and embarks on a serious strategy to reduce our dependence on petroleum  equivalent to 40 percent of our projected imports by 2020  We are united around a set of core principles that can help America achieve this goal  and believe we must act expeditiously to put this nation on the right track  We stand ready to work with your Administration and Congressional Republicans to pass legislation reflecting these principles before the summer recess  Specifically        The United States must launch an aggressive effort designed to ensure that an increasing number of new vehicles sold in America can run on alternative fuels  starting with 25 percent in 2010  In order for this to make a real difference in reducing our dependence on oil  this effort must be paired with a bold initiative to make smart investments in American infrastructure and promote real competition at the gas pump         The United States must ensure that our consumers are protected from gasoline price gouging and energy market manipulation            The United States must lessen its reliance on fossil fuels in general and take steps to curb greenhouse gas emissions  by diversifying sources of electric generation to include a greater percentage of renewable resources           The United States government   our nation   s single largest energy consumer   must help lead this transition  by adopting the best available fuel efficiency and alternative vehicle technologies  The federal fleet should reduce its petroleum consumption by 20 percent over the next five years  and save at least 40 percent by 2020           The United States must level the playing field for new renewable and energy efficiency technologies  We can provide incentives for consumers and manufacturers to accelerate the market for these technologies and the next generation of fuel efficient vehicles  by ensuring major oil companies pay their fair share in taxes and royalties owed to the American public            We are willing to work with you to consider additional constructive approaches to breaking America   s oil addiction  However  we believe these five principles reflect significant steps that we can take in coming weeks to put our nation on the path toward greater energy security  By relying on American ingenuity and investing in our nation s workforce and infrastructure  we can curb the tremendous volatility in energy prices that is draining family budgets today  and looms as a growing threat to our national security and international competitiveness         We look forward to working with you on these consensus principles  which will spur the kind of innovation and investment America needs to secure its energy future for the 21st Century            30
