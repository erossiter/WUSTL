historic and environmental significance       WASHINGTON   Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman and Representatives Nancy Johnson  R CT  and John Olver  D MA  re introduced legislation today to establish the Upper Housatonic Valley in Connecticut and Massachusetts as a National Heritage Area and authorize up to  10 million to preserve the historic and cultural assets of the region        The Upper Housatonic Valley is a unique cultural and geographical region that encompasses 29 towns in the Housatonic River watershed  extending 60 miles from Lanesboro  Massachusetts to Kent  Connecticut   The valley has made significant national contributions through literary  artistic  musical  and architectural achievements  as the backdrop for important Revolutionary War era events  as the cradle of the iron  paper  and electrical industries  and as home to key figures and events in the abolitionist and civil rights movements   It includes five National Historic Landmarks and four National Natural Landmarks   The area has already developed many significant heritage activities including an Iron Heritage Trail brochure  a graduate course for local teachers on the area  and a summer art event          The Upper Housatonic Valley National Heritage Area Act would officially designate the region as part of the National Park Service system   It would also authorize  1 million in grants annually  up to a total of  10 million  for a variety of activities that conserve the significant natural  historical  cultural  and scenic resources  and that provide educational and recreational opportunities in the area           From historic churches and meeting houses to the covered bridges in Kent and West Cornwall and the theater at Stockbridge  this region truly provides us with a window to New England   s small town past and a connection to our rich history     said Dodd      As a designated national historic area  the Housatonic Valley will be eligible for resources to enhance this environmental and cultural treasure and preserve it for the enjoyment of generations to come              This legislation is a first step in giving this nationally significant area the acknowledgment and resources it deserves     Lieberman said      Designation of the upper Housatonic Valley as a national heritage area will enhance and foster public private partnerships to educate residents and visitors about the region  improve the area   s economy through business investment  job expansion  and tourism  and protect the area   s natural and cultural heritage              The Upper Housatonic Valley area is a unique cultural treasure that must be preserved     said Johnson     The National Heritage Area designation will enable us to preserve the area s farmhouses  furnaces  and historic and natural wonders  This broad  flexible and locally led initiative will lead to the permanent protection and appreciation of the region and its heritage              The Upper Housatonic River Valley Heritage Area includes 20 historically rich communities in Berkshire County in Massachusetts     Olver said      The area was home to many nationally known writers  such as Herman Melville in Pittsfield and Edith Wharton in Lenox  and Crane and Co   the only paper mill in the country supplying U S  currency paper  was founded in Dalton in the early 19th century  This legislation will not only preserve these historical landmarks  it will also boost tourism and spur sustainable economic development           A national heritage area is a part of the U S  landscape

Heritage Corridor in Connecticut and Massachusetts in 1994           In November 2000  Dodd  Lieberman  Johnson and Olver sponsored legislation directing the Secretary of the Interior to conduct a study of the feasibility of establishing the upper Housatonic Valley as a National Heritage Area  This study  completed in spring 2003  concluded that designation of the national heritage would be the most effective way to accomplish the region   s goals for cultural and environmental preservation and education          Dodd  Lieberman  Johnson and Olver first introduced this legislation in May 2003   The bill was approved by the House but did not make it out of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee in the Senate   Each of the members    offices met yesterday with Ron Jones  Chairman of
