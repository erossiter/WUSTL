Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Tuesday sought clarification from the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services on the case of a Mexican citizen with a highly contagious  multi drug resistant form of tuberculosis who repeatedly crossed the southern border into the United States after border security officers had been notified to deny his entry and place him on a watch list    This incident highlights vulnerabilities we believe still exist within our nation s border screening systems  the Senators wrote  adding  We are troubled by the slow release of information to our Committee from the Department about the Amaya case  some of which has proven to be contradicted by other government sources  In particular  we are concerned that the Department claimed to have originally received only an alias for Mr  Amaya  but later reported that it received a complete last name and middle name for him     The letters to the two departments are very similar  Following is a copy of the DHS letter     October 30  2007    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528    Dear Secretary Chertoff     We write to seek additional information from the Department regarding the recent breach in border security which allowed a Mexican citizen with multi drug resistant tuberculosis  MDR TB  to repeatedly enter the United States after U S  Customs and Border Protection  CBP  was alerted and directed to deny his entry  This incident highlights vulnerabilities we believe still exist within our nation s border screening systems  We are also troubled by reports  which appear contradictory  that we have received from the Department of Homeland Security and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC  about the facts of this case  including the timing of events and information gathered from the individual in question     Customs and Border Protection faces a daunting challenge in facilitating travel for millions of people  while at the same time protecting our borders by preventing dangerous individuals and materials from entering the country  Since 9 11 much work has been done to increase the layers of protection at our nation s ports of entry  Nevertheless  according to an October 24  2007 report by the GAO  CBP officers noted several incidents involving individuals on watch lists who were erroneously admitted into the United States  Another example is the case of the Mexican national with MDR TB  Amado Isidro Armendariz Amaya  who was allowed to repeatedly enter the U S  between April 16 and May 31  2007  despite a lookout being placed in the CBP computer based screening system for him     We are troubled by the slow release of information to our Committee from the Department about the Amaya case  some of which has proven to be contradicted by other government sources  In particular  we are concerned that the Department claimed to have originally received only an alias for Mr  Amaya  but later reported that it received a complete last name and middle name for him  Furthermore  DHS officials reported that they could not provide the Committee with information about the flights that Mr  Amaya took within the U S  after DHS was alerted to his health status  The CDC  however  stated that it had received Mr  Amaya s flight information from the Office of Health Affairs at DHS  We expect to receive complete and accurate information on this case in a timely manner     Finally  during the same days that the Department became aware of Mr  Amaya s case  the Department was briefing Congress on the case of Andrew Speaker  an American who was also infected with MDR TB and who was also admitted to the U S  despite CBP having placed a lookout for him in their computer based screening system  During the week of June 4  2007  personnel from the Department  including the Chief Medical Officer and CBP who were involved in both the Amaya and Speaker cases  briefed the Committee on the vulnerabilities in our border systems that allowed Andrew Speaker to re enter the U S undetected  However  no one from DHS alerted the Committee of the Mexican national who had entered the U S  undetected 21 times in the seven prior weeks  We find it troubling that no one from your Department thought it prudent to advise the Senate of the Amaya case at the time that the Committee was investigating the vulnerabilities that allowed another person with MDR TB and on a watch list to enter the U S  undetected     It is important to ensure that proper coordination and communication exist between our public health and border security agencies so that individuals known to have dangerous infectious diseases do not enter the country  Using this case to expose weaknesses in our interagency communications  border procedures  and border watchlists will enable us to strengthen these systems before we are faced with an epidemic  such as SARS or a pandemic flu  which could have a devastating effect on our public health     In order to address our concerns on this matter  we respectfully request that you provide the Committee with an after action report in response to the Amaya case  a complete timeline of events for the case  and timely responses to the following questions     1  When were the Office of Health Affairs  OHA  and CBP informed about the case of the Mexican national infected with MDR TB  Amado Isidro Armendariz Amaya  and who was notified at each organization    2  What information about this individual was initially provided to OHA and CBP and who provided the information  Please provide a copy of this notification    3  When did CBP first run a search for the individual in its computer based screening system known as TECS  Please provide a record of when the initial name was run in TECS and of the information retrieved from that search    4  What information was entered into TECS when CBP ran an initial search for the Mexican national in its computer based screening system    5  If the individual s names and other personal information were entered into TECS  did TECS find a match in its system for the individual  If not  why not    6  Was TECS capable of finding a match based on the Mexican national s middle name  two last names  and birth date  If not  why not    7  Is TECS capable of finding a match on any person based on names and personal information not fully complete or presented in the incorrect order     8  Did OHA or CBP ask CDC if the information provided to them  such as the name and date of birth  were verified with identity documents  What was CDC s response    9  When did OHA and CBP determine that the name and date of the individual initially provided was incomplete or inaccurate    10  Did OHA or CBP inform the CDC that the individual s name was incomplete or inaccurate  If so  when    11  If OHA and CBP received an incomplete name and date of birth  what efforts did OHA and CBP undertake to establish a full and correct name and date of birth     12  When did OHA and CBP receive updated and accurate information about the individual s name and date of birth    13  Did CBP run a new search in its computer screening system  TECS  when it received an updated name and date of birth  Please provide a record of these updated searches and the information that was collected as a result of the searches     14  When did CBP issue a border lookout bulletin for the individual  When and why was this bulletin updated  Does a border lookout bulletin still exist for this individual  Please provide these bulletin s     15  Which ports of entry received the initial bulletin and which received follow up bulletins  Why was the bulletin expanded to other ports of entry    16  How many times and through which ports of entry did the Mexican national enter the United States between the time that CDC first alerted OHA and CBP that he should be denied entry and the time the individual s border crossing card was cancelled    17  When did OHA or CBP provide information about the Mexican national to the Transportation Security Administration  TSA   Was this information updated  and if so  when    18  If there was a delay in providing information to TSA from the initial report of the individual s name provided from CDC to OHA and CBP  please explain the cause for the delay    19  How much time passed between the time OHA and CBP received initial information about the individual and the time TSA was provided the name of the individual in order to place him on the TSA no board list  If there was a delay  please explain why    20  How much time passed between the time OHA and CBP learned of the complete name of the individual and the time TSA was provided this information in order to place his name on the TSA no board list  If there was a delay  please explain the cause    21  When did OHA and CBP learn that this Mexican national had taken any flights within the United States  Was that information provided to CDC  If so  when  Please provide details of the U S  flights the individual took between the time CDC alerted OHA and CBP of the individual and the time his border crossing card was canceled    22  Did OHA and CBP find any similarities between the Andrew Speaker case and the case of the Mexican national    23  Did OHA and CBP participate in a conference call or have any communication with other DHS components or the CDC about the Mexican national infected with MDR TB  If so  please provide the dates and list of participants  Also provide the Committee with a summary of those communications    24  In those interagency conference calls did anyone also discuss the case of Andrew Speaker  If so  for what purpose    25  Does CBP or OHA have information about another case of a person infected with MDR TB who CDC advised should not be allowed entry to the U S  and for which CBP placed a lookout in its computer based security system  but who was nevertheless granted entry into the U S   in the last year    26  Why did OHA and CBP fail to disclose information about the Mexican national infected with MDR TB to the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee during the June 4th briefing    27  Did OHA or CBP inform other Congressional Committee s  about the Mexican national infected with MDR TB before Oct  17  2007  If so  when and which Committee s     28  Were any DHS personnel  including CBP personnel in El Paso  Texas ever instructed not to discuss the case regarding the Mexican national outside the Department  If such a directive was made  did it extend to briefing Members of Congress  If such a directive was made  who made it    29  Describe the purpose of the Standard Operating Procedure  SOP  among the CDC  Department of Health and Human Services  and DHS for establishing alerts on travelers who may present a public health threat  Please provide the draft SOP    30  When will the SOP be finalized    31  How many individuals are currently on the TSA no board list due to public health concerns and how many have been on it since its inception in May 2007     We look forward to receiving a response by November 6  2007  and thank you in advance for your cooperation  If you have questions about this request  please contact Patricia Rojas on the majority Committee staff at  202  224 2627 or Rob Strayer on the minority staff at  202  224 4751     Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman    Susan Collins  Ranking Member
