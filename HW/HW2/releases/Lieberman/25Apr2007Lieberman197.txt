straining to meet its current obligations and the National Guard and Reserves stretched to the limit  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT   Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee s Airland Subcommittee  today renewed his call to significantly increase the Army s baseline troop strength   At a subcommittee hearing  Lieberman urged Acting Army Secretary Peter Green  III and Army Chief of Staff General George Casey  Jr  to help relieve the mounting stress on the U S  Army by adding more troops         We are a nation at war with an enemy that is brutal  smart  and despises our way of life   Lieberman said    We must not put the Army in a position where its leaders are forced to shape our strategy for defeating this enemy based on the inadequate resources we give it   We must together give our Army everything it needs        In 2005  Lieberman joined Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton  D NY   Bill Nelson  D FL  and Jack Reed  D RI  in introducing the United States Army Relief Act  which called for an increase in the overall troop levels authorized by Congress by 80 000 over 4 years to give the Army breathing room to reduce the overburden on our active duty troops as well as our Guard and Reserve and rebuild our capacity to respond to future threats       The full text of Lieberman s opening statement is below       The U S  Army is the best in the world but  as the full SASC heard last week  it is under severe stress because of the demands our country has placed on it since the Global War on Terrorism began on 9 11 01   That is why this hearing is different from the typical Airland Subcommittee hearing where we focus primarily on Army acquisition programs and issues relating to those programs   We will talk about Army acquisition programs but today we must expand our view to raise critical questions about how to relieve the stress the Army is under  about how large the Army should be  how it should be organized and equipped for the missions it will be called on to carry out over the next two decades  and about what we need to do now to adjust the fiscal year 2008 budget so that the Army will be better able to be all we will ask it to be in the years ahead   I am very grateful that Acting Secretary Geren and Chief of Staff Casey are here with us this morning to help our subcommittee answer these questions       This year  one of the most consequential issues confronting the Congress is increasing the size of the US ground combat forces   While there have been attempts for several years to increase the force size  including a bill submitted by Senators Clinton  Reed  Salazar  and myself to increase the Army by 100 000  until recently the Army has resisted  concluding that a temporary manpower increase of no more than 30 000 to permit conversion to brigade combat teams suffices  and that in due course the Army could then revert to the permanent end strength authorization of 482 400   To support this argument  the Army asserted that it could  find  enough additional manpower for this temporary increase by significantly decreasing uniformed positions in the institutional Army  by as much as 60 000  and handing their duties to contractors   Many people were skeptical that this was possible or desirable   Those questions are now moot because the President has proposed a permanent active Army end strength increase over a five year period to 547 4000   This is clearly a step in the right direction  but there is really little on record to enable us to decide if that is the right number  or the right schedule   Many believe it will not be enough   Some are concerned that the Army may not be able to recruit  train  and equip the envisioned force on that schedule and within the budget that is proposed   Some doubt that the Army can attain and maintain the increase without substantially lowering the quality of personnel         As I see it  the Army has four great challenges       First  deploying  supporting  and sustaining an increased troop commitment to Iraq   The Army has been asked to provide five additional brigades in Iraq  perhaps for an extended deployment  and prepare to replace them with an equal number in the future   That will be very challenging   But the challenge is compounded by the fact that none of the brigades in the US are rated combat ready  principally because of shortages of critical equipment   In addition  troop protection equipment is short  and there may be no way to fix these shortages quickly       Second  correctly sizing an Army that is currently too small   The Army is clearly stretched   Many troops are returning to Iraq for the third time  and a few for the fourth time   Many analysts are concerned that recruiting and retention will begin to decline   The President has decided to increase the number of soldiers in the Army  and that will relieve some of the stress   Now we must determine if the proposed increase yields the correct size soon enough       Third  adequately equipping the force we have now and appropriately equipping the force we will have  Before the end strength increase was announced  General Schoomaker was asking for  138 billion in FY 08 to keep 19 brigades deployed  reset the force  transition to the new brigade structure  begin to recapitalize the equipment  and keep Future Combat System on schedule   That is  20 billion more than Congress appropriated in FY 07   I am concerned that the Army does not have enough to keep about 19 brigades deployed  make up attrition losses  raise the readiness rates of next to deploy forces  and retain enough in reserve for adequate training of non deployed brigades   I am also concerned that the Army has not budgeted enough in 2008  2009  and 2010 for those requirements   In fact  the Army s unfunded priority list is disturbing because it reveals how many programs needed in the irregular wars we are fighting and will fight are unfunded in the President s budget   Programs like upgraded protection vehicles  aircraft survivability equipment  counter IED jammers  weapons  radios  night vision equipment  and combat training centers   We must give these questions close attention during the current authorization and appropriations process to ensure that the procurement accounts are sufficient to equip the current  as well as the projected force  and that the Army is buying the right equipment       Fourth  properly organizing and equipping the Army for the future   We must determine the correct structure for the Army to deal with the most probable missions over the next couple of decades  determine the correct balance between the operational and institutional Army  and find the money to adjust the program to equip both a larger and potentially differently organized force       I am glad that the Army will grow in end strength   But I believe that the currently planned increase is too small   General Schoomaker  in his last appearance before our committee said that 547 000 is a conservative number  that a less conservative number would be 565 000   But I believe we need an Army of at least 600 000  and that we must make sure we build the right kind of units and capabilities for what the Army must ready to do over the next 20 years       I am concerned that if the Army isn t big enough  the institutional Army will continue to cut in order to increase the number of brigades   As many respected former Army leaders have pointed out  it is the institutional Army that is the keeper of Army values and skills and that passes those values and skills on to the new recruits   We have had too many examples of ethical failures when our institutional Army was too small or staffed with too many of the less capable soldiers   The sexual scandal at Aberdeen and the breakdown at Walter Reed come to mind   General Schoomaker testified before our committee that   I m concerned about whether or not we ve got enough going towards building the institutional part of the Army that s required because I think that s fundamental to some of the problems we have in things like training and Walter Reed and other kinds of things   The Army right now  of all the services  has the smallest percentage of its personnel end strength committed to the institution    He went on to say that   I worry that we ve taken too much risk in the important aspects of the Army   like the medical system  like the education and training system  the kinds of things that support and are so important because we have taken a lot of efficiencies there  and where we have overreached      As General Schoomaker pointed out  the Army has about 27 percent of its strength in the institutional Army compared to the Navy and Air Force which have about 50 percent on their institutional side   That is an unacceptable imbalance for the service we are depending on in the GWOT and why I will do everything I can to make sure that the end strength is enough to maintain a good institutional Army as well as a good operational Army  and that the institutional Army is properly and adequately equipped       We are a nation at war with an enemy that is brutal  smart  and despises our way of life   We must not put the Army in a position where its leaders are forced to shape our strategy for defeating this enemy based on the inadequate resources we give it   We must together give our Army everything it needs        30
