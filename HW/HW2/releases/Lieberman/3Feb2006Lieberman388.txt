CT   Ranking Member on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  sent the following letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff urging him to explain his decision to exclude New Haven and other cities in Southwestern Connecticut from applying for homeland security grants under the Urban Areas Security Initiative Program                                                          January 30  2006       Michael Chertoff       Secretary of Homeland Security       U S  Department of Homeland Security       Washington D C  20528        Dear Secretary Chertoff                    I am writing to express my deep disappointment with certain decisions related to implementation of the Urban Areas Security Initiative Program  UASI  announced by the Department on January 3  2006                      Under this program  a total of  765 million is available to select    high threat urban areas    for equipment  training  planning and exercises in FY 2006   In its notification  DHS identified 46 urban areas eligible to apply   This includes 35 areas that were supposedly identified through a risk analysis process based on threat  vulnerability and consequence  and an additional eleven urban areas that received funding under the FY 2005 program but are eligible to apply for what the Department calls    continuation funds    under the FY 2006 program                      As you know  I strongly disagree with the Administration   s support for sharp and unwarranted decreases in the overall amount of funding available for UASI and other key programs designed to strengthen state and local preparedness   These cuts and other changes have resulted in states and cities being forced to compete for an ever decreasing amount of homeland security funding  This is not the way to equip our nation with the tools necessary to prevent  prepare for  mitigate and  if necessary  effectively respond to a catastrophe          While I support providing more funding to states and localities based on a determination of risk  I have also expressed my concerns about the credibility of the still evolving    risk    analysis methodology developed by DHS  Risk analysis is an art  not a science  and it is an inexact art at best   Moreover  DHS   s risk methodology has continued to evolve  without any evidence at all that one year   s approach is any more precise or accurate than the previous year   The Department selected New Haven  Connecticut for a UASI grant in FY 2004  but then  using slightly different risk methodology  excluded the area in FY 2005  This year  after implementing the latest version of its risk methodology  the Department has determined that New Haven is not even eligible to apply for funding in FY 2006  a decision that continues to ignore the importance of the critical infrastructure in that area to Connecticut and our nation          Last year  I argued that to adequately plan and prepare  states and localities most need predictable and sustainable levels of funding from the federal government   However  DHS rejected this argument  and refused to reconsider its decision to drop New Haven and other cities from the UASI list   For FY 2006  DHS has decided that 11 cities which otherwise would not be eligible under its    risk    calculations should remain eligible to apply for funding  according to Department staff  because of the need for    sustainability       You explained that this change was made    to address criticisms we heard last year about the kind of stop start or start stop method of funding  where you get a program going in a single year  you couldn   t complete it in a year  and you were left high and dry       Therefore you decided to provide a    bridging mechanism    to allow UASI communities identified in FY 2005 to    make the case    that they need continued funding in FY 2006        I appreciate your willingness to listen and respond to concerns about this aspect of the UASI program   However  I am dismayed that you have decided to implement this principle only for cities that were awarded UASI grants in FY 2005  and not for those awarded in FY 2004   The denial of UASI funding to New Haven clearly will adversely affect its ability to build the essential capabilities that DHS has determined localities need to keep citizens safe   If the purpose is to give certain cities an opportunity to    make a case    for sustainable funding  how can you justify denying this opportunity to some UASI cities while making it available to others        Finally  I am very disturbed by the Department   s decision to exclude those areas of Connecticut which are in every way part of the New York metropolitan area from participating in the UASI region that will receive and administer funding   This decision defies common sense   In announcing the program  DHS stated that this year   s funding formula represents a    super    UASI concept    that is designed to build greater regional capabilities across a geographic area      The Department also noted that cities on the UASI list    with shared boundaries    were combined for FY 2006 into    a single entity    and    urbanized areas    outside the official city limits were included in order to establish a geographic area for enhanced risk analysis   This supposedly reflects    a regional approach to shared risk and risk mitigation             I agree with the idea that we must focus on regional preparedness   Whenever catastrophe occurs  the impact is felt well beyond the jurisdiction which is at ground zero  and often an effective response requires assets and resources from the surrounding region  and the nation   However  if this is the Department   s current approach  how do you explain the fact that the Department has purposefully excluded communities like Greenwich  Stamford  Norwalk and others in southwestern Connecticut  which are widely understood to be a part of the New York metropolitan area  from the UASI region and from UASI consideration   One hundred thousand Connecticut residents commute daily to New York City  and Connecticut  whose train tracks and roads are interconnected with those in New York  must deploy additional assets whenever the terror alert level is raised  or during an actual attack  in New York   Residents of Connecticut clearly form an integral part of this highly interconnected region        According to DHS  the New York City urban area includes the city of New York  counties of Nassau  Suffolk and Westchester  the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey   This supposedly encompasses New York City  Yonkers and    a 10 mile buffer extending from the border of the combined area      While that would appear to at least include some areas in southwestern Connecticut  your staff has made it clear to my staff and representatives of the Governor   s office that is not the case at all   The    10 mile    buffer  which appears to have been selected totally arbitrarily  only identifies the geographic areas used to capture data for the UASI area  not the area that will be protected with the subsequent funding   The bottom line is that suburban Connecticut is apparently not considered part of the    natural region    which DHS has clearly centered around New York City  This is astounding news to those citizens         Your staff could not explain why the arbitrary 10 mile designation was made  why it does not extend into Connecticut  or why DHS did not include parts of Connecticut in the New York metropolitan region to which they so clearly belong   Nor could they provide a satisfactory explanation as to why this year   s risk methodology is in fact more accurate than that used in past years   I ask that you do so in response to this letter        I look forward to hearing from you soon                                                          Sincerely
