Security Amendment                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Amendment Changes How Homeland Security Grants Will Be Distributed  Guarantees a Minimum  Encourages Regional Planning       WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman Tuesday said Senate passage of an amendment to change the way homeland security grants are distributed to states will greatly benefit Connecticut       The amendment   co sponsored by Lieberman and HSGAC Chair Susan Collins and similar to S  21 which passed out of Committee April 13   was adopted by a vote of 71 26 to the Fiscal Year 2006 Department of Homeland Security spending bill   It must still survive a conference between the House and Senate on the spending bill          This is terrific news for the citizens of Connecticut     Lieberman said     We still have a long way to go  but with this amendment  I believe we have balanced support for cities and states at high risk of a terrorist attack without sacrificing the security of locations that have not suffered in the past  but very well could in the future          Common sense requires us to continue to build basic capacity to prevent and respond to attacks wherever they may occur   And to build capacity over time  state and local officials need some predictability of funding  They need to know when and how much assistance they are likely to receive from year to year if they are to do what their citizens expect them to do   protect them on their home turf          The amendment would authorize  2 93 billion for state grant programs  more than double threat based funding  allocate a majority of funding to states and regions with highest risk  threat and vulnerabilities  establish a sliding scale baseline minimum to ensure that states with greater population and density receive a bigger baseline and that every state receives at least  55  of appropriated funds  instructs the Department of Homeland Security Secretary to establish essential capabilities to tie each dollar spent to the unique risk and preparedness needs of states and localities  requires greater input from local first responders  and strengthens accountability of the state grant program   The amendment also requires that 25 percent of the funding be used for prevention     including intelligence  law enforcement training  and information sharing       Specifically  the amendment benefits Connecticut because it provides       Predictable  baseline funding that would enable Connecticut to build basic homeland security capabilities  The measure uses a sliding scale minimum that gives all states at least 0 55  of the total funds but provides a higher level of baseline funding to larger and more densely populated states   This means that Connecticut would be guaranteed a minimum of 0 72  of the overall funds       Regional funding with eligibility for Connecticut cities  Groups of communities within the nation s 100 largest metropolitan areas would automatically be eligible to apply for special regional funding   This means that three metropolitan areas in Connecticut     Hartford  Bridgeport and New Haven   would all have the opportunity to make their case that their communities should receive DHS grants       More than double the current funding based on risk  with a recognition of risk factors relevant to Connecticut  The amendment provides guidance on the factors the Secretary is to consider in giving out risk based funding to states and to regions   These factors include several that are relevant to Connecticut  including coastline  population density  the presence of critical infrastructure  the potential need to respond to at risk sites in neighboring jurisdictions  like New York   and being part of a metropolitan area that has been previously attacked       Substantial authorization amount  The Senate bill authorizes  2 93 billion for grant funding  thereby increasing the dollars available for first responders in Connecticut and elsewhere   This is the same amount that was appropriated in Fiscal Year 2004  and significantly more than the President   s proposed  2 billion for Fiscal Year 2006       Under the Collins Lieberman proposal  Connecticut would receive a guaranteed minimum of   21 08 million for Fiscal Year 2006  roughly the same amount it received in 2005   Under the President s plan  the state would received just  2 55 million   Under the House passed plan  Connecticut would receive  5 million       A summary of the Collins Lieberman amendment is available at  http   hsgac senate gov _files homelandamendmentsummary pdf      30
