Leslie Phillips  202 224 0384                                                                                                Lieberman Says FEMA Recovery is Fraught with Problems    HSGAC s Proposal to Rebuild FEMA Will Aid in Future Response and Recovery Efforts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement at the confirmation hearing for David Paulison  who has been nominated to become the official director of FEMA  Mr  Paulison currently serves as acting director                      Thank you Madam Chairman and welcome Chief Paulison to this hearing on your nomination to officially become the Under Secretary for Federal Emergency Management at the Department of Homeland Security  in effect  FEMA     an agency that we  ultimately  would like to see renamed and restructured   But  I   ll come back to that later in my statement                    Your background has clearly helped prepare you for the challenges you will face in this position   You have more than 30 years experience as a firefighter in the Miami Dade County Fire Department in Florida  and rose through the ranks to become Fire Chief  with oversight of the county   s Office of Emergency Management  You led the U S  Fire Administration  briefly served as Director of FEMA   s Preparedness Division and have served as FEMA   s Acting Director since September 2005                      I think many of the problems we saw in FEMA   s response to Hurricane Katrina were due to a management that did not have the same professional experience in emergency response  which is one of the reasons our Katrina report recommends that emergency management leaders have sufficient relevant experience                      I also appreciate many of the actions you have taken as acting director of FEMA since Michael Brown   s resignation   your hiring goals to bring the agency to full strength  plans to preposition relief supplies better  and to equip personnel better  Although these initiatives will help us be prepare better  we have far more work to do  especially as we head into a hurricane season that experts have ominously warned favors more catastrophic storms in both the Gulf and along the East Coast                    We need FEMA leaning into the wind     not being blown apart by it                     Having said that  as I mentioned earlier  Chairman Collins and I would like to see FEMA replaced  with a new agency     the National Preparedness and Response Authority  NPRA      established within the Department of Homeland Security  DHS                     The FEMA label has become discredited and a symbol of ineffectiveness  It needs to change  and we believe those valuable FEMA employees     whose experience and expertise would energize the new NPRA when they are transferred     deserve to have the stigma lifted and their credibility restored by establishing a new structure that would bring out their best  In short  our proposal is about much more than a change in name     Right now  FEMA is too heavily concentrated in Washington and is disconnected from the real work of preparing for disasters at the state and local level         As Chairman Collins and I envision it  the new NPRA would have the leadership  structure  and authority to work with state and local officials to prepare for and respond to catastrophes  NPRA would have 10 strong regional offices  each with a permanent    strike team     These teams would include representatives from other federal agencies involved in emergency response to ensure that all relevant federal functions are familiar with regional threats  and have already coordinated with state and local emergency preparers and responders        I know there are those who believe FEMA should be a separate agency again and taken out of DHS   But our investigation found that FEMA never has been prepared for a catastrophe of Katrina   s scope and intensity     even when it was an independent agency  As Scott Wells  the number two federal officer in Louisiana during the Katrina crisis with 25 years of emergency management experience     told the Committee     FEMA is not trained  FEMA is not equipped  FEMA is not organized to do very large response operations            If you move a weak FEMA out of DHS you   re left with a weak FEMA  now isolated from the resources it needs and relies on from within DHS   What we need is more integration  not less          Under our proposal  NPRA would be responsible not just for disaster response  but for disaster preparedness as well  working hand in hand with state and local officials  other federal agencies  and the private and non profit sectors to be ready for true catastrophes  whether natural or by the hand of terrorists         It would be able to take full advantage of the Department   s significant resources   including the Coast Guard  communications capabilities and interoperability research  law enforcement  intelligence assets  infrastructure protection and billions of dollars in grants     for an all hazards approach to emergencies                    I know you agree with the Chairman and me that emergency management must remain within DHS   However  we need much more than FEMA is now capable of delivering  I will want to know if you will work to shape this new agency to meet the needs of our nation in a disaster        I   d like to add a word about the Katrina recovery  Chief Paulison  you came before this Committee seven months ago to update us on FEMA   s recovery effort and respond to our concerns that it was in disarray   Many of the questions we had then remain unanswered today  and we continue to receive reports of inadequate planning  poor coordination  inflexible guidelines  and ineffective communications on FEMA   s part         I understand that some of your recovery programs were not created for a catastrophe of Katrina   s proportions  which is why Chairman Collins and I introduced legislation immediately after the storm to address some of the most pressing needs  One of the most essential proposals was to give the President the authority to waive the  26 200 individual assistance cap  which unfortunately was rejected  Nearly 14 000 people have now reached that cap and need additional assistance  FEMA clearly needs more tools to manage successfully long term recovery efforts  for communities as well as individuals   We hope to have your support as we develop more effective approaches          But some problems can t wait   For example  FEMA recently gave 30 days notice to many evacuees still living in apartments and trailers  Evacuees and local officials are expressing obvious frustration  and we cannot abandon these people now   I want to know how you will move this recovery forward in a fair and just manner        The new hurricane season is now just days away  But as we   ve seen with the flooding in New England  nature has its own timetable and disasters     while they can be anticipated     cannot be predicted  And terrorists can strike any time        For the time being  we need a FEMA that has learned from the mistakes of Katrina and is ready and able to jump in and save lives in the critical days and hours before and after a storm     and then ready to help communities rebuild in the weeks and months that follow        Thank you Madam Chairman       30
