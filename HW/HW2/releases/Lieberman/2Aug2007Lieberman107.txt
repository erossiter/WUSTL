Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   Thursday hailed Senate passage of the most comprehensive bipartisan lobbying and ethics reform bill in a generation as a  road to reform  that will lead to restored public trust in Congress by guaranteeing the integrity and accountability of its elected officials     Lieberman  one of the co authors of the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act  S  1  said the legislation  shines much needed light in corners and corridors of the Capitol too long left dark  by increasing transparency and disclosure of activities between lawmakers and lobbyists  The bill passed the Senate by an overwhelming vote of 83 14                   The people who are good enough to honor us by sending us here are frustrated because they think too often we put partisan interests ahead of public interest   ahead of their interests   Lieberman said on the floor of the Senate shortly before passage   When one member is accused or convicted of an ethical or legal lapse  it affects the attitude of the people toward the entire institution  And these ethical lapses have come with increasing frequency      We adopt laws to try to create clarity of rules and create incentives for our society overall and  in this case ourselves  to guide us  to encourage us  hopefully to scare us into doing the right thing  And it is in that context that I rise with real enthusiasm to support the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act  It is not only the right thing to do in every substantive way  but it is the right thing to do in the larger sense of trying to rebuild the respect that the American people have for this institution and for all of use who are members of it      HSGAC was responsible for a major portion of the bill   The Rules Committee was also closely involved in its drafting and was responsible for provisions that tighten Senate ethics rules     The measure amends the Lobbyist Disclosure Act  LDA  by requiring lobbyists to file semiannual reports detailing for the first time campaign contributions  payments for events to honor Members or to entities controlled by Members  and donations to Presidential libraries or inaugural committees  It also would bring the LDA into the age of the Internet by requiring electronic filings  and by requiring quarterly   rather than semiannual   reports detailing lobbying activities for specific clients   All reports filed under the LDA will be made public on House and Senate websites                  Other provisions of the bill would                           Prohibit lobbyists and their clients from giving gifts  including free meals and tickets  to Senators and their staffs                           Require  bundled  campaign contributions made by lobbyists to federal candidates to be disclosed to the public and published on the Federal Election Commission website                           Allow greater transparency in earmarking and the legislative process by requiring all earmarks included in bills and conference reports  and their sponsors be identified on the internet at least 48 hours before Senate votes  require Senators to certify that they and their immediate family members have no financial interest in the earmarks they request  end the practice of secret Senate holds  and make conference reports available for public review on the internet 48 hours before the vote                           Shine a spotlight on  stealth coalitions  by requiring greater disclosure of the identity of individual organizations that contribute to collective and focused lobbying efforts                           Limit privately funded travel by barring lobbyists and their private sector clients from paying for multi day travel trips by Senators and their staffs                           Require Senators  Senate candidates and Presidential candidates to pay charter rates for trips on private planes  bars House candidates from accepting trips on private planes                           Prohibit Senators and their senior staff from gaining undue lobbying access by increasing the  cooling off  period for Senators from one to two years before they can lobby Congress  prohibits senior Senate staff from lobbying contacts with the entire Senate for one year  instead of just their former employing office                            Require better enforcement mechanisms by increasing civil penalties under the LDA  and by creating a new criminal penalty for knowingly failing to comply with the Act                            Require annual audits of lobbyist filings by the Government Accountability Office as well as regular reporting by the Department of Justice on actions they take against those who violate the rules                           Prohibit Members of Congress from attending national political convention parties held in their honor and paid for by lobbyists or their clients                           Prohibit Members of Congress and their staff from attempting to influence employment decisions in exchange for political access                           Deny Congressional retirement benefits to Members of Congress who are convicted of bribery  perjury and other similar crimes           The House of Representatives passed the final bill on Tuesday by a vote of 411 8  It now goes to the President for signature into law
