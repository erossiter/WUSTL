and Lieberman Passes Homeland Security Committee                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Washington     Port security legislation authored by Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Senator Patty Murray  D WA   and cosponsored by Ranking Committee Member Joe Lieberman  D CT   passed the Committee today and is awaiting consideration by the full Senate   Entitled the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  the bill would implement needed security reforms at our nation   s seaports  including establishing improved cargo screening standards  providing incentives to importers to enhance their security measures and ensuring the successful resumption of shipping in the event of a terrorist attack  Similar legislation  modeled after the Murray Collins legislation  recently passed a House panel            For years we ve known that our ports are vulnerable  and even the 9 11 Commission identified them as a possible target for terrorists   But for too long  the Administration has dragged its feet on the issues of cargo and port security   This consistently dismissive position is unacceptable  The American people need to know that our ports are secure and the cargo entering our country is safe  no matter whose hands it may have passed through     Senator Murray said      This is precisely why Senator Collins and I introduced the GreenLane Act   I applaud Committee passage of our legislation and I look forward to bringing it to the floor of the Senate where we can move ahead and ensure the safety of our residents and the strength of our economy              For years  experts have told me and members of the committee  that our ports are one of our biggest vulnerabilities  This legislation helps address this vulnerability to ensure that our ports are safer   Our bill will help build a coordinated approach to maritime and port security across all levels of government and with our overseas trading partners   In addition to improving our nation   s security  it will expedite trade with foreign governments and businesses  and provide financial assistance to our ports as they strive to strengthen their terrorism prevention and response effort     said Senator Collins      We cannot continue on rely on luck  or even alert crane operators  to provide for the security of our seaports  our nation  and our people   The enactment of these reforms will ensure that cargo containers entering our ports do not become the Trojan horse of the 21st century           Senator Lieberman said   The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act serves as another building block in our effort to protect our national and economic security before terrorists strike  Prior to 9 11  the system for international trade was predicated on efficiency     moving millions of tons of goodS across our borders or through our ports every day   Since then  we   ve been working to inject security into that equation without causing the very economic harms terrorists have in mind   Programs like the Container Security Initiative and the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism have provided a foundation for a layered security system at our ports and throughout the global supply chain  The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act builds on that foundation         The Committee held a hearing on The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act in April  in which the directors of both the Portland  Maine  and Seattle  Washington  ports departments voiced the urgent need for enhanced security at our seaports    These sentiments were echoed by officials from the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Commerce   The hearing came at the heels of the second incident in which Chinese nationals arrived undetected at a U S  port in a sealed cargo container   This event  as well as the Dubai Ports World contract  underscores the flaws in our current maritime security structure and the need for comprehensive legislation to address these concerns         Approximately 95 percent of our nation   s trade  worth nearly  1 trillion  enters or leaves through our seaports   Foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approximately 800 million tons of goods that come into our country   In fiscal year 2005 alone  more than eleven million containers arrived on American soil by sea and this number is growing at a rate of over 10 percent a year   While this figure represents robust trade  it also signals a considerable risk to our nation   s security         Specifically  the bill would                  Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability                   Help prevent a lengthy shutdown of America s seaports in the event of an incident     protecting    America s economy from severe disruption                  Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient                 Push the borders out so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo        The bill improves security at America s ports by establishing                             The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures                             Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs                             The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures   regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies                             Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level                             The Act also authorizes  835 million for Port Security Grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT generated through the collection of customs fees        30
