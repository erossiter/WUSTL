al Qaeda in Iraq    but the road to victory now requires cutting off al Qaeda s road to Iraq through Damascus     Thanks to Gen  David Petraeus s new counterinsurgency strategy in Iraq  and the strength and skill of the American soldiers fighting there  al Qaeda in Iraq is now being routed from its former strongholds in Anbar and Diyala provinces  Many of Iraq s Sunni Arabs  meanwhile  are uniting with us against al Qaeda  alienated by the barbarism and brutality of their erstwhile allies     As Gen  Petraeus recently said of al Qaeda in Iraq   We have them off plan      But defeating al Qaeda in Iraq requires not only that we continue pressing the offensive against its leadership and infrastructure inside the country  We must also aggressively target its links to  global  al Qaeda and close off the routes its foreign fighters are using to get into Iraq     Recently declassified American intelligence reveals just how much al Qaeda in Iraq is dependent for its survival on the support it receives from the broader  global al Qaeda network  and how most of that support flows into Iraq through one country    Syria  Al Qaeda in Iraq is sustained by a transnational network of facilitators and human smugglers  who replenish its supply of suicide bombers    approximately 60 to 80 Islamist extremists  recruited every month from across the Middle East  North Africa and Europe  and sent to meet their al Qaeda handlers in Syria  from where they are taken to Iraq to blow themselves up to kill countless others     Although small in number  these foreign fighters are a vital strategic asset to al Qaeda in Iraq  providing it with the essential human ammunition it needs to conduct high visibility  mass casualty suicide bombings  such as we saw last week in northern Iraq  In fact  the U S  military estimates that between 80  and 90  of suicide attacks in Iraq are perpetrated by foreign fighters  making them the deadliest weapon in al Qaeda s war arsenal  Without them  al Qaeda in Iraq would be critically  perhaps even fatally  weakened     That is why we now must focus on disrupting this flow of suicide bombers    and that means focusing on Syria  through which up to 80  of the Iraq bound extremists transit  Indeed  even terrorists from countries that directly border Iraq travel by land via Syria to Iraq  instead of directly from their home countries  because of the permissive environment for terrorism that the Syrian government has fostered  Syria refuses to tighten its visa regime for individuals transiting its territory     Coalition forces have spent considerable time and energy trying to tighten Syria s land border with Iraq against terrorist infiltration  But given the length and topography of that border  the success of these efforts is likely to remain uneven at best  particularly without the support of the Damascus regime     Before al Qaeda s foreign fighters can make their way across the Syrian border into Iraq  however  they must first reach Syria    and the overwhelming majority does so  according to U S  intelligence estimates  by flying into Damascus International Airport  making the airport the central hub of al Qaeda travel in the Middle East  and the most vulnerable chokepoint in al Qaeda s war against Iraq and the U S  in Iraq     Syrian President Bashar al Assad cannot seriously claim that he is incapable of exercising effective control over the main airport in his capital city  Syria is a police state  with sprawling domestic intelligence and security services  The notion that al Qaeda recruits are slipping into and through the Damascus airport unbeknownst to the local Mukhabarat is totally unbelievable     This is not the first use of the Damascus airport by terrorists  It has long been the central transit point for Iranian weapons en route to Hezbollah  in violation of United Nations Security Council sanctions  as well as for al Qaeda operatives moving into and out of Lebanon     Now the Damascus airport is the point of entry into Iraq for most of the suicide bombers who are killing innocent Iraqi citizens and American soldiers  and trying to break America s will in this war  It is therefore time to demand that the Syrian regime stop playing travel agent for al Qaeda in Iraq     When Congress reconvenes next month  we should set aside whatever differences divide us on Iraq and send a clear and unambiguous message to the Syrian regime  as we did last month to the Iranian regime  that the transit of al Qaeda suicide bombers through Syria on their way to Iraq is completely unacceptable  and it must stop     We in the U S  government should also begin developing a range of options to consider taking against Damascus International  unless the Syrian government takes appropriate action  and soon     Responsible air carriers should be asked to stop flights into Damascus International  as long as it remains the main terminal of international terror  Despite its use by al Qaeda and Hezbollah terrorists  the airport continues to be serviced by many major non U S  carriers  including Alitalia  Air France  and British Airways     Interrupting the flow of foreign fighters would mean countless fewer suicide bombings in Iraq  and countless fewer innocent people murdered by the barbaric enemy we are fighting there  At a time when the al Qaeda network in Iraq is already under heavy stress thanks to American and Iraqi military operations  closing off the supply line through which al Qaeda in Iraq is armed with its most deadly weapons    suicide bombers    would be devastating to the terrorists  cause     Simply put  for the U S  and our Iraqi allies  defeating al Qaeda in Iraq means locking shut Syria s  Open Door  policy to terrorists  It is past time for Syria to do so     Mr  Lieberman is an Independent Democratic senator from Connecticut
