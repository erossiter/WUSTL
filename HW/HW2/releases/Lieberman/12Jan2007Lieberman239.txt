Bipartisan Measure       WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  reintroduced the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act  S  280  today with his longstanding ally  Senator John McCain  R AZ    Co sponsoring the bill are Senators Barack Obama  D IL  and Olympia Snowe  R ME   who had co sponsored the 2005 version of the bill  and Senators Blanche Lincoln  D AR  and Susan Collins  R ME    The most bipartisan of the Senate proposals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions across all major sectors of the US economy  the new bill quickly won endorsements from the National Wildlife Federation  Environmental Defense  and the Pew Center on Global Climate Change          When former skeptics cite melting habitat as the reason polar bears are now threatened  you know the global warming debate is over     said Lieberman      The American people want action now because they understand the alternative is bequeathing a diminished world to our children and grandchildren   Our comprehensive legislation has attracted bipartisan support because it solves the global warming problem without weakening the nation   s economic position or imposing hardship on its citizens   By using the power of the free market to promote the rapid and widespread deployment of advanced technologies  we will strengthen this country   s economic position even as we protect our grandchildren against the threat of a diminished future             We continue to work with the scientific community  industry  economists  environmentalists  the faith based community  and other stakeholders to ensure that we are fully addressing the serious problem of global warming in a manner that has both economic and environmental integrity     said McCain      I am confident that given our will and what s at stake  America can and must assume its proper leadership role in addressing the preeminent environmental issue of our time  the consequences of which so directly affects our national interests  The costs of inaction are enormous  and the national security concerns related to our inaction cannot be ignored  That is why I will continue working with my colleagues to further improve this legislation to craft and implement a market based policy that will efficiently combat global warming in a manner that will serve our nation well for many years to come             It has become readily apparent that climate change is real and potentially irreversible if we don   t begin to address it soon   said Lincoln   The burden that we will pass on to future generations grows larger each day that we fail to take action  As we move forward with this legislation  I will continue to work with my colleagues to find a solution to climate change while developing mechanisms within this bill to ensure that our economy remains strong and consumers  particularly in rural areas  are protected from unreasonable rate increases             With overwhelming scientific evidence that global warming is adversely impacting the health of our planet  the time has come for the Congress to take action     said Snowe      Manmade greenhouse gas emissions that enter the atmosphere today will last for generations to come  threatening our oceans  our environment and our economic well being   It is beyond dispute that we cannot afford the price of inaction   This legislation takes concrete steps by using a fair  market based system to once and for all demonstrate leadership on climate change and reduce emissions in the United States             With each passing year  the consequences of federal inaction on reducing greenhouse gas emissions become more devastating for our children and grandchildren  and the range of solutions grows smaller     Obama said      This bill offers a comprehensive solution that relies on American will  ingenuity  and technological expertise to solve one of the greatest problems of our generation  and it deserves consideration by the Senate as soon as possible             I   ve traveled north to the Arctic and south to Antarctica  and I ve seen signs of the changing climate in both places and almost everywhere in between     said Collins      The world   s climate is changing  from top to bottom  With 2006 the warmest year in United States history  it is clearly time to act  The Climate Stewardship Act is a powerful bill that takes advantage of market mechanisms to address global warming without harming the economy  I   m pleased to join senators McCain and Lieberman in cosponsoring this important bill          The 2005 version of the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act would have capped US greenhouse gas emissions at year 2000 levels without mandating further reductions   The new bill  S  280  will gradually lower the emissions cap  such that it reaches approximately one third of 2000 levels by 2050   Those long term reductions will forestall catastrophic  manmade climate change  provided the world   s other major economies follow suit within the next decade   Like the 2005 version  the reintroduced bill controls compliance costs by allowing companies to trade  save  and borrow emissions credits  and by allowing them to generate    offset    credits by inducing non covered businesses  farms  and others to reduce their emissions or capture and store greenhouse gases   The reintroduced bill  however  increases the availability of borrowing and offsets in order to control costs further       Lieberman and McCain first introduced their landmark bill to curb global warming using a market based system in 2003   They forced the US Senate to vote on the measure that year  and on the reintroduced bill in 2005   In June 2005  the Senate passed a resolution calling for the enactment of legislation to reverse the persistent growth of global warming pollution without harming the US economy and while encouraging the country   s major trading partners to take comparable action          30
