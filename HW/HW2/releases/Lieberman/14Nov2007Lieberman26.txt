 Explosives Device Protection Also Agreed To       WASHINGTON   Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Wednesday successfully reported out of committee several pieces of legislation central to the effective stewardship of the federal government    At a Committee markup  members approved by voice vote S  2324  The Inspector General Reform Act  S  2321  The E Government Reauthorization Act  S 100  The Telework Enhancement Act  and S 1667  a bill to create a pilot program to dispose quickly of unused federal buildings  All were passed by voice vote     Each of these bills will improve the effectiveness  efficiency  and accountability of government  Lieberman said  We came here to legislate and that is just what we are doing    S  2324  The Inspector General Reform Act would give greater independence to and require more accountability from Inspectors General  IG   Among other things  it would require the Administration to notify Congress 30 days before attempting to remove or transfer an IG  require that all IGs be chosen on the basis of qualifications  without regard to political affiliation  provide greater transparency of IG budget needs to help ensure the IG offices have the resources they need for their investigations  and enhance IG accountability by strengthening the Integrity Committee that handles allegations against IGs and their senior staff    IGs have become like consumer protectors for the taxpayer deep within each agency  Lieberman said  Their audits have saved our government billions of dollars  and exposed cases of serious misconduct and mismanagement  This bill helps ensure that IGs are more independent and more accountable so they can better perform their valuable work for the public interest    Collins said  Inspectors General are vital partners in Congress s effort to identify inefficient  ineffective  and improper government programs  The investigations and reports of IGs throughout the government help Congress shape legislation and oversight activities   improving government performance  providing important transparency into programs  and giving Americans better value for their tax dollar  The Inspector General Reform Act of 2007 will improve the independence and effectiveness of Inspectors General and contribute to better relations among the IGs  the agencies they serve  and the Congress  S  2321  the E Government Re Authorization Act  would reauthorize for five years critical provisions that are set to expire in the E Government Act  which Lieberman authored and the Committee and Congress passed in 2002  The measure would increase government accessibility and transparency by requiring the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  to work with federal agencies to make sure their information and services can be found by search engines  The bill also will improve privacy protections across the government by requiring the development of best practices for privacy impact assessments  which were mandated in the original E Government Act    The Committee also approved S  2292  The National Bombing Prevention Act  which would formally authorize the Department of Homeland Security s Office of Bombing Prevention  OBP  and increase its budget to  25 million  The measure would also require the President to deliver a long awaited National Strategy for Improvised Explosive Devices and it would require DHS to establish a program to speed up the transfer of counter IED technology to first responders    Improvised Explosive Devices are a global threat and federal efforts to protect Americans against them need to be strengthened and expanded  said Lieberman    Collins said  The most likely terror threat around the world and here in the U S  is that of IEDs  We are also painfully aware that IEDs are the cause of much death and destruction in Iraq  The FBI and DHS tell us that the threat from these devices is not only real  but growing  The Collins  Lieberman National Bombing Prevention Act of 2007 aims to improve our defenses against this deadly weapon  I am pleased that it was approved by our committee    The committee also passed     S  1000  Telework Enhancement Act of 2007  which would help improve the cost efficiency of the federal government by requiring agencies to develop telework strategies and determine which employees are eligible for telework     S  1667  a bill to establish a pilot program for the expedited disposal of Federal real property  which would allow agencies to recoup administrative costs associated with the sale of excess federal property  as well as a portion of the proceeds of the sale  The bill also ensures that unused federal buildings be reviewed to determine if they are suitable for use by groups serving the homeless     H R  390  Preservation of Records of Servitude  Emancipation  and Post Civil War Reconstruction Act     H R
