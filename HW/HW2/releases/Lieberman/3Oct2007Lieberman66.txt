ID CT  today announced major funding for Connecticuts defense industry that was included in the 2008 Defense Appropriations Bill approved by the U S  Senate tonight  The bill includes additional funds that will increase submarine production to two submarines per year by 2010  two years earlier than originally planned by the Navy  This funding impacts thousands of jobs throughout Connecticut  especially in the southeast region of the state  The bill also includes substantial investments in current defense systems and research and development activities to ensure U S  soldiers  sailors  airmen  and marines are outfitted with the quality resources they need to perform their missions  Connecticuts workers greatly contribute to our nations defense  said Dodd  For the first time in 16 years  they will now have the resources needed to restore our critical manufacturing base and build multiple submarines per year  No longer can the Pentagon promise that they will ramp up production in a few years  only to renege time and time again  The era of moving goalposts is over  Instead  we are entering the era of Connecticuts submarines   the stealthiest  most capable undersea vessels in the world   With money for a second submarine in both the House and Senate defense appropriations bills  I am confident that we have taken important steps to secure and revitalize the submarine industrial base in the United States  said Lieberman  This commitment of funding is critical to Connecticut and our nations security  Also  the inclusion of a number of a research and development projects brings an investment in high tech jobs to Connecticuts defense industry    Funding in the Defense Appropriations bill will be used to provide military equipment such as ground vehicles
