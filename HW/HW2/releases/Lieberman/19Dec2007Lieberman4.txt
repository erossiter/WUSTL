Lieberman  ID Conn   Wednesday applauded the Senate passage of the Fiscal Year  FY  2008 Omnibus Appropriations bill which includes  38 7 billion for the Department of Homeland Security  DHS  for fiscal year 2008  including  2 7 billion in emergency funds for border security and other needs         This bill rightly provides significant increases over the Administration s inadequate budget request for key national security programs   said Lieberman   With these increased funds our first responders and state and local governments can purchase equipment and receive the training necessary to effectively respond to man made or natural disasters  our ports and railways will be better protected  and our borders and airports will have tighter security        The bill includes  950 million for FEMA s State Homeland Security Grants Program  the level authorized by the  Implementing the Recommendations of the 9 11 Commission Act of 2007   which Senators Lieberman and Susan Collins R Me   authored   The appropriations bill includes  50 million for an Interoperable Emergency Communications Grant Program also established by the 9 11 bill   The Omnibus bill also includes  750 million combined for the Assistance to Firefighters Grants and SAFER grants program while Emergency Management Performance Grants received an increase of  100 million from last year s level  for a total of  300 million   FEMA receives  724 million   189 million above FY07  including an additional  100 million for FEMA s core operations programs in order to help build up FEMA s capabilities and allow it to carry out its new duties required under the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act  which Lieberman and Collins also authored   Rail and transit security grants receive  400 million   225 million above FY 2007   Port Security Grants are funded at  400 million as authorized by the SAFE Port Act   190 million above last year s level       The Appropriations Act also includes  6 8 billion for Customs and Border Protection  CBP  to secure the borders  including funds to continue limited use of National Guard troops on the border and hire 3 000 additional border patrol agents   The bill provides  1 2 billion for border security fencing to complete 370 miles by the end of FY 2008 and almost  15 million for additional unmanned aerial systems to patrol the border  The Omnibus bill also includes  475 million for the U S  VISIT program used to track the entry and exit of foreign visitors and  36 million for a new electronic travel authorization for travelers from Visa Waiver Program countries   This much needed funding will allow DHS to close security gaps at our land and air ports of entry that terrorist could potentially exploit      Lieberman was also pleased that the bill provides  10 million for the Office of Bombing Prevention  a funding increase which Senator Lieberman joined Senator Collins in adding as an amendment to the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill earlier this year   Improvised explosive devices are the preferred weapon of our enemies  and the Department of Homeland Security must have adequate resources to defend against this most likely threat   said Lieberman   I am happy to see that the Office of Bombing Prevention will receive the funding needed to fulfill its vital mission   Another initiative proposed by Lieberman to develop a national strategy for use of Closed Circuit Televisions to enhance national security was also included in the final Omnibus package      The legislation provides  50 million to protect chemical facilities from terrorist attacks and retained language championed by Senator Lieberman which allows states to enact chemical security rules that are more robust than federal standards   I am pleased that Congress has provided money for this vital security program well above the President s request   Lieberman said   We know that chemical sites pose a serious homeland security vulnerability and must ensure that DHS can help them enact meaningful security measures as soon as possible  I am also pleased that this legislation safeguards the ability of states and localities  who are our partners in homeland security  to enact stricter security standards where appropriate       It also includes  13 million for the Secure Freight Initiative and Global Trade Exchange programs  providing necessary funding for the continued operation of the container scanning pilot program authorized by the SAFE Port Act        Lieberman was disappointed that the bill contains a record number of homeland security earmarks totaling  443 8 million   While some of these earmarks are for valuable purposes  they run the risk of taking money from other important initiatives   It would be unfortunate if the increase of earmarks sharply cuts into funding for other vital homeland security priorities      Finally  the omnibus appropriations bill failed to provide any funding for a consolidated headquarters for the DHS  which is essential to establishing a unified culture at the Department   Currently  DHS is spread throughout 70 buildings across the National Capital Region making communication  coordination  and cooperation between DHS components a significant challenge   Senator Lieberman said   The elimination of this funding simply prolongs an unacceptable status quo and hinders the homeland security mission      30
