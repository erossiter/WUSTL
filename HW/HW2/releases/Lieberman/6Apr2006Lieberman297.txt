made the following statement at the Seapower Subcommittee Hearing for the Senate Committee on Armed Services           Good afternoon and thank you for attending   I want to welcome all of the witnesses to our Seapower subcommittee hearing  which continues our discussion of the Navy   s proposed budget and its warfighting plans for the future             I applaud the Navy   s ambitious long range shipbuilding plan  which was submitted to Congress in February   Our current Navy fleet is at its smallest size since prior to World War I   However  I am worried about whether the administration has requested enough money for shipbuilding in the budget to achieve these goals           Shortchanging our shipbuilding account jeopardizes our nation   s security   I am afraid that our plan for submarine construction is woefully inadequate   The Navy   s plan calls for a submarine fleet of 48 boats   I believe this number is too low for the strategic threats we face   First  several submarine officers and Defense Department officials argue that fulfilling the day to day demands for attack submarines  particularly ISR  Intelligence  Surveillance  and Reconnaissance  missions  would require a fleet of at least 70 submarines   We have been told that even with our current fleet of 54 submarines  the fleet can only provide combatant commanders with 65  of the    presence with a purpose    they requested   If our submarine fleet is too small now to perform the tasks that our warfighting commanders want done  we are inviting a level of risk that is unacceptable if we accept an even smaller fleet   Due to the proliferation of new trouble spots around the world  the need for undersea ISR has dramatically increased   A diminished submarine fleet cannot meet the demands of a post 9 11 world           The prognosis only gets worse   If we adopt the Navy   s proposed plan  which delays an increase of submarine production to two boats a year in FY 2012  we will fall below the minimal requirement of 48 submarines in 2018   At that time  our intelligence estimates conclude that China will have a well equipped  modernized submarine fleet of at least 50 boats   The Chinese are designing new classes of submarines with increased capabilities   At the same time  new submarines are being built elsewhere besides China  and they may be in the hands of future adversaries   If we do not move to produce two submarines a year as soon as possible  we are in serious danger of falling behind China  and we may have to accept dangerous risks elsewhere because we will have too few submarines             The submarine is not a Cold War legacy   In fact  the Virginia class submarine was designed specifically for post Cold War operations   It operates well in littoral waters  gathers intelligence  engages in strike operations and antisubmarine warfare  and provides Special Operations Forces with delivery and support   Because of its near shore capabilities  our submarines can intercept signals that are invisible to reconnaissance satellites and other platforms   These unique and powerful features make the Virginia class an indispensable weapon in our arsenal to fight the    long war    on terrorism   If we do not increase our build rate  we will not replace our aging Los Angeles class submarines fast enough   As a result  we run the risk of turning a deaf ear and a blind eye to a gaping hole in our national security   We live in a world in which we sometimes cannot anticipate attacks upon our homeland and military   In this instance  we can prevent a looming threat on the horizon with decisive action            The very least we can do is escalate production to two submarines as soon as possible   If we do this  we will maintain the recommended force structure fleet of 48 boats until 2025   While I still believe a fleet of 48 boats is too small for the conventional and asymmetric challenges ahead of us  it does put us in a better position to reduce the production gap between the United States and its competitors           We have the brainpower and ability to design and build the best submarines in the world in the United States   If we don   t act now  we may lose this capability  and it will be difficult to regain it   This is an issue of national concern   Submarine manufacturing companies are located in 47 states across the country   As a matter of national security and economic stability  we must take the necessary steps to preserve the submarine industrial base in the United States           I am especially concerned about our nation   s submarine designers   This is the first time in almost 50 years that we do not have a new submarine design on the table   As more designers and engineers are laid off  and we just laid off 154 workers from Electric Boat they will likely leave the business and there are no replacements   The news only gets worse  It is anticipated that Electric Boat will be forced to lay off up to 2 400 additional workers before the end of the year  Even if those laid off do return to submarine work  there could be other delays in restarting production   If designers are out of work or employed elsewhere for more than two years  they will lose their security clearances   The process of reinstating those clearances can take over a year   It is imperative that we preserve our submarine design workforce before any additional layoffs occur   I intend to fight to include funding for design work in this bill            In addition  I think we should transition New London from the world   s submarine center of excellence to the world   s undersea warfare center of excellence   We should concentrate the East Coast submarine force there  and base the LCS antisubmarine warfare and countermine modules there to build a true undersea warfare center of excellence   Devoting more resources to new design at Electric Boat would further strengthen the remarkable synergy among New London  Electric Boat  and the world   s leading undersea expertise in the region            The Defense Science Board has described the attack submarine as the    crown jewel    of American defense   If we neglect our submarine production  we jeopardize our global undersea warfare superiority   We must move forward to devise a plan that will maintain a robust submarine force in the United States which can readily meet all of the challenges of warfighting  reconnaissance  and joint support placed upon it           30
