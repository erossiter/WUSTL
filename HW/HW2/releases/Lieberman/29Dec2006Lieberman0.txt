                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            By Joseph Lieberman  Washington Post Op Ed       I ve just spent 10 days traveling in the Middle East and speaking to leaders there  all of which has made one thing clearer to me than ever  While we are naturally focused on Iraq  a larger war is emerging  On one side are extremists and terrorists led and sponsored by Iran  on the other moderates and democrats supported by the United States  Iraq is the most deadly battlefield on which that conflict is being fought  How we end the struggle there will affect not only the region but the worldwide war against the extremists who attacked us on Sept  11  2001       Because of the bravery of many Iraqi and coalition military personnel and the recent coming together of moderate political forces in Baghdad  the war is winnable  We and our Iraqi allies must do what is necessary to win it       The American people are justifiably frustrated by the lack of progress  and the price paid by our heroic troops and their families has been heavy  But what is needed now  especially in Washington and Baghdad  is not despair but decisive action    and soon       The most pressing problem we face in Iraq is not an absence of Iraqi political will or American diplomatic initiative  both of which are increasing and improving  it is a lack of basic security  As long as insurgents and death squads terrorize Baghdad  Iraq s nascent democratic institutions cannot be expected to function  much less win the trust of the people  The fear created by gang murders and mass abductions ensures that power will continue to flow to the very thugs and extremists who have the least interest in peace and reconciliation       This bloodshed  moreover  is not the inevitable product of ancient hatreds  It is the predictable consequence of a failure to ensure basic security and  equally important  of a conscious strategy by al Qaeda and Iran  which have systematically aimed to undermine Iraq s fragile political center  By ruthlessly attacking the Shiites in particular over the past three years  al Qaeda has sought to provoke precisely the dynamic of reciprocal violence that threatens to consume the country       On this point  let there be no doubt  If Iraq descends into full scale civil war  it will be a tremendous battlefield victory for al Qaeda and Iran  Iraq is the central front in the global and regional war against Islamic extremism       To turn around the crisis we need to send more American troops while we also train more Iraqi troops and strengthen the moderate political forces in the national government  After speaking with our military commanders and soldiers there  I strongly believe that additional U S  troops must be deployed to Baghdad and Anbar province    an increase that will at last allow us to establish security throughout the Iraqi capital  hold critical central neighborhoods in the city  clamp down on the insurgency and defeat al Qaeda in that province       In Baghdad and Ramadi  I found that it was the American colonels  even more than the generals  who were asking for more troops  In both places these soldiers showed a strong commitment to the cause of stopping the extremists  One colonel followed me out of the meeting with our military leaders in Ramadi and said with great emotion   Sir  I regret that I did not have the chance to speak in the meeting  but I want you to know on behalf of the soldiers in my unit and myself that we believe in why we are fighting here and we want to finish this fight  We know we can win it        In nearly four years of war  there have never been sufficient troops dispatched to accomplish our vital mission  The troop surge should be militarily meaningful in size  with a clearly defined mission       More U S  forces might not be a guarantee of success in this fight  but they are certainly its prerequisite  Just as the continuing carnage in Baghdad empowers extremists on all sides  establishing security there will open possibilities for compromise and cooperation on the Iraqi political front    possibilities that simply do not exist today because of the fear gripping all sides       I saw firsthand evidence in Iraq of the development of a multiethnic  moderate coalition against the extremists of al Qaeda and against the Mahdi Army  which is sponsored and armed by Iran and has inflamed the sectarian violence  We cannot abandon these brave Iraqi patriots who have stood up and fought the extremists and terrorists       The addition of more troops must be linked to a comprehensive new military  political and economic strategy that provides security for the population so that training of Iraqi troops and the development of a democratic government can move forward       In particular we must provide the vital breathing space for moderate Shiites and Sunnis to turn back the radicals in their communities  There are Iraqi political leaders who understand their responsibility to do this  In Anbar province we have made encouraging progress in winning over local Sunni tribal leaders in the fight against al Qaeda and other terrorists  With more troops to support them  our forces in Anbar and their Sunni allies can achieve a major victory over al Qaeda       As the hostile regimes in Iran and Syria appreciate    at times  it seems  more keenly than we do    failure in Iraq would be a strategic and moral catastrophe for the United States and its allies  Radical Islamist terrorist groups  both Sunni and Shiite  would reap victories simultaneously symbolic and tangible  as Iraq became a safe haven in which to train and strengthen their foot soldiers and Iran s terrorist agents  Hezbollah and Hamas would be greatly strengthened against their moderate opponents  One moderate Palestinian leader told me that a premature U S  exit from Iraq would be a victory for Iran and the groups it is supporting in the region  Meanwhile  the tens of thousands of Iraqis who have bravely stood with us in the hope of a democratic future would face the killing fields       In Iraq today we have a responsibility to do what is strategically and morally right for our nation over the long term    not what appears easier in the short term  The daily scenes of death and destruction are heartbreaking and infuriating  But there is no better strategic and moral alternative for America than standing with the moderate Iraqis until the country is stable and they can take over their security  Rather than engaging in hand wringing  carping or calls for withdrawal  we must summon the vision  will and courage to take the difficult and decisive steps needed for success and  yes  victory in Iraq  That will greatly advance the cause of moderation and freedom throughout the Middle East and protect our security at home       The writer is an Independent Democratic senator
