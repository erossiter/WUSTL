                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON     Today  Senator Lieberman  D CT   a member of the Environment and Public Works Committee  EPW   submitted the following statement to the EPW Subcommittee on Superfund and Waste Management announcing his co sponsorship of a bill to reinstate a polluter fee that will replenish the Superfund Trust Fund          A full copy of the Senator   s statement is below          Thank you Mr  Chairman   Contaminated industrial sites in this country continue to harm our children  our families  and our communities   I am disturbed by the mounting evidence that children are especially vulnerable to suffering brain damage and malignant disease as a result of exposure to the chemicals still found at these polluted sites   The Center for Children   s Health and the Environment at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine points out that three to four million children and adolescents live within one mile of a Superfund site       EPA concedes that there is current  actual human exposure to hazardous contaminants at two sites in my state       In Stratford  Connecticut  wastes containing lead  asbestos  and PCBs are found at thirty locations  including a residential parcel and a community park   Groundwater contaminated with volatile organic compounds flows beneath one hundred and twenty homes in the town   Indoor air testing has confirmed probable intrusion of those compounds unto the basements of those homes       In Durham  Connecticut  eighty houses abut and surround a contaminated industrial site   Children live in approximately thirty of those homes   All of the homes  in addition to three churches and a school  lie within the lateral extent of the plume of contaminated groundwater that extends from the industrial site   All of the buildings in the area get their water from wells         Both of these sites are in the Superfund pipeline  and I deeply appreciate the ongoing work of dedicated EPA employees  state employees  and neighborhood activists to minimize harmful exposure and to clean up the waste   But the people doing that vital work need adequate funding   They are unlikely to get adequate funding if the entire Superfund program is under funded   I believe that if the Superfund program is under funded  the responsible officials at the U S  EPA have an obligation to own up to that fact  so Congress can do something about it   Moreover  I believe the obligation is a moral one  because the health of children is at stake         I am concerned  then  over indications that EPA is not divulging a significant inadequacy in this vital program   s funding   I would like to rely on EPA   s assurances  because I have tremendous respect for the expertise and dedication of the agency   s career employees   But I have seen enough to make me suspect that whenever a senior EPA official tells Congress that Superfund does not need increased funding  career EPA employees shake their heads in disbelief and dismay       As Resources for the Future points out  annual appropriations for the Superfund Program have not kept pace with inflation   In fact  the program   s Fiscal Year 2005 appropriation of 1 2 billion dollars represents a forty percent decrease in purchasing power when compared with the Fiscal Year 1987 appropriation of 1 4 billion dollars   Meanwhile  as EPA acknowledges  highly complex and expensive mega sites make up an increasing percentage of the program   s cleanup burden       As the tension has increased between reality and EPA   s insistence that Superfund is adequately funded  EPA management has made less and less in the way of program details available to the public   That secrecy has fostered a suspicion that  in certain instances  sites have been allowed to progress through the Superfund pipeline even though their cleanup has not met the standards to which we can and must hold ourselves in order to protect Americans       So I am proud to cosponsor Senator Boxer   s bill to reinstate the polluter fee  which is justified and necessary to replenish the Superfund Trust Fund   As a government  we owe that to the children of Stratford  Durham  and countless other communities across the country       Thank you  Mr  Chairman      30
