Iraqi Contracts                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Washington  DC     Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Monday pressed David Norquist  nominated to be Chief Financial Officer for the Department of Homeland Security  on his role in allowing Halliburton to redact passages from a Defense Department audit of a Halliburton subsidiary s Iraqi reconstruction contract   At Norquist s confirmation hearing  Lieberman questioned why Halliburton was permitted to redact non proprietary audit findings that KBR had overcharged the Iraqi people by  177 million to import oil from Kuwait and perform related work   This episode is relevant to today   s hearing because DHS needs a CFO who puts taxpayers first  who is committed to sound financial management and transparency  and who is willing to confront agencies that may be shirking their legal responsibilities   Lieberman said        The redacted documents can be found at  http   www democrats reform house gov Documents 20050315113127 93376 pdf  His statement for the record follows        Thank you  Madam Chairman and welcome to this hearing  Mr  Norquist        I can   t stress enough how important this hearing is  The person stepping into the job of Chief Financial Officer of the Department of Homeland Security faces enormous challenges          The CFO will have to steer the 22 different agencies that make up DHS to financial stability so that DHS will finally get a clean audit  Previous audits have detailed serious shortcomings and poor financial management that has resulted in agencies running out of money for critical missions or having to impose sudden hiring freezes         We cannot have these types of disruptions to the Department charged with securing our homeland        And the CFO must work closely with the Chief Procurement Officer of the Department to bring an end to the embarrassing waste we have seen in many large DHS contracts        The CFO will also need to decide what to do with the financial modernization project called EMERGE2     or Electronically Managing Enterprise Resources for Government Effectiveness and Efficiency  The system was originally designed as a total transformation of DHS    financial systems  but has been downscaled in the President   s FY07 budget request                Given the importance of this job  in 2004  Congress changed the law to make the position of chief financial officer subject to Senate confirmation         Serving as Chief Financial Officer will require a commitment not only to sound financial management  but also to openness and transparency   If you are confirmed  Mr  Norquist  we would expect you to cooperate closely with the Inspector General and GAO  and to provide information promptly to Congress         In that spirit  I intend to ask you about your involvement in a troubling incident that relates to these important principles  While working at the Department of Defense  you led a team of government officials that decided not to disclose to a United Nations oversight board that KBR     a subsidiary of Halliburton     was suspected of overcharging Iraq millions of dollars         In December 2003  the Defense Contract Audit Agency  DCAA  announced that its draft audit had found overcharges by KBR of as much as  61 million for importing Kuwaiti fuel into Iraq  DCAA also said that significant additional overcharges were likely in the months to come                The contract was largely paid for from the Development Fund for Iraq  also known as DFI  which was established by UN Security Council Resolution 1483  The money in this fund belongs to the Iraqi people  It came from Iraqi oil sales  assets that had been frozen in bank accounts outside the U S   and  8 billion in funds transferred from the UN Oil for Food program          The UN gave control of the DFI to the Coalition Provisional Authority  The UN also established the International Advisory and Monitoring Board for Iraq to monitor our government   s administration of DFI   Resolution 1483 required that the Iraqi funds be    used in a transparent and equitable manner    and for the benefit of the Iraqi people          Beginning in April 2004 and continuing through September  the UN oversight board made repeated requests for the DCAA audits of the KBR contracts  During that period  you were the U S  Department of Defense   s observer and liaison to the Board          Accordingly  as you   ve told the Committee   s staff investigators  you headed up the process that considered whether the audits would be given to the UN Board         In October of 2004  you provided the oversight board redacted copies of the DCAA audits that struck every reference to every overcharge in every audit     463 redactions in all   Had they not been redacted  the DCAA audits would have shown that more than  177 million in overcharges and more than  17 million in unsupported costs were funded with Iraqi money        These redactions were made at KBR   s request  The Department of Defense did not dispute a single one         It would have been proper to redact information of a strictly proprietary nature  But when KBR handed over the redacted audits to the Department of Defense  it stated that it had struck information other than proprietary information  KBR explained that it had also redacted statements that the company believed were incorrect or misleading and that could damage KBR   s ability to win and negotiate new work        It is also very troubling that a contractor implicated in an overcharging scandal would be given the final say on what information to provide to the UN oversight board   After all  the UN board was the legal entity responsible for oversight of misspent Iraqi funds         Mr  Norquist  I would like to hear more about your role in this incident  I think this episode is relevant to today   s hearing because DHS needs a CFO who puts taxpayers first  who is committed to sound financial management and transparency  and who is willing to confront agencies that may be shirking their legal responsibilities          In preparing for the hearing Committee staff reviewed many documents that had been produced by the Department of Defense  as well as others that are publicly available   I ask that a selection of the documents be entered into the hearing record so that I can ask the nominee about them         30
