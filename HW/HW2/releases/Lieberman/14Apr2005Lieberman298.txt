Facts  States Oppose Rigid Mandates       WASHINGTON   A bipartisan group of Senators appealing to keep the REAL ID Act off the 2005 supplemental spending bill believes the drivers  license provisions of the Act could make the nation less safe than it would be otherwise       In letters to Majority Leader Bill Frist  R Tenn   and Minority Leader Harry Reid  D Nev   the Senators said REAL ID Act provisions that require states to verify birth certificates and immigration papers   without additional resources and data bases to do so   are simply unworkable          State governments are particularly vocal in their opposition to the REAL ID Act provisions  which would impose rigid and unrealistic mandates on their processes for issuing drivers  licenses    the letter states    In fact  the REAL ID Act provisions would be so difficult for states to implement the bill would undermine an initiative that can make the nation safer from terrorism        The REAL ID Act would repeal provisions in the National Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  signed into law last December  that called for federal minimum identification standards to ensure state issued documents are secure and identities are verified   The rule making process is already underway on an expedited schedule to set these standards  and state officials have a seat at the table  Under the REAL ID Act  states could not participate in a consensus building negotiated rule making       In part because of their exclusion in a matter concerning a traditional state function  but also because of their expertise in issuing drivers  licenses  state officials are lined up against the REAL ID Act   Opposing the bill are the National Governors Association  the National Conference of State Legislatures  and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators   Each of those groups endorsed the intelligence reform bill provisions        The REAL ID Act imposes mandates on state governments that are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government   the letter states   For example  the House bill requires verification of birth certificates without providing the time or resources needed to digitize hundreds of millions of paper documents   That requirement alone would lead to huge delays at state DMVs for all applicants        Following is the text of the letter        Dear Senator Frist       We write to express our strong belief that substantive provisions from the REAL ID Act of 2005 should not be enacted as part of the supplemental spending measure Congress is considering   In particular  we strongly oppose provisions of the REAL ID Act that would repeal the identification standards recommended by the 9 11 Commission and enacted last December as Section 7212 of The Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004         The Intelligence Reform Act requires federal minimum standards that will ensure State issued documents are secure and identities are verified   The provisions were enacted last year with the support of the Administration as well as the 9 11 Commission   State governments are particularly vocal in their opposition to the REAL ID Act provisions  which would impose rigid and unrealistic mandates on their processes for issuing drivers  licenses   In fact  the REAL ID Act provisions would be so difficult for states to implement  the bill would undermine an initiative that can make the nation safer from terrorism       Last year Congress enacted Section 7212 of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act in response to a recommendation of the 9 11 Commission       Secure identification should begin in the United States   The federal government should set standards for the issuance of birth certificates and sources of identification  such as drivers  licenses   Fraud in identity documents is no longer just a problem of theft   At many entry points to vulnerable facilities  including gates for boarding aircraft  sources of identification are the last opportunity to ensure that people are who they say they are and to check whether they are terrorists       Section 7212 requires the Department of Transportation  in consultation with the Department of Homeland Security  to establish minimum standards for drivers  licenses and personal ID cards issued by states   The standards will address the documentation required to prove an applicant s identity  verifiability of documents used to obtain a driver s license  safeguards in processing of applications to prevent fraud  and security features to ensure that drivers  licenses and personal identification cards are resistant to tampering  alteration or counterfeiting   The Department of Transportation has already begun the regulatory process that will result in new standards for drivers  licenses  on an expedited timetable required by the Act         In passing Section 7212  Congress recognized that issuing drivers  licenses is a traditional state function  and the Intelligence Reform Act guaranteed input from state governments when the regulations are being drafted   The Act requires that the regulations be developed through a negotiated rulemaking  and that representatives of state governments participate in the advisory committee that establishes the regulations   State governments strongly prefer this approach  and in its Statement of Administration Policy  dated October 7  2004  the White House emphasized the importance of consultation with states as one reason for endorsing the Senate provision on drivers  licenses over House provisions identical to those in the REAL ID Act         Title II of the REAL ID Act would repeal the Intelligence Reform Act provisions and replace them with expensive  prescriptive  and unworkable federal mandates for state issued drivers  licenses and ID cards   Under the House bill  state governments would be denied the seat at the table afforded by the Intelligence Reform Act   The House legislation is opposed by the National Governors Association  the National Conference of State Legislatures  the Council of State Governments  and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators       As these leading state government organizations have noted in correspondence to Congressional leadership  the REAL ID Act imposes mandates on state governments that are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government   For example  the House bill requires verification of birth certificates without providing the time or resources needed to digitize hundreds of millions of paper documents   That requirement alone would lead to huge delays at state DMVs for all applicants   The REAL ID Act would compel state DMVs to establish applicants  federal immigration status without providing states the necessary reliable and verifiable information to do so   And it would over ride states  traditional prerogative to make public safety determinations regarding who should be eligible for drivers  licenses        We urge you to ensure that this controversial House legislation not be added to an important supplemental spending bill that supports our troops in Iraq and funds aid to tsunami victims   The REAL ID ACT will not enhance our safety   In fact  by repealing a provision enacting a central recommendation of the 9 11 Commission  in favor of unworkably rigid federal mandates  it would jeopardize an initiative that can make the nation safer from terrorist attack       Sincerely       John E  Sununu   UNITED STATES
