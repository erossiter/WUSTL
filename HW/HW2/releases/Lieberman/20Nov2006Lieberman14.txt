                                                                                                                                                  WASHINGTON     In a letter to Department of Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff  Senators Susan Collins  R Me   and Joe Lieberman  D Conn   expressed concern that  one year after Hurricane Katrina  the Department seems to have made insufficient progress in improving situational awareness during disaster response  The Senators are looking into whether the solutions that have been implemented were ineffectively introduced  under utilized  and or may lack the necessary protocols to develop accurate situational awareness reports         One of the Department   s major initiatives to improve situational awareness is the Common Operating Picture  COP  database  an information sharing tool for first responders intended to provide DHS leadership with a coherent picture on the ground during disasters  Situational awareness was a key weakness during Hurricane Katrina  when key federal officials were unaware that the levees had been breached until long after New Orleans had started flooding         Briefings from DHS staff and reports from the DHS Inspector General indicate that the Homeland Security Information Network  HSIN   of which COP is a part  is hugely under utilized  While 18 000 first responders have registered for the network  less than 6 percent regularly use it  and DHS has done little to inform first responders about the COP or to train them how to use it  In order to ensure that COP is an effective tool  DHS must work out a protocol for how information submitted to the COP will actually be compiled  analyzed and prioritized to provide key officials with complete and meaningful situational awareness          Senator Collins and Lieberman   s letter asking for Secretary Chertoff   s response to these concerns is below             November 17  2006       The Honorable Michael Chertoff      Secretary of Homeland Security      Washington  DC 20528       Dear Secretary Chertoff                    We are writing to express our concern that the Department of Homeland Security may have failed to take sufficient steps to be capable of maintaining and sharing situational awareness during a disaster response   Despite steps intended to improve this capability  such as a restructured National Operations Center  NOC  framework and the initial implementation of a Common Operating Picture  COP  database  the Department still has significant issues to address before it is able to provide adequate situational awareness during a disaster                      Solid situational awareness is the foundation of any disaster response   Information gathered from a variety of sources     including first responders    situation reports  media  satellite imagery  and more     must be collected  analyzed  and provided in a timely manner to response managers and decision makers during or in preparation for an incident   In coordinating a national response to an incident  the NOC must be able to provide a coherent and prioritized set of information across the federal agencies and to the appropriate state and local governments  and it must ensure that critical information reaches the Director of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  the Secretary of Homeland Security  the President  and other key officials to ensure timely and effective decision making                     One of the major goals of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security was having the ability to    connect the dots      The Homeland Security Operations Center  HSOC  was a major component in implementing this goal and was designed to be our nation   s nerve center for information sharing and domestic incident management   Yet  as recognized in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   s Katrina investigation     Hurricane Katrina was the HSOC   s first major  public test  and it failed   At the federal level  there was a startling lack of situational awareness as Katrina came ashore   On the day of landfall  DHS ignored  disregarded  or simply failed to obtain readily available reports that would have     and should have     led to an understanding of the increasingly dire situation in New Orleans and the remainder of the Gulf Coast      Indeed  as the report found  on the day of landfall  senior DHS officials received numerous reports that should have led to an understanding of the dire situation in New Orleans  yet they were not aware of the crisis until Tuesday morning   The HSOC     charged with providing reliable information to decision makers including the Secretary and the President     failed to create a system to identify and acquire  and disseminate all available  relevant information    Decision makers were initially unaware of the failure of New Orleans    levee system  the extent of flooding in the city  and the presence of thousands of people in need of life sustaining assistance on highway overpasses  at the Superdome  and at the Murial Convention Center in New Orleans   The failure of senior DHS officials to realize the severe consequences of the storm prolonged human suffering and further damaged property   It is imperative that DHS develop capabilities to obtain better situational awareness and make better use of existing situational awareness to ensure a more comprehensive and effective response to future disasters  which will save lives and reduce human suffering                    DHS    efforts to improve situational awareness have resulted in a revised operations center framework based on May 2006 changes to the National Response Plan   Under this new framework  the National Operations Center will replace the HSOC  and will liaise with the National Infrastructure Coordination Center  NICC   the National Response Coordination Center  NRCC   other agency operations centers  and Sector Specific Agencies   A Disaster Response Group will replace the Interagency Incident Management Group and will function as a planning element in the NOC                      According to briefings provided by your staff  the locus of DHS    improved situational awareness ability will be its Common Operating Picture database  which rides on the Department   s real time information sharing tool  the Homeland Security Information Network  HSIN    Once fully implemented  the COP is intended to improve situational awareness by facilitating collaboration between first responders and decision makers   It is also designed to provide geospatial mapping  situation and spot reports  and requests for information or action to all users  and to overlay threats against critical infrastructure and key resources   Incoming information is intended to be vetted by subject matter experts across all levels of federal  state  and local government                    Despite these changes  however  we remain concerned that not enough has been done to ensure improved federal management of the next catastrophic disaster  which  by definition  will overwhelm state and local resources   Significant situational awareness gaps remain   For example  very few emergency management officials use HSIN on a regular basis  this must change if the COP is to become an effective situational awareness tool   According to a July 2006 report by the Department   s Office of the Inspector General  titled    Homeland Security Information Network Could Support Information Sharing More Effectively     DHS has not adequately communicated its vision for the HSIN network  especially how the network relates to and integrates with other federal  state  and local information sharing systems   In the absence of specific standard operating procedures     and training for those procedures     no more than 6 percent of the approximately 18 000 registered users contribute daily to the network   s three major portals  law enforcement  emergency management  and counter terrorism   If disaster response officials are unable or unwilling to access the COP or share situational awareness on a daily basis  no amount of NOC upgrades may be able to prevent a federal response similar to that which transpired during Katrina   Similarly  if mechanisms for COP redundancy are not implemented  if clear training programs for appropriate officials are not developed  or if other federal  state  and local entities are not effectively integrated into the NOC framework  situational awareness will not improve for the next federal response        Given the critical importance of situational awareness to the government   s ability to respond to disasters  whether natural or man made  we would appreciate your responses to the following questions regarding the Department   s current plans and progress in addressing this issue        Common Operating Picture                   DHS    implementation of the Common Operating Picture is intended to improve information sharing among the many entities involved in disaster response   Although the database has not been fully implemented  even after full implementation the COP may not ease all situational awareness deficiencies   It is important to clearly define the intended audience and scope of the COP  and to establish benchmarks for its implementation        1       What is the intended audience and scope of the COP         2       Please provide a timeline for full and final implementation of the COP  including implementation at the Unclassified  Law Enforcement Sensitive  and Classified levels         3       According to briefings by your staff  the COP   s initial operating capacity will focus primarily on hurricanes   Beyond the initial hurricane focus  please provide a timeline for implementation of an all source information all hazards all threats situational awareness database         4       When will the parallel effort addressing H5N1 avian influenza requirements be fully implemented                    The new COP database should provide significant amounts of information to watch officers at the NOC  NRCC  NICC  and other entities of the National Operations Center framework   Each participating agency will be responsible for sorting through the myriad amounts of incoming information so that it may be analyzed and prioritized by subject matter experts   It is not clear  however  that there is a system for collating the massive amounts of information into a true    common operating picture    that is coherent and meaningful to decision makers          5       How is incoming information used and processed   What plans does the NOC have in place for effective information management         6       Have national reporting requirements been developed   Has a national information reporting chain been developed       7       Are training programs in place for those charged with assimilating incoming information into a shared and prioritized structure       8       What is the decision process for determining which information is provided to key officials         9       What procedures and protocols will ensure that information provided to key officials is an accurate and meaningful representation of incoming situational awareness                    With an early entry situational awareness capability  and under the tasking authority of DHS Office of Operations Coordination  DHS Situational Awareness Teams  DSATs  are intended to be deployed soon after an incident occurs  with the goal of quickly providing information directly to the NOC   Although DSATs are administratively controlled by the Department   s Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE   it is important that other DHS entities are represented on the teams as well  in order to leverage as much as possible the Department   s assets and expertise        10   What is the current composition of DSAT teams       11   Are DHS agencies other than ICE represented on DSAT teams   Are FEMA representatives included                    DHS officials have described two mechanisms for COP redundancy in the event that a cyber attack cripples the HSIN network   In such an event  the COP would be accessible either through the Department   s secure  internal DHSOnline server or at the Department   s Continuity of Operations  COOP  facility   Neither option  however  allows for non DHS personnel to access the database or contribute situational awareness   Since the effectiveness of the COP is based upon the ability of response managers at all levels to contribute to and glean information from the database  it is important that any redundancy capability provide access to all users          12   Please describe any efforts to provide COP redundancy that will be available to all registered users of the database in the event that HSIN is not accessible                      The August 22 24  2006     Hurricane Ennis    Exercise was the first exercise to test the COP   The COP was also in use during Hurricane Ernesto        13   Please provide After Action Reports for the exercise and for Hurricane Ernesto        14   What significant obstacles to COP implementation occurred  and what other lessons learned did both the exercise and real time use provide         15   What corrective actions are being taken to mitigate obstacles derived from the lessons learned        Integration and Training                   Effective situational awareness is most achievable when clear policies are implemented  and all relevant officials have a solid understanding of their roles  The new NOC framework has the opportunity to be a valuable situational awareness tool  but its success will depend on straightforward supporting policies and comprehensive training for those policies  as well as the thorough integration of all relevant entities into the overarching operations center structure          16   An October 2006 GAO report titled    Opportunities Exist to Enhance Collaboration at 24 7 Operations Centers Staffed by Multiple DHS Agencies    states that the NOC has not defined a position description for watch staff assigned from other DHS components or outside agencies  but rather the NOC relies on those components agencies to determine their assigned watch staff   s roles and responsibilities   Does the NOC plan to develop a position description for watch staff assigned from other DHS components or outside agencies       17   Are future exercises scheduled that will test the Department   s situational awareness ability                    COP protocols state that agencies own and control information related to their areas of expertise   Indeed  the COP relies on agency specific subject matter experts to evaluate  prioritize  and forward critical information to watch staff at the NOC   Thus DHS    role as manager of the federal response during a major incident makes it incumbent on the Department to ensure that other federal  state  and local entities can also maintain situational awareness          18   What actions is DHS taking to ensure that the situational awareness plans of relevant entities  including other federal agencies  are being effectively integrated into the NOC framework   In particular  how does DHS intend to overcome cultural reluctance in other agencies that may already have their own information management tools       19   What steps has DHS taken to ensure that other federal Departments and Agencies  as well as the appropriate state and local officials  have the ability to access and share classified information at their COOP sites                      The July 2006 report by the Department   s Office of the Inspector General  titled    Homeland Security Information Network Could Support Information Sharing More Effectively     calls on DHS to clarify HSIN   s mission  provide clear guidance and standard operating procedures regarding integration with other federal  state  and local information sharing systems  and implement measurable performance metrics to gauge the network   s effectiveness   In the absence of such measures  very few of the approximately 18 000 registered HSIN users contribute regularly to the network   s three major portals   According to the report  just 6 percent of registered law enforcement users post information on a monthly basis  just 1 percent of registered emergency management users post on a monthly basis  and just 1 percent of counter terrorism users post on a monthly basis   Since the COP will rely on frequent contributions of information by HSIN users during a disaster response  such levels are clearly problematic        20     Given the concerns of this report  what steps is the Department taking to       a        Establish guidelines for COP access and contributions       b       Train HSIN users on COP guidelines  and encourage regular use of the database       c        Gauge the effectiveness of information sharing across HSIN       d       Gauge the effectiveness of COP performance                    In a September 2006 report titled    Catastrophic Disasters  Enhanced Leadership  Capabilities  and Accountability Controls Will Improve the Effectiveness of the Nation   s Preparedness  Response  and Recovery System     the GAO recommended that the Department of Defense  DOD  play a significant role in providing situational awareness due to DOD   s unique reconnaissance and satellite imagery capabilities  echoing similar recommendations of this Committee   s Katrina investigation   DOD has invested considerable resources into shoring up its communications capabilities in anticipation of a future incident   It is important that these capabilities be identified well in advance of an incident  so that DHS and DOD officials do not scramble to integrate their capabilities after an incident has occurred          21   Are pre existing contracts  MOUs  or other agreements in place to take advantage of DOD   s incident management capabilities with respect to situational awareness         22   What measures are being considered to resolve issues of classification during a crisis  wherein time sensitive information that may be essential to disaster response may not ordinarily be placed in the COP due to its classified nature                    I look forward to your responses in this important matter   Please feel free to contact Asha Mathew in Senator Collins    office at  202  224 4751 or Michael Alexander in Senator Lieberman   s office at  202  224 2627 with any questions        Sincerely           Susan M  Collins                      Joseph I  Lieberman      Chairman
