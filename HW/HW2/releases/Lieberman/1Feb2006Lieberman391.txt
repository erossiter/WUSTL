Joe Lieberman today joined a group of 27 Senators urging President Bush to support funds for home energy assistance   In a letter to the President  the senators asked him to take immediate action in supporting an additional  2 9 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  for FY 2006             Our most vulnerable citizens shouldn   t have to choose between heating their homes or going without food or medicine     said Dodd      Oil companies may be enjoying record profits but skyrocketing fuel prices are literally hitting home     and hitting home hard while LIHEAP resources have remained stagnant   That is unacceptable    It is critically important that we provide heating assistance for our most needy citizens              LIHEAP funding is a vital tool to help low income families keep warm during these cold winter months     said Lieberman     Cold temperatures in the Northeast and the steady rise in oil prices underscore the importance of acting now to get low income families the help they need to avoid having to choose between heating their homes and putting food on the table           The Text of the letter is below        February 1  2006        The President      The White House      1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW      Washington  DC 20500       Dear President Bush        High energy prices continue to threaten the health and economic well being of households across the United States  but especially low income families   No family in our nation should be forced to choose between heating their home and putting food on the table for their children   No senior citizen should have to decide between buying life saving prescriptions or paying utility bills   Unfortunately  these stark choices are a reality for too many Americans across the nation   We strongly urge you to take immediate action to help low income Americans by supporting an additional  2 92 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP  in FY 2006  and requesting  5 1 billion for LIHEAP in your FY 2007 budget request  the level authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005        The Energy Information Agency forecasts that households heating with natural gas will experience an average increase of 35 percent over last winter   Households heating with oil will see an increase of 23 percent  and households using propane can expect an increase of 17 percent   Unfortunately  energy prices do not appear to be dropping falling in the near future   In addition  wages are not keeping pace with inflation   The Real Earnings report by the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that the average hourly earnings of production and non supervisory workers on private nonfarm payrolls were lower in December 2005 than they were a year ago  after accounting for inflation   Working families are continuing to lose ground  meaning more families also need LIHEAP assistance this year   Paychecks are being stretched thinner as families face higher prices for home heating  health care  and education        Since October 5  2005  the Senate has voted four times to increase LIHEAP funding to  5 1 billion   Bipartisan amendments offered to the Department of Defense Appropriations bill  the Transportation  Treasury and HUD Appropriations bill  the Labor  Health and Human Services and Education Appropriations bill  and the Tax Reconciliation bill received a majority of the Senate   s support   Unfortunately  these amendments were not given the opportunity for a straight up or down vote   In December  63 Senators supported a successful motion to instruct  which directed the Budget Reconciliation Conference Committee to provide  2 92 billion in additional funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006   Yet  the conference report for the Budget Reconciliation bill includes only  1 billion  with this spending designated for FY 2007   Procedural maneuvers are preventing vital assistance from reaching Americans    Your leadership on this issue will help ensure that low income families and seniors get the help they deserve from the federal government          We respectfully request that you support supplemental funding for LIHEAP in FY 2006  and full funding for the program in FY2007 at its authorized level of  5 1 billion   We also urge that these resources be allocated in such a way that they will benefit all states and ensure they receive this necessary assistance promptly   American families and seniors have been waiting too long for relief from high energy costs   Thank you for your consideration for this essential request         30
