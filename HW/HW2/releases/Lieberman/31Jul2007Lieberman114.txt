

views on the war in Iraq  we know how difficult it is to find consensus on this war  But there is one thing that should unite us all     our commitment to taking care of the physical and mental health needs of our service members     Right now  the military s mental health care system is blinking red     Each month  about 40 service members are evacuated from combat in Iraq because they suffer from severe mental health problems  The Defense Department has called post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injury the  signature injuries  of the current conflict  It is estimated that one in every six returning service members suffers from PTSD  and one in every 10 has a TBI     Yet  according to a groundbreaking new study by the congressionally established Defense Task Force on Mental Health  the military health system  lacks the fiscal resources and the full trained personnel to fulfill its mission to support psychological health      A recent series of news articles has illuminated these deficiencies in the military health system and the depth to which psychological wounds have impacted our service members     Right now  there are no standard protocols in place for providing mental health treatment to all who need it  Mental health providers are in short supply     the Army has only 60 percent of the number of active duty psychologists it says it needs  And at Fort Carson  Colo   mental health providers are so overburdened that they are only able to offer  on average  one 30  to 40 minute PTSD counseling session per month to each service member     As a result of these problems  many service members are slipping through the cracks and not receiving the care they need  Short of therapists  the military health system has been reduced to dispensing psychotropic medications rather than delivering meaningful therapy     The co chairs of the Defense Task Force on Mental Health told us the week of July 9 that sweeping changes are needed in the military s mental health system  We need to invest in mental health care providers and infrastructure  offer better access to services for our military families  and educate and train our forces     particularly those in leadership positions     to immediately recognize and address mental health issues     Above all  the task force stressed the importance of dispelling the stigma associated with mental health issues  As Adm  Donald Arthur  Navy surgeon general and co chair of the task force  has said   Physical health and psychological health are equally important  If you break your leg  it s not your fault  If you get cancer  it s not your fault  If you have combat stress  it s not your fault      We must act to fix the urgent problems facing our military  The Senate Armed Services Committee recently passed the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act to help address the shortage of mental health professionals and to establish Centers of Excellence in PTSD and TBI that will provide comprehensive research on these injuries  We must implement it     When our service members suffer from untreated mental health issues  the entire military suffers  Deploying troops with mental health disorders poses a risk to the troops themselves and to the safety of their units  Leaving mental health conditions untreated back home can result in erratic behavior  substance abuse  divorce and even suicide     We have already lost more than 4 000 of America s brave sons and daughters in Iraq and Afghanistan  We shouldn t lose one more to mental illness when we can prevent it     The health and mental well being of our service members are vital to the effectiveness and long term stability of our military and to the families and communities across our country from which our servicemen and women come     Our troops put their lives on the line for our nation  we must fulfill our duty to provide them with the support they need to recover from mental health problems and
