make sense          WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT   a senior member of the Senate Environment   Public Works Committee  today made the following opening statement at the full Committee hearing on the Bush Administration   s    Clear Skies Act of 2005           Joseph I  Lieberman      Opening Statement  as prepared for delivery       Environment and Public Works Committee      Full Committee Hearing on the Clear Skies Act of 2005       Wednesday  February 2  2005          Thank you Mr  Chairman  for convening this hearing to discuss multi pollutant legislation  which is so important to the health and well being of the American people           I know we all agree there is certainly a need for clear and unambiguous Clean Air legislation to protect the quality of the air we breathe   It makes sense because it protects the health of our citizens   It makes sense because it gives business a clear set of rules to live by   And it makes sense to do this in a manner that achieves the greatest gains at the lowest possible cost  to help our businesses compete in the global marketplace           Unfortunately  in too many ways S  131  the so called    Clear Skies    legislation  doesn   t make sense             It damages the tools of the Clean Air Act that have worked so effectively to protect individual states   It drops the requirements that EPA update its standards on a regular basis   It ends requirements that best pollution control technology be employed in new facilities   It permits some industries to    opt in    to Clear Skies provisions that may be weaker than current Clean Air Act protections             It enacts SO2 and NOx provisions that are too weak  It does virtually nothing to reduce mercury pollution for more than a decade  And Clear Skies does nothing to address carbon dioxide emissions and global warming  wasting an opportunity to deal with all pollutants at once     and give industry the certainty they need now to tackle pollutants in a clear and cost effective manner           The Administration has been telling us that Clear Skies gives states the    tools they need    to combat air pollution   They say that it protects states rights by permitting them to set stricter standards within their own borders   But what they don   t mention is that what Clear Skies takes away are the useful tools that states already have under current law to fight pollution that comes from outside their borders  from another state upwind           In Connecticut  we often suffer from ozone smog caused by NOX emissions   Asthmatic children and adults in our state have attacks triggered by ozone and by the fine particles formed from SO2   Parents who have children come to them in the middle of the night and say three simple words        I can   t breathe      know just how frightening asthma can be   We can reduce the number of times this happens to children throughout our nation by implementing rigorous and fair pollution standards that can be met with today   s technology at an affordable cost   To think that we won   t because of Clear Skies should be reason enough to go back to the drawing board and get it right             The health effects of air pollution go beyond asthma   Each year  nationwide  these particles are also responsible for some 15 000 premature deaths    These are preventable deaths   Does Clear Skies help reduce this number   Probably   What they won   t tell you is that protections provided by the Clean Air Act     our current law     do a better job of reducing this number farther and faster             Throughout the country  many of our fish are tainted by high levels of mercury  which in the northeast is caused mostly by mercury emitted by U S  based power plants   There should be no debate that mercury  SO2  and NOx must be reduced decisively and quickly           What about carbon dioxide   The legislation before us does nothing  absolutely nothing  to begin to address CO2 emissions   Why   Many in industry have told us that it would be far more cost effective to factor CO2 requirements into their planning at the same time that they are making changes to control for SO2  NOx  and mercury            CO2 concentrations have been rising due to emissions from power plants  cars and other manmade sources   We have now reached the point where further study without action is both dangerous and costly  There is scientific consensus that global warming is a real and potentially disastrous phenomenon   The rest of the developed world is already taking steps  opening up market opportunities through development of new technologies and new trading markets while the U S  stands behind and does nothing   Our businesses that compete in an international marketplace are facing carbon regulation overseas as we speak             Shame on us if 100 or 200 years from now our grandchildren and great grandchildren are living on a planet that has been irreparably damaged by global warming  and they ask     How could those who came before us  who saw this coming  have let this happen                Clear Skies falls far short of what is needed  what is achievable  what is cost effective and what makes good common sense   Some say be realistic   The choice is between the Administration   s Clear Skies or nothing   If that is the choice  I choose nothing   But there are better choices  including the Clean Power Act that Senator Jeffords  Senator Collins and I and many others have introduced   Or there may be some  third alternative   The fact is we can do better than Clear Skies and we must             30
