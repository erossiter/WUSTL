Connecticut military personnel and defense industry       WASHINGTON   Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman today voiced their support for numerous provisions of a  440 2 billion Department of Defense appropriations measure that combines support for military personnel and investments in improved defense technology   The measure was approved today by the Senate Appropriations Committee and may go to the Senate floor as soon as this week            We already know that our soldiers  sailors  airmen and marines are the finest in the world   This funding will continue to ensure that they have the tools they need to meet the challenges of the 21st century   Connecticut   s many contributions are second to none and this bill recognizes the important role our state plays in outfitting our nation   s military     said Dodd      And though this measure may not be perfect  it will help assure that our servicemen and women have the military muscle to prevail in any conflict while also making the necessary investments in research and technology so our military continues to adapt and improve as technology allows             Our military s greatest successes have occurred when it has adapted to new times  new technologies  and new ways of thinking  planning and fighting   Lieberman said    This defense budget moves our military forward by investing in improvements for the weapons that have performed so well so far   It also enables us to better meet the new threats we face by targeting funds to ongoing programs that will accelerate the transformation of our military on land  in the air  and on and under the sea   I am proud that this budget continues to recognize the tremendous contribution that Connecticut companies and the outstanding workers who make these systems provide to keeping our country safe         The bill bolsters federal funding for military personnel housing  training and compensation as well as provides strong support for several weapons systems
