Manufacturing Extension Partnership in FY    06 budget       WASHINGTON  D C    Senators Chris Dodd and Joe Lieberman  a Co Chair of the Senate Task Force on Manufacturing  joined 43 Senate colleagues

million for the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP  in the Fiscal Year  FY  2006 federal budget             Supporting MEP is pro growth  pro manufacturing and will improve the climate for

profit centers in over 400 locations nationwide  including CONNSTEP in Connecticut  whose sole purpose is to provide small and medium sized manufacturers with the help they need in implementing the most advanced manufacturing technologies and processes to succeed as we compete with low wage countries such as China  The centers  serving all 50 states and Puerto Rico  are linked together through the Department of Commerce s National Institute of Standards and Technology  NIST         Centers are funded by federal  state  local and private resources to serve manufacturers  That makes it possible for even the smallest firms to tap into the expertise of MEP s knowledgeable manufacturing and business specialists throughout the United States         The full text of the letter is below        March 1  2005        The Honorable Judd Gregg  Chairman            The Honorable Kent Conrad  Ranking Member      Committee on the Budget       United States Senate      Washington  DC 20510       Dear Chairman Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad        Manufacturing has long been one of this country   s greatest economic strengths   One of the factors that have helped small and medium manufacturers compete in the global marketplace is the Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP    As the Committee prepares the budget resolution  we respectfully urge you to include  112 million in funds for the MEP for fiscal year 2006        Supporting MEP is pro growth  pro manufacturing and will improve the climate for keeping manufacturing jobs in the United States   By improving America s small and medium manufacturers    productivity  MEP significantly contributes to job growth and expansion of our economy   Without adequate funding  MEP   s ability to assist small and medium manufacturers across the country will be severely hampered           MEP is a cost effective  public private partnership   Those utilizing the expertise offered by the program experience productivity increases four times greater than comparable non MEP clients   In fiscal year 2004  the MEP   s clients reported sales of  4 12 billion  50 315 new or retained workers   686 million in cost savings  and  912 million invested in new plant and equipment as a direct result of their MEP projects        Manufacturing is a major engine for growth in our economy  producing 13 percent of GDP and 89 percent of export revenue   Small and medium manufacturers comprise about 97 percent of all manufacturing firms and employ about half of all manufacturing employees   They account for  3 8 trillion per year in manufacturing receipts and pay their workers 22 percent more than other small businesses          Without strong federal support  MEP will not be able to maintain its mission of serving American manufacturers and its benefits will be lost to our economy   At a time when economic recovery  supply chain reliability for consumer and defense goods  and global competitiveness are national priorities  MEP is a truly wise investment   We believe that MEP is a reasonable priority that fits within a fiscally responsible budget  and we urge you to include  112 million to fully fund MEP in the fiscal 2006 budget resolution            30
