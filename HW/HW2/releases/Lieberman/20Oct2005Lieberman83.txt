                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday delivered the following statement at a committee hearing entitled  Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans  A Flooded City  A Chaotic Response         Marty Bahamonde was the first and  for too long  just about the only FEMA employee on the ground in New Orleans  He arrived before Hurricane Katrina hit and rode out the storm in the city   s emergency operations center and ended up being one of the very small group of FEMA workers in New Orleans for a full three days after the storm         During that time  Mr  Bahamonde offered invaluable first hand information to his FEMA superiors  and was of great help to the thousands of people trapped in inhumane conditions at the Superdome         I consider Marty Bahamonde   s actions in New Orleans to be heroic  but the jolting fact is that he was an accidental hero  He is not a member of a FEMA Emergency Response Team  a FEMA Disaster Medical Assistance Team  or a FEMA Operations group of any kind  Marty Bahamonde is a FEMA Public Affairs Officer sent to New Orleans to advance former FEMA Director Michael Brown   s expected trip there  and to provide information to Mr  Brown about what was happening in New Orleans         Mr  Bahamonde   s story is powerful and moving  and I will leave it to him to tell it  But his story is also deeply troubling in fact  ultimately infuriating  and raises serious questions which our committee   s investigation must answer         Why  after the National Weather Service so clearly predicted on Friday  August 26  that Katrina would be a Hurricane of Category 4 or 5  the big one long feared and likely to drown New Orleans  could FEMA manage to get a Public Affairs Officer into New Orleans the next day  Saturday  but took until Tuesday morning to send a single Disaster Medical Assistance Team  and until Tuesday afternoon for a small four person FEMA Emergency Response Team to arrive  So  a FEMA Public Affairs Officer  makes it in on Saturday  but the DMAT and ERTs didn   t make it until Tuesday  That is unbelievable and unacceptable         In light of the fact that Mr  Bahamonde began sending reports to his superiors on Sunday of swelling crowds and significant humanitarian needs at the Superdome  why did FEMA send so few medical assistance and emergency response personnel to the scene         In Mr  Bahamonde   s testimony this morning  we will hear that on Monday  August 29  the day Katrina hit landfall  he reported to FEMA first in late morning emails  then later in the day in phone conversations including one directly with Michael Brown  that some levees around New Orleans had broken and that 80 percent of the city was underwater  Why then have Secretary Chertoff  as recently as yesterday before a House Committee  and Secretary Rumsfeld and General Myers said the levees were not breached until Tuesday or at least they did not learn of the levees failing until Tuesday         We will hear this morning from Mr  Bahamonde that he told everyone he possibly could up to Michael Brown  that the levees broke early Monday  and New Orleans was drowning  and yet Secretaries Chertoff and Rumsfeld and General Myers say they didn   t know until Tuesday  How could that be         This disconnect between what Marty Bahamonde saw and will say this morning  and what Secretaries Chertoff and Rumsfeld have said is beyond disturbing  It is shocking  Our investigation must find out what happened to Mr  Bahamonde   s reports from New Orleans  Who received them in the Administration and what did they do with them  Does the answer to these questions help explain the painfully slow response of DHS  FEMA  and DoD to Hurricane Katrina and the human suffering in New Orleans         Those are critical questions our investigation must answer         The testimony we will soon here from Marty Bahamonde will leave us better informed  but  I believe  also much more troubled by how the federal government responded to Hurricane Katrina         I thank you Mr  Bahamonde for your dedicated work before  during  and after Hurricane Katrina hit land  and for your important testimony this morning  And I promise you that this committee will do everything we can to make sure that nothing like the chaos and suffering you witnessed and tried so hard to stop in New Orleans will ever happen in America again
