Victims                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON     As part of a Democratic leadership legislative package to help bring relief to Hurricane Katrina victims  Senator Joe Lieberman Friday offered a series of financial proposals to help get the victims back on their feet       As the recovery efforts continue in and around New Orleans and at scores of remote evacuation sites  Katrina victims must begin picking up the pieces of their lives on the way to resuming normalcy           Mr  President  I rise today to offer this amendment to make sure that families already devastated by Hurricane Katrina aren   t pummeled financially as well     Lieberman said     With hundreds of thousands of people washed out of their homes and forced out of work  our government must do everything it can to ease their burden so they can rebuild their lives on whatever they salvaged from the storm          The first step in rebuilding for most of these people will be getting back on firm financial footing again  This amendment will do exactly that          Lieberman   s amendment to the Commerce  Justice  State Appropriations bill includes the following provisions          Waiver of caps and cost sharing under the Stafford Act Individuals and Households Program   IHP grants provide aid to those whose needs cannot be met through insurance or other assistance  These grants provide assistance for home repair  rent  temporary housing  or home replacement housing and can also address other needs such as medical  dental  and funeral expenses Grants may not exceed  26 200 per individual or household   Lieberman   s provision would authorize the President to waive that cap  and would waive other caps on the amount that could be spent on home repair or home replacement  The provision would also waive a 25  state contribution now required for some grants                   Temporary Reinstatement of the Mortgage and Rental Payments Program  This provision reinstates the Mortgage and Rental Program  MRA  for the affected states   In years past  FEMA administered MRA  which covers rent or mortgage payments for those suffering financial hardship as a result of a major disaster  MRA was eliminated in the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000 because FEMA said the program was hard to administer  although it was temporarily reinstated after 9 11                   Moratorium on Student Loans and Other Payments   Anyone affected by Hurricane Katrina who has a federal loan will be granted a six month moratorium during which they will not be penalized if they fail to make payments   This applies to federal student loans  small business loans  or other loan made  subsidized  or guaranteed by the federal government  The President would be authorized to extend the moratorium for up to six months                 Ease Bankruptcy Provisions   Many of the survivors of Katrina will face ongoing financial difficulties  The amendment would make it easier for those devastated by the hurricane to seek protection under bankruptcy laws  Without this provision  many Katrina victims could wind up with damaged credit ratings and burdensome debt                 Feed the Victims   The amendment would provide additional funding to purchase and distribute food for Katrina victims and suspend some requirements  such as requiring a temporarily displaced victim to show that he is looking for a job in order to qualify for food relief   Benefits would be guaranteed for six months and automatically extended for six more months unless the President determines they are unnecessary                 Extend and Expand Unemployment Insurance for Victims   Early estimates suggest that between 500 000 and one million workers will be left jobless by Hurricane Katrina   The jobless rate in the Gulf Coast region is expected to increase to 25 percent or higher   The amendment would extend the deadline for Disaster Unemployment Assistance from 30 days to 90 days and extend program eligibility for individuals who would otherwise be eligible for state unemployment insurance   The maximum duration of benefits would be extended from 26 to 52 weeks and a standard minimum benefit level would be created                 Relief for Withdrawals from Retirement Plans   The amendment would allow those who have suffered losses as a result of Hurricane Katrina to access qualified retirement funds for a period without tax or penalty  Amounts not repaid after five years would be subject to income tax  Tax payments and tax return filing would be suspended for at least six months  and up to a year  unless the President certified the additional time is not necessary       30
