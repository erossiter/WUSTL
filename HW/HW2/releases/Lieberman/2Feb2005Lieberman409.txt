                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON     The following statement was prepared for delivery for Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   for the nomination hearing of Michael Chertoff to be Secretary of Homeland Security       Thank you  Madame Chairman  and welcome Judge Chertoff   We   re honored to have you before us today as we consider your nomination to lead the Department of Homeland Security   If you are confirmed  yours will be one of the most difficult jobs Washington has to offer     not only for the awesome responsibility you will have safeguarding the American people from terrorist attack but also because of the Herculean effort that must be exerted to make the Department a real success       Since it was created two years ago  the Department of Homeland Security has become a central player in improving the nation   s security here  at home  Secretary Ridge deserves credit for beginning this transformation   Yet  as you know   and as we heard again last week from a panel of experts    significant challenges await the next Secretary  ranging from the development of a clear strategic vision to improving the Department   s day to day operations   We knew the largest government reorganization in half a century would be a monumental task   Secretary Ridge has worked to pull together the many disparate pieces of 22 agencies and programs and 180 000 employees  often at times with what seemed like benign neglect from the Administration  Understandably  the Department is still struggling to find its footing  and we have a significant way to go before an array of security gaps are sewn up        The lack of a focused  long term strategy after two years is a serious disappointment  I don   t see how any organization     much less one as large and unwieldy as the Department of Homeland Security     can succeed without one   Given the importance of the Department   s mission  I would urge you to develop an updated strategy immediately that defines the Department   s priorities and clarifies its roles and responsibilities  as well as those of other key partners in our shared security   In order to do this properly  you will have to consult with others in the Administration   at Defense  Health and Human Services  and Justice     to ensure that there is an integrated and overarching homeland security strategy   I know you have expressed sympathy with the call for an Under Secretary for Policy and Planning to perform the kind of long range thinking within DHS that has been in such short supply   I look forward to hearing more about your thoughts on that matter       If confirmed  you and your key deputies will need certain basic tools to succeed  The Secretary and the Deputy Secretary of the Department  for example  must have adequate staff to manage 180 000 employees     and the testimony we heard from experts last week strongly suggests that is not now the case   DHS employees must also be adequately trained to perform new and more complex tasks than they performed before the Department was created         The Department must also step up its efforts to eliminate persistent vulnerabilities at our borders and ports  within our rail and transit systems  and at the nation   s core energy  telecommunications  water  transportation  and financial networks   The Coast Guard is in dire need of a modern fleet   And the Administration absolutely must do more to prepare the nation for a possible bioterror attack which could put millions of citizens at risk  Somehow  we need to regain the sense of urgency that propelled us following the September 11 attacks   And we must do a better job of enlisting the private sector as a necessary partner in our shared security        We know  for example  that an attack on a chemical facility could put the lives of hundreds of thousands of our fellow citizens at risk  on a scale even larger than 9 11   We know that al Qaeda has examined information about U S  chemical facilities   Yet  according to Richard Falkenrath  who served as deputy homeland security adviser to the President  we have done essentially nothing to reduce the inherent insecurity of our chemical sector       To return to a familiar refrain  we must also invest in the Department if it is to pay off in greater security   We know the funding realities and we know it is impossible to protect every potential terrorist target   But we should not deny our first responders   who risk their lives for the rest of us   the training and equipment they need  especially interoperable communications equipment  to protect our communities   Unfortunately  the Administration proposed significant cuts  government wide  for first responders last year   I hope  if confirmed  you will reverse this trend        There is much to be done  and it will be a daunting task to change a fraction of what needs to change  I believe focused leadership  skilled management  and sufficient resources  however  will help master these problems   And I appreciate your willingness to take on the challenge       Judge Chertoff  you have an impressive record and have served your country with distinction  A number of questions have been raised  however  about your role in the administration   s prosecution of the war on terror  most recently with regard to advice you provided regarding the laws prohibiting torture while you were head of the Justice Department   s Criminal Division   You discussed that issue with committee staff extensively on Monday   Today  I   d like to have you discuss these issues under oath and publicly before the committee       I look forward to working with you  and hope you agree that we must work together  with a renewed sense of urgency to keep the country safe         Madam Chairman  thank you again for your bold leadership in the arena of homeland security         30
