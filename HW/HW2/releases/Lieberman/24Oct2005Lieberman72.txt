courtesy of NPR       Transcript       Analysis  Mixing politics and faith in the White House      NEAL CONAN  host       You re listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News       Senator Joseph Lieberman joins us now from the Senate Radio Studio on Capitol  Hill   His Orthodox Jewish faith became quite public when he was the vice  presidential running mate with Al Gore in the year 2000   He later ran for the  Democratic nomination in 2004   Senator Lieberman  always nice to have you  with us on the program       Senator JOSEPH LIEBERMAN  Democratic  Connecticut    Neal  good to be with you again   Thank you       CONAN   Your religion was no obstacle to those nominations  in some respects   regarded as an asset as the vice presidential nod   What do you think it says  about how attitudes toward a politician s personal faith have changed over the  years       Sen  LIEBERMAN   Well  it s a very important question  and you re absolutely  right  and I ll focus in on 2000  because it was a clearer and more intense  example of breakthrough   I mean  I was the first Jewish American honored to  be on a national ticket   In the first week or so of the campaign  there was a  great focus on that fact and on my religion  on the nature of my observance   but  and even  frankly  on the darker side   On the Internet  there was some  anti Semitism  but it all went away   And by the end of it  no one was focused  very much on my religion  and that s the way I wanted it to be   I didn t want  to get votes or lose votes because of my religion       But let me answer your question  because I think it s an interesting point   The hero  the inspiring hero of my political life was John F  Kennedy  Roman  Catholic from Massachusetts   I was 18 years old in 1960   Part of the appeal  that Senator Kennedy  then Senator Kennedy had to me was  obviously  because  he was young  he was progressive  etc   But part of it  I m sure  was that he  was Catholic and  in that sense  a member of a minority group   When he  succeeded  I think it said to me  not that I was planning a political career  then  but that America was really an open country   But President Kennedy   during that campaign  had to distance himself in some sense  not from his  religion but from the effect it might have on him   I didn t feel any pressure  of that kind in 2000   I think it measures some distance that the country came  in that time   I mean  obviously  my first responsibility         CONAN   Well         Sen  LIEBERMAN      as a senator  and if I had been able to take office as  vice president  would be the Constitution  the interests of the country   but my         CONAN   Well  maybe one reason for that is the Jewish faith is not organized  in a hierarchy like the Roman Catholic Church and doesn t issue  pronunciamentos on public policy the way the Vatican sometimes does       Sen  LIEBERMAN   Well  there s probably something to that   Maybe I should  take the old Will Rogers line about the Democratic Party    I belong to no  organized political party   I m a Democrat   and apply it to my own faith   But there is certainly precedent  if I can use a judicial term  in Judaism   but you re absolutely right  that that probably was a factor   But I do think  there s something else to be said  which is that President Kennedy broke a  barrier  and I think over time  the country has become more accepting and  tolerant of all faiths  and I  you know  I don t want to re litigate the  results of the much disputed 2000 election  if I make this comment  that it  does say something that Al Gore and I got a half a million more votes  and by  that I mean to say  it says to me that certainly the American people weren t  turned off because  for the first time  somebody Jewish ran for a national  office       CONAN   We re talking about the different roles of religion and politics   You re talking  you re listening to TALK OF THE NATION from NPR News       And  Senator Lieberman  since we ve asked everybody else about this  President  Bush brought this  this comes up in a lot of the different policy distinctions  from  everything from intelligent design to school vouchers to a lot of other  things  but         Sen  LIEBERMAN   Sure       CONAN      he mentioned that Harriet Miers  faith was one of the reasons that  he decided to pick her to fill Sandra Day O Connor s seat on the Supreme  Court   Was that appropriate  do you think       Sen  LIEBERMAN   My reaction to that is fair enough  because I do think that  certainly  the president  as the nom  given the authority to nominate a  justice to the Supreme Court  has a right to include among the factors that  give him confidence about the kind of justice this person would be  whether  she is religious  obviously  one hopes that he also considered her legal  exp  I m sure he did  her legal experience  etc   etc   But when she gets into  this job  the question obviously is how will she interpret the Constitution   Because that s got to be her number one responsibility       CONAN   Let s get another caller on the line   This is Plummer ph    Plummer  calling us from Laurel in Maryland       PLUMMER  Caller    Hi   Thank you for taking my call       CONAN   Sure       PLUMMER   I just wanted to make the comment that really  we live by the  choices that we make   Faith is a choice   Several years ago  I was  bi vocational I was the assistant pastor of a church  and I worked for a huge  advertising outfit   And one of my biggest  largest accounts at the time  I  was a commission salesperson  was a strip joint       CONAN   Hmm       PLUMMER   Yeah   And I had to make the decision   Do I go ahead and pursue  this because it was easy money  you know   They d renew  you know  without  even me having to do any of a sales thing  but I went and spoke to my boss   I  said   I can t do this because this is where I stand    And  you know   fortunately  my boss said   OK  that s fine  we ll just give this  you know   account to someone else    And life went on   And  you know  I just wanted to  make that comment that  you know  it s  our faith is about the choices that we  make  period   You know  if you choose to stand by your faith and what you  believe  then that s what you choose to   If you choose to compromise  then  there s a problem       CONAN   Well  I wonder  and thank you very much for the call  Plummer   Senator Lieberman  politicians don t always have that luxury   Again  you have  the case of a Catholic running for governor in the state of Virginia who says  though he is opposed to the death penalty  if elected governor  he would  enforce the law of the state of Virginia   You ve had Catholic governors of  various states  including New York  who said   Yes  my faith is opposed to  abortion  but that s the law of the state of New York  and I m going to uphold  it        Sen  LIEBERMAN   Correct   Correct   Well  first of all  I admire the caller   Secondly  I think that most people in public life  and I ll speak of myself   I ve found that if you re honest about who you are  people respect that  even  if who you are may involve some religious practices that are different from  the ones that they have   But ultimately  I come back to what I said earlier   When you re in public office  your responsibility cannot primarily be to your  faith or the doctrines of it   It has to be to the Constitution  to the  interests of the country   So  you know  you point to some very difficult  positions that people like the Democrat  Tim Kaine  lieutenant governor of  Virginia  now running for governor against the death penalty  but has said  that he would enforce it if he was governor       Look  John Roberts  now the chief justice of the Supreme Court  was asked over  and over again in individual meetings with senators and at the Judiciary  Committee hearings  he is a devout Catholic  presumably  personally opposed  abortion  and the question was   Would that personal opinion in any way make  it impossible or difficult for you to carry out and respect the precedence of  the court  including the Roe vs  Wade and Casey cases   And he said   No    And I think that s the appropriate balance       CONAN   We just have a minute or so left with you  and this may be not  answerable in that amount of time  but I wanted to ask you  the president of  the United States has said that he has a personal relationship with God as  well   That makes many people uncomfortable   Does it make you feel more  positive about whoever it is who holds that job  taking the personality and  the politics of this particular president out of it  or would it make  you  would it trouble you       Sen  LIEBERMAN   That s a hard one to answer in a minute   I mean  I guess I d  have to hear it directly from the president  and I haven t   I think a lot of  people in this country feel that they have what might be called a personal  relationship with God in the sense that their belief in God is very deep and  personal  their prayers are very genuine and personal   I don t know that  I  certainly don t believe that I get messages from the Almighty on a regular  basis about what I should do   This goes back to the great old Lincoln quote   which is that Lincoln said that he didn t want proclaim that God was on his  side  he wanted to act in a way that it would make it clear that he was on  God s side   And I think that s the goal and the ideal that we should all  strive for       CONAN   Senator Lieberman  we thank you for your time today       Sen  LIEBERMAN   Thank you  Neal       CONAN   Joseph Lieberman  Democrat from Connecticut  joined us from the Senate  Radio Studios on Capitol Hill
