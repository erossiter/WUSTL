Repealing Terrorist Safeguards Enacted Upon Recommendation of 9 11 Commission                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   said Wednesday the REAL ID Act would repeal safeguards against terrorism that were included in last year   s Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act and should be kept out of the conference report for the supplemental spending bill       The REAL ID Act   authored by Rep  James Sensenbrenner  R Wisc   and containing provisions rejected by Congress last year   would repeal provisions recommended by the 9 11 Commission to ensure that people who apply for drivers    licenses are actually who they say they are  The REAL ID Act would instead impose unrealistic and unfunded requirements on states to verify identification documents  slowing down the issuance of drivers    licenses to everyone   In addition  it includes anti immigration and anti asylum provisions which the 9 11 Commission has said are unrelated to the war on terrorism          Do not be fooled     Lieberman said in a statement submitted for the Congressional record      Our nation is safer if we implement the protections we passed just last December   We must not allow an ideological debate over immigration policy to derail initiatives vital to the war against terrorism          The REAL ID Act is included in the House  but not the Senate  version of the supplemental spending bill which includes additional funding for the war in Iraq and for tsunami victims        Following is text of Senator Lieberman   s floor statement       I rise to speak in opposition to the House legislation known as the REAL ID Act  and to urge that it not be included in the conference report for this spending bill   Last year Congress enacted comprehensive anti terrorism legislation  the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act  which implemented the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   Some of the most important provisions we enacted strengthen our borders against terrorist infiltration  and provide the government with new weapons in tracking terrorist travel around the globe   The Act also requires minimum federal standards to ensure that state issued drivers    licenses are always secure and reliable forms of identification        The REAL ID Act would repeal much of our work from last year  and replace it with provisions that impose on state governments unworkable standards for drivers    licenses   The REAL ID Act also includes punitive immigration provisions that we rejected last year  and that have no place on an emergency spending bill   Do not be fooled   Our nation is safer if we implement the protections we passed just last December   We must not allow an ideological debate over immigration policy to derail initiatives vital to the war against terrorism        Last year I was privileged to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle and in both chambers to develop anti terrorism and intelligence reform legislation that we can all be proud of   Among other things  the Intelligence Reform Act called for large increases in the numbers of Border Patrol agents  immigration enforcement agents  and detention beds   It strengthened consular procedures for screening visa applicants   It closed a gaping vulnerability by requiring people entering the United States at our land borders to show a passport   And it required minimum federal standards to ensure that state issued drivers    licenses are always secure and reliable forms of identification                        At the same time  I joined with my fellow conferees to ensure that the Intelligence Reform bill focused on genuine anti terrorism measures and excluded extraneous measures   In particular  in conference we rejected a number of anti asylum and anti immigration provisions   The REAL ID Act simply recycles several of the controversial immigration provisions which we rejected last year   When the REAL ID Act was debated on the House floor this year many of its supporters claimed that these provisions had been recommended by the 9 11 Commission  and are essential to the war on terrorism   That is simply not the case       Last October  the 9 11 Commissioners made clear that the immigration provisions in the House bill were irrelevant to fighting terrorism   I would like to quote from a letter the conferees received from Governor Thomas Kean and Congressman Lee Hamilton  a letter that reflected the unanimous view of the Commissioners   Referring to the House provisions on immigration  they said  and I quote     We believe strongly that this bill is not the right occasion for tackling controversial immigration and law enforcement issues that go well beyond the Commission   s recommendations   We note in this regard that some of these provisions have been advocated in response to Commission recommendations   They are not Commission recommendations      The Commissioners then added  and I quote again     We believe we are better off with broad bipartisan agreement on key recommendations of the Commission in support of border security than taking up a number of controversial provisions that are more central to the question of immigration policy than they are to the question of counterterrorism          As the Commissioners made clear  the provisions in the REAL ID Act have more to do with immigration than with national security   These are controversial provisions that need to be fully considered by our Judiciary Committee   The legislation would make it harder for refugees fleeing oppressive regimes to get asylum   That provision doesn   t target terrorists because current law already states that no member of a terrorist organization can be eligible for asylum   The REAL ID Act would suspend habeas corpus review in deportation proceedings   Not since the Civil War has habeas corpus been suspended   The House bill would allow the Department of Homeland Security to waive all laws so that fences and barriers can be built on any of our land borders   There is no limitation as to what laws can be waived     environmental laws  labor laws  laws allowing property owners to be compensated for the confiscation of their land   These provisions have serious negative consequences and should be more carefully considered   I do not believe they could ever be enacted if they were carefully considered with our normal procedures       I would also like to address the provisions in the REAL ID Act that would establish new federal standards for drivers    licenses   My colleagues no doubt remember that just last December Congress enacted standards for drivers    licenses  as recommended by the 9 11 Commission  to ensure drivers    licenses are secure and identities are verified   The standards are now being implemented through a rulemaking  in which state governments are given a seat at the table to share their expertise   These legislative standards were a great accomplishment  a result of fine work done by Senators McCain  Durbin  Collins  Alexander and other colleagues   Last year the Administration declared that the Senate   s provisions were preferable to those drafted by the House  and the 9 11 Commission endorsed them       The REAL ID Act would repeal the work Congress did last year   It would replace our provisions with much more rigid provisions from last year   s House bill   The provisions are so unrealistic that states could not implement them   All Americans applying for drivers    licenses would have to wait for weeks while state DMVs tried to confirm the authenticity of paper birth certificates and other records  records filed away at county offices across the country   State governments would have no opportunity to provide input for the regulations  as they have under current law       That   s why the state government organizations think the REAL ID Act is a terrible idea   The National Governors    Association  the National Conference of State Legislatures  the Council of State Governments  and the American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators have all announced their strong opposition to the REAL ID Act   The organizations have written to Congressional leadership that the REAL ID Act would impose requirements on state governments which  and I quote     are beyond the current capacity of even the federal government      The state government groups have asked that the law we passed last December be given a chance to work   I ask unanimous consent that a joint letter from these four organizations be entered into the Congressional Record following the conclusion of my remarks         When the state governments of our nation say that these drivers    license provisions are unworkable  we need to take notice   State governments have been issuing drivers    licenses for decades   They are the experts  and we will need their input and coordination if we are going to implement the drivers    license standards recommended by the 9 11 Commission         I urge my colleagues to oppose the REAL ID Act   We must ask our Senate conferees not to allow such a controversial measure to be pushed through Congress on an emergency spending bill   The REAL ID Act contradicts our historic identity as a nation that provides haven for the oppressed   The REAL ID Act would not make us safer   It would make us less safe   It would repeal provisions enacting a central recommendation of the 9 11 Commission  and it would undermine a vital counterterrorism initiative       I yield the floor       30
