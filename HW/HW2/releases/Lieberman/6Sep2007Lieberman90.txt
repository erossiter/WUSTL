following statement on the floor of the United States Senate   Mr  President  I rise to offer a bipartisan amendmenttogether with Senator Brownback and Senator Kylto restore the  75 million requested by the Bush administration to support democracy in Iran  Mr  President  no government poses a greater threat to the United States than the Islamic Republic of Iran   We are all aware of the belligerent international behavior of the Iranian regime  its efforts to develop nuclear weapons  its use of Islamist terrorist groups like Hamas  Hezbollah  and the Taliban to undermine moderate governments across the greater Middle East  its designation by the U S  Department of State as the number one state sponsor of terror  and of course its escalating proxy war against us in Iraq  where the Iranian Revolutionary Guard has been training  arming  equipping  and directing terrorists who are responsible in turn for the murder of hundreds of American soldiers   What is less appreciated  Mr  President  is that Irans extremist behavior abroad is matched by equally extremist behavior at home  Just as the Iranian regime has been supporting the forces of repression and terror against the people of Lebanon and Palestine and Iraq and Afghanistan  it is also been escalating a campaign of repression and terror against its own citizensagainst the people of Iran   As the New York Times reported yesterday  the Iranian government has  in recent months  arrested prominent intellectuals  suppressed the Iranian student movement  rolled back social freedoms  purged university faculties   and  closed newspapers   This assault on Iranian civil society has also been well documented by the most prominent international human rights NGOs  Amnesty International  for instance  reports that  in recent months  the Iranian authorities have been carrying out a widespread crackdown on civil society  targeting academics  womens rights activists  students  journalists and labor organizers   Mr  President  dissidents and democrats in Iran today are under attack and under siege by their own government  The question now before this Congress is whether we will stand with them in solidarity  or whether we will turn our heads and hearts away   This amendment provides  75 million in funds that will go to help these labor activists and womens groups and journalists and human rights NGOs and other members of Iranian civil society  It provides this Congress an opportunity to demonstrate that  even as we condemn the behavior of the Iranian regime  we stand with the Iranian people  a gifted people with a proud history   The alternative path before this Congress is to cut the Administrations request by two thirds  as the Subcommittee has proposed to do  At this level of funding  existing programs will not only be unable to expand  They will actually be cut back  In other words  at just the moment when the Iranian government is engaged in an unprecedented rollback of human rights and political freedoms  the American government will be rolling back its own programs to help defend those rights and freedoms   Why would we do this   The Report language says that while the Committee supports the goals of promoting democracy in Iran  it is particularly concerned that grantees suspected of receiving U S  assistance have been harassed and arrested by the Government of Iran for their pro democracy activities   In other words  we should give less help to dissidents in Iran because our help in turn may lead to their harassment by the totalitarian government of Iran   Mr  President  I respectfully question the logic of this argument   I ask my colleagues  Do we give less to democracy advocates in Myanmar or Zimbabwe or Belarus when they are being harassed by the regime  On the contrary  it is precisely when dissidents are under attack that they need more help  not less  from the United States   I ask my colleagues  what message does it send if we cut funding for Iranian civil society because its members are under attack  It says that repression works  that the best way for dictators to deter the United States from supporting the forces of freedom is by ruthlessly attacking them  and that we will not stand with our friends in their hour of greatest need   I ask my colleagues  imagine for a moment if this Congress had applied this logic during the Cold War  Imagine if  instead of providing moral and material support to dissidents behind the Iron Curtain  we instead embraced the specious argument that our support would only invite further repression by their Communist tyrants who repressed them   Fortunately  we did not do this  We recognized then that dictators imprison and attack dissidents and democrats not because America supports them  but because dictators fear and hate them   Again  I ask my colleagues  Does anyone in this chamber seriously believe that  if we give less money to the civil society leaders in Iran that the Iranian regime will repress them any less   Some say that the Administration wont be able to spend  75 million because the Iranians dont want it  They say that the taint of association with America will scare them away   But this is an assertion that is simply not borne out by the evidence   Since the State Department began making grants eight months ago  approximately 90 percent of the FY 2006 funds have been obligated  with the remaining funds expected to be obligated by mid September  While some Iranian groups no doubt do not want our funding  it is clear that many  many others do  The need is great  beyond the  75 million requested by the Secretary of State   That should be their choice  Ours is to make the money available to those who want and need it   Others claim that  75 million is simply too much money  Even if the Iranian civil society groups are able to use it all  they ask  why should they receive so much   The answer  frankly  is that Iran holds unique importance in American foreign policy  As the Senate Leader observed just the other day  our two most dangerous enemies in the Middle East today are al Qaeda and Iran  Consequently  supporting the forces of freedom in Iran is not only a moral imperative  It is in our vital national interest to do so   There is an inextricable link between the domestic repression of the Iranian regime and its aggression abroad  As the Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov once said  A country that does not respect the rights of its own people will not respect the rights of its neighbors  There is no better proof of this than the Islamic Republic of Iran today   Conversely  just as the autocratic and extremist regime that rules Iran is a threat to us and our allies  it is also possible to imagine a democratic Iran in which the Iranian people are empowered  which could become a force for stability and peace in the region and in the world   This vision may seem far fetched to some  But we know from recent history that it is not   On the contrary  we know from history that dissidents can change history  because history is made not by abstract  inexorable forces  but by individual human beings like Vaclav Havel and Lech Walesa and Andrei Sakharov and Natan Sharansky   It was the bravery of men like these that kindled our moral imagination to see the suffering of millions more behind the Iron Curtain  And it was the leadership of men like these that inspired millions more to cast off their shackles and overthrow a cruel and dictatorial system of government that many thought would endure forever   Like the communist tyrannies of Eastern Europe  the leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran repress their people because they are frightened of them  And they know how powerful the dissidents and democrats in their midst can become   These are the dissidents and democrats to whom this money would go  These are the people in whose future freedom we should invest   The dissidents in Iran who support freedoms cause have the courage of their convictions to follow the consequences of their convictions  I pray that we do as welland that we provide them with the means to make real the hopes and dreams we share with them  of a free and modern Iran      30
