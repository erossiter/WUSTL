Lieberman  ID Conn   Monday asked the Department of Homeland Security for additional information on its recent decision to waive environmental requirements before building a section of the Southwest border fence    In a letter to Secretary Michael Chertoff  the Senator asked for details on why DHS wants to waive 19 federal statutes to build the fence through two miles of the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area  SPRNCA  along the Arizona Mexico border  He also asked for information on all actions being developed to monitor and lessen the environmental impact of building the fence  The letter concluded by asking DHS for copies of any Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements completed before the waiver decision    While developing additional layers of border security is a priority for our nation  wrote Lieberman It should not impede our ability to also continue to be good environmental stewards    A full copy of the letter can be found below     December 10  2007    The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  U S  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528    Dear Secretary Chertoff     I am writing to inquire about the Department of Homeland Security s  DHS  recent use of the waiver provision in the REAL ID Act  P L  109 13  to declare a section of fence in the San Pedro Riparian National Conservation Area  SPRNCA  along the Arizona Mexico border exempt from 19 federal laws  including the National Environmental Policy Act  NEPA   the Clean Air Act  the Endangered Species Act  and the Clean Water Act    On October 10  2007  the U S  District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order to cease construction of approximately two miles of border fence and roads in the SPRNCA  The court cited several concerns over the manner in which the Bureau of Land Management  BLM  and DHS handled the Environmental Assessment under NEPA for this area including the lack of administrative record  lack of public comment period  failure to consider the cumulative effects of the larger construction of border fences along the Southwest Border  and an apparent rush to judgment by the BLM to allow fencing in this conservation area  The decision further stated that DHS had not sufficiently explained the reasons for the urgency in building fencing in the SPRNCA  A few days after the U S  District Court s order  DHS waived several critical environmental and safety laws in order to move forward with the fence construction    While developing additional layers of border security is a priority for our nation  it should not impede our ability to also continue to be good environmental stewards  NEPA is designed to establish environmental review procedures on federal agency actions  The process NEPA dictates ensures that stakeholder input can improve government projects   protecting sites of environmental  historical and cultural value  Furthermore  the environmental regulations that were waived play a critical role protecting public welfare    In order to gain a better understanding of the Department s decision to use the waiver authority in this instance  I respectfully request that you provide the Committee with timely responses to the following questions    1  What are the criteria used by DHS to determine when it is appropriate to use the waiver provision in the REAL ID Act  P L  109 13  to pursue border fence construction     What evidence does DHS have that the section of fence in the SPRNCA meets those criteria     2  What specific evidence does the Department have that the section of the border in the SPRNCA represents a higher threat for illegal entrants than other sections of the Arizona Mexico border     3  Please describe why vehicle barriers  which have a reduced impact on wildlife movement compared to pedestrian fencing  would not be an acceptable alternative to deter illegal migration in this area     4  Why does the waiver cover almost 7 miles of fence when the judge s restraining order only applied to approximately 2 miles of fence     5  If DHS was confident that the pending case would ultimately be decided in its favor  why did it not continue to pursue the case     6  Please describe  in detail  the measures that DHS  in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service  has adopted to reduce the impact of the fence in the SPRNCA on the ability of wildlife to disperse across the border     7  Please describe  in detail  the measures that DHS  in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service  has adopted to reduce the spread of invasive species associated with the construction of the SPRNCA fence     8  Please describe  in detail  the measures that DHS  in cooperation with the Fish and Wildlife Service  has adopted to reduce the impact of the SPRNCA fence on sedimentation in the San Pedro River     9  Does DHS or BLM have a monitoring plan in place that would evaluate the impact of the fence     10  On September 19  2007  DHS filed a Notice of Intent to Prepare an Environmental Impact Statement to identify and assess the potential impacts associated with a proposal to construct and operate tactical infrastructure along approximately 70 miles of border between Texas and Mexico  By what criteria did DHS decide to conduct an EIS on a regional scale in Texas  but decide it was not appropriate in Arizona or other southern border states     11  Please provide a copy of the Environmental Assessments and Environmental Impact Statements done in relation to a possible border barrier from 1999 2006 for SPRNCA     I look forward to receiving a response to these questions by December 20  2007  If you have questions about this request  please contact Patricia Rojas on the majority Committee staff at  202  224 2627  Thank you in advance for your cooperation     Sincerely     Joseph I  Lieberman  Chairman
