Collins  R Me   and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman  D Conn   were joined by a broad based and bipartisan group of Senate and House Members calling for the Government Accountability Office to conduct a comprehensive assessment of the federal government   s efforts to detect and deter biological threats  The request for the investigation was cosigned by 23 Senate and House Members  including the Republican and Democratic leaders of the Senate  the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Appropriations and Judiciary Committees  and the Chairman and Ranking Member of the House Science Committee                     In their request to David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the GAO  the Members pointed out that 11 federal agencies have spent or allocated more than  18 billion for biodefense research  development  testing and evaluation     a cumulative total that includes programs focused on detection technologies                       Having reached the fifth anniversary of the anthrax attacks  we believe Congress and the Administration would benefit from a comprehensive assessment by the Governmental Accountability Office  GAO  of currently deployed airborne or environmental biological threat detection technologies and those that are planned or under development                       Among the issues the Members asked the GAO to examine are  the government   s methodology for determining the effectiveness of biological detection technologies  the actual effectiveness of technologies under development for current and future threats  plans in place to test and evaluate new technologies  the costs associated with research and development into new technologies  and whether the government is using all resources  including private sector resources  to develop new technologies                       Following is full text of the letter        October 30  2006       The Honorable David M  Walker      Comptroller General      Government Accountability Office      441 G Street NW      Washington  DC 20548       Dear Mr  Walker        Five years ago  we learned a hard lesson about our nation   s vulnerability to bio terrorism  During September and October of 2001  letters laced with anthrax spores were mailed to the Capitol Hill offices of two U  S  Senators and to members of the media  United States Postal Service  USPS  facilities in Connecticut  New York  New Jersey  Florida  Washington  DC  and elsewhere were found to be contaminated  Twenty two people contracted anthrax disease  and five of them died  i         Since Fiscal Year 2001  Congress and the Administration have supported a dramatic expansion of the scale and diversity of basic and applied research and development  R  by civilian and military agencies  government funded laboratories  academia  and private industry on all aspects of the biological threat  In a recent report  the Center for Arms Control and Non Proliferation estimates that eleven federal departments or agencies will have spent or allocated more than  18 billion for biodefense research  development  testing  and evaluation by the end of Fiscal Year 2007  a cumulative total that includes programs focused on detection technologies  ii        Having reached the fifth anniversary of the anthrax attacks  we believe Congress and the Administration would benefit from a comprehensive assessment by the Government Accountability Office  GAO  of currently deployed airborne or environmental biological threat detection technologies and those that are planned or under development  This includes the BioWatch program at the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   the Biohazard Detection System operated by the USPS  and those technologies under development or described as near term  mid term and long term R projects in recent submissions to Congress by the Department of Defense  iii        Since 2002  GAO has produced technology assessments that provide objective information on the risks  challenges and potential of promising technologies that we hope will someday help prevent catastrophic terrorist attacks  This body of work includes a January 2006 technology assessment of radiation detectors used to screen cargo containers  iv        We now request that GAO conduct a comprehensive technology assessment of similar scope that provides a clear survey and analysis of the relevant research  development  testing  and evaluation  RDT  and deployment programs for biological detection technologies across the federal government  academia and private industry  This assessment should include currently fielded detection technologies and those under development  v  It should also include current mechanisms and strategies for validating biological threats  for testing and evaluating detection technologies  and for ensuring the integration of new or cross cutting knowledge generated by basic and applied R on all types of chemical  biological  radiological  nuclear detection technologies  and high explosive threats       We ask that GAO focus on six questions        1       Does the federal government have a methodology in place for determining the current and future performance requirements for biological detection technologies for military and civilian programs  Is the requirements determination methodology effective  Are the performance requirements identified by this methodology being applied to establish priorities for biological detection research and development        2       How effective are biological detection technologies currently available in military and civilian programs against validated biological threats  How effective are these detection technologies likely to be against potential future threats  What technologies are currently in development       3       What are the policy  cost  and implementation considerations associated with developing  deploying  and using biological detection technologies now and in the future       4       What are the policy  cost  and implementation issues associated with conducting R on biological detection technologies in academia and private industry  including the utilization of federally developed R and the need for access to sample pathogens       5       Does the federal government have programs in place to test and evaluate biological detection technologies  What steps have been taken by agencies to assure that these mechanisms are effective  What metrics are used to evaluate the technologies prior to acquisition        6       Does the federal government have mechanisms for integrating knowledge developed by basic and applied R in government  academia  and private industry for detection of all types of biological  chemical  radiological  nuclear and high explosive agents and for coordinating  managing and setting R priorities across all agencies  Are these mechanisms effective        Given the complexity of the subject and the need to gather information from many sectors of the federal government  academia and the private sector  we recognize that it may be necessary and prudent for GAO to accomplish this technology assessment with a sequence of reports  As you proceed  we ask that GAO apprise our Committees of any external impairments that could potentially limit the scope of this technology assessment or delay its completion in a timely manner        If you have any questions regarding this request  please contact us or our staff  and please ensure that all correspondence is sent to the committees or staff
