Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   Thursday asked the Government Accountability Office to evaluate Department of Homeland Security disaster response and disaster response exercises to make sure response plans are complete  sufficient  and understood by participants  In a letter to GAO Comptroller General David M  Walker  the Senators stressed the need for improved planning for disasters and the need to exercise plans to ensure preparedness in light of the serious failures of all levels of government to plan for and respond to Hurricane Katrina in 2005  Sens  Lieberman and Collins called on GAO to examine selected DHS responses to actual disasters and exercises  It is important that the roles and responsibilities  of disaster participants  are clear  effectively communicated  and completely understood for responses to any disasters that occur  they wrote  Exercises are essential to test the plans and the understanding and performance of key participants  including federal  state  and local officials  as well as non governmental entities and the private sector  The full text of the letter is below  David M  Walker  Comptroller General of the United States  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  D C  20548 Dear Mr  Walker  Hurricane Katrina  A Nation Still Unprepared  a report of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  as well as other reports on Hurricane Katrina  found serious and widespread failures in the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina  The Committee report included several recommendations to address these failures  many of those recommendations involved ensuring that roles and responsibilities of participants are clearly defined  effectively communicated  and completely understood  The recommendations  among other things  also stressed the need for improved planning for disasters and the need to exercise plans to ensure preparedness  Exercises are essential to test the plans and the understanding and performance of roles and responsibilities laid out in the plans  In order to be effective  exercises must be realistic  honestly and promptly evaluated  with corrective follow up action taken and plans re tested as appropriate  The Department of Homeland Security is currently revising the National Response Plan  NRP  and the National Incident Management System  NIMS   Exercises will be a critical component in ensuring that all key participantsfederal  state  and local governments  nongovernmental entities  and the private sectorfully and clearly understand their roles and responsibilities and have the capacity to fulfill them  Examples of some key participants and entities involved in a response with potentially redefined roles include the Principal Federal Officer and Federal Coordinating Officer  as well as the Regional Response Coordination Center  National Response Coordination Center  and the National Operations Center  Other examples include the potentially revised roles of FEMA  the Red Cross  and nongovernmental entities such as the Salvation Army in providing mass care and shelter  Additionally  since the revisions of the NRP and the NIMS are not yet complete  it is important that the roles and responsibilities are clear  effectively communicated  and completely understood for responses to any disasters that occur before the new NRP and NIMS are implemented  In light of the essential importance of making sure our plans for responding to disasters are complete  sufficient  and understood by participants  we ask that the Government Accountability Office observe and evaluate DHS exercises and evaluate responses to disasters  In doing this review  we are particularly interested in the Government Accountability Office providing information on and assessing the following  1  What are the assigned roles and responsibilities for key participants  federal  state  and local governments  nongovernmental entities and the private sector    for response to major disasters identified in the NRP and the NIMS  including the revised NRP and revised NIMS that are to be issued in the near future   Are the roles and responsibilities appropriately delineated  effective  proper  and clear  Are tiers of responsibilities identified for states and localities  2  To what extent has DHS defined the capabilities needed to carry out these roles and responsibilities  To what extent do these defined capabilities appear adequate to fulfill the assigned roles and responsibilities  To what extent and how are the National Preparedness Goal  and Guidance   the Target Capabilities List  TCL   and the  15  National Planning Scenarios used in identifying roles and responsibilities for major disasters  3  What exercises have been designed since January 2006 for use at the state  regional  and national level to test the response capabilities for major disasters  What exercises have actually been conducted  What assumptions and guidance  such as the Homeland Security Exercise and Evaluation Program  have been and are used to develop and execute the exercises  4  What is the extent of DHS oversight in evaluating the execution of the exercises  including their outcomes  and ensuring that action is taken to resolve problems identified in the exercises  What systems does DHS have in place to ensure the quality of exercises  including comprehensive assessments and the implementation of post exercise action plans  5  What roles and responsibilities did governmental and nongovernmental organizations take during the exercise or major disaster  Were the roles and responsibilities clear and understood by the participants  Were the roles and responsibilities appropriate  effective  proper  and follow the relevant plans  6  What major issues and problems surfaced during the exercise or major disaster  What unanticipated issues were identified during the exercise or major disaster  7  Are the exercises sufficient to ensure our disaster response plans are adequate and understood so an effective response can be executed to any disaster  including catastrophic disasters that may occur  In assessing these issues  we ask that the Government Accountability staff observe and evaluate selected exercises and evaluate responses to disasters using after action reports and other data  including documents and interviews  We expect the Department of Homeland Security or other agencies sponsoring exercises or participating in responses to disasters to fully cooperate with GAO s review  This includes allowing GAO staff to observe exercises that include any federal participants or observers  as well as interviewing knowledgeable individuals and having access to any relevant documents  including but not limited to after action reports for exercises and disasters that occurred in 2006 or 2007 prior to or after GAO s initiation of this review  We ask that you provide us with information regarding any issues GAO has in obtaining information for this review  both by timely informing our staff and by discussing any such issues in any report produced  Thank you in advance for your assistance  If you have any questions or concerns  please contact Mary Beth Schultz with the majority at  202  224 2627 or Asha Mathew with the minority at  202  224 4751 to discuss plans for completing this study  Sincerely  Joseph I  Lieberman Susan M  Collins Chairman Ranking Member  30
