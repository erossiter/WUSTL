Lieberman  D Conn   issued the following statement Wednesday following passage of the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act                   Mr  President  I rise to express my strong support for the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act  which we will vote on shortly   This legislation contains significant reforms in a number of areas   It gets rid of gifts from lobbyists   It requires significantly increased disclosure from those who are paid to influence Members of Congress   For the first time ever  it would shine sunlight on the activities of those who are paid to bring large numbers of phone calls and letters to Congressional offices   It significantly slows the so called revolving door by doubling the ban on lobbying by Members once they leave Congress and significantly expanding the rules covering who former staff can and can   t lobby   In short  it completely upends the status quo  and I hope it will begin to restore the American public   s trust in Congress  which has been sorely tested by recent scandals  most prominently the indictment of lobbyist Jack Abramoff       Trust between the people and their elected leaders is essential to a democracy  The behavior of Mr  Abramoff and his associates undercut that trust and created the perception that  in Washington  results go to the highest bidder  not to the greatest public good   That is not always the case  but it is the public perception   This legislation reverses that equation         Mr  President  there are many people to thank for seeing this effort through   First I want to thank my Chairman  Senator Collins  for her usual outstanding leadership in rising to the challenge of crafting a strong bipartisan lobbying reform proposal in the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   After a hearing in late January  she was ready to markup legislation a month later  despite an incredible work load from conducting the ongoing Katrina investigation  which included multiple hearings a week       The legislation we passed out of Committee contained significant reforms that will not only change the way lobbyists and Members of Congress interact  but will provide the American public with additional information about where billions of lobbying dollars are being spent and for what purpose         The measure approved by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee requires lobbyists to report more details more frequently about their activities  including their campaign contributions to Members of Congress  political action committees  and fundraising events hosted or sponsored by lobbyists  They will also be required to disclose travel they arrange for Members of Congress or Executive Branch officials   All lobbyist disclosures will have to be made quarterly  rather than semi annually  and they will have to be made online so that anyone who wishes to monitor lobbyist activities will be able to do so and do so easily on a public  searchable database        For the first time ever  large scale grassroots lobbying campaigns     those known as astro turf campaigns  because they are manufactured     will be required to disclose the money they spend   I want to thank Senator Levin for partnering with me on this effort   I am particularly proud of this victory  which directly responds to the activities of Mr  Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon  who sought contributions from Indian tribes to a grassroots lobbying effort and then took kickbacks from the grassroots organization         The legislation from the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee further slows the revolving door between Congress and K St  by doubling to two years the amount of time a former Member of Congress must wait before lobbying his or her former colleagues  and by prohibiting former senior congressional staff from lobbying for a year the entire body which they formerly served  rather than the particular member who employed them    Also  the bill increases penalties for lobbyists by doubling the civil fine for violations of the Lobbying Disclosure Act to  100 000        Mr  President  the leadership of Rules Committee Chairman Lott and his Ranking Member and my own senior Senator  Chris Dodd  must also be noted   They too produced a strong bill from their Committee  which was combined with ours on the Senate floor  Their bill prohibited most gifts from lobbyists to Members of Congress and required pre approval and greater disclosure of all Congressional travel   It also addressed an issue of deep significance to many Americans by requiring that earmarks attached to legislation be listed  explained  and the member behind the earmark be identified                   This package of reforms was further strengthened on the Senate floor with an amendment from my colleague Senator Dodd to make sure that all gifts from lobbyists were banned     including meals   This  Mr  President  is truly a remarkable victory for those who believe the relationship between lobbyists and Members of Congress has been too cozy  The bill was additionally strengthened with an amendment from Senators Wyden and Grassley that would abolish the practice of secret holds on legislation  requiring the member who wishes to place a hold to identify him or herself       I also want to thank Senators McCain  Obama  and Feingold  all stalwarts of reform and indispensable allies in this endeavor  Both Senators McCain and Feingold were out ahead on this issue  having introduced strong reform legislation last year   In addition  Senate Minority Leader Reid provided essential muscle and impetus when he introduced his own reform package  supported by almost the entire Democratic Senate caucus  earlier this year       Senator Collins and I are disappointed the Senate rejected an amendment we offered with Senators McCain  Collins  and Obama that would have established an independent Office of Public Integrity to conduct the preliminary stage of a Senate ethics complaint   I believe this independent office would have further assured the public that we in Congress are not only dead serious about reform but are dead serious about the enforcement of that reform  And I regret a group of us were unable to offer an amendment to increase the reimbursement costs of airplane travel provided to members by private entities       But even without these additional reforms  this legislation sends the clear and powerful message that  in Washington  we are taking significant steps to make sure here in this Congress results go to the greatest public good and not ever to the highest bidder   I have said many times throughout this debate that we now have a once in a generation opportunity to reach bipartisan agreement on a broad set of reforms that will reduce cynicism  prevent abuse and restore trust in the American people in their government   Mr  President  I believe this bill does just that                    On a final note  I would like to thank several staff members for their long hours and exceptional hard work on this legislation  On my staff  I particularly want to thank Troy Cribb  who led our efforts on this bill  as well as my Staff Director Joyce Rechtschaffen and Chief Counsel Laurie Rubenstein   They labored to make this bill as good as it could possibly be   I also want to thank Michael Bopp  Jennifer Hemmingway  Ann Fisher  and Kurt Schmautz on the majority staff  and Kennie Gill and Veronica Gillespie from Senator Dodd   s staff  and Senator Lott   s able staff  as well  I thank them all  I thank my colleagues and I thank the Chair  I yield the floor         30
