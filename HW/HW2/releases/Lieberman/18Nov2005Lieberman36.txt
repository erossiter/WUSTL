announced this week  to terminate payment for evacuees living in hotels and motels as of December 1  and to terminate leases for many in apartments  before seeking to ensure they will have other accommodations    Lieberman said the policy    could leave many Katrina victims homeless      Lieberman urged top government officials to employ a    flexible    approach to solving the housing problems of hundreds of thousands of Gulf Coast evacuees now facing new deadlines for finding their own shelter    In a letter to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff and Acting FEMA Director David Paulison  Lieberman said recent FEMA actions had    sown confusion  created fear  and increased stress    for thousands of displaced people and he urged FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security to reconsider its recent decisions         The unprecedented nature of this natural disaster requires that FEMA do everything possible to act with humaneness  effectiveness  and fairness to provide decent transitional living conditions for the hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims     Lieberman wrote      Unfortunately  FEMA   s current approach to housing does not appear to meet that test           Following is Lieberman   s letter           November 18  2005        The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528        The Honorable R  David Paulison  Acting Director  Federal Emergency Management Agency  500 C  St  S W   Washington  D C  20472      Dear Secretary Chertoff   Chief Paulison        As you know  since being evacuated from their homes and communities  hundreds of thousands of Hurricane Katrina survivors have faced a series of challenges in stabilizing and rebuilding their lives   While I know FEMA is working hard to assist families to meet many of their needs  recent actions by FEMA regarding existing housing programs have sown confusion  created fear  and increased stress for thousands of evacuees who are relying on FEMA for support   I urge you to reconsider these decisions         In particular  FEMA   s  decision to terminate support for evacuees still living in hotels and motels  as well as leases for many in apartments  before seeking to ensure they will have other accommodations could leave many Katrina victims homeless  The same is true of FEMA   s refusal to implement a more flexible policy for some evacuees using the Transitional Assistance Housing Program who may lose assistance because FEMA failed to inform them  in a timely manner  of important conditions in the program        On November 15  2005  FEMA announced that as of December 1  it will terminate the short term housing program for evacuees currently housed in hotels and motels   In that same announcement  FEMA noted that it is executing    an aggressive plan    to help the 150 000 evacuees currently living in 53 000 hotel and motel rooms find other long term housing solutions   However  FEMA acknowledges that it will not be able to reach each individual to ensure that he or she successfully resettles into a new home   This    aggressive plan    apparently consists largely of posting flyers outlining this new policy and urging evacuees to call the FEMA 1 800 number for help   These actions are far from adequate and appear to show little understanding of the dire situation many of these families face   Furthermore  two weeks in many instances is not enough time for evacuees to both find an apartment and sign a new lease   I urge you to develop a comprehensive housing counseling program conducted by trained professionals to assist every evacuee successfully move from short term to long term housing and to readjust your December 1 deadline to ensure time for this program to be implemented          FEMA also announced that it will not honor state and local sponsored sheltering in apartments through the Section 403 program past March 1  This is an abrupt change from September  when FEMA notified states and local governments that FEMA would cover the rental expenses for leases they signed to provide apartments to evacuees for up to 12 months   This week   s announcement changes the rules and housing expectations for state and local governments  landlords and evacuees and has created considerable confusion    The result is that some evacuees now living in apartments may be left without stable housing if FEMA is unable to successfully transition them into the Section 408 Transitional Assistance Housing Program by March 1  In addition  I have been notified by the Connecticut Department of Social Services  who is administering the Section 403 program that landlords are now refusing to rent to evacuees due to a lack of assurance from FEMA that it will cover evacuees    expenses after March 1   This deadline has added another level of disorder and uncertainty to an already stressful situation for evacuees          Finally  I am concerned about FEMA   s treatment of evacuees who may not have received sufficient instruction about the Section 408 Transitional Assistance Housing Program   As I understand it  under this program  over 500 000 families who have registered with FEMA and whose house was destroyed or made uninhabitable received a lump sum check for  2 358 to cover three months of rent   Participants may extend this assistance for up to 18 months if they remain eligible and can demonstrate that these funds were used solely for rental needs   This program can be an effective tool for securing longer term housing for Katrina evacuees   However  in discussions with my staff  FEMA personnel acknowledged that some families who received this housing assistance may not have been first informed that using the money for anything other than rent  for example other essential needs such as food  medicine or clothing  would make them ineligible for the 18 month extension   As a result  evacuees who used some of the funds for other essential needs may be barred from receiving this extended housing benefit        It is imperative that FEMA apply some flexibility to this rule and allow evacuees in need of housing assistance to continue to participate in the program if  for example  they used the housing funds for other essential needs because they were unaware of the program   s restrictions  FEMA would not need to incur additional costs because it could deduct the funds from the  26 200 maximum possible aid for personal property and housing assistance available to families through the Individual and Households Program  IHP    However  a flexible approach would help families who  through no fault of their own  may have used funds intended for housing for other essential needs        I support FEMA   s decision to transition evacuees currently in government financed apartment rentals  hotels and motels into the Section 408 Transitional Assistance Housing Program      However  evacuees should be able to count on the Section 403 housing program until they have successfully transitioned into the Section 408 program    The unprecedented nature of this natural disaster requires that FEMA do everything possible to act with humaneness  effectiveness  and fairness to provide decent transitional living conditions for the hundreds of thousands of hurricane victims   Unfortunately  FEMA   s current approach to housing does not appear to meet that test           I look forward to your prompt reply       Sincerely                Joseph I  Lieberman   Ranking Minority Member      30
