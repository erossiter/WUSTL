Senators Judd Gregg  R N H   and Robert Byrd  D W V    Chairman and Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Homeland Security of the Senate Appropriations Committee  Collins and Lieberman pointed to growing concerns over the vulnerability of our ports  rail  and transit systems to terrorist attack and urged the Appropriations Committee to increase dedicated funding for these potential targets

                             Ranking Member      Subcommittee on Homeland Security                Subcommittee on Homeland Security       Senate Committee on Appropriations                            Senate Committee on Appropriations      Washington  D C          20510                                      Washington  D C      20510       Dear Senators Gregg and Byrd        As your Subcommittee sets out to mark up the FY 2007 Homeland Security Appropriations bill on Tuesday  June 27  2006  we ask that you dedicate additional funds for port security grants and intercity passenger rail and transit security grants   In the wake of last year   s attacks on London   s transit system  the Madrid attacks of 2004  and the growing concern about the vulnerability of our nation   s ports  we believe that such funding is necessary        The Dubai Ports World controversy brought much needed attention to the critical issue of port security   While Congress moves forward with legislation to address enhancements to our nation   s maritime security  identified needs in this area remain underfunded   The American Association of Port Authorities identified a funding level of  400 million needed to implement the requirements of the Maritime Transportation Security Act  MTSA  and address port security priorities   The port security funding needs over the next two years are even more critical as the Department of Homeland Security begins to issue Transportation Worker Identification Credential  TWIC  cards to maritime workers   While issuing TWIC cards and conducting the required background checks will result in greater security comfort  true physical security at our ports will not be reached without implementing the next step of deploying access control systems   Port authorities and facilities will face significant additional costs to deploy the requisite biometric access control systems and will use their port security grant money to help fund these projects   As the House included  200 million for port security grants in its appropriations bill  we would request the Senate provide dedicated funding at an even higher level        With respect to transit security  last year   s attacks on London   s transit system and the recent information on a potential attack on the New York subway system again demonstrate that passenger rail and transit systems are attractive targets   Our Committee held an extensive hearing on the subject last September  bearing out the need for additional federal funding for intercity passenger rail and transit security   Fourteen million people rely on mass transit systems in our country every day   We must provide assistance to system owners and operators to continue rapid deployment of security enhancements   As the House recently included  200 million in its FY 2007 bill for intercity passenger rail and transit security grants  we would request the Senate provide at least that level of dedicated funding          As a show of support for additional funding  the Senate approved our amendment to the Senate Budget Resolution  providing  400 million for port security grants and  200 million for intercity passenger rail and transit security   We appreciate the difficult choices you must make in bringing this bill through conference with the House   Your efforts to fund the Department of Homeland Security make our country safer   We also urge that you not short change assistance to first responders in order to do so                                                                                  Sincerely                                Susan M  Collins                                                          Joseph I  Lieberman                              Chairman
