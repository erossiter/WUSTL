                                                                                                                                                        Senator Joseph Lieberman      Remarks for Troop Increase Press Conference       July 13  2005       Today  I am pleased to join with Senators Hillary Clinton  and Jack Reed  and Representatives Ellen Tauscher and Mark Udall to introduce the United States Army Relief Act of 2005        We in turn are pleased to be joined by two retired Army Generals   General Daniel Christman  former Superintendent of the U S  Military Academy at West Point  and        General Robert Scales  former Commandant of the U S  Army War College   General John Tilleli  former Commander in Chief  U  S  Forces Korea had hoped to join us but was detained at a previous meeting          What brings us together today is a shared conclusion that the United States Army is facing a crisis  It is not a crisis of quality  bravery or commitment  The men and women in today   s Army are as good as any who have ever worn the uniform         The crisis is that there are not enough of them in today   s army          From the beginning of the all volunteer Army in 1972 until the fall of the Soviet Union in 1989  the Army   s end strength     the maximum number of troops allowed by law     was just under 800 000         After the Cold War  that number dropped by almost 300 000 and stayed there        Look at the numbers on this chart  They illustrate the current crisis   In every other time of war since World War II  the President and Congress have increased the size of the Army        Today     three and a half years after 9 11 01 and the beginning of the Global War on Terror  with troops fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan and with soldiers deployed in 118 other countries     we are still at only 502 400 authorized Army end strength  roughly the same size as the Army has been since the end of the Cold War        We believe that our troops and our nation are paying a price for this inadequate Army end strength and may pay even more dearly in the uncertain years ahead unless the Army grows substantially        We are here to do something about that  not to make partisan statements  but to begin a patriotic movement that will reach out to colleagues of both parties in       Congress  to the officials of the Bush Administration  and to all Americans to build support for an increase in the size of our army by an additional 80 000 soldiers over the next four years to an end strength of 582  400   That is what the    United States Army Relief Act of 2005    will do   We take this action because        We believe that the current pace of troop deployments to Iraq requires too much of the men and women of our Army  Too many of them have been sent there too often and stayed too long and that has had an undesirable affect on their families  their communities  and the capacity of the Army to meet recruitment goals          We believe that greater Army end strength will give our war fighting commanders in Afghanistan and Iraq the capability they need to surge the number of troops on the ground there if facts on the ground require that        We are concerned that if other crises occur elsewhere in the world in the years ahead we won   t have the appropriately sized Army trained and ready to go there to deal with these other crises          And we are concerned that too much of the experienced institutional Army  that part that raises  trains  and supports the combat forces  is being reduced to make up for this combat troop shortage  depriving today   s soldiers of the highest level of training and education and support  and threatening to deprive tomorrow   s soldiers    including particularly tomorrow   s officers  of the knowledge and experience they will need to fight the wars of the future        In the days  weeks  and months ahead we will reach out to our colleagues on both sides of the aisle to help build an Army with the force to match its motto     This We   ll Defend           We begin with this bill  which we are introducing today   Later this month  to broaden the discussion  we intend to offer it as an amendment to the Department of Defense Authorization Bill          We will also ask for the opportunity to make our case for 100 000 more soldiers to the officials in the Pentagon who are working on the important Quadrennial Defense Review  which will be issued next year        Finally  I want to thank the Third Way  a centrist Democratic organization  for the important policy work they have done to bring us to the introduction of this legislation and the beginning of this movement       30
