language from the supplemental appropriations legislation  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  stated on the Senate floor today         Indeed  it is an awful irony of this debate that many of the same people who consistently and correctly call on the United States to do more to stop the bloodshed in Darfur now demand we abandon the Iraqis        Senator Lieberman continued   We hear that Sunnis and Shia have been fighting for centuries  and that no matter how tragic  we cannot possibly hope to resolve this conflict   We have heard these arguments before  We heard them in the 1990s about Yugoslavia  We heard them about Rwanda  Like the euphemism of  civil war   it is another way for us to distance ourselves  emotionally and morally  from what is actually happening   and from the people it is happening to  It allows us to think of these places as a sort of abstract tragedy  in which there are no victims  just victimizers  whom we can walk away from with impunity    The wanton slaughter of innocent people that our soldiers are trying to stop in Baghdad is not the inevitable product of ancient hatreds  but the consequence of a deliberate  calculated strategy by an identifiable group of perpetrators   first and foremost  Al Qaeda        Concluding  Senator Lieberman outlined both the strategic and moral consequences of a premature withdrawal from Iraq   I ask my colleagues  consider what it will mean if Congress orders our troops to pull back from this battle  just at the moment that they are taking the initiative  Consider the consequences if we knowingly and willingly withdraw our forces and abandon one of the few states in the Middle East to have held free  competitive elections to extremism and violence           We cannot redeploy from our moral responsibility to the Iraqis  It is contrary to our traditions  it is contrary to our values  and it is contrary to our interests  And yet that is precisely what this Congress will be calling for  if we order our troops to withdraw        Below is the full text of the Senator s remarks as prepared for delivery       Mr  President  Congress approaches a decisive turning point in the history of our engagement in Iraq   a moment that will have repercussions not only for the future of that country and our presence there  but for our security right here in the United States       The immediate question before us is direct  Should Congress impose a deadline for the withdrawal of our troops from Iraq        We all know the circumstances under which this vote takes place  The administration is politically weak  The war is politically unpopular  It has never been easier to advocate withdrawal  to throw up our hands and simply say   Enough         But each of us has a responsibility to do what we believe is right   not what is easy  And I believe deeply it would be wrong for this Congress to order a withdrawal of American troops from this war at this time       What are the arguments given to justify this arbitrary withdrawal       First  proponents of withdrawal keep returning to the proposition that Americans soldiers shouldn t be policing a  civil war         But what does this mean        Surely my colleagues don t mean to say that the United States military  as a general principle  should never police a civil war       That would certainly come as a surprise to our soldiers who have been keeping the peace in Bosnia and Kosovo over the past decade  dispatched there under a Democratic President with the support of Democrats in Congress        Clearly  our military has policed civil wars in the past  So why do proponents of withdrawal from Iraq keep insisting it shouldn t now       The answer  I think  has to do with the way we choose to characterize what s happening in Iraq        When we suggest that our soldiers are stuck in a civil war  it suggests that the conflict there has become hopeless   a pit of violence which there are no heroes   only villains   and where our military cannot possibly do any good       But is this really the case       Consider the Iraqi government   a government freely elected by the people of Iraq  a government where every day Iraqis of every ethnicity and sectarian identity come together  I know that the Iraqi government has many faults and weaknesses  and we should be using every instrument at our disposal to pressure its leaders to make the right choices  But there is a world of difference between the moderates who compose the Iraqi government and the extremists who seek to murder them       The image of Iraq as a country in which everyone   Sunni  Shia  and Kurd   is complicit in the violence also overlooks something else       It overlooks a sixty seven year old widow in Baghdad who was told to leave her home or be killed because she is Sunni    It overlooks the dozens of college students murdered in their classroom by a suicide bomber for no reason other than that they are Shia    It overlooks the fourteen year girl who watched as her neighbor was gunned down  as he walked over to her house to say hello         Mr  President  the term  civil war  does not begin to describe the atrocities inflicted on these people  The truth is  what we are confronted with in Iraq is the deliberate  calculated  murder of civilians  often on the basis of religious identity alone  by insurgents and terrorists       My colleagues  Even if you think that Iraq has nothing to do with the war on terrorism  surely all of us can unite around the proposition that we have a moral responsibility not to turn our backs on this       Like the Serb death squads that tried to ethnically cleanse Kosovo  or the Hutu extremists in Rwanda  or the janjaweed today in Darfur  the sectarian violence we are witnessing in Iraq is directed at the extermination of human beings on the basis of nothing more than who they are        Indeed  it is an awful irony of this debate that many of the same people who consistently and correctly call on the United States to do more to stop the bloodshed in Darfur now demand we abandon the Iraqis        And yet  if anything  precisely because United States did invade Iraq  we are more  not less  responsible for stopping the atrocities unfolding there now  There can be no disentangling ourselves  no moral withdrawal  from Iraq        I know that some believe the violence in Iraq is inevitable  the outgrowth of ancient hatreds that exist outside the bounds of normal politics  We hear that Sunnis and Shia have been fighting for centuries  and that no matter how tragic  we cannot possibly hope to resolve this conflict       We have heard these arguments before  We heard them in the 1990s about Yugoslavia  We heard them about Rwanda  Like the euphemism of  civil war   it is another way for us to distance ourselves  emotionally and morally  from what is actually happening   and from the people it is happening to  It allows us to think of these places as a sort of abstract tragedy  in which there are no victims  just victimizers  whom we can walk away from with impunity        Surely we have learned this lesson by now  Surely we should know better than that now       The wanton slaughter of innocent people that our soldiers are trying to stop in Baghdad is not the inevitable product of ancient hatreds  but the consequence of a deliberate  calculated strategy by an identifiable group of perpetrators   first and foremost  Al Qaeda       We know this because Al Qaeda itself has said so  Its leaders have stated openly that they want to foment hatred and fear between Sunnis and Shiites  precisely because they know it represents their best bet to sow chaos  to stamp out any hope of Middle Eastern democracy  and  as our debate today shows  to push the United States to the point of retreat       This is also why the notion  expressed in this supplemental  that we can separate the fight against terrorism from the fight against sectarian violence in Iraq simply defies reality  The fact of the matter is  the worst sectarian violence is being committed by Al Qaeda and other Islamist terrorists        The problem in Iraq is not the split in Islam between Sunnis and Shiites  but a specific ideology   the ideology of Islamist extremism   that is trying to exploit this divide for its own evil ends       The success of this ideology is not inevitable  Thanks to General Petraeus and the new strategy  sectarian violence is down  Moqtada al Sadr has disappeared  The Mahdi Army is splintering  Displaced families appear to be returning to their homes       Of course  we will not know for some time to what extent the new strategy will succeed  But it is clear that  for the first time  in a long time  security appears to be improving       Despite this evidence  however  advocates of withdrawal insist General Petraeus  new strategy cannot succeed because the conflict requires a  political settlement   They even argue that our efforts to protect the Iraqi people will make things worse by allowing the Iraqi government to avoid making compromises        The problem with this argument is that it is directly contradicted by our experience over the past two months        Consider the record  In the past two months  Prime Minister Maliki has allowed U S  forces to sweep into Sadr City  He has worked with General Petraeus to ensure that all the Iraqi Army units required by the new strategy are available  He has flown to the heart of Anbar province to meet with Sunni leaders        His cabinet has approved a new oil law   one of the key benchmarks for political progress  And  as of yesterday  he has approved a crucial reconciliation law that will allow all but the three highest levels of former Baathists to return to their jobs and collect a pension       These breakthroughs happened not in spite  but because of the American commitment to Iraq  and because of the presence of General Petraeus and his troops        I ask my colleagues  consider what it will mean if Congress orders our troops to pull back from this battle  just at the moment that they are taking the initiative  Consider the consequences if we knowingly and willingly withdraw our forces and abandon one of the few states in the Middle East to have held free  competitive elections to extremism and violence        I understand the frustration and anger and sheer sense of exhaustion that so many feel about Iraq  a conflict that has been dogged with so many mistakes and missteps        And I am acutely aware of the enormous toll of this war in human life   American and Iraqi       But I ask those eager to wind up our commitments in Iraq  those determined to order a withdrawal  I ask you to think carefully about the consequences  not just geopolitical but moral  of what you are calling for        We cannot redeploy from our moral responsibility to the Iraqis  It is contrary to our traditions  it is contrary to our values  and it is contrary to our interests  And yet that is precisely what this Congress will be calling for  if we order our troops to withdraw       Don t do this  Give General Petraeus a chance  Strike this language from the bill       I ask for unanimous consent to enter my full remarks into the record       I thank the Chair  I yield the floor        30
