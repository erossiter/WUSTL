Man Who Disliked Bush

Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Tuesday asked the Inspector General of the Department of Housing and Urban Development to investigate the Secretary   s apparent decision to rescind a HUD contract to a man who said he disliked President Bush                   In a letter to Inspector General Kenneth M  Donohue  Senator Lieberman referred to a press report recounting Secretary Alphonso Jackson   s speech before the Real Estate Executive Council in which he told the story of a man who had submitted a    heck of a proposal    so we selected him     But when the contractor thanked the Secretary in person  the contractor made a negative remark about Bush  and the Secretary withdrew the awarded contract                      Our government   s procurement laws    are supposed to be executed based on merit  without partiality or political bias     Lieberman wrote     I truly hope that the Secretary was misquoted  but in order to assure the American people that our procurement laws and our government are not being administered in an arbitrary and capricious manner  I ask that you immediately look into this incident                     The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction over procurement issues  Following is the letter        May 9  2006       The Honorable Kenneth M  Donohue      Inspector General      Department of Housing and Urban Development      451 7th St  SW      Washington  DC 20410       Dear Inspector General Donohue                    I am concerned about a comment reportedly made by Secretary Jackson which indicated that he had decided to rescind a contract award based on the prospective contractor   s disagreement with the Administration   s political views   A May 5  2006  article in the Dallas Business Journal entitled    HUD Secretary s Blunt Warning     quoted the following from an April 28  2006  speech Secretary Jackson gave to the Real Estate Executive Council  a national minority real estate consortium         He had made every effort to get a contract with HUD for 10 years   Jackson said of the prospective contractor   He made a heck of a proposal and was on the  General Services Administration  list  so we selected him  He came to see me and thank me for selecting him  Then he said something     he said   I have a problem with your president          I said   What do you mean   He said   I don t like President Bush   I thought to myself   Brother  you have a disconnect    the president is elected  I was selected  You wouldn t be getting the contract unless I was sitting here  If you have a problem with the president  don t tell the secretary           He didn t get the contract   Jackson continued   Why should I reward someone who doesn t like the president  so they can use funds to try to campaign against the president  Logic says they don t get the contract  That s the way I believe                      The Secretary   s words  if they are accurately reported  are very troubling   Our government   s procurement laws  over which the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has jurisdiction  are supposed to be executed based on merit  without partiality or political bias   I truly hope that the Secretary was misquoted  but in order to assure the American people that our procurement laws and our government are not being administered in an arbitrary and capricious manner  I ask that you immediately look into this incident   Specifically  I ask you to answer the following questions         1                Did Secretary Jackson make the comments quoted above        2                If so  were they accurate        3                What was the specific contract described by the Secretary and who was the specific contractor        4                Had the contractor been awarded the contract initially  and if not  how far in the process had the contractor progressed        5                Under what authority was the contract ultimately denied to the contractor        6                Did the Secretary   s or the Department   s actions with respect to this contractor violate any governing rule  regulation or law  or infringe upon the contractor   s First Amendment rights        7                What role do the political views or affiliations of prospective contractors generally play in HUD   s contracting decisions        8                What controls does HUD have in place to ensure that it abides by governing rules  regulations and laws regarding impartiality in contracting        9                What actions are appropriate to take in response to the findings your office makes        I thank you for your cooperation and look forward to hearing from you        Sincerely         Joseph I  Lieberman      Ranking Member      30
