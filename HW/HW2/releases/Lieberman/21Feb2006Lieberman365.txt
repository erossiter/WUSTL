                                                   WASHINGTON   At a press conference today with a range of CT environmental groups including Connecticut Fund for the Environment  Save the Sound  Connecticut League of Conservation Voters  Audubon Connecticut  Connecticut Sierra Club and Connecticut Public Interest Research Group  ConnPIRG  Senator Joe Lieberman announced his opposition to the proposed Broadwater Liquid Natural Gas facility to be sited on the Long Island Sound  in Hartford   s Riverside Park       The Broadwater Liquid Natural Gas  LNG  facility would offload LNG from supertankers and re gasify the liquid   In addition to the facility itself and the increased supertanker traffic in the Sound  the facility would require a 25 mile pipeline dug into the bottom of the Sound to connect the facility to the existing Iroquois pipeline   Long Island Sound is a fragile web of sensitive ecosystems and habitats for wildlife         Having dedicated so much of my political career to restoring and protecting Long Island Sound and the unique environmental and quality of life values for the people of CT that the Sound embodies  I cannot reconcile the proposed facility with either those values or what I envision as the future of the Sound     said Lieberman     Approval of the facility would remove forever a portion of the Sound from the public trust for commercial use and its operations would impact the commercial and recreational uses already provided by the Sound   I simply cannot support this project        Lieberman said he remains concerned about how to bring down energy prices for Connecticut   s residents who  according to the U S  Energy Information Administration short term prediction will pay an average of 35  more for natural gas this winter  23  more for fuel oil and 17  more for propane   At today   s event Lieberman discussed alternative proposals that he said present more promising ways to bring down energy costs without such a negative environmental impact          Broadwater represents a trade off between environmental protection and economic health that we just do not have to make     said Lieberman     Against this backdrop  that I reviewed the alternatives and although some of these facilities may not directly serve Connecticut  increase in the LNG supplies for New York and New Jersey will free existing regional supplies and have beneficial effects for Connecticut businesses and residents           Examples of potential alternative proposals include a new import terminal which has already been approved by FERC for construction in Fall River  Massachusetts  two new terminals being built in Eastern Canada  and five other proposed Eastern Seaboard facilities now pending  one in Maryland  two in Maine  and two off the shore of Boston   In addition  a proposal has recently been unveiled to construct an LNG terminal on a man made island in Atlantic Ocean between Long Island and New Jersey  Lieberman has also vowed to continue his fight for energy assistance in the face of the Administrations nearly 20  cut in LIHEAP funding over and a 32  reduction in the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP   which enables low income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient       Earlier today Lieberman celebrated Connecticut   s innovation in energy conservation by joining Centerbrook Architects in a dedication of Connecticut   s largest corporate solar energy project  in Centerbrook  The solar panels  located on the office building   s roof  will provide clean electricity for the Centerbrook Archictects    office building           What Centerbrook has done is remind us that what is good for the environment can also be good for business     said Lieberman     The foundation to a new  clean energy future for America will be built brick by brick and volt by volt at places like Centerbrook where they pull the plug on Global Warming every time they flip the switch on solar energy          30
