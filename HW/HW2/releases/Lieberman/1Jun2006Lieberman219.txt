Lack of Balance                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON     Today Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  called on the Inspector General of the United States Department of Energy  DOE  to investigate whether the composition  funding  and recent conduct of the National Coal Council  NCC  complies with the Federal Advisory Committee Act   s requirement that official advisory groups like the NCC be    fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented     The letter was prompted by a recent NCC report that called for a doubling of US coal consumption by 2025 without addressing steps that businesses can take to minimize the environmental toll of coal extraction and use          The text of the letter is below         Dear Inspector General Friedman        I am writing to ask that you investigate whether the composition  funding  and recent conduct of the National Coal Council  NCC  comply with the Federal Advisory Committee Act  FACA  and all US Department of Energy regulations  orders  and policies        As an advisory committee that provides recommendations to the Secretary of Energy  the NCC is subject to FACA   s requirements   To ensure that the recommendations of advisory committees will be unbiased  well informed  and accurate  FACA requires that such committees be    fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented           On March 22  the NCC sent Secretary Bodman a report entitled     Coal  America   s Energy Future      The report does not reflect input from a    broad spectrum of diverse interests     as claimed in its preface   Rather  the report advances the views and interests of US coal producers without exhibiting any concern for competing opinions and priorities   Most notably  the report calls for a doubling of US coal consumption by 2025 without acknowledging the need to reform some of our coal extraction techniques  install up to date pollution controls on our coal fired power plants  and implement technology for capturing and storing the global warming pollution that otherwise escapes when we burn coal        I believe strongly that coal can and should continue to meet a substantial portion of this country   s energy needs   Its abundance in the US makes it a vital economic resource  and coal fueled electricity generation can help end our addiction to oil   Key to our ability to take maximum advantage of this vital asset  however  is ensuring that we succeed in mining and using coal in an environmentally sustainable way   Before a doubling of US coal consumption can be supported  the environmental problems listed above must be solved        Of the nearly 100 NCC members currently listed on the organization   s website  all but a handful are associated with coal related industries  Only four listed members represent state governments   All of them are from energy related offices without any environmental or public health agency representation   Only one member is from an environmental group  and he represents a single state chapter of a larger national organization   None of the members appear to represent consumer interest groups        The NCC   s funding structure may exacerbate the imbalance of NCC   s membership   The organization is dependent upon voluntary membership dues that are calculated according to an ability to pay formula   Consequently  the largest and wealthiest members  which are those whose economic interests depend most upon coal production  consumption or transportation  appear to be responsible for the largest shares of the NCC   s funding        I would like to draw your particular attention to what I believe are three of the March 22 report   s specific problems   First  the report contains very little discussion of the technological measures that American businesses could implement widely to minimize the environmental toll of coal extraction and use   In fact  the report ignores Secretary Bodman   s April 7  2005 request for a comprehensive evaluation of environmentally protective technologies such as low impact coal mining        Second  the report fails to acknowledge and explore the technologies that power companies can and should use to prevent coal use from exacerbating global warming   As you know  carbon dioxide  CO2  is the primary cause of global warming  and coal fired power plants are already responsible for over 30  of US CO2 emissions   It is wrong for an official advisory council to advocate a doubling of our coal consumption without even recognizing our ability and responsibility to prevent the facilities that run on coal from releasing CO2 to the atmosphere         Finally  the economic analysis in the report appears incomplete  specifically in terms of the impact that increased coal use would have on the economy and on energy prices   For example  the report does not appear to include any of the costs associated with building the facilities needed to produce coal derived energy and fuels  nor does the report consider any public health or environmental costs        Shortly after the NCC issued this one sided report  Secretary Bodman announced his decision to disband the Secretary of Energy Advisory Board  a truly balanced advisory committee that had been providing the Department with expert  unbiased advice for nearly thirty years   That makes it all the more important that the NCC do its work in a more balanced and inclusive manner         It is with these considerations in mind that I ask you to investigate the composition  funding  and recent conduct of the NCC   I ask that this investigation pay particular attention to the question of compliance with FACA   s requirement that all government advisory committees be    fairly balanced in terms of points of view represented      Please perform this investigation on an expedited basis and share the resulting report with my staff        Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter
