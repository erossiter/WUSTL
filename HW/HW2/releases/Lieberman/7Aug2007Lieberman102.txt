Prison Information Act of 2007 in an effort to increase the transparency and accountability of the operation of private prisons                 The bill would impose reporting requirements on private prisons contracting with federal agencies similar to the reporting obligations required under the Freedom of Information Act  FOIA                   This legislation is intended to break down the wall of secrecy surrounding private prisons so that they can be held accountable to the public   Lieberman said  in introducing the legislation Friday before Congress recessed for its August break   As the federal government increasingly turns to private  for profit companies to incarcerate federal prisoners  information about the operation of private prisons and detention facilities must be available for public scrutiny                   Approximately 25 000 federal criminal prisoners are jailed in private facilities at any given time  and more than 20 percent of the 200 000 immigrants and asylum seekers detained annually by Immigration and Customs Enforcement are held in 33 private detention centers                  Studies by criminal justice groups have shown that correctional officers at privately run prisons are paid less  receive less training  and experience higher turnover rates than those at prisons run by government agencies  This can lead to greater rates of assaults on staff  inmate on inmate assaults  and escape attempts                 Immigration advocates report that private immigration detention facilities rely on psychotropic medication as a management tool for their non criminal population  The Private Prison Information Act would help prevent abuse and unlawful conduct at private prisons by requiring public disclosure of information about the operation of these facilities                  The bill was endorsed by associations and unions representing law enforcement and correctional officers  including  Corrections USA  American Friends Service Committee
