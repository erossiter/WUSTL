Enforcement                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON   Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   Thursday said he would support the nomination of Julie Myers to be Assistant Secretary of Immigration and Customs Enforcement at the Department of Homeland Security   The following is the opening statement the Senator made at her nomination hearing       Welcome Ms  Myers to this hearing on your nomination to continue as Assistant Secretary for U S  Immigration and Customs Enforcement  ICE  at the Department of Homeland Security  As you have experienced first hand  this Committee subjects the nominees who come before it to rigorous scrutiny   During your nomination hearing in 2005  I and several of my colleagues raised concerns about whether you had sufficient experience and managerial ability to lead an agency such as ICE   a big and complicated agency  I ultimately voted against your nomination in Committee because of those concerns   As you know the Senate never acted  but the President gave you a recess appointment  You have now been Assistant Secretary at ICE for more than a year and a half  and the relevant criterion now becomes whether you have been doing a good enough job running this important agency to have overcome my earlier concerns All things considered  based on your performance and on more than 20 interviews conducted by members of Committee staff of people  inside ICE and outside of ICE  who have worked with you  I believe that you have what it takes to get the job done and will therefore vote to confirm your nomination        I have been impressed by your knowledge of the complicated issues facing ICE  You have provided thoughtful answers to our Committee s policy questions on a range of topics   Some of those who Committee staff interviewed were people who have worked with you during your tenure at ICE  including senior ICE managers  ICE field agents  advocacy groups from outside the government  GAO officials  and representatives of the DHS Inspector General s office   The reviews of your work from the people who are closest to it are positive   For the most part  the people we have spoken with describe you as a talented executive with a strong work ethic and very good management abilities   You have recruited and empowered experienced and talented senior managers   You have clearly improved ICE s financial situation  bringing on a permanent Chief Financial Officer  reaching out to ICE auditors  and helping engineer a dramatic financial turnaround   Still  ICE remains an agency with troubles  As the Committee that originated the legislation to create the Department of Homeland Security  we have a stake in seeing ICE realize its full potential and we want to work with you to make sure that happens and that it happens as soon as possible  So  I want to take just a moment to focus on a few of the agency s ongoing challenges      Created through an internal reorganization after the new Department of Homeland Security itself was established  ICE was forced to integrate the employees  missions  and cultures of core Customs programs at the Department of Treasury and immigration programs at the Immigration and Naturalization Service  INS   While various agreements have been drafted to delineate responsibilities between Customs and Border Protection  CBP  and ICE  additional work is needed  we conclude  to ensure proper communication and improved intelligence  and information sharing between the two agencies   Another problem is employee morale  which  according to surveys  remains low  The Partnership for Public Service and American University  in a survey of the Best Places to Work in the Federal Government  ranked ICE in the bottom 10 out of 222 federal agencies and sub agencies rated  ICE ranked 213th on  strategic management  and 218th on  performance based rewards and advancement   These ratings are based on candid employee surveys   I understand they may reflect in part the dissonance of the merger of component agencies and may predate you  But poor morale remains a concern to this committee     I am also concerned about the effect ICE s plan to restructure the Federal Protective Service and dramatically cut law enforcement positions will have on the security of federal employees and buildings  ICE s responsibility for apprehending  detaining  and deporting undocumented immigrants is a very important mission  With approximately 12 million undocumented immigrants in the country with only 27 500 detention beds  there is a real necessity to reserve beds for those who pose the greatest risk to the broader American community   For many of the others who must await a hearing before an immigration judge  we ve got a problem and we have to figure out a way to use supervised release programs or other alternatives to detention   We have a responsibility  according to our national values  to treat those we detain humanely   Just a few weeks ago  three people died while in immigration custody within weeks of each other  bringing the total number of deaths in ICE custody since 2004 to 65  This is a troubling record that raises many questions  and I want to hear more about how those deaths occurred and what you are doing to improve the situation   When you appeared before this committee in 2005  I expressed my concern about the treatment of asylum seekers   The Commission on International Religious Freedom   concerned about the number of asylum seekers who contend they are punished because of their religious faith   had reported that they are held in harsh  maximum security facilities alongside criminals  and are sometimes subject to mistreatment or arbitrary punishments  including excessive use of solitary confinement and the denial of basic medical needs      In February of this year  the Commission reported that most of its recommendations had not been implemented yet   two years later   giving ICE an overall grade of  D  for its progress  Because of my dissatisfaction on this matter  I introduced an amendment to a broader immigration reform bill to improve the treatment of asylum seekers  After negotiating with DHS  we did reach a compromise that was accepted by unanimous consent to the comprehensive immigration reform bill  Unfortunately  the measure did not move forward in Congress  But I have recently spoken to Secretary Chertoff about implementing the reforms we negotiated   He did agree to work with the Committee to improve the treatment of asylum seekers  and I am considering legislation to implement reforms that cannot be addressed administratively                Ms  Myers  many of the Commission s recommendations related to policies and programs under ICE s jurisdiction  and I m going to ask you to do all you can to implement the reforms embodied in our agreement  ICE is a vitally important agency with a daunting combination of missions  and daunting problems   Many of the problems  I repeat  are not of your making but you can help to address them   However  you and we have a lot more to do  I believe that  given the limited time remaining in this Administration  and your now demonstrated ability and commitment  you have earned the right to continue leading this agency and hopefully solving some of these problems I mentioned   I thank you for your service  and I look forward to your testimony      30
