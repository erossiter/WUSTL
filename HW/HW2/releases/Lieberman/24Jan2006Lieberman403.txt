today at the Committee   s opening round of investigative hearings       Hearing Statement Prepared for Sen  Joseph Lieberman     Preparing for a Catastrophe   The Hurricane Pam Exercise     January 24  2006  Washington  DC     Thank you Madam Chairman  Today we begin an intensified series of hearings that will continue over the next three weeks into government   s preparations before Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast on Aug  29 of last year     and government   s response in the hours  days  weeks and now months that followed  The title of today   s hearing is    Preparing for a Catastrophe   The Hurricane Pam Exercise         Preparing for Catastrophe     The phrase makes a mournful sound when said against the backdrop of the misery and destruction the world saw on television last year and that members of this committee still saw last week when we toured the Gulf Coast Katrina was a very powerful storm  but it would have caused much less misery and destruction had we prepared for it better  This August 30th headline in the New Orleans Times Picayune says it all   Katrina  The Storm We   ve Always Feared     The storm we   ve always feared  The storm people knew would hit one day  The storm they actually practiced for in the Hurricane Pam exercise during 2004 that is the topic of this hearing  In the 10 committee hearings on Katrina we have already held  in our staff interviews of more than 200 witnesses  in our review of tens of thousands of documents  we have already learned enough to be not just disappointed  but infuriated by the poor performance of all levels of government in Katrina  These conclusions should compel us to achieve top to bottom reform of the way we prepare for and respond to disasters  Katrina was not just predictable  It was predicted over and over again  As the FEMA Coordinator for the Hurricane Pam exercise told our investigative staff last Friday  Katrina was a    replication    of Pam  And Pam itself was staged in response to the flooding in Biloxi  Mississippi  in 1998  caused by Hurricane Georges that made state and local officials of the Gulf Coast realize they could be overwhelmed if and when    the big one    hit  The Hurricane Pam exercise in the spring and summer of 2004  actually and eerily predicted the emergency response crises and devastation that occurred last August and September  when Katrina hit the Gulf Coast   Today we will hear from four witnesses who participated in the Hurricane Pam exercise who will tell us that the problems we saw last August and September were known long before Katrina hit the Gulf Coast and even long before Pam predicted them  The fictional hurricane of the Pam exercise was a slow moving Category 3 hurricane  quite similar to Hurricane Katrina  except that in the fictional exercise  Pam hit New Orleans directly and Katrina ultimately blew about 15 miles to the east of the city  Had Katrina hit New Orleans dead on  the Pam exercise predicted 67 000 deaths  That gives us some idea of how much more catastrophic Katrina could have been and how urgent disaster preparations should have been  The Pam exercise also put state and local governments  and FEMA and its parent  the Department of Homeland Security  on notice that the people of New Orleans would experience exactly the problems that we all witnessed with anguish last August and early September  including  The inability to evacuate 100 000 people  who were left behind in the City after landfall   The desperate and horrific problems at the Superdome  The breakdown in the supply chain   The over reliance on too few to accomplish search and rescue missions with inadequate equipment  The inability of leaders at every level of government to maintain accurate and current situational awareness  The Hurricane Pam exercise also predicted widespread flooding throughout New Orleans  hospitals and nursing homes under water  hundreds of thousands of people displaced  and local first responders incapacitated   The Pam exercise gave DHS and FEMA explicit notice that state and local governments would be overwhelmed when New Orleans got hit with a catastrophic hurricane  and that comprehensive federal assistance would be necessary     But despite these dire warnings from Pam  preparations for Katrina were shockingly poor    Two to three days before Katrina hit the Gulf Coast  it became clear that it would be catastrophic  In fact  as Katrina approached the Gulf Coast two days before landfall     Saturday  August 27     FEMA issued a briefing document at 9 a m  declaring that the Pam    Exercise projection is exceeded by Hurricane Katrina real life impacts      The failure to heed the fictional Pam   s many warnings compounded the tragedy when Katrina hit in real time and with full fury  That is the sad story our committee   s hearings will tell in detail in the three weeks ahead  Before closing  and as we embark on this stage of the investigation  I feel compelled to say a few words about the conduct of this investigation  First  I want to thank Chairman Collins and her staff for working with me and my staff to conduct an aggressive and thoroughly bi partisan investigation  This has been ourno9rm on the Committee and I don   t want the Chairman to think I take it for granted   We have worked together as all investigative committees should  without partisan division and with a united view that our goal is to uncover what happened with respect to Hurricane Katrina so we can make sure our government is much better prepared the next time disaster strikes  Unfortunately  though  I cannot give the same high marks to the Executive branch for its response to our investigation   The problems begin at the White House  where there has been a near total lack of cooperation that has made it impossible  in my opinion  for us to do the thorough investigation we have a responsibility to do  Why does this matter  Here is an example   The Committee has found that on the evening before Katrina made landfall  DHS circulated to federal agencies sitting in the Homeland Security Operations Center a report that the storm had been upgraded to Category 5 and that       Any storm rated Category 4 or greater        will likely lead to severe flooding and or levee breaching   This could leave the New Orleans metro area submerged for weeks or months      The White House received this report at 1 47 a m  on Monday     several hours before Katrina made landfall  What happened to that report  Why was the President left so uninformed that he said four days later     I don   t think anyone anticipated the breech of the levees      At this point we can   t answer that critical question because the White House has produced just a very small portion of the documents we requested   They have opposed efforts to interview their personnel  And they have hindered our ability to obtain information from other federal agencies regarding White House actions in response to Katrina  Almost every question our staff has asked federal agency witnesses regarding conversations with  or involvement of  the White House has been met with a response that they could not answer on direction of the White House    There   s been no assertion of executive privilege  just a refusal to answer   Indeed  at yesterday   s staff interview of former FEMA Director Michael Brown  agency lawyers advised Mr  Brown not to say whether he spoke to the President or the Vice President  or comment on the substance of conversations he had with any other high level White House officials    This assertion of a kind of virtual immunity for the White House from inquiry has frustrated our Committee   s ability to learn     and tell     the full story of Katrina and it is unacceptable    While some agencies  like FEMA and the United States Coast Guard have been cooperative  a number of other executive agencies     including the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human Services     essentially ignored our document and information requests for months and to this day have produced much less than half the information we asked for    HHS has not produced a single requested witness for an interview     The Department of Homeland Security  which is at the center of our investigation because it has overall responsibility for national disaster preparedness and response  has produced too little  too late   Repeated requests for critical witnesses and documents have been ignored or delayed   It took until two weeks ago for DHS to give us a single witness the Committee requested outside of FEMA or the Coast Guard to interview   My staff believes that DHS has engaged in a conscious strategy of slow walking our investigation in the hope that we would run out of time to follow the investigation   s natural progression to where it leads  At this point  I cannot disagree  I hope the Committee will continue to pursue all these unanswered questions asked of the Executive branch until we have the information to answer the questions that must be answered  In the meantime  because hurricane season begins again in June and the threat of a terrorist attack persists  these hearings must go forward and the Committee   s report must be written with a sense of urgency to help America   s government be better prepared to protect America   s people from disasters     natural or unnatural     history tells us will come   In that spirit  I look forward to today   s witnesses and those that will follow in the three weeks ahead    30
