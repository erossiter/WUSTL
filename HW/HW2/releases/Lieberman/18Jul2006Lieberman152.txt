Autism Act of 2005

Committee on Health  Education  Labor and Pensions  HELP  Chairman Michael Enzi  R WY  and Ranking Member Ted Kennedy  D  MA   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  expressed support for S 843  the Combating Autism Act of 2005  which the HELP Authorization Committee plans to review on Wednesday  The Act opens up opportunities to study environmental exposures  such as the mercury based preservative thimerosal used in certain vaccines  and their association with Autism        The text of the letter is below         On the eve of the Committee   s mark up of the legislation  I am writing to express support for S 843  the Combating Autism Act of 2005  which the HELP authorization committee plans to mark up this week  I applaud my colleague from Connecticut  Senator Dodd  who along with Senator Santorum and our 41 bipartisan cosponsors  have developed legislation that significantly increases the federal government   s commitment to autism surveillance  diagnosis  treatment and prevention  which must be done now        Autism poses a host of still unanswered questions starting with the causes of the approximately 800 fold rise in the incidence of the condition between 1990 and 2001   We don   t know how to treat autism medically   We don   t understand how to best educate children with autism   We don   t know if future generations of children are at risk of autism and how best to protect them        One obvious area where the Combating Autism Act will help concerns the use of the mercury based preservative thimerosal in the majority of childhood vaccines during the 1990 2001 period   While these same vaccines are now basically free of thimerosal  in 2006  thimerosal is still present in certain drugs for pregnant women  in flu vaccine and in vaccines we ship around the world to children  particularly to developing countries   There is concern that exposure to mercury in vaccines in genetically susceptible populations dramatically increases the risk of autism  especially in males   Mercury is a potent neurotoxin   The    epidemic    of autism spectrum disorder in the United States that the American Academy of Pediatrics puts at 1 in 166  seems to have coincided with two thimerosal containing vaccines being added to the childhood vaccine schedule and its having been implemented on a national scale        To date  only one medium sized prospective epidemiologic study on the association between thimerosal in vaccines and the risk of autism has been carried out involving American children and its results have been called into question  suggesting  at the very least  a pressing need to attempt to replicate the study   s results   There is a growing body of thimerosal related epidemiologic research on our European counterparts  but European children   s exposure to thimerosal was 66  less than that of American children   We need more studies on the American population alone        In addition  there needs to be more bench research on thimerosal toxicity   The Institute of Medicine  IOM  found in 2004 that there was not sufficient evidence to support a causal link between thimerosal and autism   But the IOM did not consider research from the environmental toxicology field  nor did it consider that disease association rather than disease causality is the rule when talking about chronic diseases such as autism and environmental exposures   Lung cancer  heart failure and Alzheimer   s are all examples of diseases where environmental factors are known to increase the risk of the disease  though not    cause    them  per se        Both of these current research gaps   the need for more prospective studies on American children and more toxicology research    are addressed in the Combating Autism Act   I am very satisfied that the current language enlists NIEHS into the autism effort in a way that is has not been in the past   NIEHS possesses the expertise to examine environmental exposures  including thimerosal  which may have contributed to the rise in autism rates   NIEHS    well earned reputation for objectivity would be important in helping us to resolve this serious but contentious public health concern          Once again  I applaud the HELP Committee efforts in producing a substantive bill        Senator Joseph I  Lieberman      United States Senator       30
