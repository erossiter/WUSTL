Marshall Wittmann  202 224 4041                                                                                                Senator Lieberman s Floor Statement on Energy Independence                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Mr  President  I rise to speak about the energy legislation that will be the topic of the Senate this week   it is critically important   I congratulate the co chairs of the energy committee  particularly Senators Bingaman and Domenici  for the work that they ve done  along with other committees  including Commerce and the Environment committee that I m privileged to serve on       We re dealing here with a critical national crisis   In some ways  if we can adopt bipartisan strong energy security legislation  I think we will have dealt with the most serious challenge facing our country  because in dealing with our dependence on foreign sources of oil and reducing that dependence we can make our economy more secure  protect American consumers from the painful price spikes in the cost of gasoline and home heating oil and other fuels that they ve become all too accustomed to that not only affect and drain individual budgets  but really hurt our national economic growth potential  in reality   Second  we will make our nation more secure because no matter how strong we are militarily or even economically  if we end up depending so much on foreign sources of oil  our independence can be compromised   We cannot tolerate that       Here s the reality  97 percent of transportation in the United States is fueled by oil that we buy from a unified global oil market  Saudi Arabia holds 20 percent of the world s oil reserves   Iran has 10 percent   Iran   which is lead by a man who today repeatedly says to crowds in Iran   Imagine a world without America    Ten percent of the world s oil reserves are in Iran   Venezuela   lead by a virulently anti American president   holds 6 percent of the world s oil reserves   Russia has 4 5 percent  Libya 3 percent   The United States of America today   1 5 percent of the world s oil reserves       We cannot leave our national and economic security dependent therefore on a resource that lies largely in the hands of others   including other nations that are either volatile or undemocratic or aligned against the United States        This bill before us  H R  6  which combines the work of three or four different committees in the Senate  contains many significant provisions that would really reduce our nation s oil consumption and I truly commend the heads of these committees  chairmen and ranking members  for bringing this legislation forward         This may be the only opportunity we have in this 110th session of Congress   certainly the only opportunity we re going to have in this first year of the 110th session   to confront our energy dependence and deal with it   And therefore I think it s very important that we work hard to make this bill as strong as we possibly can and of course as bi partisan as we possibly can         Our constituents   our nation   just watched the Senate unfortunately grind itself into gridlock over the comprehensive immigration bill   Let s not turn that show into a double feature with stalemate over energy security legislation as well   certainly not as energy prices soar and American consumers sour   I want to speak briefly  Mr  President  in favor of a bipartisan consensus amendment that I and others will introduce as part of this debate         I m speaking on behalf of a bipartisan and geographically diverse group of Senators led by Senators Bayh  Brownback  Salazar  Coleman  and many others   We will offer an amendment to replace the gasoline savings goal of H R  6  the underlying legislation  with Title I of our so called DRIVE Act   DRIVE  in this strange world of acronyms  stands for Dependence Reduction through Innovation in Vehicles and Energy       This is the successor to an earlier version whose title didn t make a good acronym  but whose title I loved  which was the Set America Free Act   because right now we are not free  we are dependent on others for our energy       The DRIVE Act s Title I  which we will introduce as an amendment  would direct the Executive Branch of our government to identify within 9 months  and to publish within 18 months  federal requirements that will achieve a 2 5 million barrel per day reduction in U S  oil consumption by 2016  a 7 million barrel per day reduction by 2026  and a 10 million barrel per day reduction by 2031   That s about 50 percent of the per day oil consumption of the United States today   This amendment would also direct the Office of Management and Budget to publish an analysis identifying the oil savings projected to be achieved by each requirement to be created  and demonstrating that the listed measures will  in the aggregate  achieve the overall specified oil savings   Finally  the measure includes specific requirements for the Executive Branch to evaluate  review  and update the action plan so we can achieve these critical national goals       Mr  President  the targets for savings in H R  6 are expressed in terms of American gasoline consumption   The amendment would express them in terms of what we think is a more relevant standard  which is overall oil consumption  because reducing gasoline use can be achieved by increasing the use of diesel  which of course is also made from oil         So oil consumption reduction is  in our opinion  the more appropriate goal for this law  and that s why we re going to introduce this as an amendment to H R  6         The gasoline savings goal in H R  6 amounts to about a 20 percent reduction in projected oil consumption by 2030   23 years from now   The oil savings requirement in our amendment amounts to a 35 percent reduction in projected oil consumption in 2030   That s a significant increase in reduction  and one I think we can achieve if we set the goal as high as it should be   high enough to cut our dependence on foreign oil and free America from that dependence         I think there is broad  bipartisan support for this amendment   It has 26 cosponsors  and we will offer it early in the debate     I note the presence of one of my colleagues on the floor who I know wants to speak during this first half hour of morning business  so I ll just say very briefly  We ve got an opportunity to do something right for the American people if we can work across party lines   and none of this really should be partisan   to get this done         I note in that regard  with some regret  that some of my colleagues have indicated an intention to once again introduce an amendment that will open up the Arctic Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling   Obviously  they not only have a right to do so  but this has been debated often in the Senate   My only word of caution is that I fear that such an amendment  if it as attached to this bill  may doom the overall bill and therefore we would all lose as a result of it         Mr  President  I thank the Chair for this time   I say to my colleagues that we ve got a real fresh opportunity here  a kind of fresh start   This institution is in need of a bipartisan agreement that solves some real problems   like the cost of gasoline  home heating oil  and other fuels that the American people are facing   So it s not just that the institution would benefit in its credibility with a bipartisan agreement on this critical issue   the country really needs us to show leadership on this one and I am confident as we begin this debate that we can rise to the opportunity       I thank the Chair and I yield the floor
