                                                      WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Ranking Democrat on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  Thursday announced he was joining Senator John McCain  R Ariz   on a strong lobbyist reform proposal to rein in the excesses demonstrated by the Jack Abramoff case    The Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act of 2005  S  2128  was introduced following an investigation in the Indian Affairs Committee into the activities of lobbyist Abramoff  who bilked several Indian tribes of millions of dollars for personal enrichment   Abramoff pleaded guilty this week        The Abramoff scandal has revealed large gaps in our current lobbying laws that cry out for legislative response and reform     Senator Lieberman said     It is imperative that we take steps to end corrupted and corrosive lobbying activities by tightening our lobbyist regulatory laws  Now is our opportunity to restore the trust of the American people in their elected government and to the best of our ability  scrub clean the point where money  politics  and government meet       Following is the Senator   s full statement    Good afternoon    I want to speak with you today about the Jack Abramoff scandal  its consequences for our government  and what we in Congress can do about it   Mr  Abramoff   s admissions in federal courts in Washington and Miami this week that he committed serious crimes have at least three sober and indisputable consequences for us    First  it reminds us  as the corporate scandals of recent years have  of the age old lesson that unbridled greed will lead people to immoral  unethical  and illegal behavior  and we need stronger laws to expose  prevent  and punish it    Second  Mr  Abramoff has grossly corrupted an otherwise important and honorable profession in our democracy     the representation of people in petitioning their government   We must now strengthen our laws regulating lobbying  not just to stop those who do it wrong  but to respect those who do it right    Third  Mr  Abramoff and those in our government who became his partners in greed have demeaned our political system and further diminished the trust of the American people in their government  which is essential to our democracy   They have sent a message that results in Washington go to the highest private bidder  not to the greatest public interest   That is wrong  destructive  and unacceptable    In America  we believe in the rule of law  We see the law as the expression of our best values  as the codification of our understanding of right and wrong  as our commitment to encourage right behavior and deter and punish wrongful conduct     By his guilty pleas  Mr  Abramoff has acknowledged that he violated our laws   But the seedy story of his behavior reveals much that may have been technically legal but nonetheless was clearly wrong       Because the effect of public corruption is so damaging  anyone who has anything to do with our government should hold themselves  and be held to  a standard of not just of doing what is legal  but of doing what is right   And we who are lawmakers must always be ready to make what is clearly wrong also clearly illegal    The Abramoff scandal has revealed large gaps in our current lobbying laws that cry out for legislative response and reform   Today  I am announcing my decision to join Senator John McCain as Democratic cosponsor of lobbying reform legislation  S 2128  the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act of 2005  which he introduced shortly before the Senate adjourned in December   At that time  he asked me to join him as co sponsor  I said I would review his proposal and make a decision as soon as possible      I have completed my review and enthusiastically join John as co sponsor    This strong legislation was crafted in the aftermath of a characteristically tough and independent investigation into Mr  Abramoff   s outrageous activities conducted by Senator McCain as Chairman of the Indian Affairs Committee  along with his Ranking member  Senator Byron Dorgan   It directly responds to a number of abuses uncovered by both Senator McCain and the Department of Justice investigation which led to Mr  Abramoff   s plea bargain this week    For example  the legislation requires more frequent and more detailed disclosure of the activities of lobbyists and  for the first time  covers grassroots lobbying firms  I am not talking about true grassroots organizations  which are democracy at its best  that ask and organize their members to petition their government   I am talking about the paid  professional lobbyists retained to conduct mass campaigns aimed at influencing Members of Congress  like the ones Abramoff and his associate Michael Scanlon organized to bilk Indian tribes of millions of dollars and to circumvent the existing lobbying disclosure laws     In response to Mr  Abramoff   s lavish financing of Congressional globe trotting  this bill requires lobbyists to disclose all payments for travel made or arranged  including detailed itemizations of trips   It also requires Members of Congress and staff to pay the fair market value for use of a private plane  and values sports and entertainment tickets in skyboxes at the cost of the highest priced ticket in the arena     To address the problem of the revolving door between government and the private sector  which the Abramoff case again highlights  our proposal doubles from one to two years the    cooling off    period during which senior members of the executive branch  Members of Congress  and senior congressional staff are restricted from lobbying their onetime colleagues    In an attempt to strengthen disclosure of lobbyist lawmaker interactions  Senator McCain and I would require lobbying disclosure filings to include information on campaign contributions to federal candidates  their political action committees  and political party committees  and disclosure of lobbyist contributions to events or institutions that honor or recognize public officials     These are but a few of the provisions that  had they been law  might have prevented the all encompassing scandal that now embroils this great Capital city and the country that depends upon it  It is imperative that we take steps to end corrupted and corrosive lobbying activities by tightening our lobbyist regulatory laws  Now is our opportunity to restore the trust of the American people in their elected government and to the best of our ability  scrub clean the point where money  politics  and government meet    I look forward to working with Senator Susan Collins  Chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  on which I serve as Ranking Democrats  and to which our bill has been referred  and to working with Senate leaders to turn these proposed reforms into law this year   Thank you                                                          30
