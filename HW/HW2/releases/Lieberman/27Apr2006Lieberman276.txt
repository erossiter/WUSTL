Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement Thursday as he and Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   released proposed findings and recommendations from their seven month Hurricane Katrina investigation   The Senators will present the report to Committee members for approval next week   Senator Lieberman also made public additional views regarding the White House role in the Katrina response  All documents may be read here  http   hsgac senate gov index cfm Fuseaction Links Katrina   Senator Lieberman   s statement at the press conference is below          Thanks very much  Senator Collins   Madam Chairman  I m very proud to be standing with you today to announce that we have agreed on this report  findings and a series of recommendations that we will make to our full committee next Tuesday          This has been an enormous undertaking  and I believe the report and the findings and the recommendations represent an enormous accomplishment in response to an enormous catastrophe        Thanks to Senator Collins  leadership  once again  this investigation and the drafting of the report itself were bipartisan    in fact  nonpolitical        And that allowed our staffs to come together and work as one    the two of us and our committee members to come together and work as one  across party lines  to deal with an unprecedented disaster  catastrophe  in American life  and the obvious failure of our government to prepare for and respond adequately to it          It is on the basis of the facts that this nonpolitical investigation found that we present what I believe are hard hitting findings and constructive and progressive recommendations          And I thank you  Madam Chairman  again for the leadership that you have shown  and to say to you again how grateful I am for our working partnership in this and so many other activities        I believe this is the most complete analysis yet of what occurred prior to  during and after the most serious natural disaster in America in a century    and the first disaster that tested all levels of our government since September 11th          Clearly  all levels of our government failed that test        We ve established four overarching causes for government s widespread failures before and after Katrina   One  for years  government officials at all levels    federal  state and local    neglected their duties to prepare for a forewarned catastrophe        We ve called our report   A Nation Still Unprepared    In this case  we could say   Hurricane Katrina  a nation forewarned and still unprepared          Second  government officials at all levels failed to realize that Katrina was a catastrophe  as it took shape and hit    not a conventional hurricane        Third  they did little or actually did wrong  made poor decisions in the days before landfall  which inevitably doomed the post landfall response         And fourth  the absence of effective leadership at all levels of government foreclosed the possibility of overcoming the previous lack of preparedness          These failures of leadership and government cost lives and multiplied the anguish of the storm s survivors          Despite the warnings that I have referred to  the federal government  the state of Louisiana  the city of New Orleans failed to prepare for and respond to the predicted flooding that  in fact  did trap tens of thousands of New Orleans residents        This lack of preparation was a gross dereliction of duty on the  part of nearly all the agencies responsible for ensuring the safety of the people of the Gulf Coast  and New Orleans in particular        Starting at the top  the White House was told long before Katrina that FEMA did not have the capability to handle a catastrophe of this kind  but failed to adequately address that shortcoming          Despite the clear warnings before landfall that Katrina would be catastrophic  the president and the White House were not sufficiently engaged when they should have been initiating an aggressive response        Although the president and the White House were following events after landfall  they still seemed surprisingly detached until two days later  when they began to marshal the full resources of the federal government        Homeland Security Secretary Chertoff and the department he led lacked a basic understanding of the federal government s blueprint for responding to a catastrophe  a disaster just like Katrina  which is the National Response Plan and  in fact  hadn t even assigned some of DHS s response obligations to any one in the department before Katrina hit        On the days leading to landfall  neither Secretary Chertoff nor his top aides carried a clear sense of urgency  and thereby lost precious time in readying themselves and the government s resources to respond to almost certain disaster        On the day of landfall  the department s Homeland Security Operations Center  the central federal agency for monitoring and distributing information in a time of crisis    natural or terrorist    failed miserably  inexplicably and infuriatingly by failing to put together the overwhelming evidence before it to understand what was happening and communicate the catastrophic dimensions of what was occurring in New Orleans to key decision makers  including the president of the United States        The delays in the federal response that resulted likely increased Katrina s death toll and assuredly compounded the suffering of her victims        FEMA Director Michael Brown claimed to understand Katrina s danger the weekend before landfall  but his leadership did not reflect it   In fact  his leadership simply failed to rise to the challenge of Katrina or the mandate and responsibility that his office gave him    He was presiding over an agency weakened by a 15 percent vacancy rate for over a year and senior political management largely without emergency management experience          That hurt during this catastrophe   The agency failed to train and equip staff for likely operations   It failed to arrange adequate contracts in advance to transport necessary commodities   And it failed to preposition communications equipment    a critical oversight        The agency even failed to use the assets that were available in the area  dispatching too few emergency response teams to the region too late  At a state and local level  Governor Blanco and Mayor Nagin equally failed to prepare and to coordinate and deploy available state and local resources that needed to be there for Hurricane Katrina  Most egregiously  for each of us  there are a parts of this story that  as we gathered the facts of this story  were increasing infuriating  the city and state failed to arrange transportation for the 100 000 people in New Orleans who they were forewarned would be unable or unwilling to evacuate themselves  Louisiana was simply not adequately prepared to take care of the old  sick  and incapacitated under the catastrophic conditions they were long warned would come with a hurricane like Katrina        The pivotal failures of the months and days leading up to the storm might  as I have said been less if effective leadership  at all levels of government  in the days before and after the crisis  had there to inspire and drive a more aggressive  efficient  and comprehensive  response  That was not the case for the City of New Orleans  the State of Louisiana  or the federal government of the United States        In national catastrophes  the nation does look to the President  who is uniquely charged and powered to lead our country   s response to a catastrophe of Katrina   s magnitude  President Bush won our admiration and gratitude for the way he took charge in responding to the attacks against America of September 11th  In the case of Hurricane Katrina  he failed to provide that same presidential leadership when it was needed  and America suffered        The report Senator Collins and I will propose to the Committee recounts therefore a double tragedy of epic proportions     a tragedy caused by nature and another tragedy compounded by human folly and failures of leadership        These conclusions come from the facts which are painstakingly detailed in a report that we will present to our Committee  Senator Collins and I are of like mind and expression on all elements of this report  but there are three on which I have chosen to provide additional views  One is on the question of who is responsible for most of the failures of unified command  The Second is on the role of the White House and the President in events surrounding Katrina  and the level of cooperation of the White House to the Committee on this investigation  Therefore  I will submit additional views on these three matters  In too many instances  they came to see our investigation as a nuisance and their response as discretionary          The worst offender was one that should have stood above the fray and worked hardest with the Committee to uncover the government   s failings in Katrina  the White House   The President stated early on that   quote      Congress also has an important oversight function to perform    and he said     quoting again      I will work with members of both parties to make sure this effort is thorough      End of quote  The fact  in my opinion  is our Committee faced a White House less willing to cooperate with this Senate investigation than any other I have witnessed in my 18 years as a Senator       As a result  I believe the White House wrongly deprived the Committee and the American people of the ability to fully assess the federal government   s response to Hurricane Katrina        On the critical question of the White House role in preparing for and responding to this catastrophe  how then do we assess  since there was not full cooperation in answering our questions from the White House  But based on the information we were able to obtain and based on what we all saw  and as you read the report  you will see it is very comprehensive  with new records of information on the White House  about the gathering storm  and the impact it had on August 29  2005        I have written in my additional views about what I think are the two critical roles of the President in a crisis  and the same could be said  but in a lesser way  because of the lesser offices  of the Governor and Mayor  The first is to assume control  marshal the resources at your command and direct them to respond with a sense of urgency and effectiveness to the crisis        The second is what might be called the symbolic  but critically important role  of leadership  which is to be visible  to be present at the helm  to reassure the people who are directly affected by the crisis  and  in fact  the country as a whole  that the government is responding and there is reason for confidence and hope        At each level of government  there was a failure of leadership in both of these areas and it had consequences  disastrous consequences  for the victims of this storm  I would say that at the federal level  and at the other levels  that the President  the Governor  Mayor  each  as chief executives must be held accountable for the failures in the response to the storm and must be reminded that they have the authority to hold others under them accountable for failures in the crisis        Let me just say a final and brief word about our recommendations  The records we   ve compiled  the findings  show that things can not go on         The ultimate value of the report  in my opinion  will be what is done in reaction to it  And I want to suggest two possible courses of response that I hope will happen  The first is that I think that this report is a primer for all in our government of how they should act in a crisis  to see what should have been done and what was not done  Look at the few cases  the Coast Guard  for instance  where what was done was exemplary  and to adjust their conduct and planning based on the reading of that primary        I   d like to believe that this report will be required throughout all levels of government and emergency response and preparedness  from City Hall in New Orleans to the Oval Office in the White House        The second is specific recommendations and I simply want to endorse and embrace what Senator Collins said about FEMA and the National Preparedness Agency  The fact is that some times an organization  private or public  become so disreputable  beyond repair  that you need to dissolve it  And that is the conclusion that we   ve come to on FEMA  It is a sick organization and it has totally lost the confidence of the people of America  who it was created to protect in a time of crisis  So our recommendation is to dissolve FEMA  clear the table  and begin anew  fresh  And we   ve asked ourselves  what can we best do to organize the extraordinary resources of the federal government of the United States to prepare for  mitigate and respond  oversee the recovery from disasters  and particularly the catastrophes that are beyond the resources of state and local governments  And that   s why we   ve proposed this National Preparedness and Response Agency  It will be a strong  powerful  and a distinct entity within the Department of Homeland Security  reporting in time of crisis to the President         We think we are recommending the structure that America needs to be prepared and to be protected  Ultimately  its effectiveness will depend on the quality of the people who are put in key positions in this new authority and that   s where we intend to place some minimal requirements in the statute that people put in these critical positions the experience and ability that gives us confidence that they be ready to do their jobs in a catastrophe as damaging as Hurricane Katrina was          30
