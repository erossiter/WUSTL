Governmental Affairs Committee has approved legislation Thursday authored by Chairman Susan Collins  R ME  and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D CT  that would reform the nation   s emergency management system to enable it to better prepare for and respond to a disasters   Entitled the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act  the bill would implement many of the findings of the Committee s Hurricane Katrina report  including reconstituting FEMA  improving emergency staffing  strengthening enhancing planning and preparedness  facilitating better communications and interoperability capabilities among emergency responders  improving emergency assistance programs  and reducing waste  fraud  and abuse        The bill addresses shortcomings in many of the vital preparation and response areas determined by the Committee   s eight month investigation into Hurricane Katrina as necessitating congressional action   While some of the 88 recommendations that flowed from this investigation can be adopted by administrative action  the Post  Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act consists of important steps that only Congress can take        Hurricane Katrina showed us in tragic terms that we need a new way to conduct disaster mitigation  preparation  response  and recovery efforts   If we do not reform flaws revealed during Katrina  we will see more unnecessary human suffering and destruction of communities   Our bill puts forth a careful and comprehensive program for improvement of our emergency management system   This is no academic exercise  it is a concrete  nuts and bolts plan designed to rebuild and strengthen a broken system   said Senator Collins           This legislation begins to address some of the most egregious problems we encountered in our Katrina investigation     Senator Lieberman said      The goal is to save people   s lives and ease the recovery of survivors by bringing together the skills  resources  and missions for effective preparedness and response to catastrophes when local and state agencies are overwhelmed by a terror attack or a natural disaster          The bill strengthens FEMA by giving it special status within the Department of Homeland Security  restoring its preparedness authority  requiring its leaders to have appropriate experience  and protecting it from departmental reorganizations that could erode its budget and assets   The Senate has already adopted this major element of the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act   On July 11  Senators Collins and Lieberman offered an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2007 to keep FEMA an independent agency within the Department of Homeland Security  similar to the Coast Guard  The measure was approved by the

criminal penalties for misrepresentation of assistance needs    Require FEMA to develop housing and recovery strategies  increase hazard mitigation assistance  and give FEMA the authority to provide
