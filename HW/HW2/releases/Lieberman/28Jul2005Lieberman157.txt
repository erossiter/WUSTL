     WASHINGTON     Senators Joe Lieberman and Chris Dodd announced today that they secured more than  2 5 billion over the next 5 years for transportation projects throughout Connecticut          Transportation Reauthorization Bill Conference Committee is collecting signatures today from Senate and House conferees  including Lieberman  for its final report  which includes numerous important transportation projects for the state and increases what Connecticut received under the previous authorization bill by 19              The Transportation Bill should be an enormous success for Connecticut     Lieberman said      Over the summer  as one of the conferees  I fought hard for as much funding for the state as possible and for increasing Connecticut   s share over what it received under the previous bill   I expect to be able to declare victory on both fronts              Each road  bridge  highway or transit point in Connecticut is a vital link in our state   s transportation chain     said Dodd      These critically important resources can help strengthen that chain  improve our state   s economy  and ultimately put Connecticut on track to a brighter future and a better quality of life for Connecticut citizens   Our state   s Congressional delegation worked hard to increase these dollar amounts  and I   m pleased to see this measure reflect that           Lieberman  a senior member of the Environmental and Public Works Committee and a member of the Transportation Reauthorization Bill Conference Committee  worked to create a funding formula that compensated states like Connecticut with high population densities that often serve as vital thruways for commercial and recreational traffic   Hard fought modifications to the formula are what made Connecticut   s 19  increase over the previous bill a possibility   The original bill out of Committee  which Lieberman opposed  called for a 10  increase  that number was increased on the Senate floor to 15   and the Conference Report raised that to 19         As part of the Conference Committee  Lieberman was also able to secure a number of Connecticut projects  including one of the largest Connecticut projects in the bill  a  50 million earmark designated for congestion mitigation  safety  and capacity improvements along I 95 from the state border with New York to the border with Rhode Island   This money can also be used to replace the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge in New Haven   Dodd also secured significant funding for the state   s busiest roadways  including  10 million to replace the Pearl Harbor Memorial Bridge   7 5 million to widen I 95 east of New Haven and  7 5 million to widen I 84 between Danbury and Waterbury          This new  50 million program for I 95 in our state will go a long way toward relieving congestion in this heavily traveled area     Lieberman said        The Conference Report also provides Connecticut with nearly  485 million between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2009 for transit activities across Connecticut   Dodd  as a senior member of the Banking  Housing and Urban Affairs Committee  worked to secure over  130 million in additional discretionary funding for important projects that seek to improve transit service for riders          Projects include  6 million for road improvements to Adriaen   s Landing in Hartford   32 million to build an Intermodal facility in Bridgeport   8 million for a new parking garage in Middletown  and  4 million for the construction of an access road to the Reidville Industrial Park in Waterbury         A full
