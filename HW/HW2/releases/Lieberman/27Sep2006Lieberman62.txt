often drive Department of Homeland Security decisions to use interagency contracting  according to a Government Accountability Office study requested by House and Senate homeland security committee members and released Wednesday                   The report  entitled     Interagency Contracting   Improved Guidance Would Enable the Department of Homeland Security to Address Risks     found that in Fiscal year 2005  DHS spent  17 5 billion on contracted purchases  37 percent of which was through other agencies    contracts and contracting services  Yet GAO found that DHS lacks sufficient agency wide guidance for use of interagency contracts and that DHS does not always consider contracting alternatives to ensure good value                   The report is the first of a series of reviews of DHS contracting practices being conducted by GAO at the request of Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee Ranking Member Daniel Akaka  D Hi   and House Homeland Security Committee Ranking Member Bennie G  Thompson  D Miss  among others                   Senator Lieberman said     As someone who is fighting in Congress to secure more scarce federal funding for port security  chemical security  grants to first responders  and all the other critical functions of DHS  I am frustrated by the inability of the department to make each dollar stretch as far as it can   It appears the Department routinely enters multi million dollar interagency contracts without shopping around to see if there is a better deal  and without even keeping track of the millions of dollars of fees DHS is being charged by other agencies                      Senator Akaka said     Interagency contracts are a high risk game when agencies such as the Department of Homeland Security lack the controls and sufficient personnel to oversee the billions of dollars spent on contract goods and services   Although interagency contracts may offer economic benefits by leveraging federal purchasing power  the benefits may come at a risk  which is why we have asked GAO to engage in a wide ranging reviewing of DHS contracting procedures                        Congressman Thompson said     The report validates what I have been saying for some time   The way that procurement operations are structured at the Department  the Chief Procurement Officer lacks the necessary authority and staffing resources to reign in the other procurement shops within this behemoth agency   Every wasted homeland security dollar is one more lost opportunity to make the nation more secure                     The report documents specific weaknesses in DHS procurement oversight and use of interagency contracts       n      DHS has only five staff members assigned to department wide oversight responsibilities for  17 5 billion in acquisitions       n      Customs and Border Patrol placed orders totaling  51 7 million through 15 year old interagency contracting agreements without determining whether the agreements were still a good value for the agency       n      The Office of Procurement Operations had difficulty locating contract files that GAO requested for review  When the files were located  GAO found that they lacked key documentation       n      When CBP terminated an order placed with a General Service Administration  schedule contractor due to lack of contractor performance in the amount of  1 3 million  CBP failed to refer the dispute to the GSA contracting officer and the government did not recover its costs       n      DHS placed two orders worth  9 million and  45 million through a GSA contracting service provider without any evidence that DHS determined that the GSA vehicle was the best method for acquiring the needed services                     GAO also notes that the Secretary of DHS has not taken adequate action to ensure department wide acquisition oversight and suggests that Congress should require the Secretary to report on efforts to provide the DHS Chief Procurement Officer with sufficient authority over procurement activities of all DHS components                   Upcoming GAO reports requested as part of this series will examine the reliance of DHS on contractors and DHS acquisitions of major systems         30
