CT  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  and U S  Representative John B  Larson  D CT  today wrote to Social Security Commissioner Jo Anne Barnhardt requesting reconsideration of a proposal to close the Social Security office in Bristol and merge its operations with an office in New Britain and expressing their opposition to the proposed consolidation        In the letter  the legislators outlined arguments raised during meetings with the community and local officials in Bristol   They also participated in a public meeting with representatives from the Social Security Administration on October 5 at Bristol City Hall       The text of the letter is below      October 12  2006     Ms  Jo Anne B  Barnhart    Commissioner Social Security Administration    6401 Security Boulevard    Baltimore  MD 21235 0001      RE        Proposed closing consolidation of the Bristol  CT Social Security Office to New Britain       Dear Commissioner Barnhart       We would like to respectfully request reconsideration of the proposal to close the Bristol Social Security Office   We are united in believing that this proposal should be rejected   As you know  Regional Commissioner Manuel Vaz and Government Relations Director Kurt Czarnowski of the Boston Regional Office visited Bristol on Thursday October 5th to explain the proposal   We were pleased to hear Mr  Vaz emphasize that no final decision has been made on this matter  and we were on hand to listen to the public   s response          First  we note that the alleged savings would be minimal since the staff caseload for Bristol appears to be virtually identical to the staff caseload in New Britain   Therefore  there would be no cost savings from personnel   Based on demographic data shown in the Consolidation of the New Britain and Bristol Service Areas report submitted to our offices  the Bristol office serves approximately 12 000 clients with a total staff of five  5  employees   In addition  the report shows that the New Britain office services approximately 35 000 clients with a total staff of sixteen  16  employees   The Bristol office employs a third  1 3  of the staff than the New Britain office but handles a comparable number of social security cases        The Bristol Chamber of Commerce and City Council Members made it abundantly clear that Bristol is in fact a regional hub  separate and unique from New Britain   The surrounding communities of Plymouth  Terryville  and Burlington access the Bristol office and would find transportation to the New Britain Social Security Office a hardship   In fact  the transportation infrastructure  as it currently exists  cannot meet the needs of Bristol residents and the surrounding towns should they need to travel to New Britain   The Dial A Ride Program from some towns will not transport clients to New Britain and is a program that is overwhelmed by current demands      The Mayor of Plymouth testified that transportation to the New Britain Office would be a tremendous burden and nearly impossible for Plymouth residents   The town would not be able to provide Plymouth residents with access to a Social Security Office in New Britain   The Paratransit Regional Director testified that use of the town transportation system has already doubled between the years 2000 to 2006  and that they would not be able to accommodate a sudden increase for additional services      Many residents who access the Bristol Social Security Office do not possess their own vehicle   Taking into consideration those individuals who do own automobiles  there is no direct route to the New Britain office and the additional travel and cost of gas for those on a fixed income creates an additional burden they cannot afford      The Bristol Social Service employees took the recommended bus route from Bristol to New Britain   They stated at the meeting that this travel entailed three hours and three transfers to make a round trip  without counting the time involved for a representative to meet with them   We cannot ask that kind of travel and time of our disabled and elderly  Additional testimony from the citizens stated that many of the power scooters and wheelchairs could not keep batteries charged long enough for the bus ride  and that the buses could not accommodate all types of these battery powered vehicles      The United Way recently completed a senior needs assessment for the area  see enclosed   The study pointed out six areas for improvement  two of which were transportation and access to services   This study also confirmed what census research on Bristol had shown   Bristol is a city with a higher population of senior residents  it has a senior population that is growing as is the population as a whole  and it has a higher percentage of disabled in this community than other cities in Connecticut      Finally  citizens attending the meeting expressed very serious concerns about their lack of computer access  and dissatisfaction with the telephone service they have received from the New Britain office in the past  Although the Social Security Administration offers online services  many residents to do not have computer access   This would create another difficulty for many people   In contrast  citizens were extremely satisfied with the quality of service and interactions they had at the Bristol office      The citizens and public servants of the City of Bristol have brought a new perspective demonstrating the need for a Social Security Office to remain in Bristol  They clearly stated they need the local office  and the compliments of the staff at the Bristol Office were generous and in notable quantity   We are united in believing that this proposal should be rejected   We ask that you review the issues that have been brought to our attention and strongly recommend that you reject the consolidation proposal                                                                         Sincerely         CHRISTOPHER J  DODD                   JOSEPH I  LIEBERMAN                  JOHN B  LARSON     United States Senator                             United States Senator                      Member of Congress     CC  Mr  Manuel J  Vaz  Regional Commissioner      30
