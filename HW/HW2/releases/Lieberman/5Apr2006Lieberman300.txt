Security Legislation

and Lieberman                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Washington   Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Susan Collins  and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman today considered Port Security legislation that was authored by Senators Collins and Patty Murray  D WA  and was cosponsored by Senator Lieberman  Senator Norm Coleman  R MN  is also a cosponsor  The Committee heard testimony from key stakeholders in our maritime security system who expressed the urgent need to enact comprehensive port security legislation   Witnesses included   port officials  Representatives Jane Harman  D CA  and Dan Lungren  R CA   who have introduced similar legislation in the House  and officials from the Department of Homeland Security  Chamber of Commerce and International Brotherhood of Teamsters   Senator Murray also testified               Senator Collins said     This hearing builds on our extensive efforts to enhance the security of our nation   s maritime transportation system and the international supply chain   Seaports are more than waterfront facilities   They are crucial links in a supply chain that includes all modes of transportation and that reaches across the country and around the world   They also are profoundly and unacceptably at risk     She added     Al Qaeda has a stated goal of causing maximum harm to the American people and maximum damage to the American economy   Clearly  our cargo ports provide a tempting target   We cannot eliminate the risk of terrorist attack  but better supply chain security can build a stronger shield against terrorism without hampering trade   Indeed  greater security can promote trade and strengthen the global economy by building confidence and trust           Senator Lieberman said     The fact is  at any given moment  our government still has too little knowledge about the contents of thousands of multi ton containers that are loaded onto trucks  trains  and barges for shipment into and across the heart of this nation every day  The nightmare scenario we all want to avoid is the smuggling of a nuclear bomb or a dirty bomb within a shipping container  We need a comprehensive  coordinated  and multi layered strategy to protect not just cargo and cargo containers  but ships  piers  ports  and maritime workers as well   We need to do this to protect our national and economic security before terrorists strike  The GreenLane Martitime Cargo Security Act would do just that               Senator Murray said   Just this morning  Americans learned of the smuggling of 21 Chinese nationals into the Port of Seattle in a cargo container   What keeps me up at night is the thought that terrorists or deadly weapons could be next   Senator Murray said    It is far past time to put in place a strong security regime to protect our residents and our economy and the GreenLane bill does exactly that   I applaud Senators Collis and Lieberman for holding today s hearing and working to move this critical legislation forward         Approximately 95 percent of our nation   s trade  worth nearly  1 trillion  enters or leaves through our seaports   Foreign vessels carry the bulk of the approximately 800 million tons of goods that come into our country   In fiscal year 2005 alone  more than eleven million containers arrived on American soil by sea and this number is growing at a rate of over 10 percent a year   While this figure represents robust trade  it also signals a considerable risk to our nation   s security                     The GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act was introduced last year after close consultation with key stakeholders including port authorities  major retailers and importers  carriers  labor organizations  supply chain managers  security and transportation experts  and Federal and state agencies   The Dubai Ports World deal and recent incidents in which Chinese nationals have successfully arrived at U S  ports after remaining undetected in sealed cargo containers underscore the flaws in our current maritime security structure that would be addressed though this legislation          Specifically  the bill would                  Protect Americans by making our cargo and seaports more secure   mitigating a dangerous vulnerability                   Help prevent a lengthy shutdown of America s seaports in the event of an incident   protecting America s economy from severe disruption                  Provide layered security at every step of the supply chain while keeping it efficient                 Push the borders out so we can focus our limited resources on suspect cargo        The bill improves security at America s ports by establishing                 The GreenLane  comprised of supply chain participants who voluntarily meet the highest level of security  allows our security services to better identify and respond to potential threats and provides real incentives to importers to enhance their supply chain security measures                 Minimum security standards for all cargo containers entering the U S  and requirements that strengthen current cargo security programs                 The Office of Cargo Security Policy to ensure accountability and coordination of cargo security policies  procedures   regulations at the Department of Homeland Security and with other agencies                 Joint Operations Centers to ensure a coordinated  measured response and the resumption and flow of commerce in the event of an incident or heightened national security threat level                 The Act also authorizes  835 million for Port Security Grants  the Container Security Initiative and C TPAT generated through the collection of customs fees        30
