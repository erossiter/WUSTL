Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Joseph Lieberman announced that they have reached an agreement with House negotiators on their legislation to strengthen FEMA  paving the way for the bill to be included as part of the Department of Homeland Security spending bill  which will be considered by Congress later this month   In the agreement with leaders of several House Committees  FEMA would be strengthened and become an independent entity within the Department of Homeland Security with the same protections currently provided to the U S  Coast Guard  nearly identical to the Collins Lieberman FEMA legislation  The provision was one of the key findings of the Senate Homeland Security Committee   s report     Hurricane Katrina  A Nation Still Unprepared           Senator Collins said     I am extremely pleased that we were able to reach this agreement  which implements many of the recommendations of the Homeland Security  Committee s Hurricane Katrina report  This legislation will provide FEMA with the authority  resources  and leadership necessary to help us be better prepared for the next catastrophe  whether it is natural disaster or a terrorist attack         Senator Lieberman said     Hurricane Katrina exposed the devastating results of not having an effective national system to prepare for and respond to natural or man made disasters  or terrorist attacks  This amendment will do much to begin to build such a system  It will reverse the Department   s misguided decision to separate those who are supposed to prepare for disasters from those who are supposed to respond to them  and it authorizes increased funds for FEMA over the next three years  I am disappointed that provisions in our Committee   s bill that would have provided communities that fall victim to catastrophic disasters like Katrina and funding to help achieve interoperable communications were not included in the final agreement  But I believe  if this amendment stays intact  it represents an important step forward in our nation   s preparedness      A summary of the agreement  most of which mirrors the Collins Lieberman FEMA bill  is as follows       FEMA becomes a distinct entity within DHS     as are the US Coast Guard and the Secret Service   and is therefore protected from future reorganizations by DHS     MORE         FEMA  2    The Administrator of FEMA is the principal advisor to the President for emergency management  The language is modeled after the Joint Chiefs of Staff language       The Administrator has authority to report directly to Congress and may be designated as Cabinet level at the President   s discretion during disasters       Reunites Preparedness and Response with FEMA so that the Administrator is responsible for all phases of emergency management   preparedness  response  recovery  and mitigation        Stricter qualification requirements for Administrator of FEMA       Stronger Regional focus whereby FEMA would work closely and consistently with appropriate state and  local governments  as well as private sector and non governmental entities for planning emergency operations      Requires the administrator to appoint a Disability Coordinator to ensure that the needs of the disabled are taken into account in emergency planning and operations       It strengthens personnel at FEMA by enabling the organization to recruit and retain skilled employees      Strengthens programs with in FEMA  for example  by requiring FEMA to improve its information technology systems and requiring FEMA to provide technical assistance for evacuation to state and local governments       It creates a system for ensuring that FEMA is engaged in appropriate planning  training and exercise programs with its counterparts at the federal  state and local levels   It also requires that FEMA establish specific performance measurements against which to measure progress in planning  training and exercises towards establishing readiness         Establishes a national disaster recovery strategy to assist with the recovery from future catastrophes such as Hurricane Katrina           Requires the FEMA Administrator to appoint a Disability Coordinator to ensure that individuals with disabilities are properly addressed in emergency preparedness and disaster relief       Establishes within the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children a center for locating children separated from their families after a disaster         Establishes a voluntary registry to help reunite families separated by a disaster       Requires a number of provisions that will help prevent waste  fraud  and abuse
