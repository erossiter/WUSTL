                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               NEW HAVEN     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   said Monday our national security depends not just on defense of Americans at home and abroad  but also on building bridges to the Muslim World       Lieberman was the keynote speaker at an event that included 9 11 family advocate Mary Fetchet and others to discuss implementation of the 9 11 Commission recommendations following Congressional approval of the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act of 2004   Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins  R Me   co authored that legislation to respond to the Commission   s recommendations  President Bush signed the legislation into law December 17  2004       Among the reforms contained in the legislation was a call to build better relations through outreach programs to Muslim youth  Lieberman and Senator John McCain  R Ariz   also have introduced the ADVANCE Democracy Act  which provides resources to promote freedom in non democratic and struggling democratic nations          I believe that our national security lies not just in protecting our borders  but in bridging divides     Lieberman said  The ADVANCE Democracy Act    also demands that we cease placing political expediency before our core American values  We will speak frankly to our friends about the need for democratic reform as the path to a greater peace          Following is the full text of Lieberman   s speech       Thank you Mary and thank you Seth  And good afternoon to you all       As I stand here with Mary and Seth I am reminded of Anthropologist Margaret Mead   s famous observation     and I quote        Never doubt that a small group of committed people can change the world  Indeed  it s all that ever has          Mary and Seth     and the organizations they represent     are grass roots agents for change  They are helping to make America more secure at home and respected abroad by working to advance the cause of freedom  equality and understanding everywhere       Seth and the members of Americans for Informed Democracy are working to bridge the cultural divide between ourselves and the Muslim world through live  video Town Hall meetings       I know the conversations have sometimes been disturbing  There are clearly misunderstandings between our cultures  But that   s all the more reason these conversations must take place        In fact  I think this kind of approach is so important  I am sponsoring legislation  along with my colleague John McCain  to make this kind of outreach our official government policy       Mary and I have become both close friends and colleagues over the past several years through her tireless  dogged work     along with many other 9 11 family members     in support of the of the creation of the 9 11 Commission to investigate the terrorist attacks and then the adoption of many of the commission   s recommendations as part of last year   s Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act to make the nation safer       The opposition to reform was fierce  as I   m sure you heard in the first panel earlier today       But in the end we saw the answer to the age old physics puzzle  What happens when the immovable object     in this case the status quo     meets the irresistible force     in this case  Mary and her friends       Well       the status quo is dust     as it deserved to be  In its place we are now building new intelligence structures under a single director that will facilitate the sharing of information among 15 different federal intelligence agencies  as well as with state and local law enforcement agencies that desperately need to know about possible threats in their jurisdictions       We are also strengthening our border and transportation security  and implementing programs to thwart terrorists as they travel overseas or attempt to enter and move around the United States       These new programs are still evolving and it will take the continued oversight of both Congress and an engaged public to see that these new laws are implemented fully and fairly       For instance  there is a move in the House to use stricter federal standards for driver   s licenses  birth certificates and other state IDs contained in the 9 11 reforms as a backdoor attack on immigration that would also saddle states and local law enforcement with crushing financial burdens       I will be fighting these and other attempts to use the 9 11 reforms to advance agendas not related to improving our security       A little noticed part of the 9 11 reforms     but a section I am especially proud of     is dedicated to building better relations with the Muslim world through an aggressive outreach program similar in many ways to what Americans for Informed Democracy is trying to accomplish       It   s a part of the 9 11 reform package that I plan to further build upon this year because I believe that our national security lies not just in protecting our borders  but in building bridging divides       Part of the 9 11 Reform Act calls for establishing an International Youth Opportunity Fund that will help build and operate primary and secondary schools in Muslim nations committed to public education  but who can   t afford to pay for it       Where there is no public education  students often attend Madrassahs that     while free of charge     do not teach the disciplines     math  science and engineering     that young people in the Muslim world desperately need if they are to compete in the modern world   This lack of a quality education too often leads to poverty  despair and resentment that terrorists use to enlist new recruits       But with the Youth Opportunity Fund we say that we are not only ready to go to the front lines of the terrorist world and take away the sanctuaries where they hide     we want to take back minds they steal as well       And replace hate with hope       Sen  John McCain and I want to take this a step further with the ADVANCE Democracy Act we recently introduced in the Senate and which has also been introduced in the House by Representatives Lantos and Wolf       Our bill is inspired by a fundamental lesson of the September 11 attacks   where repression rules  the lack of political participation and economic opportunity can engender despair and even extremism       With this Act we say that the inalienable rights endowed by the Creator in the Declaration of Independence  are not only for Americans  Rather  it is a universal declaration of the human rights of    life  liberty and the pursuit of happiness          I believe we stand at a unique moment in the history of the world when it comes to the spread of freedom and equality that our Founding Fathers only dreamed of and that has teased and eluded every President in the 20th Century        Last year  Afghanistan had its first democratic election ever     and a woman cast the very first vote        In Iraq  the people defied death threats and car bombs and stood bravely in long exposed lines to choose their own leaders after decades of despotic rule        In the Rose Revolution in Georgia two years ago and the Orange Revolution in the Ukraine last year  we saw democratically elected representatives take control of their governments       Today in Lebanon  the people are seeking an end of Syrian occupation and right to fully control their destiny         President Mubarak of Egypt is talking about holding the first truly competitive  multiparty elections in his nation   s history       In Kyrgyzstan  the President resigned     paving the way for elections and a leader truly chosen by the people       And for the first time we see glimmers of the long dreamed of chance for a democratic Palestinian nation that is able to live at peace with Israel       But the outcome for these and other emerging democracies is still uncertain        In a recent column  Thomas Friedman of the New York Times warned that    while the necessary conditions  for democratization  may now be in place  the sufficient conditions for democratization are still not present in any of these arenas          This ADVANCE Democracy Act makes a national commitment consistent with American values to help both emerging democracies and remaining non democratic nations find their own unique path to liberty       This bill commits our government to make American embassies abroad    islands of freedom    with the promotion of democracy at the forefront of United States policy        This bill also demands that we cease placing political expediency before our core American values  We will speak frankly to our friends about the need for democratic reform as the path to a greater peace       But this bill is more than just a statement of purpose  It creates new structures and a commitment of human and financial resources to spread the power of freedom        This bill authorizes  250 million for the Human Rights and Democracy Fund that will dramatically increases resources available for grass roots democracy promotion efforts through institutions like the National Endowment for Democracy  the U S  Institute for Peace and a host of indigenous organizations committed to finding their own way towards democratic governance       This is an exciting time  I believe we stand at the edge of a new age     a Golden Age     of freedom that will rival any of the great eras of world history because it will be the entire world itself that is changing       Our own history tells us that such change will not come without struggle and hard work  And I hope you will be among that group of committed people Margaret Mead spoke of who are ready to bring that change to the world because         indeed       you are all that ever has       Thank you       30
