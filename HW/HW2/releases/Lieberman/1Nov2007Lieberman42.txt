

following remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate   Madame President  I rise to speak on the pending nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey to be the Attorney General of the United States And I rise to urge my colleagues on the Judiciary Committee to favorably consider this nomination because I fear that we are in danger of treating this judge very unjustly  of doing something that is not fair to him personally   I want to state at the outset that I didnt just meet Judge Mukasey since he was nominated for Attorney General by the President I actually met him 43 years ago this fall  when we both entered Yale law school together We were in the same small group in Contracts together  the occupant of the chair will appreciate the intimacy and how well you get to know somebody when youre in a small group with a demanding Contracts professor together The Mike Mukasey I met 43 years ago was honorable  he was bright  he was not presumptuous  he had a great sense of humor  and he had a strong sense of values  of what I again would call honor  to him   Ive kept in touch with Mike over the years  I cant say weve seen each other a lot  but Ive watched his career grow with great pride A private practitioner  a distinguished and successful United States Assistant Attorney  a judge who has been extremely well regarded by all who have come before him  as was testified to before the Judiciary Committee on his nomination  handled some very difficult cases  ruled in cases regarding alleged terrorists  and did so to his own personal risk  had a security detail with him for some period of time because of threats he received after one of these cases   Im honored to say that Judge Mukasey asked me to introduce him to the Judiciary Committee  alongside his senator  Senator Schumer of New York I said then what I will say here  the man I that I met 43 years ago is today essentially the same man  honorable  intelligent  a real sense of values  a commitment to public service  a man of the law  not a man of politics Exactly the kind of person America always needs as Attorney General  but particularly needs at this moment And I thought he handled his nomination hearing extremely well   Now there is rising opposition to this nomination based on Judge Mukaseys answer to a single question  which is whether he would say that the waterboarding technique of interrogation is torture Judge Mukasey has preferred not to give the easy  I might say politically expedient  answer  and he has argued with us  he has educated us  I would add  to understand that his answer is not about whether were for or against waterboarding He says himself that the techniques described  Im reading from a letter of October 30th of this year from Judge Mukasey to members of the Judiciary Committee who had written to him  I was asked at the hearing and in your letter questions about the hypothetical use of certain coercive interrogation techniques As described in your letter  these techniques seem over the line and  on a personal basis  repugnant to me   So  this is not to say that Judge Mukasey is for waterboarding  thats not whats at issue here and we should not allow it to become so He is responding as a man of the law  as a judge  as a man who would be  if we allow him  exactly the kind of Attorney General we need He said  Hypotheticals are different from real life  and in any legal opinion the actual facts and circumstances are critical   As a judge  Mukasey continues  I tried to be objective in my decision making and to put aside even strongly held personal beliefs when assessing a legal question because legal questions must be answered based solely on the actual facts  circumstances  and legal standards presented A legal opinion based on hypothetical facts and circumstances may be of some limited academic appeal but has scant practical effect or value   So bottom line  the judge is saying  Waterboarding is repugnant  but I cannot say as a matter of law that it is torture under the law because I dont know exactly what waterboarding is and how its used and I have not seen the prevailing legal memos  because theyre classified  that have governed interrogations by employees of our government   He says in the letter of October 30th  I have not been briefed on techniques used in any classified interrogation program conducted by any government agency   So he is saying  How can you expect me to essentially issue a legal opinion when I dont know the facts and I cant know the facts until and unless you allow me to be Attorney General   And then he says something I think is very important in his letter  He writes to the Judiciary Committee members  I do know  however  that waterboarding cannot be used by the United States military because its use by the military would be a clear violation of the Detainee Treatment Act That is because waterboarding and certain other coercive interrogation techniques are expressly prohibited by the Army Field Manual on Intelligence Interrogation  and Congress specifically legislated in the DTA that no person in the custody or control of the Department of Defense or held in a DOD facility may be subject to any interrogation techniques not authorized and listed in the manual   So there is a law and he has made clear that because there is a law  he definitely believes waterboarding cannot be used by Department of Defense personnel The fact is that the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 did not explicitly ban waterboarding or other specific techniques of interrogation as used by other employees of the federal government  including  presumably and particularly  employees of our intelligence agencies The Detainee Treatment Act banned  and I quote  cruel  inhuman  and degrading treatment   Judge Mukasey says in his letter  In the absence of legislation expressly banning certain interrogation techniques in all circumstances  one must consider whether a particular technique complies with relevant legal standards And he simply cannot do this in the absence of a clear  legislative expression by Congress that waterboarding constitutes torture  without seeing the documents  without understanding the definition of waterboarding as applied in particular cases   He is a man of the law He is saying  as he said in his testimony and in this letter  no one  including the President  is above the law It would have been very easy to remove any doubts and opposition about his confirmation if he had just said in this letter  waterboarding is torture   But he responds to a higher authority  it is the law  in a nation that claims to be governed by the rule of law   In his testimony before the Judiciary Committee  he was repeatedly questioned in regard to his independence  and following Attorney General Gonzales close relationship with the White House  members of the committee were clearly interested in whether Judge Mukasey would be independent of the White House  of the President He said he would do what the law required him to do No one is above the law  including the President   In refusing to tell questioning members of the Judiciary Committee  colleagues of ours  what they want to hear in this case  he is also showing his independence He is saying he will not be pressured by members of the United States Senate  including those who will determine whether he is confirmed or not  he will not simply tell them what they want to hear if he thinks it is not the legally responsible thing to do That is exactly the kind of man I want  and I think we all should want  as Attorney General of the United States   So he is putting his confirmation as Attorney General at risk because he believes it would not be justified as a matter of law for him to conclude  without benefit of documents that he cannot see now  that waterboarding is torture   And for this  will we reward this good man  this public servant  this distinguished judge  this man of the law by rejecting his nomination Here is the kind of independence  the kind of allegiance to the public interest and the rule of law that the American people want to see more of in Washington and not less Thats why I repeat what I said at the beginning To reject the nomination of Judge Michael Mukasey because he refuses to say what some members want him to say on this question  and he refuses as a matter of sincerely held legal belief of what his legal responsibility is  would be grossly unfair  an unjust act to this judge   May I suggest an alternative course to my friends on the Judiciary Committee and members of the Senate who hopefully will get to consider this nomination  confirm Judge Mukasey Based on his overall record of service  his obvious intelligence and honor and integrity  the extent to which he will raise the morale of the employees of the Department of Justice Look at his entire record  dont turn him down and deprive the nation of his service as our chief law enforcer because of one legal opinion he has reached that is different from yours Confirm him  and then as Attorney General he will have access to the documents about waterboarding  he will have access to the people who may or may not have been involved in it  he will have access to the prevailing memos  and then demand that he issue a legal opinion and respond to your question But dont reject a man of the law  exactly the kind of man America needs today as our Attorney General   I thank the chair  and I yield the floor
