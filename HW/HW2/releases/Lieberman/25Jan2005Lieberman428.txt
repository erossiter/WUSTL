Island Sound                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman and Congressman Rob Simmons led members of the Connecticut and New York delegations in reintroducing legislation to establish a new system to preserve the environmental quality of the Long Island Sound  LIS        More than a decade ago  the Environmental Protection Agency identified the LIS region as vulnerable to degradation and with the Senators    support established the Long Island Sound Study to develop a plan for protection of the Sound   Study results released in 2002 concluded that coordinated action to save the Sound was necessary          Building on several of the study   s recommendations and on feedback from subsequent public hearings throughout Connecticut  New York  and Washington  DC  the members first introduced the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act  LISSA  last spring   LISSA would encourage protection of the LIS by providing financial incentives for owners of land parcels within the LIS area to preserve the environmental quality of and public access to this endangered habitat   The legislation passed the Senate last fall but did not pass the House  and so must be reintroduced in the new Congress             The health of the Long Island Sound is crucial to our region   s economy  quality of life and heritage     Lieberman said      My colleagues and I have been concerned about the deterioration of the Sound for nearly a decade and this legislation gives us the opportunity to use the Study   s key recommendations to take the first step towards protecting it            The Long Island Sound is a source of livelihood  nourishment and recreation for many in Connecticut and New York   Simmons said   The Long Island Sound Stewardship Act will play a significant role in ensuring that the Sound remains a valuable resource to both our states and the nation  Our shoreline communities will benefit from the most effective conservation efforts to enhance the Sound and I hope Congress will pass this bill in 2005 and send it to the president for his signature into law            Long Island Sound is a living  breathing environmental and economic entity   It is critically important that we protect both the Sound itself and coastal areas to ensure its health for future generations     Senator Chris Dodd said      This measure can help by taking critically important steps today to ensure that it remains healthy and vibrant tomorrow            Long Island Sound is a valuable environmental and economic resource and it is critical that we protect it   Congresswoman Nancy Johnson said   This legislation applies the most effective conservation methods available to identify  protect and enhance sites with ecological  educational and recreational value  And it does so in a way that is consistent with the vision put forward by a coalition of local groups that have been working for over a decade to save the Sound          The Long Island Sound Study Act  LISSA  gives Members from both sides of the Capitol  both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Sound an opportunity to come together with local conservation groups to advance a goal we can all agree on  preserving the Sound and ensuring it remains an environmental  economic and educational resource for generations to come   Congressman Christopher Shays said         If enacted  the Long Island Sound Stewardship Act will be a model public private partnership that will improve management of one of the country   s most important estuaries     Congresswoman Rosa L  DeLauro said      The bill will protect some of the area   s most threatened shoreline  using good science   not politics   as the means of directing federal and state dollars          It is a pleasure to join my colleagues in introducing this legislation to safeguard the environmental health and future of one of Connecticut s greatest natural assets   Congressman John Larson said   Following a number of recommendations from the study that was undertaken  this action will help preserve and protect Long Island Sound for generations         The bipartisan legislation establishes a broad based    Long Island Sound Stewardship Committee    comprised of all LIS stakeholders  including federal  state  public interest and landowners representatives   The Committee would be charged with evaluating the parcels of land within the LIS region and designating crucial parcels as    Stewardship Sites    eligible for special preservation funds   Under the legislation  the Committee would give owners of Stewardship Sites financial incentive to sell their land to preservation groups or preserve the environmental and public access features of that land themselves by volunteering to sell development rights to the land to the Committee itself   The legislation designates  40 million for the Committee   s budget  to be taken out of the funds authorized for LIS preservation under the EPA   s National Estuary Program          The legislation provides specific criteria for the Committee to use in designating Stewardship Sites that evaluate the contribution of the land to open space on and public access to the LIS as well as the ecological value of the land        The full
