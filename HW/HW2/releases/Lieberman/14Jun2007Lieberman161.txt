senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  SASC  and Barbara Boxer  D CA  today lauded SASC s approval of The Mental Health Care for our Wounded Warriors Act of 2007 that they introduced in April   The bill  which was included in the Wounded Warriors bill approved by SASC  addresses two significant challenges facing the Department of Defense  DoD   the absence of designated  centralized facilities   or  Centers of Excellence    to research and coordinate all aspects of military mental health policies and services  and the shortage of mental health professionals to provide care to members of the armed forces       We have no greater obligation than to care for our wounded service members   Lieberman said    Not all of the wounds they suffer are visible  though  We know that an estimated one in six returning service members has a diagnosable condition of post traumatic stress disorder and one in ten service members may suffer a traumatic brain injury  These are the signature injuries of our war in Iraq and Afghanistan  We need to give our troops psychological armor  If we provide the right care at the right time for our troops  we will not only be protecting them  but making our military stronger and more effective  Senator Boxer and I are committed to working with each other  our Senate colleagues  and the Department of Defense to solve these pressing problems        Boxer said   I am so pleased that the Senate Armed Services Committee recognized the need to take care of both the physical and mental health needs of our service members   The two amendments Senator Lieberman and I worked to include will help ensure we are providing the best mental health care services to our military  and in particular  the women serving in our Armed Forces   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans          The bill would establish Centers of Excellence within the DoD to research and guide the development and implementation of comprehensive strategies to prevent  identify  and treat combat related mental health conditions  emphasizing Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  and traumatic brain injuries   The centers would also develop  identify  and disseminate best practices for treatment of combat related mental health conditions and brain injuries and develop measures to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health illnesses       The bill would also require the DoD to report back to Congress within 45 days on the need for Congressional intervention to provide financial incentives to reduce mental health workforce shortages  Congressional intervention to amend the duration of service obligation to increase the recruitment of mental health professionals  and increasing the use of scholarship and financial assistance to recruit qualified mental health professionals       An estimated one in six returning service members has a diagnosable condition of post traumatic stress disorder  PTSD  and one in ten service members involved in the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts may suffer a traumatic brain injury  Over one third of the Iraq and Afghanistan veterans treated by the VA have been diagnosed with a mental health condition  including PTSD  depression  and substance abuse  among others       The bill passed by SASC today also includes language authored by Lieberman and Boxer directing the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to jointly conduct a comprehensive review of the need for mental health treatment and services for female service members and veterans and the efficiency and adequacy of existing mental health treatment programs and services    The language calls on the VA and DoD to report the results of their review to Congress and create a comprehensive policy to address the treatment and care needs of female service members and veterans who have experienced mental health problems and conditions  including PTSD         Following passage of the legislation out of committee  the Senators then met with Vice Admiral Donald C  Arthur  MC  USN Shelley M  MacDermid  MBA  PhD  Co chairs of the DoD Mental Health Task Force  The Task Force issued a groundbreaking report on the status of mental health treatment in the military  It calls for sweeping changes to the existing system and provides concrete recommendations for DoD and Congress to act quickly        30
