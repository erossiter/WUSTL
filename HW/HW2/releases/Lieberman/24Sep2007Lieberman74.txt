                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON  D C   Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  today delivered the following remarks on the floor of the United States Senate   Mr  President  I rise to offer an amendment  together with Senator Kyl of Arizona  about the dangerous and destabilizing role that the Islamic Republic of Iran is playing inside Iraq   General Petraeus  testifying before Congress two weeks ago  could not have been clearer about the threat we face from Iran  In his words  it is increasingly apparent to both coalition and Iraqi leaders that Iran  through the use of the Iranian Republican Guard Corps Qods Force  seeks to turn the Shia militia extremists into a Hezbollah like force to serve its interests and fight a proxy war against the Iraqi state and coalition forces   General Petraeus testimony is only the latest in a growing dossier of evidence about Iranian terrorism inside Iraq  and throughout the region  that we in this chamber have receivedfrom our military commanders on the ground in Iraq  from our top diplomats there  and from our intelligence community    Specifically  we have received detailed information in recent months about how operatives from the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps have been training  arming  funding  and even directing extremists inside Iraq  As Ambassador Crocker testified  While claiming to support Iraq in its transition  Iran has actively undermined it by providing lethal capabilities to the enemies of the Iraqi state   The Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is also importing terrorists from Lebanese Hezbollah to help build up its extremist proxies in Iraq  We know this  in part  because coalition forces have captured one of the Hezbollah leaders  inside Iraq  and recovered documents that detail the relationship between the Iranian regime and the extremist groups they are sponsoring   As General Petraeus said last week  This is not intelligence  This is evidence    We also know that Iran has also been using its territory to train and organize these extremists  According to the U S  military spokesperson in Baghdad  Brigadier General Kevin Bergner  groups of up to 60 Iraqi militants at a time have been taken to three camps near Tehran  where they have received instruction in the use of mortars  rockets  improvised explosive devices and other deadly tools of guerrilla warfare that they then use against our troops in Iraq    General Bergner also reported this summer that the U S  military has concluded that the senior leadership in Iran is aware of the activities of the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps in sponsoring attacks against our soldiers in Iraq  and that  in his words  it is hard to imagine that the Supreme Leader of Iran  Ayatollah Ali Khamenei  does not know of them    The consequences of Irans terrorism have been immense and terrible for our men and women in uniform  According to Lt  Gen  Ray Odierno  the deputy commander of our forces in Iraq  Iranian supplied weapons were responsible for a full third of U S  combat deaths this July  Let me repeat that  Up to a third of the deaths of American soldiers in Iraq this July were caused by sophisticated explosive devices that can be traced to the Islamic Republic of Iran   Iran is killing our troops because it wants us to retreat from Iraq  The Iranians understandsometimes  it seems  better than a lot of Americans dothat if American power collapses in Iraq  if we retreat and abandon our friends there  our position throughout the Middle East becomes much  much weaker  and Irans position becomes much  much stronger    Irans aggression in Iraq also fits squarely into a larger pattern of regional aggression    In addition to sponsoring attacks on American soldiers in Iraq today  Tehran is also training  funding  and equipping radical groups that are working to destabilize Lebanon  Palestine  and Afghanistan  where just last week  Admiral Fallon  the commander of Central Command  said the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps is supplying anti coalition forces with the same sophisticated explosive devices it is giving to extremists in Iraq  In Admiral Fallons words  There is no doubt that agents from Iran are involved in aiding the insurgency   But the fact is  it is Iraq that is today the central front of Irans efforts to become the hegemonic power in the Middle East  The Iranian regime knows that Iraq is their best shot to weaken us in the region  and to begin the process of pushing us out of the region    That is why you cannot be serious about responding to the threat of Iran  while calling for our precipitous withdrawal from Iraq   President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad  just a few weeks ago  said  The political power of the occupiers is collapsing rapidly  Soon we will see a huge power vacuum in the region We are prepared to fill that gap  Asked about this statement  Ambassador Crocker said  Ahmedinejad means what he says  and is already trying to implement it  to the best of his ability   Mr  President  it is vital to the national security interests of the United States that the Iranian government not be allowed to prevail in its war against us in Iraq   The amendment that Senator Kyl and I are offering is an important component of our response to this threat   First  it will send a clear messageboth to the regime in Teheran  and to our allies in the regionthat the United States will not stand idly by and allow Iranian backed terrorists to kill hundreds and hundreds of American soldiers  and dominate Iraq  It acknowledges what our military commanders and top diplomats are telling us  which is that  regardless of what we might desire here in Washington  the government in Tehran has made a decision to wage a proxy war against usand we must respond   Our amendment states that it should be the policy of the United States to stop the violent activities and the destabilizing influence inside Iraq of the Government of the Islamic Republic of Iran  as well as its foreign facilitators like Lebanese Hezbollah  and its indigenous Iraqi proxies   Our amendment also recognizes that thwarting Irans campaign of terror must be among the crucial considerations for any plan for the transition and draw down of our forces in Iraq  As General Petraeus warned us in his testimony  the threat of Iran may in the long run prove an even greater danger to the stability of Iraq than al Qaeda  We cannot ignore it   For that reason  the amendment also calls on the State Department to designate the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization and place the IRGC on the list of Specially Designated Global Terrorists  This is the organization that is responsible for the murder of our soldiers  They are launching terrorist attacks against our troopsand so we should treat them as terrorists   Of course everyone in this chamber would prefer that we can convince the Iranian regime to stop these attacks against our soldiers through peaceful diplomacy alone  But reality requires that we recognize that we have been attempting to use the tools of diplomacy with Iran  thus far  and the Iranians have not respondedat all   Since May  Ambassador Crocker has met three times with his Iranian counterparts in Baghdadthe highest level  official meetings between American and Iranian representatives in decades  These talks  however  have thus far produced nothing   In Ambassador Crockers own words  testifying before Congress  I laid out the concerns we had over Iranian activity that was damaging to Iraqs security  but found no readiness on the Iranians side at all to engage seriously on these issues  The impression I came away with after a couple rounds is that the Iranians were interested simply in the appearance of discussions  of being seen to be at the table with the U S  as an arbiter of Iraqs present and future  rather than actually doing serious business Right now  I havent seen any sign of earnestness or seriousness on the Iranian side   Far from convincing the Iranian regime to stop its proxy attacks on American soldiers  the evidence is that these attacks have escalated over the last few months  According to the most recent National Intelligence Estimate  Iran has been intensifying aspects of its lethal support for select groups of Iraqi Shia militants  This is further confirmed by the Pentagons recent 9010 report to Congress  which states that attacks on our forces using Iranian supplied weapons have risen nearly 40 percent this summer    Mr  President  the war that Iran is fighting against American troops and our allies in Iraq is an undeclared war  but it is nonetheless a real war  in which real Americans and Iraqis are being murdered by Iranian agents    It is a war that the Iranians want to wage in the shadows  so that they can escape responsibility for the blood on their hands  This amendment exposes their behavior and demands justice   As we speak  the President of Iran is in the United States  There is no better time than this for us to send a crystal clear message to himand the fanatics and tyrants who now run the great country of Iranthat their campaign of terror against our troops in Iraq must end  and that we stand united as Americans against it     30
