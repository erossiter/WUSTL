                                                       WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Wednesday  delivered the following statement at the Committee   s seventh hearing on preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina       Madam Chairman  thanks for holding this seventh hearing in the Committee   s ongoing investigation into the preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina     Today  we temporarily turn away from examining the role of federal  state  and local agencies and focus instead on the role of private sector agencies and what government might learn from companies that were prepared and uniquely positioned to help save lives in emergencies     companies like those represented before us today  In some areas hit by the storm  stores like Wal Mart  Target  and Home Depot were virtual life lines for dazed and bereft citizens who were fortunate enough to survive Katrina   s wrath  These companies and their employees became key distribution points for food  water  clothing  generators  and other supplies because they were prepared and because they had the capacity to do what they do everyday  and that is to move goods and provide services     Mississippi Power  a subsidiary of Southern Company  was able to restore life sustaining electricity to hundreds of thousands of customers well ahead of schedule apparently because it has a culture of empowering managers to make decisions free from authorization requirements and other bureaucratic entanglements    Starwood Hotels  which operates three properties  including the Sheraton in New Orleans  provided vital services to its customers  employees  and first responders during and immediately after the storm  and was able to get its hotels back up and operating  within days after the storm     And IBM  one of the world   s leading information technology companies  has much to teach us in terms of how to harness technology to plan  manage  share information and coordinate disaster related activities better than the government did in response to Hurricane Katrina   We examine these stories today to learn lessons that will help all businesses     large and small   as well as all levels of government  be better prepared to respond when disaster strikes     Since 9 11  we have been all too aware of the fact that the private sector owns 85 percent of our nation   s critical infrastructure     that is  our communications networks  power grids  financial and health services  chemical plants  oil refineries  transportation systems and much more  These infrastructures form the backbone of our society and economy and  therefore  must be prepared  in the national interest  to respond      That   s why we created an Infrastructure Protection division in the Department of Homeland Security which was the first of its kind at any federal agency   The point was that government needed to work with the private sector to make sure the systems so crucial to our way of life were adequately protected  and if attacked by terrorists or overwhelmed by natural forces  were able to recover quickly and restore services    Among the lessons reinforced by our examination today is that there is no substitute for preparation  We also learned that leadership is key  as are communications   and that in a crisis decisions must often be made by those on the scene  We also learned that the homeland security partnership between government and the private sector must be improved   In the final analysis  when the lives of American people are at stake     whether from terror or natural disaster   we must transcend all affiliations and unite as a team  as you did   using all of the strengths of our great country     whether they are from the public  private or non profit sectors  We have to operate as one to get the job done   You did that  I hope this hearing will prepare our country to achieve that sense of unity of purpose  get closer to where we need to be    Thank you Madam Chairman        30
