Range of Homeland Security Needs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Tuesday appealed for more funding for homeland defense as the Senate debated the Fiscal Year 2006 spending bill for the Department of Homeland Security       At a press conference attended by several Democratic Senators who will seek to increase funding for first responders  transit security  port security and other homeland security needs  Lieberman delivered the following statement          On September 11  2001  I was privileged to be serving as Chairman of what was then known as the Governmental Affairs Committee and we immediately began a series of hearings to determine our security vulnerabilities and what could be done about them   On December 13  2001  we held a hearing on the security of our rail and transit systems   Witnesses testified about the reality of the threat and about promising new security technologies such as facial recognition and chemical sensors  I remember saying at the time that transit security should not be side tracked while other homeland defense needs claimed all our time and resources          Today  three and a half years later  the sad fact is the train has still not left the station when it comes to genuine rail and transit security   And the reason is that this Congress and this Administration have devoted neither the resources nor the time necessary to protect the 14 million people who ride subways  buses  light rails  commuter trains  and ferries each day throughout our country           This is not just about last week   s tragic attacks on London  I agree with Secretary Chertoff when he says we can   t base our national homeland defense policies on a single attack somewhere else   We don   t have to do that  We   ve been attacked here  We know the reality of the threat and we know the reality of our vulnerabilities           But experts in and out of government have told us in no uncertain terms that we are still vulnerable     and will remain vulnerable     to terrorist attack unless we begin to invest   seriously and strategically   in our own security          Experts have identified billions of dollars in urgent security needs  ranging from rail  transit  and port security  to communications equipment for first responders  to modernizing the Coast Guard fleet  to fixing our porous borders           We have the best military in the world because we   ve invested in it   If we want to have the best homeland security  we will have to invest in it          This year  the President proposed only modest increases for the Department   s many important programs  And even those proposed increases were illusory  as they were based on a controversial airline ticket fee that congressional leaders have rejected   The House and the Senate Appropriations Committee have approved bills that provide even less for DHS than President Bush proposed           Yes  we have we increased spending on homeland security since 9 11  but we have not increased it anywhere near enough to meet the threat of terrorism that we face   The budget to fight terrorism at home is still just a small fraction of the budget to fight terrorism abroad            Last year  for example  Congress provided  150 million specifically for rail and transit grants  This year  the President proposed no dedicated funding at all for rail and transit  and the Senate Appropriations bill proposes only  100 million     a  50 million cut from last year          Funding for first responders is decreasing for the second year in a row  Even taking into account proposed increases in two grant programs  the Administration s FY 2006 budget would cut overall DHS first responder program by  565 million  That   s simply not acceptable            None of these proposed cuts make sense given the pressing need and the Senate   s 63 37 bipartisan vote on the Budget Resolution to restore the Administration s proposed cuts to DHS first responder grants          Homeland Security expert Steve Flynn describes our predicament in his recent book  America the Vulnerable  He writes   AHomeland security has entered our post 9 11 lexicon  but homeland insecurity remains the abiding reality                 My colleagues and I will be introducing and supporting amendments to address some of these shortfalls and  hopefully  to diminish the terrorist threat             We urge this Congress and this Administration to recall how we felt on September 11  2001  and listen to the security experts who tell us we must live with B and prepare for B the terrorist threat for the indefinite future  Together  we can meet and defeat the terrorist threat          30
