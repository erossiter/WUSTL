shortages       WASHINGTON  D C   Today  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  and 18 of his Senate colleagues called on Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff to expand an important work authorization program that enables foreign graduates of U S  universities to contribute to the U S  economy  Expansion of the program  known as Optional Practical Training  OPT   would ease pressures affecting employers in Connecticut and nationwide  who are increasingly unable to fill high skilled positions   Affirming their commitment to promoting meaningful legislative remedies including increasing the number of H 1B and employment based visas  the Senators urged that  in the interim  Secretary Chertoff exercise his regulatory authority to extend the maximum OPT period from its current 12 months to a new 29 months    Extending the maximum OPT period to 29 months would be an important first step in addressing the crisis caused by the record shortage of skilled worker visas  said Senator Lieberman  In Connecticut  and indeed across America  our innovative companies are facing critical shortages of certain highly skilled workers  We must enable our companies to access the talent they need  which ensures that they will keep jobs on our shores and that they will continue to grow in this country    Expansion of OPT is particularly critical because of the shortage of skilled worker visas  known as H 1B visas   a shortage the Senators believe threatens America s economic competitiveness  Demand for H 1Bs was so high this year that the government received 133 000 applications   more than double the annual 65 000 allowance   on April 1  the very first day applications were accepted  Excessive demand prompted the government to stop accepting applications on April 2  But because an H 1B application cannot be filed before a diploma is issued  U S  employers were unable to seek H 1Bs for U S  university students who would graduate weeks later  As a result  2007 graduates who had applied their OPT allowance towards internships  and 2006 graduates unable to secure H 1B visas  were lost to competitor economies  If the maximum OPT period had been 29 months  U S  employers would have been able to continue employing these US educated professionals long enough to seek an H 1B visa for them the following year    An extension of OPT would also help US universities compete for the world s top students Said Yale University President Richard Levin  Yale and many other American universities attract talented students from every region of the world Many of these students want to stay and have careers in the United States  but immigration rules often discourage that I commend Senator Lieberman for urging Secretary Chertoff to expand opportunities for practical training after graduation These students have a lot to offer  it s win win for students and the U S  economy   The Senators  call is endorsed by the Association of American Universities  AAU  On behalf of the 60 leading U S  research universities that make up the Association of American Universities  I urge Secretary Chertoff to take regulatory action to extend Optional Practical Training from 12 months to 29 months  said Robert M  Berdahl  president of AAU Students from around the world view the U S  as the destination of choice for study and research opportunities For many  OPT is a necessary bridge between the expiration of their student visas and their attainment of an H 1B visa The extension of OPT from 12 months to 29 months will provide these talented international students with an opportunity to receive an H 1B visa and to contribute to the U S  economy   Lieberman  who is Chairman of the Senate s Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  was joined on the letter by Chairmen of four other committees with jurisdiction over key immigration and business issues  Chairmen Leahy  Judiciary   Inouye  Commerce   Kerry  Small Business   and Schumer  Joint Economic Committee   Additional signatories are Senators Akaka  Alexander  Bennett  Cantwell  Collins  Cornyn  Crapo  Hagel  Hatch  Landrieu  Bill Nelson  Murray  Smith  and Voinovich    A longtime advocate of skilled worker immigration reform  Lieberman is lead sponsor  along with Senators Hagel  Cantwell  and Voinvoich  of the Skilled Worker Immigration and Fairness Act of 2007  S  1397   The bill would increase the annual allotment of H 1B visas and exempt from numeric caps all foreign nationals holding a US graduate degree  a non US graduate degree in science  technology  engineering or math  or a US medical specialty certification
