                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON     Senator Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  delivered the following statement today on the Senate floor         As Prepared for Delivery        Mr  President  our nation has reached a critical crossroad in the war in Iraq  More than four years ago  this chamber voted to authorize the use of force against Saddam Hussein  a tyrant who slaughtered his own people  attacked his neighbors  and threatened our security  Thanks to the courageous service of the men and women of our military  that evil regime was overthrown  And in its place came hopes of democracy in the heart of the Middle East and a victory in the war for the hearts and minds of the Muslim world        As of today  those hopes have not been realized  Because of the ruthless conduct of our enemies  as well as our own failures  we instead today find ourselves on a knife   s edge in Iraq        Now  a new course has been chosen  A new commander is in place in Iraq  confirmed by this Senate  A new Secretary of Defense is in place at the Pentagon  confirmed by this Senate  And a new strategy has begun to be put into action on the ground in Iraq by our troops         It is altogether proper that we debate our policy in Iraq  It should be a debate that is as serious as the situation in Iraq and that reflects the powers the Constitution gives to Congress in matters of war        But that  sadly  is not the debate that the Warner Levin resolution invites us to have  I am going to speak strongly against this resolution because I feel strongly about it  I do so with respect for my colleagues who have offered it  but I believe its passage would so compromise America   s security  present and future  that I will say so in the clearest terms I can        The resolution before us  its sponsors concede  will not stop the new strategy from going forward  As we speak  thousands of troops are already in Baghdad  with thousands more moving into position to carry out their Commander   s orders  This resolution does nothing to alter these facts        Instead  its sponsors say it will send a message of rebuke from the Senate to the president  from one end of Pennsylvania Avenue to the other  But there is a world beyond Pennsylvania Avenue that is watching and listening        What we say here is being heard in Baghdad by Iraqi moderates  trying to decide whether the Americans will stand with them  We are being heard by our men and women in uniform  who will be interested to know whether we support the plan they have begun to carry out  We are being heard by the leaders of the thuggish regimes in Iran and Syria  and by Al Qaeda terrorists  eager for evidence that America   s will is breaking  And we are being heard across America by our constituents  who are wondering if their Congress is capable of serious action  not just hollow posturing        This resolution is not about Congress taking responsibility  It is the opposite  It is a resolution of irresolution         For the Senate to take up a symbolic vote of no confidence on the eve of a decisive battle is unprecedented  but it is not inconsequential  It is an act which  I fear  will discourage our troops  hearten our enemies  and showcase our disunity  And that is why I will vote against cloture        If you believe that General Petraeus and his new strategy have a reasonable chance of success in Iraq  then you should resolve to support him and his troops through the difficult days ahead  On the other hand  if you believe that this new strategy is flawed or that our cause is hopeless in Iraq  then you should vote to stop it  Vote to cut off funds  Vote for a binding timeline for American withdrawal  If that is where your convictions lie  then have the courage of your convictions to accept the consequences of your convictions  That would be a resolution        The non binding measure before us  by contrast  is an accumulation of ambiguities and inconsistencies  It is at once for the war but also against the war  It pledges its support to the troops in the field but also washes its hands of what they are doing  It approves more troops for Anbar but not for Baghdad        We cannot have it both ways  We cannot vote full confidence in General Petraeus  but no confidence in his strategy  We cannot say that the troops have our full support  but disavow their mission on the eve of battle  This is what happens when you try to wage war by committee  That is why the Constitution gave that authority to the President as Commander in Chief        Cynics may say this kind of thing happens all of the time in Congress  In this case  however  they are wrong  If it passed  this resolution would be unique in American legislative history  I contacted the Library of Congress on this question last week and was told that  never before  when American soldiers have been in harm   s way  fighting and dying in a conflict that Congress had voted to authorize  has Congress turned around and passed a resolution like this  disapproving of a particular battlefield strategy         I ask each of my colleagues to stop for a moment and consider this history carefully  Even during Vietnam  even after the Tet Offensive  even after the invasion of Cambodia  Congress did not take up a resolution like this one        Past Congresses certainly debated wars  They argued heatedly about them  And they clashed directly with the Executive Branch over their execution  But in doing so they accepted the consequences of their convictions         This resolution does no such thing  It is simply an expression of opinion  It does not pretend to have any substantive effect on policy on the ground in Iraq         But again  I ask you  what will this resolution say to our soldiers  What will it say to our allies  And what will it say to our enemies        We heard from General Petraeus during his confirmation hearing that war is a battle of wills  Our enemies believe that they are winning in Iraq today  They believe that they can outlast us  that  sooner or later  we will tire of this grinding conflict and go home  That is the lesson that Osama bin Laden took from our retreats from Lebanon and Somalia in the 1980s and 1990s  It is a belief at the core of the insurgency in Iraq  and at the core of radical Islam worldwide  And this resolution   by codifying our disunity  by disavowing the mission our troops are about to undertake   confirms our enemies    belief in American weakness         This resolution also sends a terrible message to our allies  I agree that we must hold the Iraqi government to account  That is exactly what the resolution Senator McCain and I have offered would do  But I ask you  Imagine for a moment that you are a Sunni or Shia politician in Baghdad who wants the violence to end   and ask yourself how the Warner Levin resolution will affect your thinking  your calculations of risk  your willingness to stand against the forces of extremism  Every day  you are threatened by enemies who want nothing but to inflict the most brutal imaginable horrors on you and your loved ones  Will this resolution empower you  or will it undermine you  Will it make you feel safer  or will it make you feel you should hedge your bets  or go over to the extremists  or leave the country        And finally  what is the message this resolution sends to our soldiers  I know that everyone here supports our troops   but actions have consequences  often unintended  When we send a message of irresolution  it does not support our troops  When we renounce their mission  it does not support our troops         We heard recently in the Senate Armed Services Committee from General Jack Keane  who said of this resolution     It   s just not helpful    What the enemy sees is an erosion of the political and moral will of the American people    Our soldiers are Americans first  They clearly understand there   s a political process in this country that they clearly support    But at the end of the day  they are going to go out and do a tough mission  and I certainly would like to see them supported in that mission as opposed to declaring non support              Everyone here knows that the American people are frustrated about the lack of progress in Iraq  Everyone here shares that frustration  And as elected representatives of the people  everyone here feels pressure to give expression to that frustration        This is not a new challenge  It is one that every democracy in every long  difficult war has had to confront        Nearly a century and a half ago  at a site not far from here  an American president wrestled with just this problem  It was in the midst of a terrible war   a civil war   in which hundreds of thousands of Americans were fighting and dying to secure the freedom of millions long and cruelly denied it             We here highly resolve         that was Lincoln   s message at Gettysburg  It was a message of resolution  of conviction against adversity  of hope against despair  and of confidence in the cause of freedom  which is America   s cause        Today  in the depths of a terrible war  on the brink of a decisive battle for Baghdad  let us have a serious debate about where we stand and where we must go in Iraq  That is the debate we should have   but it is not the debate that this resolution would bring         The sixty vote requirement to close debate was put in place by our predecessors as a way to stop the passions of the moment from sweeping across our country and through Congress in a way that will jeopardize our future  Because I believe this resolution  if passed  would have such an effect  I will respectfully oppose the motion for cloture       I thank the President and yield the floor       30
