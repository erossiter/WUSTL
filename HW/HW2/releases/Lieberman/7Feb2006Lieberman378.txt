Committee hearing today  Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  said he fears that the strategic and budgetary recommendations in the Bush Administration   s FY2007 defense budget and recently released Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR  do not adequately support the security threats our nation currently faces   Lieberman challenged Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and other Defense Department officials on their plan             The bottom line is that I see critical discontinuities between the strategic threats outlined in the QDR  and the resource decisions allocated in the 2007 defense budget     Lieberman said      Our military must continue to transform from a traditional force to one that is more capable of defeating both conventional and unconventional foes  and we must increase and shift our resources to achieve this goal           The full text of Lieberman   s hearing statement is below        Opening Statement for Senator Joe Lieberman      Senate Armed Services Committee Hearing on Proposed Defense Department Budget for FY2007      February 7  2006       Good morning and thank you for attending   This hearing begins our examination of our nation   s military strategy for today and tomorrow and how well the budget request offers a defense program to support that strategy   I want to thank Senators Warner and Levin for holding this hearing which gives us the opportunity to ask questions about the 2007 defense budget  the Quadrennial Defense Review  and the continuing operations in Iraq   Our purpose must be to guarantee that the men and women of our armed services have the resources and support they need to protect the United States and the American people  who live in an all too dangerous world   Good morning to Secretary Rumsfeld  General Pace  General Schoomaker  and General Abizaid   I appreciate all the hard work you have done to ensure our nation   s security        I believe that 2006 is an extremely important year for our military   It is imperative that coalition forces make significant progress in securing and stabilizing Iraq   In order to do that  the military must receive the necessary support in both equipment and personnel to get the job done   We must also look forward in our planning with the assumption that our military will not return to a comfortable conventional warfare posture   Instead  we must be ready to defeat the kind of threats that have confronted us for the past fifteen years   I am concerned that the decisions represented in the budget and the QDR do not adequately consider the extent and duration of operations to defeat these threats          We must evaluate what defense programs will help us transition from a traditional fighting force into a military that can respond to non conventional threats  as well as conventional ones  and sustain that response  for years if necessary   We must discuss many of these programs and where they fit into our future military          Given the new strategic threat environment described in the QDR  I want to focus on the adequate size of land forces we need to meet these demands   Our soldiers in the Army are the most technologically advanced in the history of our nation and this budget will help them become even more so   We are doing them a disservice if we do not make sure we have enough brigades to both deploy and support troop rotation for extended periods of time  and to be able to do so in more than one place  if necessary   We also must maintain the institutional Army   the training  support  and educational part of the Army that has made our combat units so successful   We can not outsource these vital  core institutional functions and remain as good as we are          The 2007 budget also calls for a reduction in the authorized end strength of the National Guard  which is a decision that seems to reflect the tight fiscal environment rather than the military   s operational demands   I must ask the obvious  yet difficult question   if we are transitioning from a traditional force to a military more responsive to irregular and potentially catastrophic threats  then why have all the traditional weapons systems remained in the budget  in many cases receiving an increase in funding  while funding for personnel has been reduced         I am also concerned about the size of our Navy  particularly in light of the aggressive development of submarines by other nations   such as China   If we wait until 2012 to increase our sub production to two a year  we will fall beneath the number of boats needed to satisfy the Navy   s force structure requirement and to remain the world   s dominant undersea warfare force in the future        Although the QDR recognizes the need for increased long range strike capability by 2018  I do not find any funding in the 2007 budget request for this   There continues to be a lot of money for short range strike capability   Even if we start now  which aren   t  I doubt it is possible to field the land based bomber part of this capability by 2018 as the QDR calls for   That is eleven years from now  and we normally take fifteen or more years to field such a program        The bottom line is that I see critical discontinuities between the strategic threats outlined in the QDR  and the resource decisions allocated in the 2007 defense budget   Our military must continue to transform from a conventional to an irregular and conventional fighting force  and we must increase and shift our resources to achieve this goal   We are engaged in a    long war    against terrorism   It is imperative that our choices reflect that new strategic reality        30
