to provide federal funding for stem cell research  which potentially holds the key to cures for such diseases as Alzheimer   s disease  Leukemia and Multiple Sclerosis    The Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  H R  810  which passed the House earlier this year  was approved by the Senate by a vote of 63 37          In a statement made during the Senate   s consideration of stem cell legislation  Lieberman called on the Bush Administration to follow the Senate   s lead by supporting legislation to lift the federal ban on embryonic stem cell research   He warned that vetoing the bill would stunt the nation   s efforts to harness the potential and miracle of embryonic stem cells and cures         A copy of the senator   s statement is below            Mr  President I rise in support of the stem cell bills currently being considered by the Senate   Frankly  this debate has been too long in coming and I commend my friends  Majority Leader Frist and Minority Leader Reid  on coming to an agreement and bringing this debate to the floor            This is as real as it gets  This is about life over death and hope over despair  This is about encouraging astounding scientific advances that can relieve the suffering of millions of our fellow citizens  or accepting a shriveling stasis that  in fact  sounds a retreat as we watch the rest of the world march past us            We have before us three stem cell bills  but only one  the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  H R  810  deals with embryonic stem cells            Let me say that with a big    E      These embryonic stem cells actually hold the greatest promise for those afflicted with currently incurable diseases such as Alzheimer s  heart failure and spinal cord injury  These stem cells are    pluri potent        that is they can differentiate into any and all tissues           There is still much to know about what causes appropriate differentiation of embryonic stem cells  but if we conduct research to answer these questions  we will have the scientific power to replace dead neural tissue and muscle and cancerous white blood cells  with fresh new ones            The potential is breathtaking  What this means is that an individual with quadriplegia could walk again  The elderly affected by Alzheimer   s can be brought back from a hellish twilight and rejoin their families  Childhood leukemia could be banished to the realm of distant memory   And Americans everywhere will have a second chance at running with strong loud hearts           The science on embryonic stem cells is new and complicated  which is why we need our nation   s brightest minds working on this  Yet in 2001  President Bush issued an executive order which effectively banned federally funded embryonic stem cell research   This has stifled our nation s attempts to lead the world in harnessing the potential and miracles of embryonic stem cells   The president reasoned  like many who oppose this bill  that the process of embryonic stem cell extraction amounts to abortion because these cells have to be taken from microscopic embryos that do not survive the process             What the President did not mention is that the embryos under discussion number in the tens of thousands   They are the unused embryos from in vitro fertilization  are frozen in fertility clinics  are unique  and will be thrown away           I repeat  Thrown away  The chance to offer new life to millions of Americans suffering from debilitating by disease or injury will be discarded as medical waste           Given these facts  the choice seems clear  The Senate must choose to advance the scope of our scientific knowledge and expand the horizons of our medical technologies            The House has already done this  Last year  by a vote of 238 194  the House passed H R  810  introduced by Rep  Michael Castle  R DE   which authorized federally funded research on embryonic stem cell lines derived from surplus embryos at in vitro fertilization clinics  provided that donors give consent and that they are not paid for the embryos           The Senate today has the opportunity to join the House and we must do so by a resounding majority to convince the President that a veto of the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act is contrary to what Americans want             More than 65  of Americans support federal funding of embryonic stem cell research across all party lines            Finally  I do support the other two bills being considered alongside the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act  But a vote for them without a vote for H R 810 is the height of cynicism            Let us be clear  alternatives to embryonic stem cells  such as umbilical cord and adult bone marrow stem cells  are inferior alternatives  They do not have the same regenerative potential and Congress has already authorized money that is currently being used for research in this area            Today we stand at destiny   s doorstep with the chance to have it swing wide and open into a new age of scientific and medical understanding  We must not hesitate            I urge my colleagues will join me in its passage H R 810 and I call on President Bush to sign it into law and not veto the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans for whom astounding new cures may lie just over the threshold of our present knowledge           I yield the floor                30
