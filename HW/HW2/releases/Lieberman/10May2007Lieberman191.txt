                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  made the following statement today on the floor of the United States Senate       Mr  President  in the days ahead  this Congress and the President of the United States face a choice on the critical question of funding our operations in Iraq and Afghanistan  It is a choice between brinksmanship and statesmanship    a choice between continuing to stalemate largely along partisan lines or uniting across partisan lines in support of our troops        We all know what our most important responsibility is  Our forces in Iraq and Afghanistan are looking to us  They need the funding that only we in Congress can provide them  The money is running out       I understand that many in this chamber saw the supplemental appropriations bill as an opportunity to force a withdrawal of our troops from Iraq  and that many of us argued vigorously against the amendments that attempted to do that  Each side has now had an opportunity to make its case  and the result is clear  there are not enough votes in Congress to enact a mandatory date for withdrawal of American forces from Iraq  The time for having debates and sending messages on this troop funding bill should be over        It is time to get our troops the equipment  the training  the supplies they need   and without delay       We in this chamber have a responsibility to make certain that   no matter what our disagreements and differences here in Washington   our men and women in uniform in Iraq and Afghanistan are not caught in the political crossfire       Only a couple of months ago  the Senate confirmed a new Commander to implement a new strategy in Iraq  General David Petraeus  That new strategy is now being implemented  and it is achieving some encouraging  if early  signs of success  Indeed  progress has been won even though the full complement of troops has not yet arrived in Iraq       Yet  now many in Congress would pull the plug on this new strategy and thwart the work of our troops before they are given a fair chance to succeed         I am aware that public opinion has turned against the war in Iraq   The American people are deeply frustrated by the multiplicity of mistakes and errors that have been made   Progress has been too slow   The savagery of our enemy  which the American people witness on television every night  has been demoralizing   Many simply want to leave and wash our hands of what they perceive as a mess         But  leadership requires sometimes that we defy public opinion if that is what is necessary to do what is right for our country  In fact  at a time like this  we are required to do what each of us believes is right  and that might not be what is popular       And what is right  I firmly believe  is that we cannot allow our nation to be defeated in Iraq by the same terrorist enemy with which we are engaged in a world wide conflict   The global war on terrorism which we are waging is a world wide struggle against a barbaric totalitarian foe that is Al Qaeda   And today  it is Al Qaeda that we are fighting in Iraq   Al Qaeda itself has declared Iraq to be the central front of their larger war against our way of life       All of us who are privileged to serve this great country in positions of leadership have a very serious choice to make        Our judgment can be guided by the polls and we can withdraw in defeat   We can rationalize our action with the reassuring but falsely hopeful words like redeployment   No matter what we say  our enemy will know that America s will has been broken by the barbarity of their blood lust   the very barbarity we declare we are fighting  but from which we would actually be running      Mr  President  my main point is this  Now is not the time for more delay  for prolonged legislative posturing and bargaining over the supplemental appropriations bill  It is the time to do our duty to fund our troops  stand by our allies  and do everything we can to help them win the war against Al Qaeda in Iraq       Rather than inventing new ways to vent our frustration with the war on Iraq  or with the President by handcuffing General Petraeus and undermining his strategy  let us give him and his troops our support as they and their Iraqi allies fight to win for us       Thank you  Mr  President   I yield the floor        30
