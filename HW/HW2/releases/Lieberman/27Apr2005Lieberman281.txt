Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement Wednesday at a Committee hearing on the vulnerability to terrorist attack of the chemical industry       Madam Chairman  thank you for holding this first of what we hope will be a series of hearings on a critical gap in our homeland security   Once again  you have demonstrated your willingness to roll up your sleeves and tackle the hard issues and chemical security is certainly one of the hard ones   But it is an area of such serious vulnerability that we can   t be deterred by its complexities   I appreciate your leadership and  as always  I   m pleased to work with you and the other members of this Committee to try to address this hole in our homeland defense   I   m confident that we   re going to get something done this session of Congress         No one can doubt that the vast and diverse chemical industry is central to our way of life and to our economy  We rely on a multitude of chemical substances in our daily lives  from cleaning compounds  to life saving medicines  to home heating oil  Chemical plants  oil refineries  waste water treatment plants  and pharmaceutical companies all manufacture and store industrial chemicals and pesticides in large quantities in thousands of locations throughout the country  often near larger population centers  The consequences of an attack on any one of these facilities would be disastrous       The fact is  a chemical release from at least 123 plants scattered throughout the land could endanger more than a million people  according to the Environmental Protection Agency  and 3 000 facilities around the country could threaten 10 000 people   Furthermore  the Army Surgeon General has determined that as many as 2 4 million people could be killed or injured in a terrorist attack against a toxic chemical plant in a densely populated area   These are mega disasters that could occur       We have ample evidence that terrorists are working along these lines and intend to in the future as well   The Congressional Research Service reports that during the 1990s both international and domestic terrorists attempted to use explosives to release chemicals from manufacturing and storage facilities close to population centers   At least two of these incidents occurred in the U S         One of the 1993 World Trade Center bombers was employed as a chemical engineer and used company stationery to order chemicals for a bomb used in that attack   Those same terrorists stole cyanide from a chemical facility and were training to introduce it into the ventilation systems of office buildings   In a 2002 report the Justice Department described the threat posed by terrorists to chemical facilities as     quote      both real and credible        end quote  for the foreseeable future   And  it has been reported that U S  troops found chemical trade publications in Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan         It doesn   t take much imagination to picture the pain terrorists could inflict by attacking a chemical facility   Two decades later  the Bhopal horror is still fresh in our minds  At least 4 000 people were killed and an estimated 400 000 injured from the release of a toxic gas cloud from a chemical plant in central India in 1984   More recently  when a train recently derailed in South Carolina and ruptured a chlorine gas tanker car  10 people were killed by the lethal fumes which  according to EPA  affected an area two miles downwind from the derailment   This was not a worst case event since the gas release was not instantaneous  but occurred over several days   If that had been an intentional strike on a chlorine gas facility in a dense area  the death toll could have been staggering  Indeed  the experts continually tell us that the casualties of the 9 11 attacks could pale by comparison to an attack on a chemical facility in a densely populated area       Given our knowledge of the terrorists    desire to stage deadly chemical attacks  some of the more responsible companies aren   t waiting for Congress to tell them how to improve their security   I know the Department of Homeland Security is working with industry on several security initiatives  The Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 and the Bioterrorism Act of 2002 legislated important measures to improve security at a number of chemical and water treatment facilities   And several states are on the road to better chemical security         But millions more Americans continue to be at risk  and many facilities that use extremely hazardous chemicals are not covered by the patchwork of laws and regulations now in place   When the lives and livelihoods of so many Americans are at stake  relying on voluntary initiatives by the chemical industry to adequately protect us simply is not enough        So  how much progress has the government made to address this threat   Richard Falkenrath  former White House deputy homeland security adviser  whom we will hear from today  has told this Committee that since 9 11     quote        we have essentially done nothing        end quote  That is an unacceptable reality        Senator Corzine     whose testimony I eagerly await this morning    has worked diligently to move legislation through the Congress  and I supported his efforts last session  Unfortunately  the status quo has proven unmovable so far   The Administration has voiced support for legislation in the past  but actions speak louder than words     and thus far  it has not provided the leadership necessary to pass legislation to protect the American people        I look forward to hearing DHS   s views at a future hearing and I hope the Administration will commit to working with this Committee on a bipartisan basis to pass effective legislation         I   d like to thank the witnesses here today for sharing their expertise with us   You can help us better understand the gravity of the situation that confronts us  and provide guidance as we work to craft solutions          Thank you again  Madam Chairman  for providing your unique brand of leadership on yet another issue central to the security of millions of Americans         30
