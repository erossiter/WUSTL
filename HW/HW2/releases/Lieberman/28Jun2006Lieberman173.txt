                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement on the Senate floor Wednesday upon introduction of the U S  Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006                    Mr  President  I am pleased to join with Chairman Collins today to speak in favor of the legislation we are introducing to reinvent FEMA into an agency capable of responding effectively to a catastrophe the size and scope of Hurricane Katrina but also to the natural disasters in the normal course of events that have effected and will effect the American people                   The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee spent seven months last year and into this year investigating the failed government response to that hurricane  Our report recounts a double tragedy of epic proportions     a tragedy caused by nature and compounded by human folly and the failure of leadership                   We found government at all levels     from the federal government to the local government  from the White House to FEMA to the governor   s office in Louisiana to the mayor   s office in New Orleans     unprepared  even though the hurricane and its affect on the New Orleans levee system had been long predicted   Likewise  all levels of government were unequipped to deal with the human suffering that followed the storm   s landfall and galvanized the attention and ultimately produced the enormous embarrassment and anger of the American people as we watched our fellow Americans suffering on the Gulf coast without the support they have the right to expect from their government  These failings were caused by negligence  lack of resources  lack of capability  but most of all  a lack of leadership starting at the very top                   We cannot legislate leadership   But we can legislate bold changes at the federal level that are critical for our nation to develop the capacity necessary to protect our people in times of disaster whether natural or terrorist    So  we made a number of recommendations  on a bipartisan basis  about what was needed to improve our preparations  response  and recovery the next time disaster strikes  as it surely will   One of our recommendations    was to rebuild FEMA into a more powerful  better managed  better integrated  better supported organization  Our recommendation was to give the reinvented FEMA  for the first time in its history  the authority and muscle to respond to natural disasters and to catastrophes in the way the American people expect their federal government to respond     with speed  with efficiency and with effect                    We would call this new organization the United States Emergency Management Authority  USEMA    But no matter what you call it  this organization  we have concluded  must be in the Department of Homeland Security  in fact must be at the core of the Department   just as FEMA was originally intended to be when we proposed the new department in 2002  based on the recommendations of the Hart Rudman Commission the previous year                    The legislation we are introducing today is the first step in this process   Chairman Collins and I expect to introduce soon a broader bill that will encompass all of our report   s key recommendations   But we begin today by rejoining the functions of disaster response with disaster preparedness within a new USEMA                     Our investigation of Hurricane Katrina made it clear to us that preparedness and response are two sides of the same coin    In the years before Katrina  FEMA  the agency charged with coordinating our nation   s response to terrorist attacks or natural disasters  too often was out of the loop when critical decisions about how to prepare     such as how to spend billions of dollars in grants     were made   Exercises were designed and held without serious input by FEMA   FEMA   s ability to respond was crippled because it was not central to preparedness  and thus did not have the close relationships needed with state and local officials on the front lines   The preparers and the responders need to be working hand in hand with state and local officials  other federal agencies  and the private and non profit sectors if both functions are to work as well as we expect them to                    Our legislation first and foremost will ensure that our preparedness efforts are closely linked  inseparable from the capabilities we need to respond                    Our investigation also made clear that part of FEMA   s problem during Hurricane Katrina was that it was an agency weakened by years of budget and staff cuts   At the time the hurricane made landfall  FEMA had been operating with a 15 percent vacancy rate for over a year  And it had a senior political management largely without emergency management experience                    We address these problems by giving the new authority a special status within the Department of Homeland Security     the same special status the Coast Guard and Secret Service now have   With this status  changes to the agency   s functions and assets can only be made through statute   Furthermore  we would require that the Administrator and other key officials have the necessary experience and qualifications to get the job done   USEMA will not be plagued by unqualified appointees like FEMA has been                   The Chairman and I also believe FEMA is too Washington oriented and too disconnected from the real work of preparing for disasters where they actually occur  so we envision a rebuilt agency with robust regional offices to focus on preparedness and response coordination with local and state agencies   Each regional office would house a permanent    strike team    that would include representatives from other federal agencies involved in emergency response to ensure the Feds are familiar with regional threats and with state and local emergency personnel                    I know some of my colleagues believe FEMA should be removed from DHS and given the full independent status it once had  But Senator Collins and I know this is not the solution  Removing the agency from the Department will only create additional problems   It would be like removing the Army from the Department of Defense                    The USEMA  the government   s chief response agency  must have access to the vast resources of the Department of Homeland Security and it needs to work seamlessly with the other agencies that have critical roles to play during catastrophes  The Coast Guard  which performed so admirably during Katrina  might need to be activated  The Department   s communications capabilities  law enforcement  intelligence offices  and infrastructure protection will all be needed in response to a catastrophe   In other words  the federal response must be integrated and that will occur if all agencies have a history of working together within the same Department  if the officials know one another  and if they ultimately serve the same Secretary of Homeland Security                   Furthermore  taking FEMA out of DHS would create more and duplicative bureaucracy   DHS would have to develop its own response capabilities  FEMA would have to develop its own preparedness capabilities  And both would need to have tools for obtaining situational awareness  We do not have the resources to waste on that kind of duplication                    Returning FEMA to an independent agency is not a guarantee that it will be competent  Even when it was independent  FEMA never did develop the capabilities needed to respond to a catastrophe like Katrina  In fact  its response to Hurricane Andrew in 1992     a much smaller storm  killing about 50 people compared to Katrina   s 1 500    was a disaster in itself  leading the Government Accounting Office to conclude that it had    serious doubts about whether FEMA is capable of responding to catastrophic disasters     The agency did improve subsequent to Hurricane Andrew but never had the ability to respond to a storm like Katrina                     The desperate conditions of Gulf Coast communities in the week after Katrina   s landfall shocked the country   There are many other American communities that are similarly vulnerable   whether to a natural disaster or to terrorist attack  The next catastrophe is coming   We know that   We also know there are significant flaws in the nation   s readiness  We can   t afford another response like the one to Katrina                     Our proposal is not about fiddling with bureaucratic flow charts or re branding  or rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic  It is about plugging the gash in the hull  and building a better deck  It   s about saving people   s lives by bringing together the skills  resources  missions  and authority for effective preparedness and response to catastrophes when local and state agencies are overwhelmed by a terror attack or a natural disaster                   I ask my colleagues for their support of this legislation  And I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the bill be reprinted into the record   Thank you        30
