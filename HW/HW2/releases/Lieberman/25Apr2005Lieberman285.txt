appalling          WASHINGTON     Senators Susan Collins  R Me   and Joseph Lieberman  D Conn   are asking the head of the Transportation Security Administration to ensure that specific actions are being taken to prevent wasteful spending at the Transportations Security Operations Center        In a letter to Assistant Secretary David Stone  the Senators express    serious concerns    regarding a recently released Department of Homeland Security Inspector General report titled    Irregularities in the Development of the Transportation Security Operations Centers           The report cites breakdowns in management controls that led to waste and abuse and TSA stood up its TSOC   The Inspector General specifically points to inappropriate purchases     decorative items such as silk plants and art     totaling  500 000  improper use of federal purchase cards  and wasteful procurement and construction decisions  including 4 200 square foot fitness center          The findings in this report are appalling     said Senators Collins and Lieberman in a joint letter to Secretary Stone dated April 25  2005      The disregard shown by the project manager to procurement policies  the failure by senior management at the time to provide appropriate oversight  the endless citations of wasteful spending     and even one of overpayment     are unacceptable   From the start  TSA failed to scope the construction project following basic acquisition guidelines   That lack of attention extended throughout the project such that TSA still cannot account properly for expended funds          The Senators acknowledged that TSA faced    tremendous strains    during the developmental stages of TSOC  including the mobilization of 60 000 field employees in nearly 500 locations nationwide and the lack of robust communications capabilities to direct field operations   However  Senators Collins and Lieberman said these challenges do not excuse the findings of the report          Major decisions were made haphazardly  without weighing all of the appropriate factors  such as cost and requirements   The report cites that TSA   s own policies and guidelines were not followed or enforced     wrote the Senators       Senators Collins and Lieberman asked Assistant Secretary Stone to provide details of the specific measures TSA has established to preclude similar wasteful spending incidents in the future and information on any disciplinary action taken as a result of the incidents revealed by the DHS IG report       The full text of the letter is as follows          April 25  2005   Dear Secretary Stone     We are writing to express our serious concerns regarding the recently released DHS Inspector General report titled    Irregularities in the Development of the Transportation Security Operations Center             The findings in this report are appalling   The disregard shown by the project manager to procurement policies  the failure by senior management at the time to provide appropriate oversight  the endless citations of wasteful spending    and even one of overpayment    are unacceptable   From the start  TSA failed to scope the construction project following basic acquisition guidelines   That lack of attention extended throughout the project such that TSA still cannot account properly for expended funds          We recognize the tremendous strains that TSA faced during its developmental stages   The dramatic mobilization of 60 000 field employees in nearly 500 locations nationwide created a significant management challenge   That challenge was complicated by the lack of robust communications capabilities to direct field operations   These explanations were laid out well by Former Deputy Administrator Stephen McHale in his letter responding to the report       Yet  those reasons in no way excuse the findings of this report   Major decisions were made haphazardly  without weighing all of the appropriate factors  such as cost and requirements   The report cites that TSA   s own policies and guidelines were not followed or enforced       We would appreciate your personal reassurance that TSA has taken specific actions since this incident  and others that occurred in this time frame  to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future   To this end  we would appreciate a written response outlining the specific measures you have established that will preclude any similar incidents in the future   Please also provide information on any disciplinary action taken as a result of this incident       We look forward to personally hearing your response to these allegations   If you have any questions  please feel free to have your staff contact Kathy Kraninger of the majority staff at  202  224 4751 or minority staff member Jason Yanussi at  202  224 2627      Sincerely    Susan Collins  Chairman   Joseph Lieberman  Ranking Member       30
