                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   said the  35 billion homeland security spending bill that was expected to be passed by the Senate late Friday was    imperfect    but would nevertheless improve the security of the American people                      I believe we have made real progress in strengthening our homeland security since 9 11  and I am privileged to have had a role in bringing about that progress     Lieberman said      I must add  however  that we are still a ways off from assuring the American people they are as safe as they should be   We continue to work toward that goal  and each day we get a little bit closer                      The Fiscal Year 2007 appropriations bill for the Department of Homeland Security includes provisions to refashion the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the wake of its disastrous preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina   Lieberman and HSGAC Chairman Susan Collins proposed these changes in an effort to guarantee more effective planning for and a more successful response to future disasters                   Lieberman said he was deeply disappointed by continued cuts in funding for the men and women on the front lines of the war on terror at home   And he lamented the under funding of rail and transit security                       We cannot afford to become complacent     Lieberman said     The terrorists still have us in their sites  Additional resources are needed  and I will continue to advocate for them as a wise investment in the greater protection it will provide the American people                       The cuts in state homeland security funding are not as deep as those proposed by the President in his budget this year  but    they still continue what has been a disturbing downward trend over the last few years     the Senator said                   Since 2004  for example  the state homeland security grant program     which provides the central preparedness assistance to states throughout the country     has been slashed by 69 percent                   The legislation before the Senate on Friday would elevate FEMA to a special  independent status within DHS  and reorganizations could only occur by Congressional action  The FEMA administrator will be the President   s principal advisor in an emergency and the administrator and top regional officials will have to have appropriate experience and qualifications for the job                      This legislation restores unity to FEMA   s preparedness and response functions     Lieberman added     In other words  there will be one organization     FEMA   responsible for both responding to a disaster and planning and training for that response                      The measure also creates a new Office for Emergency Communications dedicated to achieving the operability and interoperability of emergency communications among first responders that is fundamental to any disaster response  But it does not contain dedicated funding for a grant program to support and promote communications interoperability                   Although the measure gives DHS  for the first time ever  the authority to regulate high risk chemical facilities  Lieberman said it lacks many portions of the comprehensive and bipartisan legislation passed out of both House and Senate homeland security committees  For example  it does not guarantee the rights of states to enact stronger chemical security provisions   And it does not refer to the benefits of safer chemicals and methods to lessen the vulnerability of chemical facilities in the first place                      These provisions are vital because  as we recently observed with the breech of security here at our own heavily guarded Capitol complex  guards and gates alone are always subject to failure     Lieberman said     The American people will not be safe from attacks on these facilities until we provide comprehensive security                        Lieberman added     While this bill is imperfect  I think it is a step toward ensuring that we have a strong  capable agency     FEMA   to lead the country   s response to future disasters
