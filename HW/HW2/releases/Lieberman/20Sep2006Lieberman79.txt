                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  a senior member of the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works  EPW  Committee  criticized the Bush Administration   s inadequate response to global warming   Lieberman submitted the following statement during an EPW Committee hearing to examine Asia Pacific Partnership           Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing           Since 2002  the Bush administration has acknowledged that global warming threatens our nation   s well being  and that the U S  accordingly should slow  stop  and reverse the current growth in its greenhouse gas emissions             Unfortunately  the administration   s policies will not slow or stop  much less reverse those emissions in time to avoid the shame of leaving our grandchildren a world of flooded coastlines  increased drought  more destructive storms  rampant disease  and more armed conflict           The only specific target President Bush has endorsed is reducing the    greenhouse gas intensity    of the U S  economy by 18 percent in the decade between 2002 and 2012   What that adds up to is actually a 14 percent increase in the nation   s annual greenhouse gas emissions over that same period   That is the identical rate of increase that we have seen over the past 15 years   So even if President Bush   s policies live up to his commitment  they will not slow the growth in U S  greenhouse gas emissions at all           As it happens  the administration   s existing policies are insufficient to meet even President Bush   s inadequate commitment   The centerpiece of those policies  the Asia Pacific Partnership that is the subject of today   s hearing  is nothing more than a series of meetings in which representatives from the U S   Australia  China  Japan  Korea  and India will discuss ways in which they might work together to promote cleaner  more efficient technologies to address pollution reduction  energy security  and climate change concerns   There is nothing binding about the Asia Pacific Partnership  and its charter does not even set any targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions             The most tangible step the administration has taken toward meeting its inadequate commitment is to launch    FutureGen     a public private partnership that is spending ten years to build a facility that will make electricity and hydrogen from coal without emitting any greenhouse gasses   As laudable as this single project is  it will not change the fact that  in the absence of the real climate policies that the administration still opposes  the U S  private sector will spend the next ten years building more than a dozen new coal fired power plants that will release all of their global warming pollution into the atmosphere           The administration   s half measures reflect a mentality that now lags behind the views of many of the large American businesses that emit greenhouse gasses   More and more of those companies acknowledge that the U S  can and must institute a mandatory  economy wide emissions cap to curb this nation   s negative influence on the world   s climate           The country   s business leaders are coming around to the position that John McCain and I staked out in 2003  when we introduced the first bill to institute a mandatory  economy wide greenhouse gas emissions cap and allow companies to trade emissions allowances beneath that cap   By literally mandating that U S  global warming pollution actually be cut  our bill attaches a price to emitting global warming pollution   By instituting a market based system with plenty of built in flexibility  and by investing heavily in technology deployment  the bill gives industry the tools it needs to limit its emissions in affordable ways that end up creating jobs and increasing the competitiveness of American businesses in the global marketplace           As you all know  John and I forced the Senate to vote on our Climate Stewardship Act in 2003 and again in 2005  The bill that we will reintroduce early next year  hopefully again with the co sponsorship of my fellow committee member Senator Obama and of Senate Snowe  will adhere to the core principles I have already mentioned            It will also include improvements designed to further reduce compliance costs  further protect American workers  further fund the early deployment of safe  zero emissions energy technologies  accelerate the spread of products and techniques that reduce energy usage without compromises  and reward the early action that some of the nation   s most climate responsible businesses are taking already             This past July  my fellow committee members  Jim Jeffords and Barbara Boxer  introduced a bill to mandate aggressive reductions in the U S  economy   s greenhouse gas emissions  Senator Feinstein has announced her intention to do the same in the next Congress   In May  my friend Tom Carper reintroduced his bill to cap the U S  power sector   s greenhouse gas emissions             While John and I will push for enactment of our bipartisan  economy wide  cap and trade bill in the next Congress  we welcome our colleagues    bills as highly productive contributions to the Senate   s work on this crucial issue  and I for one look forward to working with them           The Bush Administration  however  has some serious catching up to do           Thank you  Mr  Chairman          30
