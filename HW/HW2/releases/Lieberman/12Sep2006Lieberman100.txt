the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  delivered the following statement at a hearing Tuesday on    Homeland Security  The Next Five Years                  Thank you  Madam Chairman and welcome to you  Secretary Chertoff   Madam Chairman  I   m grateful to you for calling this hearing to discuss the state of our homeland security five years after Islamic terrorists murdered 3 000 innocent Americans and shocked the rest of us from our false post Cold War sense of security   Yesterday was a day of remembrance and requiem   Today  we will ask where we want to be in homeland security five years from now  What can we say on a personalized level to the parents of America about what we will do in the next five years together to be able to guarantee that their children   s upbringing and lives will be as secure as theirs were prior to 9 11             September 11  2001  was like Pearl Harbor  a tragedy of such enormity that it ushered in an understanding that we are in a war with a different kind of enemy  and that our country  led by the federal government  must pull together and do better to fulfill our Constitutional duty to provide for the common defense against this unconventional and unprecedented threat  The threat of a terrorist attack on Americans is as real today as it was five years ago   The foiled plot to explode airliners heading to the United States from the UK is the most recent and public example             Together  we can say to the American people that they are safer than they were on 9 11 01  although  as we all acknowledge  they are not yet as safe as we want them to be  We have every reason  as we look back over these five years  to thank G d and to thank all the work being done each day by 180 000 Department of Homeland Security employees to protect our homeland security and that America and Americans have not been attacked at home since 9 11 01   We are thankful that a number of terrorist plots have been disrupted through increased vigilance at home and cooperative work with our allies abroad               Since 9 11  we have made historic organizational changes in our government to shore up our homeland defenses  These include the reorganization of our  vast and far flung security and emergency response agencies into the Department of Homeland Security  the creation of the 9 11 Commission  the enactment of its bold proposals for reform for greater security  and the establishment of the Northern Command to focus the Department of Defense on homeland  as well as international  security   The point of these changes has been to focus federal attention on terrorism 24 hours a day  seven days a week with resolve  coordination  and strong leadership  to bring purpose and effectiveness to the protection of our homeland   As I have said  we are clearly safer today for all we have done together  and there are clearly weak links remaining  that we must deal with together                 I know that along the way there have been misgivings and soul searching about the Department of Homeland Security  but I do not hear any credible voice saying that we erred in creating the Department of Homeland Security  So if the Department has not yet fully lived up to all that we in Congress hoped it would be  let us resolve today to look forward to the next five years  to work together to make it so             Let me say very briefly that the first great challenge the Department is facing is to pull itself together  We gave the department an enormous task to bring together 180 000 federal employees from a large number of agencies with different cultures and on different directions  We need what Warren Bennis  advisor to four presidents  called the    capacity to translate vision into reality     that is leadership  It   s a great challenge  but I believe progress has been made in the time the Department has existed             The failure of leadership we saw acutely in the run up and response to Hurricane Katrina  Mr  Secretary  as you know  the pain and devastation that Katrina caused and is still causing would be even worse were a nuclear weapon to explode in a crowded city  or if terrorists were to spray a mall with a deadly biological agent  or even if a naturally occurring virus spread to the level of a pandemic               We are looking to you for leadership on these threats   I hope that you have acted to apply some of the painful lessons learned in Katrina  You know that we on this Committee have done the same through legislative work and we know there is more work to do       Second  I continue to believe that we are continuing to under fund some critical Homeland Security needs  particularly our first responders  Mr  Secretary  today I look forward to hearing from you your sense  your vision  of where this Department of going and also what you are going to do to translate that vision into reality and to action              The security of the American people is the highest priority of our government  The plain fact is  without security  there can not be and will not be the life  liberty  and pursuit of property that our government was formed to secure  So we have to get this right  and we have to get it right together              I close with thanks to Senator Collins and the other members of this Committee  as we look back over the last five years since 9 11 01  in a Capitol City which has become all too partisan  reflexively  On the question of homeland security  on balance  this Committee has acted with a real sense of unity that goes well beyond partisanship for the national interest  Legislation that we have reported out has been adopted by Congress  signed by the President  and  undoubtedly today  makes America safer  Madam Chairman  I thank you for your leadership and point to the commitment of all members of this Committee to work together to secure our future against a brutal and inhumane enemy
