                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Thank you  Madam Chairman   Once again our Committee has been asked to take on a major assignment  and under your leadership  we   ve worked hard  worked together and worked quickly to produce a good and positive result to send to the full Senate   The Committee   s prompt attention to fixing our lobbying laws will be an important step toward restoring the public   s confidence in the integrity and fairness of the Congress of the United States        I want to begin by thanking Senators McCain and Dorgan who led the investigation into Jack Abramoff  I also want to thank Senator Obama for the leadership role he has played         The scandals surrounding lobbyist Jack Abramoff and Congressman Duke Cunningham are the immediate reasons for prompt action that we are taking today and of course that action has to be bipartisan and I am confident it will be         Trust between the people and their elected leadership is at the core of our democracy  The behavior of Mr  Abramoff and Mr  Cunningham undercuts that trust and sends the message that in Washington  results go to the highest bidder  not to the greatest public good   We know that that is rarely the case  but it is in the interest of  the Democratic process to respond        By their guilty pleas  Mr  Abramoff and Mr  Cunningham have acknowledged their violations of the letter of the law  But Mr  Abramoff   s story also reveals activity that  while technically legal  is nonetheless clearly wrong   In government  we have a responsibility to hold ourselves  and be held to  a higher standard  which is to say      to do not just what is legal  but what is right   As lawmakers  we uniquely now have the opportunity and responsibility to make what is clearly wrong also clearly illegal       I joined with Senator John McCain earlier this year to cosponsor the Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act  which will be the base of our substitution bill today   I am also very proud to be co sponsoring Chairman Collins    mark   The Collins Lieberman substitute contains important reforms that will require more disclosure from lobbyists and strengthen enforcement of the rules and regulations governing those lobbyists   It would establish  as the Chairman has mentioned  an independent Office of Public Integrity with a full time executive director with investigative and subpoena powers and the staff to do a lot more than is done under the status quo   It would require lobbyists to report their activities on a quarterly basis  rather than semi annually  and establish an electronic database of the information   Our proposal for the first time would require registered lobbyists to report all their campaign contributions  as well as other contributions that honor Members of Congress  all in the interest of full disclosure   And it would increase from one year to two the amount of time that must pass before a former Member of Congress or senior executive branch official could lobby his or her former colleagues   It would also bar Congressional staff from lobbying the entire Congress for one year       The substitute Senator Collins and I offer this morning does not contain some of the provisions embodied in the McCain Lieberman bill that would amend the rules of the Senate  pursuant to the decision Senator Collins and I have made that our Committee should not intrude into the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee  reflecting the decision of the Rules Committee not to intrude into our jurisdiction   But Senator McCain and I and others will be offering amendments to change the Senate rules on the floor next week  including one that will concern the price Senators pay when we fly on private jets        I have said before and I will say it again  we now have a once in a generation opportunity to reach agreement on a broad set of reforms that will help fix the rules governing our relations with lobbyists and restore the reputation of this institution in the eyes of the American people  Our laws and rules that govern our interaction with lobbyists need fixing  We cannot let partisanship or institutional defensiveness keep us from achieving that goal        30
