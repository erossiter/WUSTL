                                                                                  June 8  2005 Contact

Commissioners to Groton                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Governor M  Jodi Rell and the Connecticut Congressional delegation have sent personal invitations to the five members of the Base Realignment and Closure  BRAC  Commission who have not yet visited the U S  Navy   s submarine base in Groton  saying a tour of the base would give them indispensable insight on its value                    BRAC Commission Chairman Anthony Principi and Commissioners James H  Bilbray  Philip Coyle and Lloyd    Fig    Newton visited Groton on May 31 and June 1  The Commissioners met with Governor Rell  members of the delegation and senior Navy officials  The commissioners toured the base and heard from the Governor  the members of Congress and the SUBASE Realignment Coalition about the strengths of the Groton facility and the problems discovered in a review of the Defense Department decision                       Chairman Principi and the commissioners came away from their trip to Groton with a profoundly better understanding of our base  its role in national defense and homeland security  its importance to Connecticut  and the serious errors the Department of Defense made in its analysis     Governor Rell said     They could see for themselves the wealth of facilities on the base  the improvements we and the federal government have been making and the critical synergies that exist between the base and Electric Boat                        The commissioners could also see the gross inconsistencies between the Defense Department   s analysis and reality  for example  the    zero    score Groton got for piers     the very piers commissioners were standing on     the Governor said     That is the kind of information that we think it is important for all of the commissioners to have as they consider the future of this base  We know they have an extremely busy schedule  But given the gravity of the decision to close this base  we feel the visit is worth the time                       The invitations to Commissioners Harold W  Gehman Jr   James V  Hansen        James T  Hill  Samuel K  Skinner and Sue E  Turner are each signed by the Governor and all seven members of Connecticut   s Congressional delegation                       Sub Base New London is unique     said Senator Christopher Dodd     It and southeastern Connecticut provide    one stop shopping    when it comes to our nation   s submarine needs  It   s vital that we preserve its unparalleled value and synergy  Having all of the other BRAC commissioners come see it first hand can only help us in that endeavor                       Senator Joe Lieberman said     We had a good  productive exchange of information with the commissioners who visited Groton and met with us last week  They were asking all of the right questions and  I hope  learned a lot about the military value of the New London sub base  I encourage the other commissioners to visit us as their colleagues did to see first hand the irreplaceable synergy that occurs with Electric Boat  the sub base and the sub school in such close proximity                          Last week   s two day visit to the region provided four of the nine BRAC commissioners with a clear picture of the substantial military value and synergy benefits of our Navy sub base     said Representative Rob Simmons     It   s imperative that the other five commissioners get the same tour and briefings  Seeing the sub base is believing in the sub base                       Representative John B  Larson said     Seeing the base first hand will confirm the discrepancies we have found between the base   s true value to our long term defense interests and the Pentagon   s assessment  For reasons still not apparent  the Defense Department has significantly undervalued the sub base   s role and viability  Its continuation isn   t just in Connecticut   s best interest but the nation   s                          Once the other commissioners see what Connecticut residents have known for generations     that the Groton submarine base plays a vital and unique role in our national defense and that nearby Electric Boat is crucial to our manufacturing industry     the Groton base will not be on the final BRAC list     said Representative Rosa DeLauro                    Representative Christopher Shays said     I am eager for all of the BRAC commissioners to see our sub base and fully understand the synergy between the military base and the local educational and industrial organizations nearby  Given the economic impact this closing could have on our state  I am hopeful the commissioners will take the time for a personal visit                          The New London sub base has tremendous military value for the nation and it must be maintained     said Representative Nancy Johnson     It is important for each commissioner to visit the base so they can fully understand the need to preserve this installation and its assets             30
