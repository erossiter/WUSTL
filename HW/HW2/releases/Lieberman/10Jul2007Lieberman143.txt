the following remarks on the floor of the U S  Senate        Mr  President  I rise to speak about the pending business before the Senate  which is the Department of Defense Authorization Bill for Fiscal Year 2008  This is a bill that the Senate Armed Services Committee has worked long and hard on over a period of several months   I am privileged to be a member of the committee  now doubly privileged to be chair of the Air Land Subcommittee   I am proud of the work of the committee  This is a bill that does the best we possibly can to support and expand our forces during a time of war        Unfortunately  most of the time that will be spent by this chamber on this bill will not be about its solid substance  but on a series of amendments that will be offered to alter our course or force our withdrawal from Iraq       In my considered opinion  respectfully  this is a mistake   These amendments regarding Iraq  I believe  are untimely  they are unwise  and they are unfair   They are untimely in the sense that they are premature and should await September when  as ordained by this Congress itself on the Supplemental Appropriations Bill  General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker will come back to report to us fully   They are unwise  if ever adopted  because they would essentially represent a retreat from Iraq  a defeat for the United States and the forces of a new Iraq  a free Iraq  and a tremendous victory for Iran and Al Qaeda  who are our two most significant enemies in the world today         And  introducing these amendments at this time  in my opinion  is unfair   unfair most of all to the 160 000 Americans in uniform over there  brave men and women who in my opinion are the new greatest generation  and who are putting their lives on the line every day   They have made tremendous progress already in the so called surge counteroffensive  and to snipe at them from here is  in my opinion  unfair   And that s why I will oppose all of the amendments that I have heard about thus far  and why I want to discuss them today   I suppose that  in terms of timeliness  if one felt that the surge counteroffensive  which began in February and has just been fully staffed a couple of weeks ago  had absolutely failed  then one might say  okay  we won t wait until September as we d promised we d do   We ll try to force a change in policy and retreat right now   But the facts that I will discuss will show that the surge is showing some success   in some ways  some remarkable success  and doesn t justify these amendments of retreat being introduced at this time       Mr  President  six months ago  this chamber voted unanimously to confirm General David Petraeus as commander of our forces in Iraq  The fact is  previously the administration had followed a strategy in Iraq that simply was not working   It was a strategy focused on keeping the U S  force presence as small as possible  regardless of conditions on the ground  and of pushing Iraqi forces into the lead as quickly as possibly  regardless of their capabilities         General Petraeus was part of a process along with others that presented a dramatically different strategy to the President of the United States  the Commander in Chief  He accepted that dramatically different strategy  which was to apply classic principles of counterinsurgency that have been successful elsewhere  So that instead of our main goal being to get out of Iraq  our main goal became to protect the civilian population that the terrorists were persistently attacking  bringing chaos throughout the country  including particularly in the capital city of Baghdad  making it impossible for a new Iraqi government to take shape             As a result  over the past five months  many problems  many crises  many challenges in Iraq that had long been described as hopeless have begun to improve  In Baghdad  the sectarian violence that had paralyzed the city for more than a year began to drop dramatically  In Anbar province  which the chief of Marine Corps intelligence in Iraq described just nine months ago as  lost   our surge forces have moved in effectively   Working together with Sunni tribal leaders  we have got Al Qaeda on the run from Anbar province  the province that they intended to make the capital of the new Islamist extremist republic of Iraq         As John Burns of the New York Times recently put it  the capital city of Anbar  Ramadi  has  gone from being the most dangerous place in Iraq  to being one of the least dangerous places         Despite these gains in Baghdad and Anbar  critics of the new strategy nonetheless insisted that it was not working  pointing to the fact that while Al Qaeda was on the run from some places  it was causing devastation in other parts of Iraq  in Diyala province for instance   But what happened   Petraeus  now with the additional personnel brought under his command by the surge counteroffensive  has been able to leave troops in Anbar  fortified by Iraqi security forces and the Sunni tribal forces  and add new forces to Diyala   And now they have Al Qaeda on the run there           Our forces in the field are  of course  still facing daunting challenges and a brutal  inhumane foe  enemies who are prepared to blow themselves up to make a point  to kill others  hating us and others more than they love their own lives   But the plain truth is  the Iraq  in this month  July 2007 is a very different and better place than Iraq in January or February 2007   and it because of the so called surge counteroffensive strategy   Those who refuse to recognize that change and nonetheless go forward with the same policies of defeat and withdrawal that they ve been talking about for months have  I would say respectfully  have closed their eyes to the reality of what is actually happening on the ground in Iraq        General Petraeus has persistently appealed to us to have some patience  to not rush to judgment about the success or failure of the new surge strategy   and it s only right that we do so         But instead of respecting those pleas  withholding our judgment  remaining true to what we ourselves put into the Supplemental Appropriations Bill   which was a requirement for an interim report this week  and a full report about the benchmarks  and in person by General Petraeus and Ambassador Crocker in September   instead of waiting for that to happen  I regret that some of my colleagues have decided to go ahead and submit these amendments which to me represent the continuation of legislative trench warfare against our presence in Iraq  no matter what the facts on the ground there are   Rather than giving General Petraeus and his troops a fair chance to succeed   and it s not just for them  it is for us   I regret that the efforts will be made here to undermine our strategy   which is now a successful strategy in Iraq   to dictate when  where  and against whom our soldiers can fight  and when we should get out         I suppose this would be justified if somebody concluded that the war was lost in Iraq   But the war is not lost in Iraq   In fact  now American forces are winning   the enemy is on the run  but here in Congress  in Washington  some members seem to be on the run   chased  I fear  by public opinion polls         I know the American people are frustrated  I understand that   I know what they see every night on TV  the suicide bombs   I know how much they want their loved ones to come home  no one wants that more than we do here   But the consequences of doing that would be a disaster for Iraq  the Middle East  and for us  because the victors would be Iran and Al Qaeda   our two most dangerous enemies in the world today   And trust me  they would follow us back here to this country         One might pursue a policy of changing course  directing a retreat  a withdrawal  accepting defeat  if one thought that the war is lost  The war is not lost         In fact  I will say to my colleagues today that this war in Iraq will never be lost by our military on the ground in Iraq   The war in Iraq can only be lost with a loss of political will here at home  and perhaps with a loss of political will in Iraq   but that story is not finished yet         Perhaps there are some that the war is not lost  but it s not worth winning   I think you ve got to think of the consequences of defeat   The consequences of defeat are a victory for Iran and Al Qaeda  chaos in Iraq  slaughter that will probably begin to look like genocide  instability in the region  and the danger that we will be forced to send our troops back into the region in greater numbers to fight a more difficult war        The amendments on this Department of Defense Bill  I think  are mistaken   And what are the alternatives that my colleagues are going to propose on these amendments   Some propose a total withdrawal of American troops from Iraq as quickly as possible   Its sponsors argue that we can continue to fight Al Qaeda in Iraq and defend our other key interests in the Middle East by operating from bases elsewhere there         With all due respect  this is fantasy        As my friend Senator Lugar pointed out a short while ago  a complete American withdrawal from Iraq is likely to have devastating consequences for American national security  Everyone knows that Senator Lugar is a skeptic about the current strategy and events in Iraq  and yet  in his words  a complete withdrawal from Iraq would  compound the risks of a wider regional conflict    It would be a severe blow to U S  credibility that would make nations in the region far less likely to cooperate with us    It would expose Iraqis who have worked with us to retribution    and would also be a signal that the United States was abandoning efforts to prevent Iraqi territory from being used as a terrorist base    So spoke the distinguished Senator from Indiana  Senator Lugar         Another amendment would keep some forces in Iraq  pull most forces out by next April 1st   their numbers should be dramatically reduced  and their mission radically redefined  Some argue that American soldiers should withdraw from Iraq s cities and instead focus on the training of Iraqi forces  targeting counterterrorism  and protecting the remaining American troops there       Let me say  Mr  President  that that s a vision I would embrace for the future   not as a substitute for the surge counteroffensive strategy we re following now  but as a consequence of a successful implementation of that strategy   For if we in this chamber of Congress mandate the withdrawal of our troops down to a core group with a new mission before the Iraqi security forces are ready to provide security  we re going back to the exact strategy some describe as the Rumsfeld strategy   which didn t work  which was condemned by most people in both parties over a period of years        I repeat my confidence that the number of American troops will be reduced  but it will be reduced best when it is reduced as the result of a successful implementation of the surge strategy as carried out heroically by American forces       Mr  President  I conclude with these words  Our responsibilities in this chamber ultimately do not allow us to be guided by our frustrations  or even by public opinion polls  when we respectfully believe that those public opinion polls do not reflect what is best for our nation         We were elected to lead   We were elected to see beyond the next election  to do what is best for the next generation of Americans   We were elected to defend our beloved country  its security  and its values   all that is on the line in Iraq today        So I appeal to my colleagues  let s not undercut our troops and legislate a defeat in Iraq where none is occurring now  where hope is strong  where the momentum is in fact on our side   And if you question that  at least show the fairness and respect for General Petraeus  Ambassador Crocker  and all the people working for us there to wait until September  which is what we said we would do  until we take a serious look at these amendments  If we go down the path that the amendments entice us toward  what awaits us is an emboldened Iran  a strengthened Al Qaeda  a failed Iraq that will become not just a killing field  but will destabilize the entire Middle East  and also  I fear  imperil our security here at home       I thank the chair and I yield the floor             30
