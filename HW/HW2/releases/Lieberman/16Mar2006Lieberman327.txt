Wednesday wrote to Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff asking him to improve housing assistance to Katrina victims and to take immediate steps to develop a national catastrophic housing plan  In their letter  Collins and Lieberman sought information on FEMA   s efforts to ease the transition of victims from hotels and motels into temporary housing   They asked the Secretary to sort out why many Katrina victims have not received the mobile homes they have requested  They urged FEMA to clarify eligibility guidelines for those in need of additional rental assistance  And they asked the Secretary to coordinate with relevant federal  state  and local agencies  and non governmental organizations to develop a national strategy to better handle the displacement of large numbers of people in the future   Following is the full text of the letter           March 14  2006       The Honorable Michael Chertoff                             Secretary                                                                 Department of Homeland Security                           Washington  DC 20528                                                                                                                   Dear Secretary Chertoff        We are writing to urge you to take immediate steps to address the critical shortfalls in FEMA s efforts to provide transitional housing for victims of Hurricane Katrina and to request that you institute a collaborative effort with the appropriate agencies to develop a national disaster housing strategy to ensure that when our government is called to provide transitional housing in the wake of a major disaster or catastrophe  the effort is effective and efficient          Almost six months after hurricane Katrina ravaged the Gulf Coast  housing remains among the most pressing challenges facing thousands of residents in the region   Significant problems remain with transitional housing  including FEMA s hotel motel program  which has imposed deadlines that are leaving many Katrina survivors struggling to find shelter   FEMA s manufactured housing program  which should be an alternative  has been hampered by confusion and inefficiency   In addition  the lack of a unified and coordinated federal disaster housing strategy is encumbering the delivery of federal housing assistance to storm victims and is sure to be an issue in future disasters  Our government s inability to help thousands of Americans who were forced from their homes find adequate housing is unacceptable         Hotel Motel Program       On November 18  2005  Senator Lieberman sent a letter to you urging that FEMA reconsider its decision to terminate the hotel motel program by early December due to his concern that FEMA had ended the program before seeking to ensure that evacuees had secured alternative housing and that as a result  participants might be left homeless   The letter urged you to develop a comprehensive housing counseling program to assist evacuees as they transition to long term housing   A court subsequently ordered FEMA to extend the deadline and to begin an outreach campaign to provide more useful information to participants about alternative housing options   FEMA then required individuals to register for an authorization code designed to enable the agency to provide that outreach and to better identify individuals utilizing the program   On February 13  the first of the new deadlines expired for individuals using the hotel motel program  and the remaining participants were required to leave on March 1   Yet  despite the efforts of FEMA and the evacuees  thousands of participants had not secured viable housing options  On Thursday  February 23  FEMA once again extended the hotel motel termination date to March 15          We are pleased that FEMA is showing flexibility with regard to the program participants  and we hope that the agency will continue to help these families find alternate housing   As you know  many participants are waiting for FEMA to provide the mobile homes and travel trailers that were promised  still others are looking for alternative housing but have had trouble obtaining FEMA rental assistance   An additional problem for some evacuees is the increase in market rates for rent and or a lack of available housing  Some evacuees have simply been unable to make the transition out of the program   We remain concerned that until these problems are addressed  they will continue to hinder the housing transition   We strongly encourage you to consider the individual circumstances of each of the families still utilizing the hotel motel program and to work to ensure that these families are able to secure rental assistance or identify alternative housing before the new March 15 deadline           FEMA Mobile Homes and Travel Trailers        We are dismayed that mobile homes and travel trailers are still not available for many who need them  particularly in Louisiana  The system for acquiring  deploying  and assigning trailers has been abysmal   In Louisiana  six months after Katrina hit  only 46 percent of the 90 000 requests for temporary housing units have been met   By comparison  in Mississippi  federal officials report that of about 40 000 such requests  35 442  88 percent  have been met   While FEMA contends that there are currently 48 357 occupied travel trailers and manufactured homes in Louisiana  nearly 42 000 more still need to be set up and made ready to house individuals   FEMA officials are installing about 500 units daily  at that rate it will take an additional 100 days before they reach their goal   This is simply unacceptable         As you know  the Department of Homeland Security s Inspector General recently testified that as part of its sheltering initiative  FEMA purchased  at a total cost of nearly  900 million  more than 25 000 manufactured and modular homes that are largely unusable for Katrina victims   By FEMA regulations  the homes cannot be installed in flood plains  in the areas where they are most needed  and some of the homes exceed the allowable size   According to the Inspector General  only 1 000 of the homes have been used for Katrina victims   We wonder what will happen to these homes  The Inspector General testified that many of them are improperly stored and some have been scavenged  Will these homes be re sold at a substantial loss when so many Katrina victims  needs go unmet                    It appears that many of the modular and manufactured homes should never have been purchased   FEMA officials acted without adequately considering the urgent needs of Katrina victims or the limitations of their own regulations   Poor advance planning led to a frenzy of unfocused buying in the weeks after the storm and the squandering of  900 million that could have been spent fulfilling real housing requirements   We ask that you explain how FEMA arrived at the decision to purchase the manufactured homes and whether you plan to utilize the homes to help meet the overwhelming need for transitional housing           FEMA Transitional Housing Assistance       As you know  under the Stafford Act  families displaced by disasters are eligible to receive rental assistance for up to 18 months so long as they have been unable to secure adequate housing on their own  Yet  FEMA has failed to provide clear guidance to families regarding their eligibility for ongoing rental assistance   This failure has created unnecessary anxiety and instability for families  as well as uncertainty among landlords about the prudence of renting available units to Katrina evacuees   In December  Congress directed FEMA to issue clear guidance regarding eligibility for housing assistance under the Individuals and Households Program and to include details for the extension of this assistance in such guidance   Your failure to issue this guidance is continuing to hamper the ability of families to make necessary housing decisions and to determine if they will return to their communities to rebuild   We urge you to quickly issue this guidance and to provide us with a copy of this guidance          National Disaster Housing Strategy       Finally  it is clear that the federal government is attempting to deal with this unprecedented housing crisis without a comprehensive strategy to address temporary or long term housing needs on the Gulf Coast   Pursuant to its responsibilities under the National Response Plan  NRP   FEMA must be more proactive in its efforts to coordinate agencies and work to develop a national disaster housing strategy with the Department of Housing and Urban Development  the Department of Health and Human Services  the Department of Agriculture  and other state  local  and non governmental agencies and organizations         The 2005 hurricane season showed us that advance plans must be created  implemented  reviewed  and exercised in order to carry out a successful recovery   Agreements on the mechanisms the federal government should use to house disaster victims  beyond simply purchasing manufactured housing  and where and how agencies will provide resources must be predetermined  and officials must be familiar with them well in advance of disaster events   Preparation and coordination are absolutely critical to a good response and recovery effort   With a new hurricane season just a few months away  we urge you to begin working now to develop a comprehensive and cohesive housing strategy for disasters that are sure to come          It is critical that the federal government remain committed to our promise to assist in rebuilding the lives of the Americans who survived perhaps the greatest natural disaster in our country s history   Nothing is more basic to that process than housing   In the wake of a catastrophe that devastated a major American city and 90 000 square miles along the Gulf Coast  we cannot realistically expect an immediate return to normalcy  However  the federal government has the means to provide safe transitional housing more quickly and more efficiently than has thus far been the case to citizens who have been displaced         We expect to hear soon how you intend to improve the transitional housing situation for Katrina survivors while developing a better disaster housing strategy for future disasters           Sincerely          Susan CollinsChairman              Joseph I  Lieberman                                                          Ranking Member
