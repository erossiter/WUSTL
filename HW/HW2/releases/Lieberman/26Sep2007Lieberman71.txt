Centers Washington Sustainability Forum  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  today challenged President Bush to drop his opposition to mandatory limits on U S  global warming pollution  and he called upon Chinese President Hu and Indian Prime Minister Singh to signal their nations willingness to follow the U S  lead  In the address  Lieberman said    With environmentally catastrophic consequences of inaction moving from possible to probable  Presidents Bush and Hu  and Prime Minister Singh  would  in a practical  rational world  sit down and negotiate an agreement that commits each of them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  with the United States going first  and India and China following within a reasonable period thereafter    Below is the full text of his speech  as prepared for delivery    Thank you all very much   I want to thank David  Kepler  Dow Chemical executive vice president  for that introduction and for his companys sponsorship of this event    I also want to thank Terry  Yosie  WEC President and CEO  for the invitation he extended to me on behalf of the World Environment Center to speak to all of you at this  the inaugural Washington Sustainability Forum   And  of course  let me thank the Government of Canada  its esteemed ambassador  the Honorable Michael Wilson  and its distinguished Environment Minister  the Honorable John Baird  for hosting todays forum   Tomorrow  President Bush will convene a Major Economies Meeting on Energy Security and Climate Change here in Washington   By doing so  the President will confirm something he said in May  when he announced his intention to host this weeks meeting  which is that by the end of 2008  the United States needs to set a long term goal for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and interim targets that get us there   This is one of the several steps by which the Bush Administration has been moving to a more proactive position on climate change  But  unfortunately  the Administration still rejects mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions   Until President Bush embraces a program that mandates specific cuts in U S  greenhouse gas emissions  the leadership role that he is reaching for by convening this important meeting will elude his grasp   The science of climate change is compelling  The situation is grave    Here  for instance  are some of the impacts that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds the United States will experience by mid century at the hand of unchecked global warming    Warming in western mountains is projected to cause decreased snowpack  more winter flooding  and reduced summer flows  exacerbating competition for over allocated water resources   Disturbances from pests  diseases  and fire are projected to have increasing impacts on forests  with an extended period of high fire risk and large increases in area burned   Coastal communities and habitats will be increasingly stressed by climate change impacts   So  floods  droughts  pests  fires  and hurricanes  all with increasing intensity by mid century  unless we achieve cumulative emissions reductions that simply will not be achieved unless we start cutting emissions now and mandate increasing cuts in the decades ahead   Are voluntary programs alone up to the task of averting these harms  No  of course theyre not  The IPCC stated the obvious this May  when it found that voluntary agreements between industry and governments are not achieving significant emissions reductions beyond business as usual   Kyoto was adopted in 1997 because the voluntary goals of greenhouse gas reductions set up by the Rio agreement in 1992 were simply not being met   Will cheerleading for new technologies solve the problem  No  it wont  There is no way that currently expensive technologies  such as carbon capture and storage for coal plants  will deploy quickly enough or widely enough unless we attach a meaningful price to emission of carbon dioxide  That alone will drive the kind of massive private investment needed to reduce emissions  and reduce cost   We need mandatory emissions cuts  and we need them now  And that is why if President Bush wants the world to take seriously his commitment to combating climate change  he must see his way to supporting mandatory measures  If he does not  I predict the next American President  regardless of party  will  Congress  for its part  can and must act before 2009   Senator John Warner and I have decided to work together  as ranking member and chair of the Senates climate change subcommittee  to push mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reduction measures through a real and serious legislative process on Capitol Hill   And I believe we can succeed in this Congress   In August  Sen  Warner and I released a proposed framework for a bill to achieve robust  long term reductions in greenhouse gas emissions from 80 percent of the U S  economy  specifically  year by year reductions reaching 70 percent below current levels by 2050  using the emissions trading formula that worked well in reducing smog  and acid rain forming emissions from U S  power plants   In October  we will introduce that bill and bring it to a vote in our subcommittee   Senator Barbara Boxer  the Chairman of the full environment committee  has said that if our bill clears our subcommittee  which I am confident it will  she will use it as the basis for climate legislation that she will bring to a vote in the full committee shortly thereafter    If the bill clears the full committee  which I also believe it will  then we will have a debate on mandatory climate legislation in the full U S  Senate before the end of this year or early next year  It would be the first time for such a bill to arrive on the floor with the support of the Environment Committee   Senator Warner and I hope our bill  and the Congressional debates it will bring about  will signal to the world that policy leaders in the U S  are ready to get into the fight against global warming  and that a U S  bill to curb global warming will be enacted soon    I believe there is a substantial and increasing likelihood that both the Senate and the House will  by the end of next year  pass legislation mandating cuts in U S  greenhouse gas emissions  Two things in particular make me optimistic    First  the center of gravity in U S  industry has shifted to wanting that to happen  They want uniform rules of the road to be set by the federal government  especially since they see that many state governments have moved very far along toward finalizing distinct  mandatory systems    They want the rules of the road to be set by a Congress with the current political makeup  And they want the rules of the road to be set by an administration that is viewed as a friend of fossil fuel industries   As a sign of this shift  several of the large  carbon heavy businesses that have remained aloof for years are now coming into my office to engage on specifics   The other thing that makes me optimistic is my count of the votes in the Senate  I wont share my vote count with you  Its a trade secret  But I find that I now dont need to make all that many optimistic assumptions in order to add up more than sixty votes in the Senate for strong  balanced  comprehensive climate legislation   Whether my optimism about this Congress is justified  I feel certain that enactment of a strong U S  climate law in the next Congress  that is  before the end of 2010  will happen  And that will be with a couple of years to spare before the second commitment period begins under the Kyoto Protocol   I hope the prospects of this Congress adopting national climate change legislation  and the certainly that the next Congress will  can fortify the resolve of international negotiators to pursue constructive  multilateral discussions when the Framework Convention parties next meet at the Bali conference in December to plan for the post 2012 period   But  for there to be the progress the world urgently needs  it will take more than President Bush and America to do something real to cut greenhouse gas emission  It will take President Hu and China  and Prime Minister Singh and India   If those other two great countries commit to following the U S  with commensurate action within a reasonable period of time  it would be an enormous help to those of us trying to enact real caps on U S  emissions   I visited Beijing and New Delhi last month  I saw the environmental and political pressure on both governments to clean up the air and deal with global warming    I saw the serious efforts that are beginning in both countries to do something about global warming and to increase energy efficiency   In fact  though our three economies are  of course  at different stages of development  and though the United States and Europe have  of course  done more over the last two centuries to create todays global warming crisis  the salient environmental fact is that China alone is about to become the worlds largest emitter of greenhouse gas emissions  and India will not be far behind   And the salient political fact is that the political circumstances regarding climate change in these three largest countries in the world are surprisingly similar  In each country  there is a growing public restiveness about the environmental crisis of climate change  and growing calls for the nations leaders to do something about it   In each of the three countries there are leaders  President Bush  President Hu and Prime Minister Singh  who recognize the reality of the crisis  but are reluctant to support mandatory limits on greenhouse gas emissions because of their fear of what it will do to their nations economies   All three leaders worry about the rising costs on their people and businesses from mandatory limits on greenhouse gas production  President Bush and many in Congress worry that if we act first  and the Chinese and Indians do not follow quickly  we will lose more jobs and businesses to them   With environmentally catastrophic consequences of inaction moving from possible to probable  Presidents Bush and Hu  and Prime Minister Singh  would  in a practical  rational world  sit down and negotiate an agreement that commits each of them to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  with the United States going first  and India and China following within a reasonable period thereafter   With each countys own national policies to achieve emissions reductions set in place  American  Indian and Chinese businesses and technology companies would face powerful incentives to begin to work together to meet their ultimately parallel obligations    In fact  businesses success in following the path blazed by those incentives would be ensured if  as a companion to their emissions policies  the three countries established an international investment fund  to develop innovative solutions and technologies    In the wake of the past decades gridlock here in Washington and in the international arena  the prospect of commitment and cooperation between and among our three countries that I can envision may sound fantastic    But  with the growing scientific consensus and political momentum on climate making action inevitable  this approach is actually pragmatic   Let me be clear  The United States has a unique and independent obligation to mandate robust emissions cuts domestically now  without waiting for China and India  We must be the leader    But tripartite negotiation and agreement is so much in the interest of the people of China  India and the United States  not to mention the people of the world  and the legacy of the leadership of Presidents Bush and Hu and Prime Minister Singh  that I dont understand why they have not already begun to negotiate   Nevertheless  we in the U S  Congress have begun to act   In the end  I rest my optimism on the simple fact that Americans are a caring  courageous  enterprising people  We will not bequeath a world diminished by global warming to the children and grandchildren of those alive today    Thank you     30
