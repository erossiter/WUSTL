blasted the Bush Administration   s budget proposal for shortchanging critical programs that provide aid and support to millions of Americans  and he called for significant funding increases for these initiatives        Among the programs either under funded or completely cut by the Bush Administration were Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   Department of Housing and Urban Development  HUD      Hope VI Program  Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  Program  Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS  Program  and the Community Services Block Grant  CSBG          Across the board  the President   s budget has cut funding or under funded critical federal programs to help hard working Americans and our nation   s neediest citizens     said Lieberman      These are the wrong priorities   Shortchanging vital investments in energy assistance  crime prevention and community development means that families in Connecticut will have to scrape by to own homes and pay their energy bills and fear for their safety in their own neighborhoods         In a letter to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  Senators Judd Gregg  R NH  and Kent Conrad  D ND   Lieberman expressed concern over the Bush Administration   s budget cuts in several important areas  including        LIHEAP   The importance and effectiveness of LIHEAP is incontrovertible   LIHEAP assists low income  vulnerable households with children and disabled and elderly individuals who are at risk for health problems due to insufficient home heating or cooling   The home energy burden for low income households is over four times that of non low income households   LIHEAP serves the same low income population that also relies on assistance with heating costs through the Weatherization Assistance Program  for which a 32  cut is proposed   Ongoing debates over LIHEAP funding highlight the unmet winter heating needs of the most impoverished   A survey of LIHEAP recipients found that 44  had been forced to skip energy payments  or pay less than the entire home energy bill over the last year  30  reported that they had received notice or threat to disconnect their electricity or home heating fuel  and 8  reported that their electricity or home heating had actually been disconnected   The Administration should be calling for LIHEAP to be funded at  5 1 billion  the full amount authorized by the Energy Policy Act        Hope VI Program   The HUD HOPE VI program is once again proposed for elimination in the federal budget and OMB rated the program as    Ineffective      The Administration has been successful in cutting the funding level for the program from  149 million in FY2004 to only  99 million in FY2006  so the program is effectively decimated already  this year  the Administration proposes the coup de grace   It not only proposes no new funding for FY2007  but would rescind the funding for FY2006   Part of the reason  the Administration claims  for eliminating the program is that it has accomplished its mission of    demolishing 100 000 units of public housing      On the contrary  the need to address public housing improvement in Connecticut and around the nation continues apace   Recent estimates are that there is a backlog of about  20 billion in public housing improvement needs around the country   Not only is this program effective  it is badly needed and should be continued        CDBG Program   The Administration has this year continued its effort to reconfigure the CDBG program   Last year  the Administration proposed to remove the program from HUD  shift it to the Department of Commerce  merge it into a block grant with several other programs  and substantially cut the funding for all of them   Fortunately  Congress did not adopt the proposal   Unfortunately  the Administration was successful in attaining a substantial cut in the program of almost  500 million  to  4 1 billion  This year  the Administration has given up on its idea to transfer the program to Commerce  but it again seeks a substantial budget cut of more than 25   it asked for a funding level of only  3 0 billion for CDBG   CDBG has been one of the most successful and flexible programs of assistance to local governments the federal government has ever produced   It is continually cited by mayors and local officials in Connecticut and across the country as the model for how a federal program should work  it provides them resources with which they can make local decisions about how to improve communities   That was the original purpose of the program and should not be abandoned in favor of excessive federal oversight and control        COPS Program   The COPS program is a very effective program administered by the Department of Justice that provides grants to local law enforcement agencies to promote community policing and acquire technologies that help local law enforcement agencies become more efficient   One of the great advantages of the COPS program is that it gives local first responders flexibility to use the money to meet their specific needs   OMB concluded that the COPS program is not performing   I disagree with OMB s assessment   GAO issued a report in June 2005 showing evidence that the level of COPS program funding is correlated with reduced crime rates   Moreover  I have seen the benefits of the COPS program throughout Connecticut   I propose restoring the cuts to COPS program in order to bring it back to its FY2006 funding level of  478 million          Census Bureau   s Survey of Income and Program Participation  SIPP    The Budget request calls for the elimination of the Survey of Income and Program Participation  SIPP   an important source of Census Bureau data about poverty  income  and program participation  The Census Bureau has indicated that it wants to improve the survey that is used to collect data in these vital areas  and the Budget for FY2007 provides funds for the development of the new survey  but does not provide funds for conducting the SIPP itself   The SIPP provides information about low income families across the nation  The SIPP provides essential information on the effectiveness of programs such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families  TANF   Medicaid  Social Security  and unemployment insurance   Many experts have long believed that the SIPP is the nation   s best source of data about poverty and income  For example  the National Academy of Sciences stated in 1995     SIPP should become the nation   s primary source of income statistics      Other national surveys  can never be designed to provide the same extent of detail or achieve the same quality of reporting as in SIPP      The Panel on Poverty and Family Assistance of the National Research Council  National Academy of Sciences     Measuring Poverty  A New Approach     page 11  1995    The SIPP also tracks health insurance coverage  and provides more in depth information than any other government survey on work family issues  such as maternity leave   It is essential that SIPP be funded at its FY2006 appropriated level of  33 9 million           Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC      State and Local Preparedness Grants   The CDC state and local preparedness grants are authorized to provide funds to states to support preparedness planning  including deployment of the Strategic National Stockpile  surveillance and epidemiology of diseases  laboratory capacity for biological and chemical agents  establishing information technology capacities  communicating health threats with the public and others  and education and workforce training  Across all 50 states  funding has decreased from  919 million in 2005 to  824 million in 2006  This year  the Administration is proposing a slight cut again to  822 million   CDC state and local preparedness grants are one of the few mechanisms available to states to plan for any hazard     whether it be a biological or chemical terrorist attack  hurricane  or pandemic flu   The Trust for America   s Health  TFAH  released an issue report on public health preparedness across the nation   Their panel of experts recommended that the CDC grants program be funded at a minimum level of  950 million for public health and bioterrorism preparedness to states   Funding should not be cut for the CDC state and local preparedness grant program        CSBG  The CSBG is a federal block grant that delivers and coordinates programs and services to low income Americans aimed at fighting poverty   It funds more than 1 100 agencies that are currently operating in 96  of counties in the country  In 2005   637 million was provided to the CSBG and  630 million in 2005   However  for fiscal year 2007  no funds have been requested for the program   The Department of Health and Human Services has reported that CSBG funds have resulted in over 2 million service opportunities  including the provision of public and private transportation  access to medical care and child care  establishment of community centers  funding of youth development programs  increased business opportunities for low income Americans  and access to quality food shopping in low income neighborhoods with limited access to quality foods   More than 100 000 low income families have received improved housing based on CBSG funds and more than 50 000 Americans have had higher income earnings as a result of the grants  CSBG has also resulted in more than 100 000 Americans completing high school  higher education  or job retraining   Lastly  CSBG has resulted in greater private and public investments in fighting poverty  with estimates indicating that  1 486 was leveraged for every  1 in CSBG funds  That amounts to a  9 6 billion investment in American communities   Congress should maintain funding for the CSBG grants and not terminate a program and destroy an infrastructure that has benefited millions of low income Americans  who are already disproportionately negatively affected by the Administration   s budget proposal        Enhancing Education Through Technology  EETT    The President   s FY2007 Budget proposes eliminating funding for the EETT program  which seeks to ensure that by the time students complete eighth grade  they are technologically literate  The program also awards grants to states and local school districts for teacher training and curriculum development  as well as other related activities  Grants are provided to state educational agencies on the basis of their proportional share of funding under Part A of Title I  states may retain up to 5 percent of their allocations for state level activities  and must distribute one half of the remainder by formula to eligible local educational agencies and the other half competitively to eligible local entities          A copy of the entire letter is available at    30
