today announced his decision to vote in favor of the nomination of US Court of Appeals Judge John G  Roberts Jr  to fill the vacancy on the United States Supreme Court Chief Justice William H  Rehnquist   Below is the text of his statement on the Senate floor  as delivered          Statement of Senator Joe Lieberman on the Supreme Court nomination of Judge John G  Roberts      September 27  2005       Remarks As Delivered        Mr  President  during my 17 years as a member of the United States Senate I have had the opportunity on four previous occasions to consider nominees to the Supreme Court  two from President George H  W  Bush and two from President Bill Clinton   On three of those occasions     Justices Souter  Ginsberg  and Breyer     I carried out my Constitutional responsibility by giving not only advice but consent   On the fourth  Justice Thomas  I withheld my consent        I must say on each of the preceding four occasions  I was struck by the wisdom of the founders and framers of our constitutional system  and by the perplexing position they put the Senate in when we consider a nominee for the United States Supreme Court   As we know  our founders had declared their independence and formed their new government to    secure    the inalienable rights and freedoms which they believed are the endowment of our Creator to every person   But from their knowledge of history and humanity and from their own experiences with the British Monarch  they saw that governments had a historic tendency to stifle  not secure  the rights of their citizens   So in constructing their new government they allocated power and then limited it time and time again   Theirs was to be a government of checks and balances  except for one institution which is  generally speaking  unchecked and unlimited although it has only legal authority  and that is the Supreme Court   I understand that Congress can re enact a statute that has been struck down by the Court as inconsistent with the Constitution  but I also know that the Court can then nullify the new statute   I understand  too  that the people may amend the Constitution to overturn a Supreme Court decision with which they disagree  but that is difficult and cumbersome  and therefore rare in American history   So the Supreme Court almost always has the last word in our government   It can be and has been a momentous last word with great consequences for our national and personal lives        Why then  in constituting the Supreme Court  did our nation   s founders and early justices veer from their system of limited government  of checks and balances   Well  I believe one reason is that they were wise enough to know that to be orderly  to function  a system must have a final credible point where disputation and uncertainty end and from which the work of society and government proceeds   But there was a larger reason  I   m concerned  consistent with their highest value  and that was their understanding  again from our knowledge of humanity  that freedom can just as easily be taken by a mob of citizens as it can by a tyrannical leader   And so they created a Supreme Court that was to be insulated from the political passions of the moment  and that would base its decisions not on transitory public opinion but on the eternal values of our founding documents     the Declaration  the Constitution  the Bill of Rights    and the rule of law        And they did this  these founders and framers  not just by giving the Court such enormous power  but also by giving its individual members life tenure   The President nominates Justices   The Senate advises and decides whether to consent   And then the Justice who is confirmed serves for as long as he or she lives or chooses to serve  absent of the unusual possibility of impeachment  safely beyond the reach  except that provided by his or her own conscience  intellect  sense of right and wrong  understanding of what the Constitution and law demand  and the capacity of the litigants that appear in the Court and the Justice   s own colleagues to convince him or her          Now this gets to why I have described the Senate   s own responsibility to act on nominations to the United States Supreme Court as perplexing   It is our one and only chance to evaluate and influence the nominees  and then they are untouchable and politically unaccountable   But the Senate is a political body   We are elected by and accountable to the people     so naturally during the confirmation process we try to extract from the nominees to this Court     on this last chance that we have commitments   political commitments that they will uphold the decisions of the Court with which we agree and overrule the ones with which we disagree   And they naturally try to avoid making such commitments          We are both right   Because the United States Supreme Court has such power over our lives and liberties  we Senators are right to ask such questions   But  because the Court is intended to be the non political branch of our government  the branch before which litigants must come with confidence that the Justices    minds are open  not closed by rigid ideology or political declaration  the nominees to the Court are ultimately right to resist answering such questions in great detail   I understand that I am describing an ideal which has not always been reached by individual Justices on the court  but on the other hand  the history of the Supreme Court is full of examples of Justices who have issued surprisingly different opinions than expected  or even than expressed before they join the Court  and also of Justices who have changed their opinions over the years of their service on the Court   That is the right and  I would add  the responsibility the Constitution gives to Justices of our Supreme Court          Now  Mr  President  our pending decision on President Bush   s nomination of John Roberts to the Supreme Court is made more difficult because it comes at an excessively partisan time in our political history   And that makes it even more important that we stretch to decide it correctly without partisan calculations  whichever side we come down on   Mr  Roberts  after all  has been nominated to be Chief Justice of the highest court of the greatest country in the world   And  our decision whether or not to confirm him should  in the end  be a decision made above partisanship        Today  in these partisan times  it is worth remembering that seven of the nine sitting Justices were confirmed by overwhelmingly bipartisan votes here in the Senate    Justices O   Connor by 99  Stevens and Scalia by 98  Kennedy by 97  Ginsberg by 96  Souter by 90  and Breyer by 89   It is hard to imagine a nominee receiving so much bipartisan support today   So it wasn   t always as it is now and as it is now is wrong and regrettable          One reason for this sad turn is that our recent presidential campaigns have unfortunately made the Supreme Court into a partisan political issue with candidates in each party promising to nominate only Justices who would uphold or overrule particular prevailing Supreme Court decisions   I know that is surely not the first time that has happened in our history but it nonetheless undercuts the credibility and independence of the Court and  I might add  complicates this confirmation process   Because President Bush promised in his campaign that he would nominate Supreme Court Justices in the mold of Justices Scalia and Thomas  an extra burden of proof has been placed on Judge Roberts to prove his openness of mind and independence of judgment          That is one reason why  earlier this year  I was proud to be one of the Group of 14 Senators   I view the agreement of the Group of 14 as an important step away from the partisan politicizing of the Supreme Court   By opposing the so called nuclear option we were saying  seven Republicans and seven Democrats  that a nominee for lifetime appointment to the Supreme Court must be close enough to the bipartisan mainstream of judicial thinking to obtain the support of at least 60 of the 100 members of the U S  Senate   That is just not asking very much for this high office        When I was asked to describe the kind of Justice that would pass that test I said one who would not come to the Supreme Court with a prefixed ideological agenda but would approach each case with an open mind  committed to applying the Constitution and the rule of law to reach the most just result possible in the particular case   I remember also saying that the agreement of the Group of 14 could be read as a bipartisan appeal to President Bush  which might be phrased in these words      Mr  President  you won the 2004 election and with it came the right to fill vacancies on the Supreme Court   We assume you will nominate a conservative but we appeal to you not to send us an extreme conservative who will confront the Court and the country with a disruptive  divisive predetermined ideological agenda   Send us an able  honorable nominee Mr  President  who will take each case as it comes  listen fully to all sides and try to do the right thing           Based on the hours of testimony Judge Roberts gave to the Judiciary Committee under oath  a lengthy meeting I had with him  a review of his extraordinary legal and judicial ability and experience  and the comments of people who have known or worked with Judge Roberts at different times in his life and volunteered to me his integrity and decency  I conclude that John Roberts meets and passes the test   I will therefore consent to his nomination        In his opening statement to the Judiciary Committee on September 13 Judge Roberts said           I have no platform   Judges are not politicians who can promise to do certain things in exchange for votes      If I am confirmed  I will confront every case with an open mind   I will fully and fairly analyze the legal arguments that are presented   I will be open to the considered views of my colleagues on the bench   And I will decide every case based on the record  according to the rule of law  without fear or favor  to the best of my ability           I could not have asked for a more reassuring statement        During the hearings  some of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee challenged Judge Roberts to reconcile that excellent pledge with memos or briefs he wrote during the 1980s and early 1990s  or opinions he wrote on the Circuit Court in more recent years   They were right to do so  I thought his answers brought reassurance  if not total peace of mind   But then again  I have no Constitutional right to peace of mind as a Senator advising and consenting on a Justice of the Supreme Court       From his statements going back more than 20 years  I was troubled by  and in some cases strongly disagreed with  opinions or work that he had been involved in  on fundamental questions of racial and gender equality  the right of privacy  and the commerce clause   But in each of these areas of jurisprudence his testimony under oath was reassuring          On questions of civil rights  before the Judiciary Committee Judge Roberts expressed his respect for the Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act as precedents of the Court and agreed that they were    not constitutionally suspect      He added that he    certainly agreed that the Voting Rights Act should be extended      When asked by Senator Kennedy whether he agreed with Justice O   Connor   s statement in upholding an affirmative action program that it was important to give    great weight to the real world impact of affirmative action policies in universities      Judge Roberts answered     You do need to look at the real world impact in this area and     in other areas as well      He also told Senator Durbin that he believed the Reagan Administration had taken the    incorrect position    on Bob Jones University        I   ve said and I say again  I found those answers to be reassuring        With regard to the right of privacy Judge Roberts gave this strong statement     The right of privacy is protected under the Constitution in various ways             He said     It   s protected by the Fourth Amendment which provides that the right of people to be secure in their persons  houses  effects  and papers              It   s protected under the First Amendment dealing with prohibition on establishment of a religion and guaranteeing of free exercise           It protects privacy in matters of conscience            These are all quotes of Judge Roberts   He continued     It was protected by the framers in areas that were of particular concern to them     The Third Amendment protecting their homes against the quartering of troops           And in addition  the Court     has recognized that personal privacy is a component of the liberty protected by the due process clause           The Court has explained that the liberty protected is not limited to freedom from physical restraint and that it   s protected not simply procedurally  but as a substantive matter as well           And those decisions     he concluded     have sketched out  over a period of years  certain aspects of privacy that are protected as part of the liberty in the due process clause of the Constitution            I thought that was a learned embrace of the Constitutional right of privacy  particularly when combined with Judge Roberts    consistent support of the principle of stare decisis  respect for the past decisions and precedents of the Court in the interest of stability in the judicial system and society        Regarding Roe v  Wade  Judge Roberts specifically said     That is a precedent entitled to respect under the principles of stare decisis like any other precedent of the Court      When asked by Senator Feinstein to explain further when  under stare decisis  a Court precedent should be revisited  Judge Roberts answered           Well  I do think you do have to look at those criteria   And the ones that I pull from those various cases are  first of all  the basic principle that it   s not enough that you think that the decision was wrongly decided   That   s not enough to justify revisiting it   Otherwise  there   d be no role for precedent  and no role for stare decisis   Second of all  one basis for reconsidering is the issue of workability    and  the issue of settled expectations  the Court has explained  you look at the extent to which people have conformed their conduct to the rule and have developed settled expectations in connection with it           And  again  specifically with regard to Roe  I found those answers reassuring          One of Judge Roberts    Circuit Court opinions on the Commerce Clause gave rise to fears that he would constrict Congress   s authority to legislate under that great Clause   But in his consistent expressions of deference to the work of Congress  and in his several references to the Supreme Court   s recent decision in Gonzales v  Raich  Judge Roberts was once more reassuring          So Mr  President  I will vote to confirm John Roberts and send him off to the non political world of the Supreme Court with high hopes  encouraged by the words of promise he spoke to the Judiciary Committee at the end of his opening statement to that committee           If I am confirmed  I will be vigilant to protect the independence and integrity of the Supreme Court  and I will work to ensure that it upholds the rule of law and safeguards those liberties that make this land one of endless possibilities for all Americans           I thank the Chair and I yield the floor        Audio of this statement is available   30
