Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  Tuesday urged the Senate to approve the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006   He is an original co sponsor of the bill  The following statement was prepared for delivery on the Senate floor                     I am proud to be an original cosponsor of the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006  its predecessor  the GreenLane Maritime Cargo Security Act  and a partner with Senators Collins  Murray and Coleman  in bringing a comprehensive  bipartisan port security bill before the Senate                   I would also like to thank Senators Stevens and Inouye of the Senate Commerce Committee  and Senators Grassley and Baucus of the Finance Committee  for their hard work  leadership and commitment to passing a port security bill this Congress                   Ninety five percent of our international trade flows through our ports  Prior to 9 11  the main goal was to move these millions of tons through our ports efficiently  Since 9 11  we   ve realized we need to bring security into that equation  but without inflicting on ourselves the precise economic harm terrorists have in mind                   It   s a tricky     but imperative     balancing act                   The 9 11 Commission report said that    major vulnerabilities still exist in cargo  security     and that  since aviation security has been significantly improved since 9 11     terrorists may turn their attention to other modes   Opportunities to do harm are as great  or greater  in maritime and surface transportation                      Just last month  RAND   s Center for Terrorism Risk Management Policy published a report titled     Considering the Effects of a Catastrophic Terrorist Attack    that considered the effects of a nuclear weapon smuggled in a shipping container sent to the Port of Long Beach and detonated on a pier                     The potential short and long term effects truly are devastating  The report estimated that up to 60 000 people might die instantly from the blast or radiation poisoning  with 150 000 more exposed to hazardous levels of radiation                   The blast and the fires could completely destroy both the Port of Long Beach and the Port of Los Angeles and every ship in the port  As many as 6 million people might have to be evacuated from the Los Angeles area and another two to three million from the surrounding area might have to relocate due to the fallout                   Gasoline supplies would quickly dry up  as one third of all the gas used on the West Coast is processed at the Port of Long Beach   s refineries                     Short term costs  for medical care  insurance claims  workers    compensation  evacuation and reconstruction  could exceed  1 trillion  By comparison  9 11 cost between  50 and  100 billion                     Besides the damage to the United States  the attack would cause economic effects that would ripple across the globe                   The dangerous little secret of port security     and why we need this bill     is that we still have very little idea about the contents of thousands of containers that are shipped into and across the heart of this nation every day                    Just 5 or 6 percent of those containers are physically inspected         While Senator Collins and I began working on port security legislation in late 2004  the truth is port security legislation did not really begin to develop any traction in Congress until the Dubai Ports World controversy earlier this year                    Looking back on it  perhaps we can at least be thankful that the Dubai Ports World incident raised the collective consciousness of the American people and Members of Congress to the vulnerabilities that we face at our ports                     Following that incident  the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee marked up the GreenLane bill  and later  Senator Collins and I started working with the Senate Commerce and Finance Committees to craft comprehensive port security legislation that stands before the Senate today                   The Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 builds on these foundations for homeland security by strengthening key port security programs by providing both direction and much needed resources  I would like to focus my colleagues    attention on a few critically important parts of the bill                     First  the bill moves us closer towards the goal of inspecting all of the containers entering the United States through our ports  The legislation requires DHS to establish a pilot program to inspect 100 percent of all containers bound for the U S  from three foreign ports within one year and then report to Congress on how DHS can expand that system                   There is legitimate concern that inspecting 100 percent of containers would be so burdensome that it would bring commerce to a halt   However  technology companies have been working for several years to build more efficient inspection systems  The Port of Hong Kong is currently testing an integrated inspection system to scan every container entering the two largest terminals at that port  while the research and development offices of DHS have begun work on developing automated systems to analyze this data   We should move towards 100 percent inspection as fast as we can get there  understanding that we can not afford to bring commerce to a halt    and this legislation will provide us critical information about how soon we can achieve this goal                    Second  this bill authorizes comprehensive and robust port security grant  training and exercise programs  with a  400 million grant program available to all ports  Third  this legislation requires DHS to deploy both radiation detection and imaging equipment  to improve our ability to find dangerous goods and people being smuggled into the United States                      DHS has committed to deploying radiation portal monitors at all of our largest seaports by the end of 2007   Unfortunately  this    solution    is  in fact  only half of the equation   To provide real port security  radiation detection equipment capable of detecting unshielded radiological materials  as these portal monitors do  must be paired with imaging equipment capable of detecting dense objects  like shielding                     This legislation requires DHS develop a strategy for deploying both types of equipment  and the pilot program for screening 100 percent of containers at three ports similarly requires that both types of equipment be used                   Fourth  this bill requires DHS to develop a strategic port and cargo security plan  and it creates an Office of Cargo Security Policy in DHS to ensure federal  state and local governments and the private sector coordinate their policies                   Currently  the Coast Guard is responsible for the waterside security of our ports  U S  Customs and Border Protection regulates the flow of commerce through our ports   The Transportation Security Administration is responsible for overseeing the movement of cargo domestically  And the Domestic Nuclear Detection Office has been working with the Defense Department and the Department of Energy to strengthen our ability to detect radiological materials anywhere in the country                     It is imperative that these agencies  offices and departments are working closely with each other  as well as state and local government and the private sector to develop and coordinate port security policies and programs                   Lastly  since most experts agree that another terrorist attack is more a matter of when than if  this bill requires DHS to develop a plan to deal with the effects of a maritime security incident  including developing protocols for resuming trade and identifying specific responsibilities for different agencies                   This is critically important to ensuring the private sector and our global partners have enough confidence in our system  so that we can mitigate any economic disruption and foil a terrorist   s plan to hurt our economy                   Moving the Port Security Improvement Act of 2006 forward will take us one giant step closer to where we ought to be by building a robust port security regime  domestically and abroad  and provide the resources necessary to protect the American people                      I look forward to continuing to work with Senators Collins  Stevens  Inouye  Grassley and Baucus  and our colleagues in the House  to finalizing meaningful port security legislation   Thank you       30
