Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   delivered the following statement on the Senate floor Monday during the beginning of debate on lobbying reform          Mr  President  I rise to express my strong support for the bipartisan Lobbying Transparency and Accountability Act which was reported out of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee last Thursday and which forms a significant part of the combined Homeland Security    Rules Committee bill we are starting to consider today           With these two bills before us  we now have the opportunity to vote on the most significant lobbying and ethics reform in at least a decade   I believe we in Congress can go a long way toward restoring our tattered reputation with the American public by moving swiftly to enact these proposals into law            By ensuring full transparency for the legislative process and those who work within it  this legislation will directly answer many of the questions that have been raised about the relationships between Members of Congress and lobbyists  about the role of money in public debate and deliberations  and about whether results here in Washington go to the highest bidder or to the greatest public good  This bill draws back the curtain to let the sun shine directly and brightly on the lobbyist lawmaker relationship for all to see  clearly and easily           I want to thank my good friends  colleagues  and partners Senators McCain and Collins   Senator McCain  along with his Indian Affairs Committee Ranking Member Byron Dorgan  conducted a hard hitting investigation into the activities of disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff  helping to expose his criminal activities  in particular his odious exploitation of Indian tribes  On the basis of that investigation  Senator McCain introduced the Lobbyist Transparency and Accountability Act  which I proudly co sponsored  Chairman Collins took up the banner and  based on Senator McCain   s bill  we drafted legislation and quickly brought it before the Committee for mark up   The bill we debate today is the product of those efforts           Senate Minority Leader Reid and Senator Obama have played critical leadership roles in pushing reform forward by introducing very strong legislation     the Honest Leadership Act   which earned the support of 41 Members of the Senate and really helped lay the groundwork for us today  The backing of virtually the entire Democratic caucus helped move this significant legislation to the floor  and the legislation we are taking up today contains most of the proposals laid out in the Honest Leadership Act   I will also be supporting amendments to restore other provisions from the Honest Leadership Act that were left out of the legislation before us today  And finally  thanks to Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin  who  history will note  was the first to introduce lobbying reform legislation   He did it last year   Senator Feingold is always a reliable ally when it comes to raising the public interest above the special interest          Mr  President  the abuses to which these bills respond  I must stress  are the exception to the rule   Almost always  lobbyists comply with the law and provide Congress with valuable knowledge and expertise   Whether they represent corporations  unions  or trade associations  non profits  or the public interest groups that have lobbied us to pass this legislation  lobbyists are instrumental to the work that goes on here on Capitol Hill   The Founding Fathers recognized the importance of such work when they enshrined in the very first amendment the right of all people    to petition the government for redress of grievances      We must always remember this when we legislate in this critically important and constitutionally elevated area  Lobbyists and the people they represent are exercising a constitutional right  and so we must be careful  as we have done in our bill  to respect that right   Nothing in our bill improperly intrudes on the people   s right to be represented here in Washington   But there is an equivalent right of the public to a functioning form of government that must also be respected             And that   s precisely what our bill does  by building on previous efforts in this area   The Supreme Court long ago made clear that the First Amendment   s guarantee of the right to petition the government did not confer a right to do so in secret   In the 1954 case of United States v  Harris  the Court upheld the constitutionality of lobbying disclosure requirements and said those requirements were consistent with the First Amendment  Let me read a passage from that decision  And I quote here       Present day legislative complexities are such that individual members of Congress cannot be expected to explore the myriad pressures to which they are regularly subjected  Yet the full realization of the American ideal of government by elected representatives depends to no small extent on their ability to properly evaluate such pressures   Otherwise  the voice of the people may all too easily be drowned out by the voice of the special interest groups seeking favored treatment while masquerading as proponents of the public weal   This is the evil which the Lobbying Act was designed to help prevent      End of quote          Mr  President  those words could not be truer today when most Americans  whether they realize it or not  are represented in some way by lobbyists in Washington  not just those of us who were elected to Congress   Whether they are teachers or steel workers  law enforcement officers or seniors  veterans or veterinarians  small business owners or big business executives     people from all walks of American life  million and millions of them  have paid representation in this city   Some of the strongest proponents of lobbying reform are registered lobbyists themselves  lobbying Congress to enact reforms like those we are discussing today for the honor of their profession and  I might say  for Congress          The number of lobbyists in Washington has exploded over the last decade   The Congressional Research Service reported that over 30 000 people were registered as lobbyists in 2004  and that is an 86 percent increase over the number of registered lobbyists in 2000  The industry receives and spends enormous sums of money   According to the Center for Public Integrity   3 billion was spent on lobbying activities in 2004  the last full year for which records are available  And that   s double the sum spent six years earlier  Add to these numbers the recent scandals  and the perception too many Americans have of business in Washington is one of cash exchanging hands under tables or campaign contributions made in exchange for back room favors   Public condemnation weighs upon Congress as an institution and lobbyists as a profession          So  we find ourselves in a place where the current lobbying disclosure requirements are self evidently inadequate  and ethics rules governing Member interactions with lobbyists need to be tightened  especially with respect to gifts from lobbyists  The Washington Post reported last December that more than 80 Members of Congress and their staff were listed as having appeared to have accepted entertainment from BellSouth lobbyists exceeding congressional gift limits   One can only wonder about the overall rate of failure to comply with the rules           Let   s take a look at our Committee   s proposal in detail  The first thing our legislation would do is bring the lawmaker lobbyist relationship into the age of the Internet   We mandate that lobbyist disclosure statements be made publicly available on a searchable Internet database  linked to the Federal Election Commission database of campaign contributions  We also require that these disclosures be made quarterly  instead of semi annually as is now the case   That will add significantly to the public   s ability to monitor lobbyist lawmaker interactions          When combined with the Rules Committee   s bill  we virtually see the elimination of gifts to Members from lobbyists  and ensure that those that remain are fully disclosed   The Rules Committee bill bans all gifts other than meals from lobbyists to Members of Congress and their staff and requires Members to disclose on their websites any meals they do consume through the hospitality of a lobbyist  We  in turn  provide the belt to the Rules Committee   s suspenders by ensuring that lobbyists must  for the first time  disclose all gifts over  20  remembering that the law prohibits any lobbyist from giving any Member of Congress gifts more than  100 in any year   These two bills together will ensure a very significant curtailment of gifts and clear knowledge for the public of those that are still given           The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee bill increases transparency in a number of other ways   Lobbyists will for the first time have to disclose when they play any role in arranging for Members of Congress and executive branch officials to travel   The lobbyist would have to disclose the purpose and itinerary of any trips  itemize expenses  and disclose all lobbyists and Members in the traveling party          We also require more disclosure about lobbyists    campaign activities  Contributions of  200 or more to candidates  leadership PACs or parties    as well as fundraising events hosted or sponsored by lobbyists     would have to be reported on an annual basis  These disclosures are now available on FEC databases  but they are not easy to find  Chairman Collins and I believe that this additional reporting requirement is a minimal burden well worth the additional public disclosure            To those who had concerns that the initial formulation of this provision unfairly forced employees to tell their employers whom they gave campaign contributions to  let me assure you that the Committee heard your concerns and responded   We no longer require lobbyists to disclose their contributions through their employers  but instead mandate direct disclosure from each lobbyist   We also make clear that the contributions that must be disclosed are the same ones already provided by campaigns to the FEC   In other words  we are not requiring additional information about an individual   s campaign contributions  We are just making it easier for the public to find it          Our proposal takes another step forward to require lobbyists to disclose payments for events that honor Members of Congress or executive branch officials  as well as payments to organizations  such as charities  that are founded or controlled by Members of Congress  Together  these provisions ensure that the public will have full knowledge of all money that is flowing from lobbyists to organizations run by or associated with Members of Congress   This critical and substantial reform will go far to provide the full transparency the people demand and deserve          We would also shed new light on the political background of lobbyists by requiring them to disclose all past Congressional or executive branch employment  instead of the current requirement to disclose only the last two years of employment           Our proposal would increase incentives to comply with the law by doubling the civil penalty for noncompliance under the Lobbying Disclosure Act from  50 000 to  100 000   Also  for the first time  we prohibit lobbyists by statute from providing gifts or travel that doesn   t comply with Congressional ethics rules   This is a critical reform  because  up until now  there has been nothing in the law to stop lobbyists from giving Members or staff gifts that skirt Congressional limits  as long as Members and staff were willing to accept them   With this reform  lobbyists would continue that kind of behavior at their own very serious public peril           Our proposal would also make greater demands on those among us who move back and forth between public service and lobbying   To avoid conflicts of interest  we would increase from one year to two the amount of time that must pass before a former Member of Congress or a former high level executive branch official must wait before lobbying his or her former colleagues   For Congressional staff  we expand the one year cooling off period to bar lobbying not just of the staffer   s former office but of the entire House of Congress in which the staffer worked   Again  if the revolving door spins more slowly  so too will abuses           Now  let me address what has become a controversial portion of our legislation   The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  on a strong and bipartisan vote  accepted in mark up an amendment offered by Senator Levin and myself in direct response to the Abramoff scandal that ignited the reform drive that brings us together today  Mr  Abramoff directed his clients to pay millions of dollars to grassroots lobbying firms controlled by himself and his associate Michael Scanlon     fees that were then  in large part  directed back to Mr  Abramoff in the form of kickbacks   I believe that if disclosure requirements had been in place  Mr  Abramoff and Mr  Scanlon would not have been able to pull off this scam          But the Abramoff Scanlon so called    astroturf    campaign was not an isolated event   In the past decade  orchestrated  paid for  so called grass roots campaigns have become a stable and integrated part of many big money lobbying campaigns   There is nothing wrong with this  The question is whether we should ask for minimal disclosure  Last year  it was hard to miss the ads paid for by lobbyists urging voters to contact their Members of Congress to vote either for or against Social Security private accounts   In the first two months of 2006 alone  candidates and public interest groups have spent over  92 million on television advertising   The confirmation of Justice Alito  asbestos litigation reform  implementation of the new Medicare rules  and proposals related to telecommunications regulation all generated massive media campaigns aimed at generating constituent calls to Members and drove up spending on issue advertisements          Our proposal on this matter would for the first time ever require the disclosure of money received and spent by professional  big money grassroots campaigners     that is grassroots efforts paid for by lobbyists to generate major media campaigns  mass mailings  and large phone banks with the intent of influencing Members of Congress or the executive branch           Let me say that again  because I want my colleagues to be clear about what this provision does and does not do   It does not ban or restrict grassroots lobbying of any kind in any way  That would be wrong  Grassroots lobbying is another important way for people to get involved and contact their members of Congress   It merely requires the disclosure of the amount of money spent on this type of lobbying when it is done by professional  and big money campaigns           The controversy over this provision is unreasonable because our bill will not impede any true grassroots lobbying in any way  In fact  Senator Levin and I have taken steps to ensure that our proposal applies only to the larger  professional efforts such as the one Mr  Abramoff devised  For example       If the grassroots lobbying  per quarter    in other words  less than  100 000 a effort spends under  25 000 year     it will not have to report at all  They   re exempt     Money spent on communications directed at an organization   s own members  employees  officers  or shareholders is also exempt from disclosure       501 c  3   expenses to the IRS would be organizations that already report grassroots allowed to report that same number under the Lobbying Disclosure Act  minimizing any alleged paperwork or accounting burden on these organizations       And while redundant   not required for voluntary efforts by the we make clear that reporting is general public to communicate their own views to federal officials or to encourage other members of the general public to do the same          Ten years ago Senator Levin unsuccessfully fought for a grassroots lobbying disclosure provision when Congress passed the Lobbying Disclosure Act   At the time  he said such campaigns spent about  700 million a year   That figure has likely grown past  1 billion today  and the public has no accurate picture of who is spending what to influence others to lobby us   Disclosure of paid grassroots lobbying is way past due          Let me stress in no uncertain terms  The reform we are debating here today does nothing to abridge the right of the people     of all people    to petition their government  Its purpose is simply to bring the grassroots lobbying community out of the shadows and expose its interactions with and for Members of Congress for everyone to see          We are not talking about disclosing the activities of a grassroots organization   We are talking about disclosing just two numbers  the amount of money received and the amount of money spent   Nothing more and nothing less than lobbyists are already required to do            During markup  some Senators asked whether 527 groups would be covered by this provision  Mr  President  527s are already required by law to disclose far greater amounts of information to either the Internal Revenue Service or the Federal Election Commission   527 groups are required  for instance  to disclose the names of anyone who contributes more than  200 a year   And they must state the purpose of any expenditure over  500   So let   s put to rest the notion that we have to do something about 527 groups here because we already require far more of them than we are asking of paid  professional grassroots lobbying efforts          Another question was raised in Committee about whether a broadcaster would be subject to the grassroots disclosure requirements for urging his or her audience on radio or television to take a particular position on an issue   Of course not   The bill requires disclosure only by paid lobbyists who acting on behalf of a client          Mr  President  I have described what I think are very powerful provisions in this legislation to increase disclosure  to increase the transparency of the lobbyist lawmaker relationship  and to slow down the revolving door between government service and K Street   I have heard some people say this legislation is not strong enough because the Committee struck from the bill a bicameral Office of Public Integrity that would have been the new  independent repository of disclosure statements with the power to investigate complaints and issue subpoenas            The enforcement provision that Senator Collins and I advocated for in Committee would have helped restore the confidence of the American people in the ability of Congress to ensure compliance with its own ethics rules   The ethics process in the House of Representatives  quite frankly  is dysfunctional  I do believe we have a strong Ethics Committee in the Senate  That   s not why we   re offering this proposal  We   re offering it to add staff and support to the Ethics Committee and to add an element of independence and greater transparency to it  Our proposal would have provided that by establishing an independent office within Congress to conduct the preliminary review of any alleged violation of the House or Senate rules            In addition to restoring the public trust in the ability of Congress to police itself  our proposal was designed to act as a watchdog over the Lobbying Disclosure Act   Now  lobbying disclosure forms are filed with the Secretary of the Senate   s office  which has fewer then 20 people to review filings  compared to the 400 employees of the Federal Election Commission  which many people believe is understaffed   It   s very hard for 20 people to oversee and supervise the filings of over 30 000 lobbyists            I assure you that I will be joining my colleagues in offering amendments to strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of our proposed reforms          I will also offer an amendment with Senator McCain to curb the excesses of privately funded travel   whether for governmental or campaign purposes   Currently  when a Member of Congress or a candidate for federal office uses a private plane instead of flying on a commercial flight  the ethics rules require a payment to the owner of the plane equivalent to a first class commercial ticket   Senator McCain and I and others believe that the current rule undervalues flights on non commercial jets and provides an end run on what corporations can give us as gifts  We believe it is time to update our rules to base payment on the fair market value of chartering a private plane              But even without these amendments  our Committee has passed a very strong bill  a bill with sharp teeth  that I believe will reduce the influence of money on the legislative process  prevent the kinds of grotesque abuses that Mr  Abramoff and Congressman Cunningham have pleaded guilty to  and restore the balance of power in favor of the American people  I am confident that increased transparency     the so called disinfecting rays of sunshine   will discourage many abuses that now occur  And when combined with the bill reported out of the Rules Committee  we will be writing into law a near total ban on gifts  Thus  to the extent that lobbyists do confer gifts or arrange for travel for Members of Congress  our constituents will be able to follow our activities on the Internet and will be kept well informed by our industrious and free press   It has been said that information is power  and information  and therefore power  is what we are providing the public with this legislation           These are dramatic and transformational steps that are included in both of these measures  I hope will give our constituents a renewed sense of faith in this institution   I urge my colleagues to support this legislation          30
