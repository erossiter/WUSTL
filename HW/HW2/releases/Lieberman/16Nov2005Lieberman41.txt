Dependence on Foreign Oil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Legislation would set new standards for fuel efficiency and emphasize the use of alternative fuels                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          WASHINGTON    Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  was joined today by Senators Sam Brownback  R KS   Evan Bayh  D IN   Norm Coleman  R MN   Ken Salazar  D CO   Lindsey Graham  R SC    Bill Nelson  D FL  and Jeff Sessions  R AL  in introducing bipartisan legislation which is aimed at breaking America   s dependence on foreign oil   The Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act would mandate 10 million barrels in oil savings in 25 years and would also require the mass production of cars that can burn any combination of gasoline and alternative fuels or  alternatively  cars powered by efficient hybrid engines   Lieberman first laid out his proposal last month in speeches at Georgetown and Yale Universities              Given the facts of the growing  global dependency on oil     and given the fact that we have only limited oil reserves here at home     and given the fact that other solutions to our dependency are so readily at hand     failure to act will make us a pitiful giant  like Gulliver in Lilliput  tied down and subject to the whim of smaller nations who have     Lieberman said           It s good common sense to reduce our dependence on foreign oil  and it s doable in the near term     Brownback said      This dependence limits our foreign policy and national security options  and there is broad public support for reducing oil consumption   We can create market incentives to use technologies available today to deal with a problem that will only get worse unless we take action            Achieving energy independence is one of the greatest challenges of our generation  one that will impact everything from our national security to our economy   Bayh said   It will take an effort on par with the race to put a man on the moon  but we must find a way to reduce our dependence on foreign oil so that America is prepared for the future  We can t afford to rely on countries like Saudi Arabia and Venezuela for our energy needs any longer             The Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act is a strong national vision for America   s future that moves us toward energy independence and increased national security     Coleman said      Energy dependence is the greatest threat to our economy  our security  and our freedom this nation faces  This bill takes bold and aggressive action toward independence by mandating the saving of 2 5 million barrels per day over the next ten years  and furthers the development of alternative forms of energy by creating a plan to grow fuel on the farm and efficiently use oil  We attack these long range goals with real world solutions  and I am proud of the leadership  commitment  and work of Senators Lieberman  Bayh  Brownback  and Graham as we work to achieve these objectives              Our Nation   s over dependence on foreign energy is a threat to our economic and national security     Salazar said      The burden of high fuel costs is crushing our farmers  commuters and everyone who struggles day by day to make ends meet   Energy independence for America can no longer be just a goal  it is a necessity   America deserves better and this bill will deliver              The best thing we can do for our national security and future economic viability is to create a comprehensive energy plan     Graham said      America must reduce its dependence on Mideast oil and fossil fuels in general   I hope this effort will be seen as a breakthrough toward achieving those goals              Reducing our dependence on foreign oil will make our country stronger and protect consumers against future fuel price spikes     Nelson said            With the price of gasoline for Americans doubling and the world price of oil tripling from  20 to  60 per barrel  America   s national security is at risk     Sessions said      This represents a tripling of America   s wealth transfer to foreign nations  many of which are hostile to U S  interests  This legislation is a bold step to deal with the energy crisis as a national security issue  Every single action that we can take to reduce consumption  increase domestic production and support new technologies is important  American innovation is the key to solving this problem           The bill will also                       Set targets for manufacturers to produce flexible fuel vehicles  FFV   alternative fueled vehicles  hybrids  plug in hybrids  fuel cell vehicles or other qualified vehicles that meet a performance standard of 175  of average fleet fuel economy     starting at 10  in 2012 and rising to 50  in 2016   After 2016 at least 10  of the 50  requirement must be met by hybrids  advanced diesels  plug in hybrids and other non FFV vehicles                       Require the Secretary of Energy to issue regulations for federal and state fleets covered by the Energy Policy Act of 1992 to reduce petroleum consumption by 30  from a 1999 baseline by FY2016   Require 30  of federal fleet requirement  22 5  25  of the total fleet requirement  to be met by advanced diesels  hybrids or plug in hybrids in 2016   Allow electric drive technology vehicles  hybrids  to qualify under the Federal Fleet requirements of EPAct                       Provide retooling tax credits for manufacturers and suppliers of advanced diesels and hybrids    Nearly identical to Levin Bayh amendment to the energy bill                      Create a tire efficiency program for tires used on light duty vehicles                      Create a fuel economy testing program and the implementation of efficiency standards for heavy duty vehicles  trucks  buses  etc        of the legislation           breakdown of the legislation           30
