CT  today joined his colleagues on the Senate Armed Services Committee in approving late today a  517 6 billion blueprint for the nation   s armed forces that expresses Congress    support for the necessary tools for our military fighting throughout the world   As ranking member of a key subcommittee  Lieberman played a leadership role in shaping the measure in a way that will make our soldiers safer and more effective and also strongly benefit Connecticut   s defense workers and economy           It is critical that our military invest more resources for training  weapons  and technology to meet the new demands placed on it by the War on Terror     Lieberman said    We need to keep investing in our defense programs that have worked well in the past   We must also make sure that we provide enough resources for research and development  which will insure that our servicemen and servicewomen are equipped with the best weapons possible   I am proud of the many Connecticut defense companies that meet both of these critical demands   Last year  we successfully fought efforts to close Submarine Base New London  because closing the base would have been a threat to our national security and would have put the most skilled defense workers in the world out of work   These Connecticut workers are responsible for promoting our national security and developing important innovations that will help protect the lives of our military personnel  and we will continue to fight to keep their jobs in Connecticut           The committee today approved the Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2007  which sets funding levels and overall strategic goals for defense personnel  facilities  and weapons systems   The defense authorization bill sets forth Congress    priorities in supporting our military today and in the future  and now awaits consideration by the full Senate later this spring   As the ranking member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Airland Forces  Lieberman advocated aggressively during committee debate to fund efforts to transform the military to keep pace with the security needs of the 21st century and to provide tools effective to our Army and Air Force today        The bill bolsters federal funding for military housing  training  and compensation as well as providing strong support for critical weapons systems produced by Connecticut companies   Particularly important this year are additions to submarine design programs and construction at U S  Submarine Base New London   It provides  75 million in additional funding for submarine design   65 million for improvements to the Virginia class submarine and  10 million to begin design for the replacement of the nation   s Ohio class ballistic missile submarine  This addition will help submarine designers at EB   The addition of  9 6 million for a small craft maintenance facility is an important step in upgrading the submarine base        The bill also contains the following provisions of importance to Connecticut   s defense economy        Groton  Electric Boat                      2 6 billion to procure one new VIRGINIA Class attack submarine
