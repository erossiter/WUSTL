                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Mr  President  I want to begin my remarks by thanking my friend from Alabama  Senator Sessions  and acknowledging his leadership on this very important humanitarian reform   I would also like to thank the Senate Appropriations Committee  who under the fine leadership of Senator Cochran and Senator Byrd  for bringing forward this emergency supplemental to include an important provision to reform the financial benefits for families of our fallen soldiers       I am grateful that the Emergency Supplemental  HR 1268  uses the HEROES Bill  S 77   which I joined with Senator Sessions to co sponsor and which we introduced in January  as the basis for the reforms found to enhance the death gratuity and the level of coverage provided by the Servicemen   s Group Life Insurance  SGLI  program       These reforms  based on our bill  do nothing less than honor the brave men and women wearing America   s uniform who have made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our liberty by giving them and their families what we owe them   Nothing can replace the loss of life   But a decent death benefit and adequate life insurance can provide our servicemembers and the loved ones a sense of security about their financial future       For too long  they have not gotten the peace of mind and respect they deserve   Senator Sessions and I have worked together for some time as members of the Armed Services Committee and until recently  he was chair and I was ranking Democrat on the Airland Subcommittee   We began looking at the question of what survivor benefits were in place for our men and women in uniform  as we were concerned that the benefits being provided to the families of those killed in battle lagged behind benefits provided for public service employees in high risk occupations  namely police and firefighters   When we began this review  the death gratuity paid to the families of servicemen and women who were killed was  6 000 and hadn   t been raised since 1991     an embarrassing sum    A small step forward was taken in 2004 when the death gratuity was raised to  12 000  but this is still woefully inadequate         Two studies  one by DoD and the other by GAO  documented that the survivor benefits provided to some public employees in high risk positions were greater than those provided to our soldiers killed in combat   That is self evidently unfair for those putting their lives on the line to protect our nation   Our legislation  the HEROES Act  which we worked on over two years with the Pentagon and others  resulted in a bill to correct that imbalance by adjusting military survivor benefits to more equitably reflect today   s world         I am gratified that our idea took hold   The goals we sought are represented in this Emergency Supplemental and the final form of what we and others were concerned about is taking shape         With these changes  we will reform benefits by increasing the death gratuity from its present level of  12 000 to  100 000  thereby helping families who have lost a loved one get back on their feet in the short term   We will also increase the Servicemen   s Group Life Insurance  or SGLI as it is called  from  250 000 to  400 000 with the premium for the first  150 000 for troops serving in a combat zone covered by the U S  government   This is term insurance  so it is not a typical death benefit  but it will help families address their long term financial needs   In order to recognize those that have fought so bravely these past few years defending our freedoms  these benefits are being made retroactively to cover those lost since October 2001 when Operation Enduring Freedom began       With these changes  if a soldier has bought the SGLI  their family will receive  250 000 for which the soldier pays   150 000 for which we pay  and  100 000 that will now be the death benefit   That   s a half million dollars  which sounds like a lot but these days is really not a lot of money for families left without a parent  a spouse  and who will have children who will need to go to college and all the expenses related to it   As I mentioned  these families who have lost a family member will have a terrible void  and with these benefit reforms we hope in some small way to fill that void monetarily by providing this increase in support and hopefully giving them a little less to worry about   Our fighting men and women  and the families that worry about them  must have the confidence and knowledge that they will be taken care of no matter what happens   That is what the HEROES act sought and what this Supplemental legislation will bring about       We ask much of the volunteers who make up our military   those brave few who assume the risks of battle to secure freedom for us all   We must make sure our soldiers  and the families that worry about them  have the confidence and knowledge that they will be taken care of no matter what   President Theodore Roosevelt once said     A man who is good enough to shed blood for his country is good enough to be given a square deal afterward      TR was right  and the men and women who are shedding blood for our Nation today in the cause of liberty in a way that has fundamentally improved our national security should know that their families will be taken care of no matter what happens       I do not think I have ever been a part of legislation that I have felt better about   This is an issue that transcends party labels and speaks to our higher calling as Americans   We   ve worked across the aisle in a bipartisan way to push for these reforms  and I am glad to see we are about to put them in place   We all recognize that we must keep faith with our fighting men and women  we must give them a    square deal      This is just too important   Our men and women are doing their duty to protect us   It is our duty to protect their families should they give their lives for our freedoms   Thank you         30
