                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Joe Lieberman spoke to the American Israel Public Affairs Committee  AIPAC  National Policy Conference yesterday       The text of the speech  as prepared for delivery  is below          Thank you so much  Thank you  Lonny  for that kind introduction  It s a pleasure to be here among so many friends        I don t know if I can ever sufficiently thank Lonny and so many of you who stood with me throughout the long journey that was my 2006 re election campaign        But trust me  I will try   for as long as God gives me life  and the good people of Connecticut give me the privilege of service       And besides  now AIPAC can say it not only has bipartisan support  It has tripartisan support       In the great policy discussions in Washington  I ve learned  there are opponents on the one side  and on the other  there are allies  and friends  and then  there is family        For me and many others  AIPAC is family   united in our shared history  our shared values  and our shared vision for the future  As family  we can talk frankly with each other  and that is what I would like to do with you today       The fact is we can t afford anything less than honesty at a time like this   a time when  as citizens of America and supporters of Israel  we confront grave and growing dangers to the nations we care so much about       The threats I am referring to are directed not just against the security of our societies  but against the values that define who we are and who we hope to be        They are threats to the universal principles of freedom  of democracy  of the rule of law   threats to the fundamental human rights that we believe are not just cherished by  but endowed to everyone on earth       I do not need to tell you about the nature of these threats  I do not need to tell you about the regime in Iran   about its determination to acquire nuclear weapons  about its sponsorship of terrorism  about its repression of its own citizens        I do not need to tell you about Al Qaeda and Hezbollah and Hamas   about their addiction to violence  about their pathological hatred of America and Israel  about their ambitions for conquest       And I do not need to tell you about the fanatical ideology that links these different groups   the ideology of Islamist extremism  a totalitarian ideology as violent and vicious as the fascism and communism we Americans and our allies fought and defeated in the last century       I do not need to tell you about these threats because you in AIPAC already understand them  That is why you work so hard and so well not just to preserve a strong U S  Israeli relationship but to uphold the cause of freedom        Unfortunately  many in our country today do not seem to share that critical understanding of the threats we face       Increasingly  the debate over our foreign policy is becoming so polarized  so partisan  so bound up in the battles we are having here in Washington  that it seems blind to the real battle outside of America  the challenge of our time from the Islamist extremists who want to destroy us all  who attacked America on September 11  2001  and intend to do so again       In this regard  if I may have a point of personal privilege  as we say in the Senate  I d like to talk with you about my own experience over the past year       First  let me again say thank you  Your support helped me win an election  and even more importantly  to continue the fight for the principles and policies we believe in       I don t think it s any secret that much of my fight for reelection was about the war in Iraq       Given all the mistakes made in Iraq  all of the setbacks and disappointments  I understand how well intentioned people have come to disagree about the war       I also understand the frustration and exhaustion that so many people feel about Iraq  the desire just to throw up our hands and say   Enough         But I continue to believe that a withdrawal from Iraq  as many are now urging  would be a victory for Iran and Al Qaeda and the cause of Islamist extremism  and a catastrophic defeat for the United States and all who desire peace and security and freedom in the Middle East and here at home        We are now implementing a new plan for success in Iraq  with new troops under a new commander  That is why I have called for a six month truce in the political wars in Washington to give that new plan  those new troops  and that new commander a chance to succeed  And I call on all who care about security and peace in the Middle East  and security from terrorism here at home  to do the same        Our fate is now inextricably linked to Iraq s  And our divisions cannot be allowed to become so deep that we cannot find unity in the face of Islamist extremism  Suicide bombers who kill civilians to make a political statement should not be allowed to triumph   in New York or Tel Aviv or Samarra  We must stand strong and united against barbarism   and  with your help  we will       I understand the anger about Iraq  but I am deeply troubled by how this anger  and the feelings of animosity that many people have for President Bush  have begun to affect the way we talk and think about what is happening in the world beyond Iraq and America s role in it       There is something profoundly wrong when opposition to the war in Iraq seems to inspire greater passion than opposition to Islamist extremism        There is something profoundly wrong when there is so much distrust of our intelligence community that some Americans doubt the plain and ominous facts about the threat to us posed by Iran       And there is something profoundly wrong when  in the face of attacks by radical Islam  we think we can find safety and stability by pulling back  by talking to and accommodating our enemies  and abandoning our friends and allies       Some of this wrong headed thinking about the world is happening because we re in a political climate where  for many people  when George Bush says  yes   their reflex reaction is to say  no        That is unacceptable        It s time to step back and start thinking together about our national interest again  to say  yes  when we agree and  no  when we don t  and to find ways to disagree without dividing ourselves from one another        It s time to step back and remember that there is a real enemy out there   an enemy violently opposed to human rights and women s rights and gay rights and the basic political rights of each one of us       It s time to step back and see that America s interests lie with the interests of free people everywhere  and that the response to radical Islam is not to abandon them but to stand with them   whether they are in Baghdad or Teheran or Jerusalem       And that is precisely why I believe AIPAC s mission is more important today than ever before  Your organization embodies an ideal that in the struggle for the defense of freedom  we are not Democrats or Republicans   we are Americans  we are citizens of the same world       I know some people do not appreciate just how deeply American your organization is  They attack AIPAC as if it were an external force in our body politic   an  Israel lobby        These people are outrageously wrong  AIPAC is an American lobby  fighting for the best ideals  values  and interests that the United States of America and Israel share       In supporting the U S  Israeli relationship  AIPAC has been internationalist  strong  and nonpartisan  That is precisely what America s foreign policy   and our domestic political debates about it   desperately needs to be right now  internationalist  strong  and non partisan   not isolationist  weak  and partisan       You have an opportunity and an imperative here in Washington this week   to combat the partisanship that threatens to elevate party interests over the national interest   to fight the fallacy that we can withdraw from the fight against radical Islam and make peace by sweet talking people who shout  Death to America  and call for the destruction of Israel  That has never worked  and it will never work       I want each of you here today to recognize that you are on the frontlines of this war  It is a war for security but also a war about ideas  In your meetings on Capitol Hill  in your discussions when you return home to your communities across America  I ask you to be proud of what you stand for  of what you are doing  and of the ideas and the organization you represent        And when you are challenged about your beliefs  do not let the charges go unanswered  Do not shy from this fight  Do not retreat from the battlefield of ideas        You know that the struggle for freedom is indivisible  You know that freedom itself is indivisible        That is why we stand united   as Americans  as Israelis  as children of God  as children of freedom        The esteemed historian of the Middle East  Bernard Lewis  was in Washington this past week  He said that  when he looks at the world today and the threats we face  it reminds him of the 1930s   and that he hears far more voices that sound like Chamberlain than like Churchill       And so I challenge each of you to find the voice of Churchill inside yourself  and let it be heard this week on Capitol Hill and throughout the nation in the days and years ahead       Stand up for your arguments  Stand up for your principles  Stand up for your values       Stand up for America  Stand up for Israel  Stand up for freedom  And have confidence that in the end  our cause will  with God s help  prevail       Thank you so much
