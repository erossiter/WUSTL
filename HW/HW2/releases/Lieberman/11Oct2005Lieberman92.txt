                                                                                                                                Condemns    Dangerous and Misguided    Cuts in First Responder Funding       WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   released the following statement Friday in opposition to the Fiscal Year 2006 Homeland Security Department Appropriations bill  approved by the Senate on a voice vote           It is with regret that I oppose this conference report       I am a strong advocate of the need for the Department of Homeland Security and its work  And as the ranking member of the Department   s lead authorizing committee  I do not lightly oppose this appropriations bill for the Department   s vital work  But I feel I have no choice but to protest what I consider to be dangerous and misguided cuts in the vital programs that help America   s first responders       Just weeks ago  we watched with horror as our fellow citizens in Louisiana and Mississippi suffered the ravages of Hurricane Katrina  It was inevitable that a hurricane of that size and intensity would cause hardship  But we know that the pain was far greater     and the recovery far more daunting     than it needed to have been if our government had done all it could to prepare for and respond to the catastrophe  We know that preparedness planning was inadequate  that first responders lacked the equipment and communications they needed to respond  and that first responders and officials did not have the training and command structures they needed to work effectively together to help the many victims depending on them  And this for a catastrophic hurricane that had been predicted in advance  We can only speculate what preparedness and response to an unforeseen catastrophic terror attack might look like       We know  in short  that we have very far to go before we are as ready as we must be for the threats ahead  So why are we now are asked to approve dramatic cuts in the very programs that could help strengthen these essential capabilities       This conference report would cut the three core first responder programs     the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSGP   the Urban Area Security Initiative  UASI  and the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  LETPP      by 28 percent     nearly a third   The state homeland grants  which make up the backbone of most prevention and preparedness efforts  would be cut in half from FY 05 levels   And this comes on top of several years of cuts to these accounts  I know these cuts will leave unacceptable gaps in homeland security efforts in my own state of Connecticut  and I assume other states will also be unable to achieve their preparedness and response goals without more help from the federal government        By contrast  the Senate voted in support of S  21  a bill sponsored by Senator Collins and me  to authorize a significant increase in funding for these core first responder programs  The Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee has also endorsed legislation to create a new dedicated grant program to help first responders obtain interoperable communications equipment  This vital need     so painfully apparent on 9 11 and again during Katrina and its aftermath     alone is estimated to cost billions of dollars  Currently  first responders must purchase interoperable communications systems with these general homeland security grants  making the pending cuts all the more distressing       I recognize that appropriators struggled with constraints imposed by the Administration   s budget and had to make difficult choices between many important homeland security needs  I appreciate that conferees fought to include dedicated money for rail  transit and port security grants  as well as for the Coast Guard   s Deepwater program  But I reject the premise that we must accept this as the best we can do for our first responders  It is not the best we can do  It must not be the best we can do  We know that the threats     natural or manmade     are real  and that we are not yet ready to meet them  Katrina has just underscored that lesson  Two years ago  a distinguished task force chaired by our former colleague Warren Rudman told us that our first responders were    drastically underfunded  dangerously unprepared    and that we would need close to  100 billion over five years to meet critical preparedness and response needs  Yet in the time since  we have only whittled away at these critical programs rather than strengthening them  As I have said before  we have the best military in the world because we are willing to pay for it  We should not do less for our defenses here at home       I wish to go on record opposing this conference report because I believe we must find a way to do more for our first responders and the communities they serve          30
