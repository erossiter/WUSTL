Open                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Senator celebrates Commission   s 7 1 vote to reverse Pentagon recommendation       WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman today lauded the decision by the Base Closure and Realignment Commission  BRAC   to keep Submarine Base New London open   Lieberman celebrated the commission   s 7 1 vote to reverse the Pentagon   s recommendation        Lieberman joined Governor M  Jodi Rell  Senator Chris Dodd  Representatives Christopher Shays and John Larson  Electric Boat President John Casey  local Chairman of the Subase Realignment Coalition John Markowicz and coalition analyst Gabe Stern at a press conference in Groton following the BRAC commission   s decision           This is a huge win for Connecticut and a huge win for the nation     Lieberman said      I would like to express my gratitude to the BRAC commissioners for recognizing the military value of Submarine Base New London   Making our case to these commissioners was a true team effort  which could not have been accomplished without the great work of John Markowicz  Gabe Stern and the dedicated members of the Subase Realignment Coalition and the Washington Group             Commissioners Principi  Newton  Bilbray  Coyle  Skinner  Hill and Turner voted in favor of keeping the base open  while Commissioner Hansen voted to uphold the Pentagon   s closure recommendation and Commissioner Gehman abstained        The Pentagon issued its list of base closure recommendations  which included the closure of Submarine Base New London  on May 13  The Connecticut team then had the opportunity to make their case to the BRAC commissioners at a two hour hearing in Boston on July 6   In preparing for their July 6 defense of Submarine Base New London  the Connecticut team met great difficulty in obtaining necessary data from the Pentagon on how they arrived at their recommendation to close Submarine Base New London   This lack of information forced Lieberman and Senator Susan Collins R ME  to use their authority as Chairman and Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee to issue a subpoena forcing the Pentagon to release the data    Senator Lieberman participated in Congressional hearings and held numerous meetings and discussions with BRAC commissioners and staff as well as with DoD officials during the process         At the July 6 hearing the Connecticut team argued that the military value score the Pentagon gave Submarine Base New London was considerably lower than was deserved   The Pentagon failed to give any value to among other things  the U S  Submarine School housed in New London  the nuclear capability of the base and the synergy with the nation   s leading submarine construction yard adjacent to the base at Electric Boat        The BRAC commissioners heard other arguments in favor of the base  including the potentially dangerous impact closing the base would have on our national security  the infrastructure advantage of Submarine Base New London over other sub bases  the economic impact the base closure would have on the state  the cost of cleaning up the base and the close working relationship between the base and nearby submarine builder Electric Boat   The Commissioners also heard arguments in favor of the base from Former President Jimmy Carter  House Speaker Dennis Hastert  and several former Admirals   The distinguished former Admirals who wrote to the BRAC Commission include        William Crowe               Former Chairman  Joint Chiefs of Staff      Carlisle Trost                  Former Chief  Naval Operations      Frank Kelso                    Former Chief  Naval Operations      Thomas Fargo                Former Commander  Pacific Command      Richard Mies                  Former Commander  U S  Strategic Command      Kinnaird McKee             Former Director of Naval Reactors      Bruce DeMars                Former Director of Naval Reactors      Frank Bowman               Former Director of Naval Reactors      Kenneth Carr                  Former Commander Submarine Force  U S  Atlantic Fleet      Roland Thunman            Former Deputy Chief of Naval Operations  Submarine Warfare      Al Konetzni                    Former Commander Submarine Force  U S  Pacific Fleet      George Sterner               Former Commander  Naval Sea Systems Command      James Watkins               Former Chief  Naval Operations        In addition  Lieberman and Dodd sponsored legislation introduced by Senator John Thune in July which called for the BRAC process to be postponed until U S  troops returned home from Iraq and the Pentagon completed its Quadrennial Defense Review  as well as other legislation to force a more thorough review of the decision   However  consideration of relevant legislation was delayed in the senate to preclude consideration of these provisions        After their vote today  the BRAC Commission must report their recommendations to the President by September 8  and the President will submit his final list to Congress on November 7         30
