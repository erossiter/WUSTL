Security Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   that will reinvent  protect  and strengthen the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  passed the Senate floor today by a vote of 87 to 11  The amendment to the Department of Homeland Security Appropriations legislation was cosponsored by Senators Trent Lott  R Miss   and Tom Carper  D Del   and largely mirrors legislation introduced by Senators Collins and Lieberman two weeks ago  The United States Emergency Management Authority Act of 2006    Specifically  the measure will implement key recommendations of the Committee   s Hurricane Katrina Report  A Nation Still Unprepared  and will recreate FEMA as the U S  Emergency Management Authority  USEMA   reunite its response and preparedness functions  and ensure that the agency remains within the Department of Homeland Security as an independent agency  similar to the current structure of the Coast Guard        This amendment reflects  key recommendations  of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security   s seven month investigation into the failed preparations and response to Hurricane Katrina  which consisted of  23 hearings  the testimony of 85 witnesses  the texts of more than 325 formal interviews  and the evidence from more than 838 000 pages of documents         Senator Collins said     This amendment is a significant first step toward implementing the Committee   s major recommendations for reforming FEMA    The overarching objective of the amendment is to strengthen FEMA by giving it new authority  new capabilities  and new responsibilities for all hazards emergency preparedness and response   As last year   s tragedy demonstrated  FEMA urgently needs our help to be more effective   Amending the Homeland Security appropriations bill with this provision will go far to ensuring that we will have a far more effective structure to protect our fellow citizens    lives and livelihoods from disaster           Senator Lieberman said     We cannot legislate leadership  But we can legislate changes in government structures to make them more sensible and better suited to protecting people in times of disaster  This amendment would literally reinvent FEMA to give our federal emergency preparedness and response experts the authority  capabilities  the resources  and the integration with state and local officials they need to avoid the confused  uncoordinated  and ultimately ineffective response the nation and the world witnessed last August when Hurricane Katrina made landfall  We are creating a truly national system of emergency management that will be able to draw on the nation   s vast resources for a cohesive and complete local  state  and federal response           The following are highlights of the amendment        Recreates  FEMA the U S  Emergency Management Authority  USEMA           The USEMA will be an independent agency within the Department of Homeland Security and will have the same protections currently provided to the U S  Coast Guard  For example  the DHS Secretary will have no authority to reorganize the structure of the agency  erode its assets or functions  or alter its mission without approval by Congress           Preparedness functions would be joined with response capabilities so that the organization that works with state and local officials to prepare for disasters is the same one that works with state and local officials to respond to disasters           USEMA would have a strengthened regional focus with federal    strike teams    for faster and more effective responses  These teams would ensure that the USEMA is familiar with regional threats and with state and local emergency personnel and can rapidly and effectively cooperate with first responders and public officials in disaster areas           The administrator of USEMA will report to the DHS Secretary  but will also have direct access to the President to advise on emergency management matters  much as the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff does on military issues           Ensures that the administrator of USEMA has direct access to the President and serves as principal emergency management advisor           Senators Collins and Lieberman will introduce subsequent legislation to implement other recommendations from their Hurricane Katrina report
