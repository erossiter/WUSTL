hearing       WASHINGTON     In testimony today before a Senate Indian Affairs Committee hearing on the tribal recognition process Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  urged his colleagues to take swift action to fix what he called a broken process for federal recognition of Native American tribes   Lieberman   s statement discussed two disputed tribal recognition cases in Connecticut   the Eastern Pequots and the Skatigcokes   and explained his proposal to overhaul of the process           Lacking clear transparency needed to foster and sustain strong public confidence  BIA decision making has lost an enormous amount of public credibility     Lieberman said      Neither Native American groups and tribes  nor the general public can afford or accept a process that is full of errors  inequities and delays   Using the critique and recommendations of the GAO report as a starting point  Senator Dodd and I introduced legislation that would have created a more fair and open tribal recognition process             The Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement  TRIBE  Act  which Dodd and Lieberman introduced earlier this year  would codify existing criteria used to make recognition decisions and would require that a tribe meet all of these criteria before being recognized as a sovereign nation         Senator Chris Dodd  D CT   Representatives Nancy Johnson  R CT   Congressman Chris Shays  R CT   Rob Simmons  R CT  and Governor Jodi Rell  R CT  also testified at today   s hearing        Senator Lieberman   s full testimony is below                                            Testimony of Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  Before the Senate Indian Affairs Committee      May 11  2005       As prepared for delivery        Mr  Chairman  thank you for holding this hearing today on the process of tribal recognition   My home state of Connecticut is not alone in finding this a critical issue  where the stakes are high for local communities  for people seeking recognition and for those tribes that have gained recognition   All have a vital stake in ensuring the legitimacy and credibility of the process          To most others  tribal recognition means casino gaming  and  as such  is among the top issues of concern cited by the public   Connecticut already has two casinos operated by the Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation and Mohegan Tribe        As a result  many people in Connecticut see acutely the linkages between this issue and other priority concerns  such as suburban sprawl and traffic congestion and the overall quality of life in their local communities          That is why it is urgent for the federal government to undertake a complete overhaul of the badly broken federal tribal recognition process           If we are going to treat groups seeking recognition fairly  while making decisions that so clearly affect the economics and quality of life in so many local communities across the country  we must ensure the Bureau of Indian Affairs renders every single one of its decisions according to clearly defined recognition criteria that everybody sees and understands        Now  let me state clearly at the outset of this hearing as I have done in the past  that I do not oppose the recognition of historic Native American tribes          That is one of the reasons that I find so troubling recent decisions by the Bureau of Indian Affairs  decisions that so clearly demonstrate that the tribal recognition process is dysfunctional         For example  in Connecticut  the BIA recently recognized the Eastern Pequot    That decision actually involved recognition petitions from two different groups  both of which insisted that the groups comprised two totally separate tribes         Completely on its own motion  the BIA nonetheless created a new tribe by merging the two petitioners into one tribe     a move no one had requested          Another decision     recognizing the Schaghticoke     led to an Inspector General   s report  requested by Senator Dodd         Although the IG   s August 2004 report found no actual malfeasance or wrongdoing  the BIA subsequently revealed that it made a critical error in calculating the marriage rate between Schaghticoke tribal members during the 19th century          New marriage figures calculated by the BIA dropped the Schaghticoke intra tribal marriage rate below the threshold that automatically satisfies one of the seven federal recognition criteria         The BIA refused all Connecticut lawmaker requests for immediate reversal of its decision  and this case remains on appeal  along with the Eastern Pequot determination          If the Eastern Pequot and Schaghticoke recognition decisions are upheld  local residents will have to bear the economic and social costs associated with the prospect of two new casinos that will forever change their quality of life          Lacking clear transparency needed to foster and sustain strong public confidence  BIA decision making has lost an enormous amount of public credibility   Neither Native American groups and tribes  nor the general public can afford or accept a process that is full of errors  inequities and delays        Using the critique and recommendations of the GAO report as a starting point  Senator Dodd and I introduced legislation that would have created a more fair and open tribal recognition process          We remain unwavering in our commitment to reform the process so that these critical decisions are based on fair  consistent  and accurate procedures  and have reintroduced The Tribal Recognition and Indian Bureau Enhancement  TRIBE  Act to enact these reforms         Our legislation is a balanced effort to fix the acknowledged problems in the BIA   s tribal recognition process          BIA must provide adequate procedures to ensure its legitimacy  and have the increased resources and staff needed to follow these procedures fully          The TRIBE Act will benefit both Native American tribes and the communities most directly affected by the growth of casino gambling   All stakeholders must be provided the financial tools to participate meaningfully in the recognition process        I want to again stress that the TRIBE Act does nothing to affect tribes that have already gained recognition as a result of final agency action  nor would it hinder their economic development plans          We want these procedural reforms to fix the shortcomings identified in the GAO report which are undermining the legitimacy of the entire process          In closing  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this legislation   The tribal recognition process is a critical matter not only for Connecticut  but for many other states   Mr  Chairman  your committee has the opportunity to fix a broken process and I thank you for this opportunity to urge you to do so        30
