public and private insurers  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   have written federal officials to hold them to their commitment to conduct new analysis of global warming s impact on the federal crop and flood insurance programs                   At a Committee hearing on April 19  2007  entitled   Dangerous Exposure  The Impact of Global Warming on Private and Federal Insurance   the Government Accountability Office  GAO  released a report   commissioned by Lieberman and Collins two years earlier   that found that the Department of Agriculture and the Department of Homeland Security can and should do a better job of assessing the fiscal impacts that unchecked global warming will have on the taxpayer funded Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and National Flood Insurance Program  Through those programs  American taxpayers are exposed to many billions of dollars in claims for the losses that result from the very weather catastrophes that are projected to intensify due to global warming                     The Senators   in letters to Michael Buckley  Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mitigation for the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   and Eldon Gould  Administrator of the Risk Management Agency at the U S  Department of Agriculture   called for the agencies to lay out a plan for how they will factor in the potential losses that climate change could create  and submit the plan to Congress                    Full text of the letters follows           May 2  2007        Michael Buckley  Deputy Assistant Administrator for Mitigation  Federal Emergency Management Agency  U S  Department of Homeland Security  500 C St   S W   Washington  DC 20472         Dear Mr  Buckley       We are writing to follow up on a request made at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee hearing of April 19  2007  entitled  Dangerous Exposure  The Impact of Global Warming on Private and Federal Insurance         At that hearing  John Stephenson of the General Accountability Office submitted a report entitled   Climate Change  Financial Risks to Federal and Private Insurers in Coming Decades Are Potentially Significant   That report stated        We recommend that the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of Homeland Security direct the Administrator of the Risk Management Agency and the Under Secretary of Homeland Security for Emergency Preparedness to analyze the potential long term implications of climate change for the Federal Crop Insurance Corporation and the National Flood Insurance Program  respectively  and report their findings to the Congress  This analysis should use forthcoming assessments from the Climate Change Science Program and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to establish sound estimates of expected future conditions  Key components of this analysis may include   1  realistic scenarios of future losses under anticipated climatic conditions and expected exposure levels  including both potential budgetary implications and consequences for continued program operation and  2  potential mitigation options that each program might use to reduce their exposure to loss       You testified that DHS agreed with the recommendations  At the hearing  we requested that your agency submit a report to Congress  separate from any annual reports  that implements GAO s recommendations  We are writing now to ask that you provide to this Committee  in writing  a date by which you will be able to complete this report and a description of the analysis that will be included in the report  We believe that given the substantial potential financial liability to the federal government due to climate change  it is of the utmost importance that the NFIP begin to factor in the potential losses that climate change could create        Thank you for your consideration of this request  We look forward to hearing back from you soon        Sincerely          Joseph I Lieberman  Chairman      Susan M  Collins  Ranking Member       May 2  2007         The Honorable Eldon Gould  Administrator
