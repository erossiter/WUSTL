Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Tuesday co sponsored a bipartisan amendment to the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would reinvent FEMA into an agency capable of responding to all disasters rapidly and with state and local coordination                    The Committee   s study of the disastrous response to Hurricane Katrina led to the proposal  also sponsored by Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   Senator Tom Caroper  D Del   and Senator Trent Lott  R Miss        Following is text of the Senator   s floor statement                    Mr  President  I am pleased to join with Chairman Collins and Senators Carper and Lott today to introduce this amendment to make FEMA into an agency capable of responding swiftly and effectively to the most serious kinds of disaster     whether it is a hurricane the size and scope of Katrina  a natural disaster the likes of which we see more routinely in this country from year to year  or a terrorist attack  which our enemies hope will be even more devastating than the attacks of 9 11 and for which me must be perpetually on the defensive and prepared                    This amendment would literally reinvent FEMA to give our federal emergency preparedness and response experts the authority  capabilities  the resources  and the integration with state and local officials they need to avoid the confused  uncoordinated  and ultimately ineffective response the nation and the world witnessed last August when Katrina made landfall   And it would strengthen emergency preparedness and response within the Homeland Security Department  which this Congress created a short time ago to prevent  prepare for  and ultimately respond to disasters of all kinds  This amendment would create a truly national system of emergency management that will be able to draw on the nation   s vast resources for a cohesive and complete local  state  and federal response                   Mr  President  the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee spent seven months at the request of the leadership of the Senate in 2005 and 2006 investigating the botched government response to that catastrophic hurricane                    We found that  at all levels  our government was ill equipped to deal with the massive human suffering all along the Gulf Coast that followed the storm   s landfall  suffering that shocked and angered the American people who expect better support from their government for fellow Americans in need   These failings were caused by negligence  lack of resources  lack of capability  but most of all  a lack of leadership     from the very top to the very bottom                   We cannot legislate leadership   But we can legislate changes in government structures to make them more sensible and better suited to protecting people in times of disaster  The Committee   s report had merit because we told the story of what happened and what didn   t happen  of the clear warnings of a storm like Katrina  and the clear predictions that we were not ready for it  The committee went beyond just telling the story and offered a number of recommendations about what was needed to improve our preparations  response  and recovery  Chairman Collins and I will introduce broader legislation to encompass all of our report   s key recommendations shortly   But we begin today with the foundation  rejoining the functions of disaster response with disaster preparedness                     We are calling this reinvented organization the United States Emergency Management Authority  USEMA  and it would be at the very core of the Department of Homeland Security  just as FEMA was originally intended to be when the proposed new department took shape in 2002  based on the recommendations of the Hart Rudman Commission the previous year    How could one have a Department of Homeland Security aimed at preparing for and responding to terrorist attacks without the primary agency responsible for emergency management at its core                   We are not just renaming FEMA  Where FEMA has often struggled to cope with normal hurricanes  the mission of the new Authority will be to partner with state and local governments  other federal agencies  the private sector and non governmental organizations to build a national system of emergency management that can respond effectively to a truly catastrophic incident  or other natural or man made disaster                  Our investigation of what went wrong during Hurricane Katrina made it clear that part of the problem was caused by separate and uncoordinated federal preparedness and response functions within the Department of Homeland Security                      In the years before Katrina  FEMA  the agency charged with coordinating our nation   s response to terrorist attacks and natural disasters  too often was out of the loop when critical decisions about how to prepare were made   It had no say in how to spend billions of dollars in preparedness grants   Exercises were designed and held without serious input by FEMA   Relationships with state and local officials on the front lines were not developed  And so  FEMA   s ability to respond was crippled because it was not working hand in glove with those making preparations     whether at the state and local level  other federal agencies  or the private and non profit sectors                     Our amendment  first and foremost  will ensure that our preparedness efforts are inseparable from the capabilities needed to respond  USEMA will provide the resources  and it will have the ability  and the obligation  to plan and train with state and local emergency management officials  just as it will have the responsibility to coordinate with them at the time of a disaster                     Where FEMA has been slow to respond  and too often reactive  the new Authority will be charged with developing a federal response capability that can act rapidly and proactively when necessary to deliver assistance essential to saving lives in a disaster   Where FEMA has not been fully integrated with DHS in the past  the new Authority will be charged with coordinating with key agencies in DHS  like the Coast Guard  under the leadership of the Secretary of Homeland Security                    Our amendment would also give the new authority special status within the Department of Homeland Security     the same status the Coast Guard and Secret Service now have   With this status  changes to the agency   s functions and its assets could only be made by Congressional statute  We would also insist in this legislation that the Administrator and other key agency officials have the necessary experience and qualifications for the job  It   s unbelievable  in many ways  that that has not been the statutory requirement  To have people who don   t have emergency management experience is really irresponsible   In other words  USEMA would not be plagued by unqualified appointees as FEMA has been in the past                    The Chairman and I also envision a new agency with robust regional offices to focus on preparedness and response coordination with local and state agencies   Let   s take the focus away from Washington and place it where it belongs  where the real work of preparedness is done  on the front lines  in the states  and in the municipalities  This will guarantee that federal officials are familiar with regional and local threats  Different parts of the country are vulnerable to different threats  This regional approach will ensure that officials are not exchanging business cards on the day the disaster strikes  and that they are not meeting on the day of the disaster  that  in fact  they know each other                   I know some of my colleagues believe FEMA should be removed from DHS and given independent status  But Senator Collins and I know from our investigation that this is not the solution  Even when it was independent  FEMA had never developed the capacity to respond to a catastrophe like Hurricane Katrina  So returning it to independent status as if those were the golden days of yore are not based on fact and will in no way solve the problems we face   In fact  it will make solutions  and I would say preparations and response  to disasters far more difficult  Removing the agency from the Department will only create additional problems  duplications  and disconnectedness    FEMA     or our reinvented version of it   should be the critical core of the Department                    To cope with a catastrophe  the government   s chief preparations and response agency must have access to the vast resources of the Department of Homeland Security and it needs to work seamlessly with other agencies that have critical roles to play during catastrophes  Each agency and function will have to work with the others  and smooth working relationships under intense pressure are more likely if officials know one another  if agencies have a history with each other  and if everyone ultimately serves the same Secretary of Homeland Security                   The grievous conditions of Gulf Coast communities in the week after Katrina   s landfall embarrassed us before the world and quite appropriately angered us because we know we can do better  But the Gulf Coast and the force of Katrina are not isolated communities  Other American communities are similarly vulnerable today   whether to a natural disaster or terrorist attack  We also know that significant flaws in the nation   s readiness remain  Another response like the one we saw during Katrina  allowing such a response to occur  is simply not an option                     Our proposal is not about rearranging bureaucratic boxes  We have studied past failings and carefully considered how to improve our performance the next time  We have been driven by that singular goal  We have not had any thoughts of protecting the status quo or protecting one entity7 over another  We have tried to come up with a solution that will best protect American people the next time disaster strikes  We have been driven by the imperative to save people   s lives because that it what is on the line  and what we have lost  The changes embodied in this amendment promise a better response the next time disaster strikes                   I ask my colleagues for their support on this amendment so that we will not be embarrassed before the world again  And I thank Senator Lott and Senator Carper for joining in a truly bipartisan national interest to protect the homeland security  Thank you       30
