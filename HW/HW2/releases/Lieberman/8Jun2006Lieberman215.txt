Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Thursday  Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   repeated his call for reinvigorating FEMA within the Department of Homeland Security  He also criticized the Department   s recent allocation of Fiscal Year 2006 homeland security grants and called for a larger pot of funding so first responders and preparers can conduct the planning and get the equipment and training they need to do their jobs adequately        Thank you  Madam Chairman  and welcome to you Secretary Chertoff  I appreciate your coming before the Committee today to discuss the future of FEMA and our ideas about how to reinvigorate the agency so that in the future it can respond successfully to catastrophes the size and scope of Hurricane Katrina        I know you know that many of us are also extremely disappointed by the consistently declining level of funding for homeland security grants that this Administration supports and the way it has chosen to disburse it   Last week   s announcement of the Fiscal Year 2006 allocations was received with dismay  and in my opinion  for very good reason  I   ll have more to say on that point in a moment       Last month  this Committee issued an extensive analysis of what went wrong during the preparations for and response to Hurricane Katrina   You are familiar with our findings and also with the recommendation contained within that report to rebuild FEMA into a more muscular  accountable agency within the Department of Homeland Security   I am pleased you believe that FEMA should remain within the Department  as the Chairman and I do   And I hope that you will come to agree with our other reorganization proposals  which would pull together the resources  the missions  and the authority for an effective federal catastrophic preparedness and response when local and state agencies are overwhelmed       Our driving motivation for rebuilding and reinventing FEMA is to save lives and to help those who survive disasters rebuild their lives  Over 1 500 people lost their lives as a result of Hurricane Katrina     a devastating number when we consider that no other storm in the last 30 years has caused as many as 100 deaths   But this one brought about the deaths of 1500 people  Tens of thousands were left without basic necessities for days in conditions that shocked all Americans   The fact is that still today  months after the storm and at the start of yet another hurricane season  hundreds of thousands displaced by Katrina and Rita still face uncertain futures   We can and must do better together         As you know  I have been critical of the lack of leadership at the federal  state and local level  in the immediate run up to and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina    Active and decisive leadership is the single most important factor in saving lives during catastrophes  Appropriate government structures are a distant second       But appropriate government structures have their place  When we created the Department of Homeland Security four years ago as the primary department for protecting Americans here at home  emergency management was supposed to be at the new Department   s heart   Just as the Hart Rudman Commission had recommended  we put FEMA at the core of the Department where it could draw on the Department   s other components for strength  capability and competence  especially in the face of a catastrophic terrorist attack or natural disaster       Unfortunately  the Administration and Congress undermined that vision by depriving the agency of funds and qualified leaders   Secretary Ridge and you further dismantled what was left of FEMA   s preparedness functions  placing them elsewhere in the Department  I believe this was a mistake   That   s why Senator Collins and I have proposed to reunite preparedness with response so that the same officials who help states and locals get ready for disasters are the ones who also help them respond       As we will hear from our witnesses today  FEMA must remain within the Department of Homeland Security  in part  so it can take full advantage of the many DHS resources available   including Coast Guard responders  communications capabilities and interoperability research  law enforcement assets  infrastructure protection  and intelligence about the types of attacks that are most likely to occur and for which we should prepare   At a time when the threat of terrorism and future catastrophes loom  now is not the time to begin dismantling the Department of Homeland Security that was created to make our nation safer       We think FEMA should be less Washington centric and more connected to the real work of preparing for disasters where they actually occur  so we envision a rebuilt agency with ten strengthened regional offices to focus on preparedness and response coordination with local and state agencies   Each regional office would house a permanent    strike team    that would include representatives from other federal agencies involved in emergency response to ensure the Feds are familiar with regional threats and with state and local emergency personnel        Our rebuilt FEMA would be designed to deliver the kind of rapid  energetic  and life saving response exhibited by the U S  Coast Guard during and after Hurricane Katrina  The Coast Guard is part of DHS and has a role defined by statute  which is just what we propose for our bigger  better FEMA   Finally  we would require the new agency   s top leaders to have the experience  professional qualifications  and relevant technical training that will enable them to call the right shots when catastrophes happen                   Mr  Secretary  a brief word about homeland security grants to states  This Administration and this Congress continue to underfund one of the most crucial needs of this nation     the grants that allow state and local first preparers and responders to conduct the extensive planning and get the training and equipment they need to do their jobs   For the second year in a row  this funding has declined  and the Administration has proposed significant additional cuts for next year as well   Yet the risks to our communities  whether by natural disaster or terrorist attack  have not diminished   We must invest more in our defenses here at home if we are to have any chance of thwarting another September 11 or of responding effectively to the next Katrina   Even if we get the right organization within DHS  it will matter little if the Administration continues to underfund our most critical homeland security needs                    I want to welcome our witnesses today  and I look forward to their counsel and advice   The tragedy that was Hurricane Katrina and the subsequent federal response seems to me evidence enough that we cannot go back to the past  If we are to be prepared for the threats of the future  we must give those who prepare for and respond to disasters the tools they need     and that means money  leadership  and authority   That is how to save people   s lives when catastrophe strikes   Thank you  Madam Chairman           30
