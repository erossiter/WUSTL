Department of Education to re consider changes which could undermine female participation in athletics       WASHINGTON    Senator Joe Lieberman today called on the Bush Administration to preserve Title IX education law aimed at providing equal opportunity for female student athletes   In a letter to Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings  Lieberman urged the Department of Education to re consider a change to its Title IX compliance policy  which threatens to undermine 33 years of progress made on behalf of women athletes throughout the nation             I might point out that 2 9 million high school girls compete for fewer than 200 000 college female athletic participation opportunities  which include preferred admissions to the nation   s best colleges and over  300 million in athletic scholarship dollars     Lieberman wrote      The current policies have been in place through Republican and Democratic administrations and have been uniformly upheld under federal court appeals  The change proposed by the Department   s guidance could give schools an easy way out of their Title IX responsibilities               The full text of the letter is below        April 28  2005     The Honorable Margaret Spellings  Secretary of Education  U S  Department of Education  400 Maryland Ave   SW  Washington  DC 20202     Dear Secretary Spellings     I write to express my concerns regarding the Department of Education   s new Title IX policy     Additional Clarification of Intercollegiate Athletic Policy  Three Part Test   Part Three      I am concerned that this new policy may undermine 33 years of progress made under this legislation on behalf of women athletes throughout the nation        Since Title IX became law in 1972  participation by young women in high school and college athletics has enjoyed a manifold increase  Despite these remarkable gains in participation  women and girls   who constitute half of student enrollments   still receive only 41 percent of athletic opportunities  and they continue to be shortchanged in terms of athletic scholarship opportunities  facilities  and other benefits and services   I am concerned that the ground they have gained may be eroded if the guidance issued is permitted to stand  and I implore the Department of Education to maintain a vigorous enforcement of Title IX        As you know  currently  institutions can meet Title IX compliance by any one of three means  by demonstrating that intercollegiate participation opportunities for males and females are proportional to their respective enrollments  by demonstrating a historical and continuing practice of program expansion for an underrepresented sex  or by demonstrating that the interests and abilities of an underrepresented sex are fully and effectively accommodated by existing programs  I am concerned that the recent change in policy   which addresses the third  or    accommodation of interest    method   is a departure from the previous standards by which schools could demonstrate compliance with Title IX  The Department   s guidance authorizes the use of an e mail    model survey    to determine Title IX compliance  The interest survey approach is problematic for several reasons        First  according to long standing policy and practice  surveys account for only one of many factors that schools must consider in assessing their accommodation of student interest  Under the new guidance  numerous other considerations  such as direct requests to add a sport  opinions of coaches and administrators  and participation rates in local high school and community league sports  are no longer required         Further  under the Department   s guidance  a lack of response to the survey may be interpreted as a de facto lack of interest in sports participation  By establishing a default presumption of compliance  this model deflects the institution   s responsibility to demonstrate compliance  and compels the student to illustrate otherwise  The success of Title IX has shown that opportunity breeds interest  and such surveys  taken apart from other indicators  could reflect artificial limitations on interest which have resulted simply from a lack of opportunity         I might point out that 2 9 million high school girls compete for fewer than 200 000 college female athletic participation opportunities  which include preferred admissions to the nation   s best colleges and over  300 million in athletic scholarship dollars        The current policies have been in place through Republican and Democratic administrations and have been uniformly upheld under federal court appeals  The change proposed by the Department   s guidance could give schools an easy way out of their Title IX responsibilities        The value of lessons learned through athletic competition cannot be quantified  and they last a lifetime   In the interests of today   s young women and girls   and of those who will follow   I ask you to reconsider the    Clarification    issued March 18  2005   Thank you for your consideration  I would appreciate the inclusion of these comments in any public record related to this matter        Sincerely        Joseph I  Lieberman      United States Senator       30
