production       WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee  lauded the committee s approval of a  648 8 billion defense authorization bill for FY 2008 that provides critical equipment to the nation s war fighters  including more than  3 8 billion to submarine construction and billions more for cutting edge defense projects across Connecticut       Lieberman  who played a critical role in shaping the bill  said the authorizations would dramatically improve the readiness of our armed forces  take care of service members and their families  and strike the necessary balance between the military s near  and long term capabilities        It is critical that we invest more to increase the size and capabilities of our nation s ground combat forces and submarine force   Lieberman said   The bill that passed out of committee today does that  it increases our investment in successful defense programs while providing enough research and development dollars to ensure that our servicemen and servicewomen are supplied with the very best weapons available        Lieberman personally worked to include several important authorizations in the bill  Among them                  An addition of  470 million for advanced procurement which authorizes the Navy to  increase production of Virginia class submarine to two a year beginning in 2010                  An addition of  97 million for a total of  341 million for next generation  high altitude  precision surveillance and targeting radar  MPRTIP  for the JSTARS aircraft                  An addition of  25 million for research and design on the Navy s next generation ballistic missile submarine  which will replace the current fleet of Ohio class submarines       As a senior committee member  Lieberman worked diligently since the start of the 110th Congress in January to secure the funding for these and many other critical needs  He attended almost 30 Senate Armed Services Committee and subcommittee hearings   sitting through nearly 100 hours of expert witness testimony   to determine the status of our armed services and how they should transform for the future       As a result  Lieberman was determined to accelerate the manufacture of two submarines a year to 2010 instead of the Navy s proposed starting date of 2012  the earlier ramp up date  he said  is critical to national security in the face of China s rapidly expanding navy  The funding is important  also  to both Electric Boat and Navy Submarine Base New London s workers  whose numbers have dwindled  The funding for new construction and research into the next generation ballistic submarine would help maintain the workforce at the base and at Electric Boat  including naval designers and engineers  The bill also authorizes improvements to the base s physical environs  including the construction of a small watercraft maintenance building        The workers and sailors in Connecticut have not only played an important role in our national security  but are developing innovative technologies that will spell out the future of defense   Lieberman said   The bill as it now stands repays that commitment  providing more resources to the development and construction of new submarines  We will continue to fight for this investment  which  incidentally  will keep high skilled jobs in Connecticut        As chairman of the important Airland Subcommittee and sitting member of the Personnel and Seapower subcommittees  Lieberman helped spearhead one of the biggest military initiatives since the war on terrorism began   increasing the size of our ground forces and providing them with necessary armored vehicles  air support  and equipment       Lieberman has been a vocal advocate for the increases to the Army and Marine Corps that Congress and the Bush administration are now supporting  The bill would increase the size of the Army by 43 000 personnel in the coming year   a faster build up than the 7 000 soldier a year increase the Bush administration has proposed  Just last winter the Pentagon called for a 547 000 personnel Army and 202 000 personnel Marine Corps by fiscal 2013  increasing the two services by 65 000 and 27 000 personnel respectively  Lieberman has shown leadership on this issue  however  introducing legislation last year to increase U S  ground forces by an even greater number   100 000 personnel       Lieberman also supported provisions for funding critical force protection equipment  including mine resistant  ambush protected vehicles  or MRAPS  hulking armored trucks with v shaped hulls that are more effective than armored Humvees in saving soldiers  lives       During the SASC s work on the bill  Lieberman pushed to include the procurement of more than 90 helicopters  providing ground forces with the air support they will need as more Army and Marine Corps soldiers are deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan        We have asked our brave men and women in the armed services to make the greatest sacrifices in service to this nation   Lieberman said   Providing them with effective protections on the ground and in the air is the very least we can do        Lieberman also supported the development of a family of next generation radars for airborne surveillance systems that will provide war fighters with unprecedented situational awareness of both ground and airborne targets  Called Multi platform Radar Technology Insertion Program  MPRTIP   the technology will provide U S  and coalition forces with a great advantage in fighting the global war on terrorism  The radar is built largely by Norden Systems in Norwalk  Conn   and gaining authorization funding for it is a major achievement for the state s defense industry       In addition  Lieberman supported the general provisions of the bill  one of which would advance the chief of the National Guard to the rank of general and designate him an advisor to the secretary of defense through the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff  in order to give the Guard a greater say in Defense Department planning        Another general provision in the bill provided service members with a 3 5 percent pay raise   one half of one percent more than President Bush requested       Lieberman helped secure funding above the amount the president s budget requested        Authorizations benefiting Sikorsky Aircraft Corp  in Stratford  Conn                   1 326 billion for 42 Black Hawk helicopters  UH 60   An additional seven Black Hawk helicopters are included in the fiscal 2007 supplemental war spending bill                   958 8 million for 27 medium lift Sea Hawk helicopters  MH 60R                    509 7 million for 18 medium lift Navy medical evacuation helicopters  MH 60S                    417 2 million for research and development on the H 53 helicopter       Authorizations benefiting General Dynamics Electric Boat in Groton  Conn                   2 69 billion to build one Virginia class submarine in fiscal 2008                   702 7 million in advance procurement funding for one Virginia class submarine in 2009 and another in 2010  this money will be used to get an early start on components that require a long time to build  thus keeping the overall production on a tight  cost effective schedule                   470 million in advance procurement for a second submarine in 2010  two years ahead of the scheduled date of 2012                   25 million to begin design for a new class of submarine  the Ohio class submarine
