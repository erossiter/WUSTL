                                                      WASHINGTON     The following statement was prepared for delivery by Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Monday at the Committee s 16 th hearing on the inadequate preparation and response to Hurricane Katrina   Thank you Madam Chairman  In today s hearing      Managing Law Enforcement and Communications in a Catastrophe      we examine two issues crucial to an effective response to any disaster     restoring order and maintaining communications   Emergency response will never be successful if our government is unable to deliver on these two essential requirements   The National Response Plan puts the Department of Homeland Security in charge of making sure communications and law enforcement work in an emergency   It is DHS s law enforcement assets  along with Justice Department agencies  that are expected to help maintain public safety and security   Unfortunately  today s hearing will show  DHS was largely unprepared to provide the emergency communications and law enforcement support the Gulf Coast needed after this Hurricane Katrina struck  That s a serious failure   And that failure was part of a larger failure from Jan  6  2005     when the National Response Plan was issued     to Aug  29  when Katrina struck  of the Department of Homeland Security to take steps to activate its role under the NRP and prepare to carry out its responsibilities under the National Response Plan in time of disaster   Its unpreparedness left state  local police  firefighters  search and rescue teams  Red Cross and FEMA volunteers adrift without communications or the public safety support they needed from the federal government   A s early as 2001  in the run up to the Hurricane Pam exercise  southeast Louisiana disaster planners realized that a catastrophic hurricane would  overwhelm  local law enforcement officers just when they were most needed for search and rescue  restoring calm  and providing security for crucial rescue and relief efforts   No Hurricane Pam exercise was devoted to mapping out how the security law enforcement roles would be carried out if local law enforcement was incapacitated by a storm     apparently because of a lack of funds   The portion of the National Response Plan that addresses public safety and security creates a framework for federal law enforcement to assist other federal  state and local authorities during what is labeled an  Incident of National Significance   But under this portion of the plan     designated ESF 13  for Emergency Support Function 13     two agencies  instead of one  are designated as the coordinators     the Department of Homeland Security and the Department of Justice   Evidence gathered by our staff makes clear that in the critical first days     before  during and after Katrina     there was little coordination between the two agencies     and little coordination within the agencies as well   The Homeland Security s department s senior leadership failed to understand it had a leadership role for public safety and  so far  has produced no evidence that anyone was given clear and explicit responsibility to take the lead on public safety for DHS in the days before landfall or in the days immediately afterward the hurricane struck    The responses to these emergency functions that we discussed today  ESF 2  communications   ESF 13  public safety and security   raise troubling questions about who was in charge of the NRP generally Who was making sure that the NRP was being properly activated or implemented    Later this week we will hear from people from FEMA and DHS and  of course  next week we will hear from Secretary Chertoff    The Department of Justice waited to be asked for help and did receive a request from Louisiana on August 30th  the day after Katrina made landfall  But documents show the response was delayed while the Justice Department struggled to answer fundamental questions about its authority under the National Response Plan   This confusion was compounded by lack of cooperation between DOJ and DHS  According to emails obtained from DHS  there appears to have been conflict between the two over who should be in charge of law enforcement in New Orleans   Our exhibits specifically include an e mail dated Sept  4 th that refers to a dispute as to who would take the lead     the FBI  which is under DOJ  or the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency  ICE   which is under DHS   This lack of coordination clearly slowed federal assistance  which could have avoided the breakdown of law and order that had serious consequences on the ground in the desperate and confusing aftermath of Katrina   For example  FEMA Disaster Medical Assistance Teams deployed to the Superdome to assist evacuees with special needs were forced to abandon their posts     and patients     and leave their supplies and equipment behind because the teams grew concerned about security  including rumors that segments of the crowd at the Dome were plotting to stage a riot on the third day after landfall   On the same day     Thursday  Sept  1 st    search and rescue and communications teams were also forced to curtail critical operations in large parts of the stricken city for similar safety reasons   So public safety fears limited the rescue and recovery efforts   Our second panel today deals with communications and the twin problems of inability of first responders to talk to each other     or the ability to talk at all   The heroes of search and rescue efforts in New Orleans testified last week about their inability to communicate with each other  with the victims  and with coordinators at the EOC   Katrina s high winds and subsequent flooding caused what the FCC called  extraordinary  destruction of communications facilities  Almost 3 million telephone lines were knocked down  38 911 call centers were put out of action  more than 1 000 cell towers were left useless and most over the air and cable television service was wiped out   These outages not only made it extremely difficult for hundreds of thousands of victims to get emergency information  or communicate with family and friends  they also crippled the ability of government officials and first responders to coordinate their activities   Some failures were more basic  In earlier hearings  we learned that FEMA s state of the art mobile communication s facility simply was not transported to the Superdome and FEMA s few people on scene were essentially incommunicado  except when they could use cell phones belonging to the Louisiana National Guard   Despite the clear responsibility given to the Department of Homeland Security under the National Response Plan to ensure communications support to federal and state and local response efforts in a disaster  the Department had no plan to provide such emergency support when Katrina struck   While the National Communications System within the Department of Homeland Security engaged in daily contact with the telecommunications industry to help facilitate restoration of landline and cellular systems  it had not contact with state or local governments who were desperately in need of their help to restore communications   The Department was caught off guard by the extensive destruction to local emergency networks  and was even unaware of the extent of the damage for several days   DHS was totally unprepared to move in with mobile systems to provide emergency communications solutions to the police  fire departments  search and rescue teams  and other first responders who were struggling to save lives in the days after landfall   Last week  New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin  Louisiana Governor Kathleen Blanco and Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour each testified that communications failures greatly hampered emergency response efforts and  along with interoperability  is the number one issue that needs to be addressed   This inability to communicate after Katrina serves as a grim reminder that four year after 9 11  our nation was still no where near as prepared for a major disaster as it should have been   Restoring law and order and maintaining communications     both for first responders as well as the stricken population     are crucial missions for the federal government in the immediate aftermath of an American catastrophe     and in the case of Hurricane Katrina  which was an American catastrophe  neither happened   We need to find out why if we are to make sure it never happens again   Thank you Madam Chairman
