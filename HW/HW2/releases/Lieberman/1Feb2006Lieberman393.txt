President to Support Legislation to Reduce America   s Dependence on Foreign Oil                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Senator urges President Bush to take action now                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        WASHINGTON     U S  Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  led Senators Evan Bayh  D IN   Sam Brownback  R KS   Norm Coleman  R MN   and Ken Salazar  D CO   along with Congressmen Jack Kingston  R GA  and Eliot Engel  D NY   in calling on President Bush to follow up on his remarks in last night   s State of the Union Address by supporting their bipartisan legislation to increase America   s energy independence   Last November  the bipartisan coalition introduced the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  which would mandate 2 5 million barrels in oil savings in 10 years and would also encourage the mass production of cars that can burn any combination of gasoline and alternative fuels or  alternatively  cars powered by efficient hybrid engines        In a letter that will be sent to the President today  the members express their support for the President   s call for energy independence and urge him to support their bipartisan legislation as the solution to America   s dependence on foreign oil             Energy independence is a matter of national security and its urgency demands that we take action now     Lieberman said      Last fall a large bipartisan    and bicameral    coalition of Senators and Representatives came together to offer a comprehensive bill that would turn the rhetoric of energy security into reality by saving millions of barrels of oil in just a few years and bringing new fuels and technologies to market within five years   The best way to reach the goals President Bush talked about in his State of the Union is for Congress to enact this legislation and for the President to support it and sign it into law           In addition to reducing the amount of oil used in America  the bill  which has 41 co sponsors in the House and 12 co sponsors in the Senate  would also                     Push for the development and mass marketing of hybrid technologies  including hybrids that give drivers the option to plug them in at night                     Encourage the construction of more alternative fuel pumps at gas stations                    Include  for the first time  fuel efficiency standards for trucks                    Offer standards to ensure fuel efficient replacement tires are offered for cars and trucks                    Provide tax credits for manufacturers to retool facilities for advanced technology and alternative fuel cars and trucks           Editor   s Note  Text of the Letter Attached          February 1  2006       Mr  President        We are writing to you to express our strong support for your call to reduce America   s dependence on foreign oil   As you expressed in your State of the Union speech last night  we must continue to expand our research and development efforts into vehicle and fuel technologies that will be available in the near term   By doing this we will help safeguard our national security  improve American competitiveness and protect our environment        We represent an emerging bi partisan and bi cameral consensus on legislative steps we can take this year to address our dependence on fossil fuels   In November  we introduced The Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  which is focused on two important concepts   First  we must set visionary and achievable goals for reduced oil consumption and measure progress towards these goals as a national priority   Second  the most effective means to achieve these goals is by providing incentives to encourage manufacturers  distributors and consumers to utilize domestic resources to bring to the market a full range of 21st Century vehicles and fuels based on clean  renewable  non oil based technologies    Flexible fuel electric hybrid vehicles that take advantage of fuels such as bio ethanols  methanol  clean bio and coal diesels  and electricity  are here today and can dramatically reduce our oil consumption in the near future   By utilizing the programs authorized in our legislation  we believe that we can achieve crude oil savings of over 2 5 million barrels per day within a decade        This dedicated bi partisan group looks forward to your support as we move our legislation forward to bring these ideas into action this year
