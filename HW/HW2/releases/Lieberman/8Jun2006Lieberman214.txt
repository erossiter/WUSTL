introduced legislation to boost innovative education programs designed to ensure the United States remains the lead in innovation  research and development and the training of scientists and engineers   At an event today hosted by the bipartisan technology advocacy group TechNet  Lieberman accepted the 2006 Founders Circle Award for his past work to promote the growth of America   s innovation economy and explained his National Innovation Education Act  NIEA  to the assembled audience technology leaders          NIEA  which includes several provisions from the National Innovation Act of 2005  proposes education initiatives across the learning spectrum     from pre kindergarten through graduate school    that seek to improve instruction and access to strong and innovative education programs with a particular emphasis in science  technology  engineering and mathematics  STEM  fields           Our new bill authorizes funding to help ensure that high school graduates are prepared to succeed in college  to increase the number of students graduating with degrees in math and science fields and teacher certifications  and provides professional development for current teachers     said Lieberman     Our nation faces many high tech challenges that will span generations     challenges like achieving energy independence and ending global warming   This bill will help ensure that America   s students are prepared to take the lead in solving them           A summary of the bill components is below                       P 16 Commissions   The bill would authorize grants to states to establish Commissions to facilitate elementary and secondary schools collaboration with higher education institutions and the business community   The Commissions will work to help all

longitudinal data systems                      Magnet Schools   The bill would authorize grants for magnet schools that develop innovative educational methods  practices and curricula that promote student achievement in STEM courses                       Experiential Learning   The bill would authorize grants for pilot programs to local education agencies to implement innovation based experiential learning                       Teacher Certification in STEM fields   The bill would authorize grants to higher education institutions to provide integrated courses of study leading to baccalaureate degrees in STEM fields concurrent with teacher certification                      Teacher Professional Development   The bill would authorize teacher professional development institutes to improve teacher quality  particularly in STEM fields  in schools serving low income populations                      Graduate programs in STEM   The bill would authorize NSF to expand the Graduate Research Fellowship Program and the Integrative Graduate Education and Research Trainee program   These programs provide funds to encourage students to pursue post graduate degrees in STEM fields                      Professional science master   s degrees   The bill would award grants to establish new programs and to improve existing programs for professional science master   s degrees   It would also direct NSF to establish a clearinghouse of successful professional science master   s degree program elements                        Tech Talent   The bill would authorize and increases funding for the Tech Talent program which supports innovative higher education programs designed to increase the number of graduates in STEM fields                      Service Science   The bill includes a
