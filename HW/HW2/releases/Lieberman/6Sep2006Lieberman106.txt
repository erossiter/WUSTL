                                                                                                                                                      Thank you  Mr  Chairman  for holding this hearing on the federal government   s renewable fuels programs  The Energy Policy Act   s promotion of renewable fuels is one of the attributes that led me to vote in favor of that law   s passage last year   The Act directs the Energy Department to institute a ten cents per gallon financial incentive for the production of cellulosic biofuel   It authorizes the Department to provide loan guarantees amounting to as much as 80  of the cost of at least one commercial scale cellulosic biomass project   It also authorizes the Department to provide up to  250 million in loans to merchant producers of cellulosic biomass and other approved renewable fuels   It authorizes the Agriculture Department to issue  1 million per year in grants to small businesses for the marketing and certification of bioproducts   And  perhaps most significantly  the Act directs the Environmental Protection Agency to mandate the use of at least 4 billion gallons of renewable fuel in this country this year  and at least 7 5 billion gallons in 2012  In my view  these incentives and mandates in the Energy Policy Act represent a positive and necessary step toward ending this country   s destructive oil addiction and curbing global warming   I am glad to hear  then  that tomorrow EPA Administrator Johnson will sign a proposed rule to implement the Act   s renewable fuels mandate   As warranted and impressive as the Energy Policy Act   s renewable fuels provisions are  however  I believe they amount to only a first step toward ending our oil addiction and dramatically reducing our transportation sector   s contribution to global warming   To carry this country much farther down the road that we need to travel  I joined with Senators Bayh  Brownback  Coleman  and others last November to introduce S  2025  the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act   That bill  which now has the bipartisan support of 28 Senators  would require the executive branch to use means readily at its disposal to save  by 2016  2 5 million barrels per day from projected oil consumption in that year   That is roughly the amount of oil that we currently import from the Middle East   The bill  which I like to call the Set America Free Act  would go on to require 7 million barrels per day in savings by 2026 and 10 million barrels per day in savings by 2031  our current oil consumption is just over 20 million barrels per day     To implement these savings  the Set America Free Act would set rising targets for manufacturers to produce flexible fuel  alternative fuel  hybrid  plug in hybrid  and fuel cell vehicles  institute loan guarantees  grants  and tax credits to promote sales of those vehicles  mandate the development of fuel efficiency standards for heavy duty vehicles  eliminate the current tax break for purchases of heavy SUVs  require the federal government to improve the fuel efficiency of its vehicle fleets  institute a program for increasing the use of fuel saving tires  and institute a series of steps for increasing domestic production of ethanol  Of particular relevance to today   s hearing  the Set America Free Act would increase the ethanol infrastructure tax credit to 50    This is important  because limited ethanol infrastructure is one of the greatest impediments to use of the fuel today   Millions of flexible fuel vehicles designed to use ethanol never see a drop of it simply because it is unavailable at the pump   The Set America Free Act   s tax credits would help change that   The Act would also increase the authorization for cellulosic ethanol incentives to  200 million for five years  and add a near term target of 75 million gallons of cellulosic biomass fuel by 2010  My cosponsors and I were disappointed that Majority Leader Frist blocked our effort to add the Set America Free Act to the Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act in July   We were somewhat encouraged  however  to hear Senator Frist and Energy Committee Chairman Domenici nevertheless praise our bill on the Senate floor   We will continue to advance the Set America Free Act in the next Congress  because the Energy Policy Act   s significant step toward energy security will have been in vain unless we now continue the march toward that goal  Thank you  Mr  Chairman      30
