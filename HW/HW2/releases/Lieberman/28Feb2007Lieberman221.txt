Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Joe Lieberman  ID Conn   and Ranking Member Susan Collins  R Me   took to the floor of the Senate Wednesday for the official opening of debate on S 4  a bill to improve the nation s security against terrorism by fully implementing the 9 11 Commission s recommendations         Every day that we don t act is another day in which we are not as secure here at home as we should be   said Lieberman   This bill would create a strategy to strengthen our homeland security against the threat of terrorist attack and also prepare for and recover from all hazards  whether natural or man made  We ve studied  We ve reflected   And now  with a real sense of urgency  it is time to act to build a safer and more secure nation for the generations to come         This legislation continues the work of Congress and the Senate Homeland Security Committee to strengthen our homeland security in the spirit that shaped the recommendations of the 9 11 Commission   said Senator Collins    Our legislation s broad front attack on the threats we face will ensure good value for every dollar our nation spends to improve our defenses at the federal  state  and local levels  The legislation would ensure significant and predictable funding for our state  local  and tribal governments to help safeguard our lives and properties in all catastrophes  whether natural or manmade   It will provide appropriate transparency and accountability into the federal government s security decisions   And it will strike an appropriate balance between increased security and our cherished civil liberties  The passage of this bill will benefit every American        The bipartisan bill  Improving America s Security Act of 2007  was reported out of HSGAC February 15  2007  on a vote of 16 0  with one abstention  It would provide risk based homeland security grants to states  create a dedicated interoperable communications grants program for first responders  restrict terrorists  ability to enter the United States  and improve information sharing among federal  state  and local officials  It also includes provisions to strengthen the privacy and civil liberties of ordinary Americans as we fight the war on terror        Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid offered a substitute amendment Wednesday morning that combines S  4 with three bills reported out of the Commerce Committee  S  184  the Surface Transportation and Rail Security Act of 2007  S  509  the Aviation Security Improvement Act  and S  385  the Interoperable Emergency Communications Act   and a measure reported out of the Banking Committee  the Public Transportation Terrorism Prevention Act of 2007                         Specific provisions of the HSGAC bill include   Authorization of  3 105 billion for each of the next three years for homeland security grants  which would ensure that grants intended to improve prevention and preparedness for terrorist attacks would be distributed overwhelmingly based on risk  while at the same time bolstering support for all hazards preparedness   Creation and authorization at  3 3 billion over five years of a dedicated interoperable grant program to help state  local and tribal governments build communications systems that allow first responders from different organizations to talk with each other in a disaster    Improving the government s ability to disrupt terrorists  travel and infiltration of the U S  by requiring improvements to the Visa Waiver Program    Strengthening the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board    Establishing a voluntary certification program for private sector preparedness that would provide companies with a clear roadmap for strengthening preparedness  and   Improving counter terrorism information sharing within the federal government and among federal  state and local officials           In 2004  Congress passed and the President signed into law the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act  which enacted the major 9 11 Commission recommendations  including creation of a Director of National Intelligence to forge greater unity of effort among our intelligence agencies and a National Counter Terrorism Center to improve interagency planning to combat terrorism              This bill that we began considering in the Senate today continues the process of securing our nation in this new era where our enemies don t wear the uniforms of soldiers or follow any traditional laws of combat but  rather  move silently among us  probing for weaknesses while plotting attacks on innocent civilians    Lieberman said       30
