                                                         WASHINGTON     Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D CT   and Oversight of Government Management Subcommittee Ranking Member Daniel Akaka  D HI  today expressed serious concerns that the Bush Administration may be inadequately prepared for a potential avian flu pandemic or other public health disaster in the U S   In a letter to Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt the Senators asked for answers to a number of specific questions on U S  preparedness   The letter is below and attached        January 13  2006       Secretary Michael Leavitt      Department of Health and Human Services      200 Independence Avenue  S W       Washington  D C  20201       Dear Secretary Leavitt        As Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services  DHHS  you play a critical role in assessing medical disaster response needs and responding to those needs         Many Americans are concerned by the growing spread of the H5N1 avian influenza virus and I know you share this concern   The virus  which originated in Southeast Asia  has now moved to Mongolia  across to Romania and the EU  and now to Africa   The H5N1 avian flu strain has killed over 60 people  However  the strain with the right mutation can kill millions          Because of the very serious medical response difficulties we witnessed in the preparation for and aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  public concerns about a potential avian flu epidemic must be addressed  Many people are worried that we are inadequately prepared for a potential pandemic and others in the future  The Katrina failures must not be repeated  Therefore  as the Ranking Member of the Senate   s major oversight committee with jurisdiction over government organization  I have compiled a list of questions and request your response as we prepare for a possible flu pandemic        Planning   Coordination       The key to adequate and appropriate medical response is planning   As we examine who is in charge of coordinating national medical response to disasters  it is not clear  The Homeland Security Act of 2002 transferred some command and control and disaster medical assets to the Department of Homeland Security  DHS   but significant public health and programmatic responsibilities  statutory authority  and medical expertise are retained by DHHS  Therefore  we need a clearer idea of how medical response is coordinated and what DHHS is specifically responsible for in the event of a public health event or emergency  including the responsibilities of DHHS under the ESF 8 of the National Response Plan  which gives command and control to DHHS to coordinate public health and medical services regarding national disasters         1   Which agency will be ultimately accountable     DHS or DHHS     for coordinating human medical response in the event of an avian flu epidemic         2  How will DHHS implement public health and medical response plans with command and control and disaster medical assets retained by DHS  How will DHHS implement ESF 8  Which particular person will be in charge at DHHS for a public health event and specifically for ESF 8        3  Please describe what each of the operating divisions of DHHS are doing to prepare for a possible pandemic  including  the Office of Public Health and Emergency Preparedness  OPHEP   Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  CDC   Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA   Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration  SAMHSA   the Surgeon General   s Office  the Food and Drug Administration  FDA   the Indian Health Services  IHS   the National Institutes of Health  NIH   the Administration for Children and Families  ACF   and the Administration on Aging  AoA   What resources  including financial  are being given to each for preparation  What is the operating coordination mechanism to both assure day to day and overall planning coordination between these entities        4  The President   s avian flu plan was recently released  How is DHHS incorporating the President   s plan into its own  What mechanisms are in place to ensure that DHHS and DHS through the National Response Plan  NRP  are communicating and working together fluidly in the event of a pandemic flu         5  How will DHHS provide public health information for different populations with different degrees of exposure and resources in their communities  For instance  if there is an outbreak in New York City  people in Washington DC may panic and try to obtain limited supplies of antivirals that should be reserved for priority groups and those in the immediate vicinity of the outbreak  How will DHHS work with other federal agencies to help people understand their level of risk and take appropriate measures          6  Preventing and preparing for an epidemic are contingent on predicting where disease outbreaks are likely to occur  Wild migratory birds are spreading H5N1  therefore  tracking them internationally has direct implications for disease prevention and preparedness  How is DHHS addressing global wild bird surveillance  Are agencies systematically examining international testing and surveillance data to track viral mutations as H5N1 moves across the globe        Emergency Response        There is increasing attention on our medical system   s current capacity to respond to a pandemic  Numerous questions  such as distributing drugs  medical supplies  and food and water  and supporting healthcare providers flooded with patients require planning prior to the onset of an emergency  However  it is unclear what plans are in place to coordinate these efforts        7  Has a cross agency communications working group been established  as outlined in the DHHS pandemic flu plan  If so  what are the products  to date and in preparation  of the working group and which agencies and officials have been included         8  The DHHS pandemic flu plan states that the    Federal government may mobilize the PHS Commissioned Corps to distribute vaccines or medications    to Federal agencies  states  and localities throughout the National Disaster Medical System  NDMS   How will federally stockpiled vaccines and antivirals be delivered  For example  will already stretched private distribution mechanisms with limited backup supply be used or will untested public distribution mechanisms be used  How will DHHS coordinate with DHS when supply chain  delivery  and labor shortages occur  Have private and public partnerships been explored in this area  and if so  what processes are in place        9  DHHS has outlined priority groups for vaccines and antivirals  Exactly  how will we ensure that people adhere to the priority list  How will public health and medical workers be trained to cope with panicked citizens not in priority groups asking for treatments        10  What specific programmatic supports and funding will hospitals receive to manage people that will be flooding hospitals in the event of a pandemic  Are there estimates for the numbers of health professionals required during a flu pandemic occurring in multiple waves with varying levels of pathogenicity and lethality  Please provide these  How will these individuals be mobilized and transported in urban and rural areas as needed        11  What provisions will be made for individuals that require medical attention for non flu related illnesses  such as diabetes  stroke  or heart disease  What plans are there and how will the government help hospitals implement plans        12  Who in the federal government and in the states will decide when and how to implement human containment measures  such as quarantines  canceling public gatherings  or advising non essential workers to remain at home  How has DHHS been involved  other than through financial assistance  in setting guidelines to support decision making on the state and local levels         Medical Preparedness       It is impossible to predict the nature of any disaster  However  we must be prepared for the contingencies that can be anticipated  We know that hospital surge capacity will be a problem  Hospitals have not systematically trained in disaster preparedness and are not involved in preparedness planning efforts  DHHS will be the lead in mapping out a plan for trauma preparedness  ordering the implementation of the plan  monitoring progress  and responding to emerging needs         13  If there is a pandemic flu outbreak  many health workers may not put themselves at risk or may be unable to work due to early exposure  What communications systems are in place between local hospitals  state agencies  and DHHS to ensure that any outbreak is met with an immediate supply of antivirals and vaccines for priority groups        14  Hospitals are often running to capacity during annual flu seasons  indicating limited surge capacity  Providers and experts have stated that our current medical system is not be equipped to address the health needs of communities due to an influenza pandemic  How many mobile hospital units are being considered to enhance capacity  even though they were not included in the DHHS pandemic flu plan  How will mobile hospital units be staffed given that healthcare workers will remain in hospitals and clinics  How will mobile hospital units be supplied     via private and or public distribution systems  Where would they be established  How will DHS be involved in efforts to set up mobile or temporary units  What role will the US military medical system play         15     Critical product continuity    refers to ensuring that important goods in a time of pandemic  such as syringes  masks  and IV bags  are in supply  Our current stocks of critical medical supplies are insufficient and will require a surge capacity in both manufacturing and transport  Has the private sector been consulted in ensuring the continuous supply of critical products and what plans have resulted from discussions        16  How will medical expenses for the uninsured  beneficiaries of entitlement programs  and other victims of a pandemic be covered  Have mechanisms other than Medicaid been identified for providing coverage   There was no mention in the DHHS pandemic flu plan regarding coverage for non Medicaid populations  Are there estimates for the number of people that may require additional coverage if there is a pandemic in the US         17  The potential for a human pandemic will require significant psychosocial support services to children  families  and communities  Please describe your plans to screen for mental health  related substance abuse  and family support needs  What mechanisms are being considered to provide the requisite services  How will services be reimbursed         18  DHHS has published extensive guidelines for the roles and responsibilities of healthcare and public health providers in the event of a pandemic  Despite the guidelines  many hospitals are not involved in planning efforts to the extent necessary for disasters and pandemics due to lack of funding  Are there plans to reimburse hospitals for preparedness planning or provide other incentives        19  The psychological impact and response of not having sufficient medical solutions or treatments will be significant  People may have panic responses and not be able to accurately assess their level of risk or non medical measures they can take to minimize their risk  People will feel that medication or a    silver bullet    will be their only option to survive successive waves of a pandemic  Specifically  how are communications working groups addressing these issues  What are their plans for public education and outreach        20  Overall  the DHHS plan is detailed and addresses a number of major areas of concern  However  the report is not specific in how states and localities should carry out the recommendations  Many experts have suggested that a single public health and medical response plan and strategy  including for ESF  8   across all 50 states is necessary to successfully fight a pandemic  Are you going to more clearly outline a single strategy  and if so  when will that be available          Avian flu may never strike the United States  but if it does  this country must be prepared   I thank you for your thoughtful consideration of these complex and pressing issues   I would like to work with you coordinating your efforts with those of other agencies and levels of government to ensure the safety of Americans in a worst case disaster scenario       Sincerely         Senator Joseph I  Lieberman   Ranking Member   Committee on Governmental Affairs and Homeland Security   Senator Daniel Akaka   Ranking Member                                                              Subcommittee on Government Management  the Federal workforce and the District of Columbia             30
