Environment and Public Works Committee against the oil industry s gaming of its own decision to switch from MTBE as a backdoor means of raising gas prices in states like Connecticut   Lieberman has been consistently fighting to protect the consumer and break America   s dependence on foreign oil         The Senator recently introduced a bill that would institute a one time 50  tax on windfall profits from oil produced by integrated oil companies in the 2005 tax year  and use the revenue for a energy rebate to low income and middle class families  Last month  as part of a long term strategy to break America s costly dependence on the global oil market  Lieberman also introduced the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  which would mandate 10 million barrels in oil savings in 25 years and would also require the mass production of consumer friendly cars that can burn any combination of gasoline and alternative fuels or  alternatively  cars powered by efficient hybrid engines        The statement is below         Statement as Prepared for Senator Joe Lieberman      EPW Oversight Hearing  Elimination of MTBE      March 29  2006      Washington  DC                   Thank you Mr  Chairman for calling this hearing to review Department of Energy warnings that the oil industry   s abrupt decision to switch from MTBE to ethanol as an oxygenate or octane enhancer could lead another summer of gasoline shortages and high prices                    I support the goal of phasing out MTBE     or methyl tertiary butyl ether     in favor of ethanol  In fact  the bipartisan Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act I have sponsored  along with Sen  Brownback and 10 other Senators  encourages the development ethanol and other renewable fuels as a way of lowering our dependence on foreign oil                    My home state of Connecticut is one of seven states that have already banned the use of MTBE as a gasoline additive because of the dangers it poses to public health and environment as a possible carcinogen leaking into the ground water                    But I fear that the oil industry     already drowning in record profits     will use the sudden switch from MTBE to ethanol as a backdoor means of raising prices if the ethanol industry cannot deliver the quantities needed  as the Energy Information Administration thinks likely  according to its recent report                   The oil industry says it was forced to switch from MTBE to ethanol because Congress did not provide a waiver of liability from damage caused by MTBE when it dropped the oxygenate requirement in the 2005 Energy Policy Act  Unfortunately  we do not have a representative of the oil industry at this hearing today  so we can not explore more fully how they would defend their decisions                      As we consider the actions of the oil industry  we should remember several points   First  the industry chose to use MTBE as an oxygenate to make gasoline burn cleaner in heavily polluted areas          MTBE was the industry   s choice  not a Congressional mandate  and there is no reason to release the industry from liability for a choice it made         As stated succinctly by the representative of the Renewable Fuels Association today     Refiners are not compelled to use MTBE in  Reformulated Gasoline   nor are they compelled to use ethanol once the oxygenate requirement is eliminated   The decision to stop using MTBE is the refiners    alone                       The industry knew the day would come that it would have to phase out MTBE and has had plenty of time to plan for the transition and make sure there were adequate supplies of the ethanol or another alternative                      There is no excuse for unnecessary shortages and discretionary price increases   That  if anything  should be the focus of Congressional investigation   Any resulting price spikes and higher profits should be taxed as an undeserved windfall         Legislation I introduced in December year would impose an excise tax on oil companies for 50 percent of their windfall profits   This one time tax would provide a one time payment to partially offset increased home heating and energy costs  as well as a portion of gasoline cost increases        Thank you Mr  Chairman        30
