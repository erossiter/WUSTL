Water State Revolving Funds  SRF   two critical clean water programs   In a letter to Senator Judd Gregg  Chairman  and Senator Kent Conrad  Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  the Senators requested restoring Clean Water SRF to at least the fiscal year 2004 level of  1 35 billion and maintaining Drinking Water SRF at  850 million for the FY 2006 budget            The proposed cuts would have a devastating impact on the ability of our states and communities to continue upgrading their wastewater infrastructure and meeting Clean Water Act requirements     the letter said     Despite important progress over the last three decades  EPA reports that 40 percent of our nation s waters are still too impaired for fishing or swimming           The full text of the letter is below

Gregg and Ranking Member Conrad        As you prepare the fiscal year 2006 budget resolution  we urge you to restore funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Funds  SRF  to at least the fiscal year 2004 level of  1 35 billion   The proposed cuts would have a devastating impact on the ability of our states and communities to continue upgrading their wastewater infrastructure and meeting Clean Water Act requirements  the attached table shows the state by state impacts   We urge you to support the President   s request for  850 million for the Drinking Water State Revolving Funds  which help communities ensure safe drinking water        Despite important progress over the last three decades  EPA reports that 40 percent of our nation s waters are still too impaired for fishing or swimming   Discharges from aging and failing sewerage systems  urban storm water and other sources continue to pose serious threats to our nation s lakes  rivers and estuaries  endangering not only public health but fishing and recreation industries  Population growth and development are placing additional stress on the nation   s water infrastructure and its ability to sustain hard won water quality gains          The President   s budget proposes to cut the Clean Water SRF by more than 33 percent  which will exacerbate the current spending gap to address water infrastructure  In May 2002  the Congressional Budget Office released a report that estimated the spending gap for Clean Water needs between  132 billion and  388 billion over 20 years and the spending gap for drinking water needs at between  70 billion and  362 billion over 20 years  In September 2002  the EPA released a Clean Water and Drinking Water Infrastructure Gap Analysis  which found that there will be a  535 billion gap between current spending and projected needs for water and wastewater infrastructure by 2019 if additional investments are not made   In fiscal years 2004 and 2005  the Senate Budget Resolution supported  3 2 billion for the Clean Water SRF and  2 billion for the Drinking Water SRF in order to address this financial need for infrastructure projects        The federal government must sustain a strong partnership with states and local governments to avert this massive projected funding gap and share in the burden of maintaining and improving the nation   s water infrastructure  We urge you to restore funding for the Clean Water SRF to  1 35 billion and maintain funding for the Drinking Water SRF at  850 million as an absolute minimum level for protecting the safety of our water
