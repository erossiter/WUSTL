Privacy Laws While Testing Passenger Prescreening System

Privacy Act       Washington  DC   Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  today criticized the Transportation Security Administration  TSA  for failing to meet basic Privacy Act requirements in carrying out testing of the Secure Flight program  which is an airline passenger prescreening system aimed at identifying known or suspected terrorists   The Senators wrote a letter to Department of Homeland Security  DHS  Secretary Michael Chertoff to express their concern about the way TSA has administered the program to date  and urged that he pay careful attention to the program as it goes forward   TSA is the agency under DHS that is responsible for creating a prescreening system to check airline passengers    names against terrorist watch lists   Senator Collins is the Chairman and Senator Lieberman is the Ranking Member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  which has oversight of DHS       The Government Accountability Office  GAO  today released findings that during TSA   s testing of the Secure Flight program it violated passengers    privacy rights when it    collected and stored commercial data records even though TSA stated in its privacy notices that it would not do so           We understand that  in response to GAO   s assertions  TSA took corrective actions to inform the public of its actual test protocols through updated Privacy Notices   However  that action does not excuse TSA   s failure to meet basic Privacy Act requirements in carrying out this program     wrote Senators Collins and Lieberman      Given fundamental concerns surrounding the government   s use of personal information and the unfortunate history of TSA   s passenger prescreening program  careless missteps such as this jeopardize the public trust and DHS    ability to deploy a much needed  new system          The following is the full text of the letter       Dear Secretary Chertoff       Today  the Government Accountability Office  GAO  released its findings on the Transportation Security Administration   s  TSA  Secure Flight Test Records privacy notices   We are writing to express our concerns over these findings and our continued interest in deployment of a more effective passenger prescreening system that incorporates privacy principles       In a letter to Congressional requesters  GAO stated that TSA failed to comply fully with the Privacy Act when it    collected and stored commercial data records even though TSA stated in its privacy notices that it would not do so      The GAO further described how a TSA contractor obtained more than 100 million records from commercial data aggregators  and supplemented passenger name records  PNR  obtained from airlines with personal information contained in the commercial data  though TSA    did not identify  in its privacy notices  its plans to supplement PNR data with commercial data      The GAO also noted that TSA   s initial privacy notices    did not fully inform the public of    1  the subjects of data collection   2  the types of personal data to be collected   3  the full purpose of collecting the data   4  policies and practices regarding storage and maintenance of the data  and  5  how those subject to having data collected could access and amend their data            As the GAO explains in its letter report  the Privacy Act  which is based on internationally recognized fair information practices  is intended to allow citizens    to learn how their personal information is collected  maintained  used and disseminated by the federal government      We understand that  in response to GAO   s assertions  TSA took corrective actions to inform the public of its actual test protocols through updated Privacy Notices   However  that action does not excuse TSA   s failure to meet basic Privacy Act requirements in carrying out this program       We urge your continued attention to this important program  and we commend GAO for its efforts   Given fundamental concerns surrounding the government   s use of personal information and the unfortunate history of TSA   s passenger prescreening program  careless missteps such as this jeopardize the public trust and DHS    ability to deploy a much needed  new system       30
