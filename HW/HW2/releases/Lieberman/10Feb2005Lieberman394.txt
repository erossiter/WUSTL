nationwide open meetings       WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today joined Senator John McCain  R AZ  to reintroduce the Climate Stewardship Act in the 109th Congress   The Senators announced plans to begin a nationwide    listening tour    to hear from Americans across the country about the real effects that the warming climate is having on their lives and environment           When John and I began this battle we were facing our concern about the impact of global warming on the planet on scientific models and we were projecting what we thought might happen  That period is over     Lieberman said      Today  we can see with our own eyes what global warming is doing   In that context it becomes truly irresponsible  if not immoral  for us not to do something           According to a United Nations study  every ton of greenhouse gas emitted into the atmosphere costs each American up to  160   and the United States is currently emitting billions of tons each year  Property lost to rising sea levels  cropland lost to drought  and revenues lost to dwindling fishing stocks caused by global warming also represent real costs   not to mention the immeasurable damage to Americans    health and quality of living  According to a recent Zogby poll  75  of 1 200 citizens polled supported requiring major industries to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions  with more than 70  support in each region of the nation         The Climate Stewardship Act  crafted in close consultation with industry leaders and supported by the environmental community  is modeled after the successful acid rain trading program of the 1990 Clean Air Act  It would require a reduction in carbon dioxide emission levels to 2000 levels by the year 2010 by capping the overall greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity generation  transportation  industrial  and commercial economic sectors  and creating a market for individual companies to trade pollution credits         Despite strong support in the Senate  the Climate Stewardship Act fell short in a vote in October 2003 on the Senate floor  Lieberman pledged to bring the bill up for another vote in the Senate this year  and they remain optimistic that they will improve upon the 44 Senators who supported their bill in the last vote   To ramp up action on the bill  Lieberman announced that he and McCain will take their case to Americans across the country through a series of open meetings           If we are going to get the politics to catch up with the science we have got to engage the American people more     Lieberman said      Senator McCain and I intend to conduct a series of open meetings throughout America on the subject of global warming   We will ask people to ask themselves whether they will have the water available to grow their communities and their businesses  whether our croplands will yield adequate food  whether our coastal communities will remain above water  whether new diseases will emerge  and of course whether there will be enough snow left to hit the ski slopes if we do not take action to curb greenhouse gases           A study by MIT estimated that the Climate Stewardship Act would cost approximately  20 per household  and analysts predict that the impact on U S  GNP would be no more than  01   A second study by the Tellus Institute predicted that the Climate Stewardship Act would save Americans  48 billion in net savings by 2020 due to reduced energy demand  And according to a new study released today by the Natural Resources Defense Council the Climate Stewardship Act would add more than 800 000 new jobs in America by 2025        The legislation has the support of a bipartisan group of 155 mayors across the country  the National Farmers Union  23 senior climate economists  and the ski industry  the leading insurance underwriter in North America  and an industry coalition that includes corporations such as Maytag have all expressed their support for the bill        Representatives Wayne Gilchrest  R MD  and John Olver  D MA   lead sponsors of the House version of the legislation  joined Lieberman and McCain at a press conference today to announce re introduction of both the House and Senate versions of the legislation   Several of the Senate and House original co sponsors  including Senator Olympia Snowe  R ME   joined the sponsors at the event
