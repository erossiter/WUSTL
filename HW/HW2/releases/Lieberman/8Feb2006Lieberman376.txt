today criticized President Bush   s Fiscal Year 2007 budget for making deep cuts in critical transportation and energy assistance programs in Connecticut   Among the programs hardest hit by the White House spending plan are Amtrak and the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP         The Administration   s FY 2007 budget requests  900 million for Amtrak  nearly a 30 percent cut from the funding provided by Congress last year and far short of what is needed to fully fund basic operating costs and capital improvements for the rail line   Under the Administration   s proposal  Amtrak would be forced to use  500 million for capital improvements  and the remaining  400 million is to be doled out by the Department of Transportation in discretionary grants to Amtrak  rather than being provided to Amtrak for basic operating costs   Last year  President Bush   s budget proposal did not include any funding for Amtrak   However  Congress stepped in and allocated  1 3 billion for the railroad in the FY 2006 Transportation and Housing and Urban Development  THUD  Appropriations bill             Amtrak is a critical mode of transportation in Connecticut and throughout the Northeast     Lieberman said      By failing to provide enough funding  the Bush Administration is jeopardizing the railroad   s ability to maintain its current schedule  including its operations in Connecticut and along the Northeast Corridor  forcing thousands of cars each day onto Connecticut   s already congested highways           The White House is proposing a nearly 20  cut in LIHEAP funding over and a 32  reduction in the Weatherization Assistance Program  WAP   which enables low income families to permanently reduce their energy bills by making their homes more energy efficient   This comes at a time when  in its latest short term energy cost outlook  the U S  Energy Information Administration has predicted that Americans will pay an average of 35 percent more for natural gas this winter  23 percent more for fuel oil and 17 percent more for propane             Across the board  the President   s budget has wrongly cut funding or under funded critical federal programs to help hard working Americans and our nation   s neediest citizens while renewing his plan to make permanent his tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans     said Lieberman      Programs like LIHEAP are needed now more than ever to help low income families afford the record high cost of heating their homes  and they should not fall victim to President Bush   s misguided priorities           Lieberman also blasted the President   s budget for once again using his budget to call for the opening up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge  ANWR  for drilling  while actually cutting funding for vehicle technologies  which includes development of plug in hybrid electric vehicles  by 9   despite his promise in last week   s State of the Union address to break America   s dependence on foreign oil            While President Bush is promising the American people he will break America   s addiction to foreign oil  his budget provides more disturbing evidence that his Administration is merely paying lip service to the problem     Lieberman said     The White House is using the budget to repeat its past failed efforts to drill in ANWR  I urge the White House and Congress to stop trying to drill our way out of this problem and instead work together to innovate our way to energy independence            Last year  Lieberman led a bi partisan group of 10 Senators who introduced the Vehicle and Fuel Choices for American Security Act  which would mandate 10 million barrels in oil savings in 25 years and would also require the mass production of cars that can burn any combination of gasoline and alternative fuels or  alternatively  cars powered by efficient hybrid engines            30
