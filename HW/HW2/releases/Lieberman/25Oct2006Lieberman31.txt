Required       WASHINGTON   Connecticut s two U S  Senators and two of its members of the House of Representatives Wednesday asked Federal Emergency Management Agency Director David Paulison to reevaluate the agency s denial of disaster assistance for Waterbury  Conn                   Senators Chris Dodd  D Conn   and Joe Lieberman  D Conn   and Representatives Nancy Johnson  R Conn   and Rosa Delauro  D Conn    in a letter to Paulison dated October 23  2006   pointed out that the city had provided additional documentation regarding damage to the city following a severe storm June 2  2006  Furthermore  the four Members of Congress  all of whom represent Waterbury  argued that FEMA s own regulations appear to warrant disaster assistance to the city                    The June 2 storm had a devastating financial impact on the City of Waterbury   damaging critical facilities including its sewage system and aspects of its transportation system   the letter said   The declaration is supported under FEMA s regulations and we strongly support Governor Rell s request                      Following is full text of the letter        October 25  2006       The Honorable R  David Paulison      Director      Federal Emergency Management Agency      500 C Street  S W       Washington  DC  20472       Dear Director Paulison        We are writing in support of Governor Rell s appeal of FEMA s rejection of her July 27  2006 request for a major disaster declaration    FEMA denied the State of Connecticut s request for a major disaster declaration for severe damage  particularly to the City of Waterbury  from heavy rains and flash flooding on June 2  2006         Since Governor Rell initially sought the declaration  the State of Connecticut and the City of Waterbury have obtained additional evidence detailing the storm damage  and in her appeal Governor Rell has requested a new inspection of the damages   Some of this evidence includes additional documentation regarding damage to the City of Waterbury s sewage system and bids the City of Waterbury has obtained for repairing storm damage   We support Governor Rell s request for a new inspection which we believe will support the City of Waterbury s total damages more accurately            In addition  despite FEMA s initial denial decision  a disaster declaration appears to be warranted under its own regulations   FEMA s staff stated that Connecticut s request for a declaration was denied because the eligible damages did not reach the statewide or countywide threshold for damages   However  although FEMA s public assistance disaster aid regulations require an evaluation of statewide damages  where the statewide threshold is not met  FEMA must evaluate the localized impacts of the damages   44 CFR 206 48   Specifically  the regulations state that FEMA will            evaluate the impact of the disaster at the county and local government level       because at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met  This is particularly true where critical facilities are involved or where localized per capita impacts might be extremely high   For example  we have at times seen localized damages in the tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita though the statewide per capita impact was low        44 CFR 206 48 a  2   emphasis added          Although Connecticut has  county  boundaries  these boundaries lack any real or legal significance because  as recognized by the U S  Census Bureau in its Government Finance and Employment Classification Manual  Connecticut has no  county government    Because Connecticut has no  county government   FEMA must look at the impact of the disaster at the  local government  level   In this instance  the City of Waterbury bears the burden of the damages from the flooding because there is no  county government  to help absorb the repair costs   Thus  the relevant factor is the per capita damages per Waterbury resident  not per New Haven County resident  1           FEMA staff has also indicated that even if FEMA considered the amount of damages per capita of Waterbury residents  it would not recommend a declaration because the damages in Connecticut do not come close enough to meeting the required threshold for statewide damages   However  this interpretation again incorrectly applies FEMA s regulations   The regulations say nothing about granting a declaration based on localized damages where the statewide damages per capita is close to being met   Instead  the regulations simply state that  We evaluate the impact of the disaster at the county and local government level     because at times there are extraordinary concentrations of damages that might warrant Federal assistance even if the statewide per capita is not met    44 CFR 206 48 a  2   emphasis added          We respectfully request that FEMA reinspect and reevaluate the damages caused by the June 2  2006 flooding in light of the additional evidence obtained by the State of Connecticut and the City of Waterbury and correctly apply FEMA s regulations to the damage estimate as outlined above   The June 2nd storm had a devastating financial impact on the City of Waterbury   damaging critical facilities including its sewage system and aspects of its transportation system   The declaration is supported under FEMA s regulations  and we strongly support Governor Rell s request and thank you for your attention to this matter        Sincerely      CHRISTOPHER J  DODD  United States Senator JOSEPH I  LIEBERMAN  United States Senator  NANCY L  JOHNSON    Memeber of Congress ROSA L  DELAURO  Member of Congress    1  Although a new inspection will determine the estimation of damages  even under the estimates used in the original request  the damages per capita for Waterbury residents are quite high   According to the Governor s original request for a declaration  damages to the State were estimated at  2 249 209  and of this damage  FEMA had verified  1 348 205 in eligible damages in Waterbury alone   The City of Waterbury disagrees with FEMA s estimate of Waterbury damages  as its engineers have estimated eligible damages in Waterbury at  4 4 million   Under the City of Waterbury s  4 4 million damage assessment  the cost would be  41 per Waterbury resident   Under the  1 3 million estimation of damages FEMA had verified before Governor Rell filed the appeal  the cost would be  12 57 per Waterbury resident   Thus  even under FEMA s original estimate  the localized damages to Waterbury residents are in the  tens  of dollars of damage   This amount falls squarely into the example of  extremely high impact    where the localized damages are in the  tens or even hundreds of dollars per capita    in FEMA s regulations   44 CFR 206 48 a  2    Because this damage estimate falls into the range given in the example in FEMA s regulations  the major disaster declaration is warranted   Indeed  the per capita damages under FEMA s original disputed estimate is more than ten times FEMA s statewide threshold and more than four times FEMA s countywide threshold         30
