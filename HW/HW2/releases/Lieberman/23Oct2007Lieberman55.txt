Lieberman  ID Conn  and Ranking Member Susan Collins R Me   along with Chairman of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery  Senator Mary Landrieu D La   Monday responded to the proposed National Response Framework  NRF  being prepared by the Department of Homeland Security  In a letter to DHS Secretary Michael Chertoff  the lawmakers thanked the Department for working toward the Committee s recommendation to make the National Response Plan clearer and more accessible to users  But they also raised questions about whether DHS is properly implementing the Post Katrina Emergency Management Act of 2006  the lack of a clear chain of command  and the process by which the NRF was developed  Additionally the Senators stressed that the NRF does not replace the need for proper operational plans      Following is the letter        The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary  Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC  20528   Dear Secretary Chertoff     As the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs  Committee  and as the Chairman of the Ad Hoc Subcommittee on Disaster Recovery  we are writing to provide comments on the draft National Response Framework  NRF    We ask that our letter be treated as a response to the request for comments in FEMA Docket ID 2007 07  72 Fed  Reg  51833  September 11  2007   and included as part of the public record in that matter   While we support the Department of Homeland Security s  Department or DHS  efforts to enumerate preparedness planning and guidelines  we would like to raise some concerns  and in some cases pose questions  about the draft NRF  especially as it relates to implementing key provisions in the  Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006   the  Homeland Security Act of 2002   and other authorities   These comments are limited to the base framework itself and do not address the accompanying emergency support functions and annexes       In investigating the failed response to Hurricane Katrina  the Committee found that the Department  and especially the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   was unprepared for a catastrophic event   In addition to a lack of basic capabilities and resources at FEMA  the Committee found key failures in other parts of the Department  such as its hesitant  inaccurate  and inconsistent implementation of the National Response Plan  NRP  and the lack of effective communication between the Secretary of Homeland Security and the then Director of FEMA   The Committee recommended replacing FEMA with a new  stronger  more robust Federal response agency   In September 2006  Congress passed the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006   the Act    which President Bush signed into law in October 2006                 The Act  which implemented many of the recommendations from the Committee s investigation  creates a new FEMA   with responsibilities  missions  capabilities  and resources far exceeding those of FEMA at the time of Hurricane Katrina   by vesting greater autonomy and elevating the status of FEMA and its leaders within the Department   Among other things  unlike its predecessor  the new FEMA is    1  a distinct entity within DHS  with protections similar to those afforded the U S  Coast Guard   2  focused on all hazards preparedness  protection  mitigation  response  and recovery  and  3  responsible for the entire cycle of emergency management  including the management of close to  2 billion in grants to help State and local officials and first responders prepare for terrorist attacks and natural disasters                  In debating the Act  Congress decided to strengthen FEMA within the Department of Homeland Security in recognition of the fact that the kinds of catastrophic disasters the nation must prepare for requires resources far beyond what FEMA can effectively marshal standing alone   The Act s goal is to better enable FEMA to coordinate effectively the substantial response resources in other components within the Department  such as the Coast Guard  as well as to enable FEMA to be more effective in coordinating the response assets of the rest of the Federal government   However  even though FEMA by most accounts has made important progress since Hurricane Katrina  the draft NRF raises several important questions about whether the Act is being properly implemented      Framework no substitute for operational plans                 Effective planning for disasters   both large and small   is essential   Indeed  planning experts consider the process of making and updating such plans to be as important as  if not more than  the final product   Planning for a national response is particularly difficult  given the significant challenges in coordinating the responses of Federal  State  and local governments  the private sector  and nongovernmental entities   In the final analysis  an effective response requires well exercised plans that clearly enumerate roles and responsibilities at all levels of government   Unfortunately  we are not convinced that the draft NRF meets this requirement       In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina  the Committee identified several problems with the NRP and its execution  including ambiguities in areas such as the roles and responsibilities of response participants   For example  the Committee found that the roles and responsibilities of the Principal Federal Official  PFO  and the Federal Coordinating Officer  FCO  overlapped and caused considerable confusion   As a consequence  the Committee s report recommended that the Department revise the NRP to make it clearer and more accessible to users   The draft NRF is in many respects more streamlined than the NRP  uses far less jargon and fewer acronyms  and is an overall more user friendly document   We are pleased that the Department worked towards meeting this recommendation        We understand and appreciate the fact that DHS s intention with the draft NRF was explicitly not to create a plan  but instead to create a document addressed to senior elected and appointed leaders and to  inform  emergency management practitioners   The inadequate response to Hurricane Katrina clearly demonstrated the importance of educating elected officials at all levels about disaster response   However  over six years since the terrorist attacks of September 11 and over two years since Hurricane Katrina  we still do not have sufficient operational plans for governing the response to disasters   As Hurricane Katrina demonstrated  operational plans  properly exercised  are needed to support the NRP   The continuing lack of such plans is a serious gap in our homeland security   The draft NRF emphasizes how far away we are from accomplishing this admittedly complex and ongoing  but also critically important  task   Consequently  we would like to know when you expect the operational plans required by the Act to be completed  how many staff FEMA has devoted to this task  and whether or not FEMA s new authorities are considered sufficient to get the job done       Role of FEMA and the FEMA Administrator     The Committee s investigation into Hurricane Katrina found that FEMA did not have sufficient authorities and resources with which to lead DHS  other Federal agencies  State and local governments  and the private sector in effectively responding to a catastrophic event    Consequently  the Act gave FEMA and its Administrator elevated and expanded roles in leading the nation s efforts to prepare for  protect against  respond to  recover from  and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters  acts of terrorism  and other man made disasters   It made the FEMA Administrator an Executive Level II official  equivalent to the level of Deputy Secretary  and the principal advisor to the President  the Homeland Security Council  and the Secretary of Homeland Security on emergency management   It also gave the President the authority to make the FEMA Administrator a cabinet member during disasters   These changes are designed to ensure that FEMA has the political authority and clout to direct and coordinate the appropriate personnel and resources within DHS  which are substantial  and to coordinate across the Federal government when needed      The draft NRF  however  fails to recognize this expanded and elevated role of FEMA and its Administrator   In the Roles and Responsibilities chapter  the draft Framework fails to even refer to either FEMA or its Administrator   Rather  as drafted  the NRF suggests that the Department has delegated key leadership and coordination responsibilities to individuals or entities other than FEMA or its Administrator   The draft NRF states correctly that the Secretary is the PFO for domestic incident management   However  the Secretary s authorities must be exercised and delegated in compliance with the Homeland Security Act  which provides the authorities to lead our nation s efforts to prepare for  protect against  respond to  recover from  and mitigate against the risk of natural disasters and man made events to the Administrator of FEMA       Interestingly  what we understand to be the last discussion draft NRF circulated to key stakeholders states  correctly  that the FEMA Administrator is the principle advisor to the President  Homeland Security Council  and the Secretary of Homeland Security for all matters relating to emergency management  for whatever reason  the Department deleted this language from the draft released for public comment       Contrary to Congress  clear intent in the Act  the draft NRF states only that the FEMA Administrator is the Secretary s principal advisor for  all matters related to emergency management    It notes that the role of the Secretary of Homeland Security  is to provide the President with an overall architecture for emergency response and to coordinate the Federal response    It points out the roles of the Homeland Security Council and the National Security Council   However  the draft NRF provides little information on the FEMA Administrator s responsibilities and duties  and fails to acknowledge the potential for the FEMA Administrator being made a member of the President s cabinet during a disaster   The final NRF must explain clearly the role of the FEMA Administrator as defined in the Act  as well as the Administrator s responsibilities with respect to authorities delegated to the Secretary in the Homeland Security      To further confuse matters  the draft NRF also states that the Department s Director of Operations Coordination shall serve as the Secretary s  principal advisor  for the overall Departmental level of integration of  incident management operations     Neither the draft NRF  nor subsequent briefings provided to Committee staff  however  has clarified sufficiently how  emergency management  differs from  incident management    This lack of clarity raises concerns that the draft NRF conflicts with provisions in the Act which make the FEMA Administrator the lead in preparing for and responding to disasters  regardless of their cause      Similarly  according to the draft NRF  FEMA s National Response Coordination Center  NRCC  will serve as FEMA s primary operations management center for most  but not all  national incidents   Indeed  the draft NRF suggests that parts of the National Operations Center  NOC  other than the NRCC  such as the 24 7 Watch and the Incident Management Planning Team  IMPT   will perform primary operations management for some incidents  The draft NRF  however  does not make clear for which incidents the NRCC or other parts of the NOC will be responsible   Moreover  the draft NRF states that other parts of the NOC will be involved in incident planning and management during disasters   but  again  it fails to specify the respective roles of the NRCC and the other parts of the NOC       Given the severe consequences that can result when roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined  the final NRF must clarify these ambiguities consistent with the Act  including the role of the FEMA Administrator  the difference between  emergency management  and  incident management   and the respective roles and responsibilities of the NRCC and other parts of the NOC        Finally  the Committee s Hurricane Katrina investigation found that taking FEMA out of DHS would be a mistake  for  among other reasons  that it made no sense to have one agency responsible for the preparedness for and response to terrorists attacks and another agency responsible for the same activities for natural disasters  as many of the steps in preparedness and response are the same   The Committee concluded that the nation cannot afford the inefficiencies  duplication of effort and confusion of State and local officials  who would be forced to engage one system for natural disasters and another one for terrorist attacks   That is why the Act explicitly mandated that the Department must pursue a genuine all hazards approach to preparedness and response   The draft NRF could be construed as separating natural disasters  where FEMA has the lead  from acts of terrorism and other man made disasters  where the Department s Director of Operations has the lead   Does this apparent construct put us on the path to implementing the same sort of potential inefficiencies  duplication of effort  and confusion that the Committee identified during its Hurricane Katrina investigation       Federal Coordinating Officer and Principal Federal Official     The draft NRF also fails to clarify the respective roles and responsibilities of the FCO and the PFO   As documented by every review of the response to Hurricane Katrina  confusion about the roles of the FCO and PFO contributed greatly to the failed response at all levels of government   To address this serious problem  the Act required the FEMA Administrator to ensure that the NRP  or its successor document  provide for a clear chain of command consistent with the Administrator being the principal Federal advisor on emergency management   The Act also narrowly circumscribes the role of the PFO   Indeed  the Act clearly prohibits the PFO from directing or replacing the incident command and exercising directional authority over the FCO or other Federal and State officials during a disaster                 The draft NRF  however  describes the PFO as  the lead Federal official in the field  during an incident and states that the PFO will coordinate the activities of other Federal officials involved in the response and serve as the primary representative with whom State and local officials interface   The draft NRF does state  as required by the Act  that the PFO will not direct or replace the incident command structure established at an incident   Additionally  the draft NRF states that the PFO does not have  line authority  over the FCO  Senior Federal Law Enforcement Official  a Department of Defense Joint Task Force Commander  or any State or local official       Nevertheless  it is clear from our own observations  and from the comments of emergency managers who have reviewed the draft  that the potential for confusion and conflict between Federal officials involved in the response outlined in the NRF has not been resolved by these distinctions   For example  the draft NRF does not require that the PFO report to the FEMA Administrator or even keep the FEMA Administrator informed of his or her activities   Contrary to the lessons of Hurricane Katrina  the draft NRF appears to create two separate chains of command   one running from the FCO to the FEMA Administrator  and another running from the PFO to the Secretary   The draft NRF does not clearly specify which responsibilities lay with the FCO and which responsibilities lay with the PFO   While the Act specified that the PFO not have directive authority over Federal officials  the Department omitted that directive from the draft NRF   The draft NRF appears to give the PFO an expansive and operational like role  instead of the more limited role envisioned by the Act   In contrast  language in what we understand to be the last discussion draft distributed to key stakeholders was much clearer and seemed to follow the requirements of the Act       As you know  Congress  desire for clarity on this issue has prompted language in the House FY 2008 Department of Homeland Security Appropriations bill that would simply not allow DHS to fund the PFO position   While we share the frustration of members who support defunding  we have not expressed support for that effort thus far  because it could unnecessarily tie the Department s hands   However  it is essential that the final NRF demonstrates that the lessons from Hurricane Katrina have been learned in this area   Continued confusion is not an option        Preparedness and Response     The Committee s investigation found that the misalignment between the way the Department went about preparing for disasters and the way it  primarily through the previous incarnation of FEMA  directed the response greatly hampered the government s response       There are many ways that preparedness directly affects response   though few are as important as planning   The draft NRF states that operational planners from multiple agencies have been assigned to the IMPT   an interagency group managed by the Department s Director of Operations Coordination   to develop strategic guidance and plans for the 15 National Planning Scenarios   The draft NRF assigns FEMA the responsibility to conduct operational planning to support these strategic plans      This construct raises important issues that the Department must clarify in the final NRF   what is FEMA s role with respect to the strategic guidance and plans being developed by the IMPT  and how does the draft NRF ensure that those strategic plans will be consistent with FEMA s operational plans   Perhaps more importantly  how does this construct ensure that the Department does not repeat the same mistakes it made prior to Hurricane Katrina when it split preparedness from response       Process                   The Act gives FEMA the responsibility for maintaining  and periodically reviewing and revising  the NRP and successors thereto   It also provides that  in doing so  the FEMA Administrator shall act in consultation with the National Advisory Council  NAC   an advisory body made up of representatives of State  local  tribal  private and nongovernmental entities   The Act envisions the NRP as a collaborative  national effort  led by FEMA                 In some respects  the process by which the revision of the NRP was undertaken was exemplary   In others respects  however  it was troublesome   We are disappointed  for example  that the NAC   which was designed to ensure an effective State  local  and first responder voice in the process and which was required by the Act to be established by December 2006   is to meet for the first time only today  and therefore was not a part of the NRF development process   We were also surprised to learn that the steering committee that led the initial drafting process was chaired not by FEMA alone but jointly with the Preparedness Directorate  parts of which the Department renamed on April 1  2007 as the National Protection and Programs Directorate  NPPD      Despite these issues  the NRP revision process appears to have started off well   Beginning in December 2006  the Department convened a steering committee composed of representatives from emergency management  the fire service  law enforcement  and other key stakeholders to provide input on rewriting of the NRP   According to key stakeholders  the steering committee frequently consulted them  and they actively participated in various NRP working groups       Around March 2007  however  FEMA and NPPD suspended the steering committee process and submitted a revised NRP to the Department s senior leadership for approval   In April 2007  the Department notified steering committee members that it needed additional time to consider all of the input that it received from other Federal Departments and agencies   The Department received approximately 800 agency comments     At this point  the revision process appears to have been limited to a small number of individuals within DHS headquarters and FEMA leadership   Although we appreciate that the Department is now providing the current draft NRF for public comment  the nontransparency of that earlier stage clearly was a source of dismay for some of the stakeholders that had been actively participating in the rewriting process up until that time   In addition  there were significant delays at this stage   While the Act did not require FEMA to revise the NRP by a particular date  the Department itself repeatedly announced that it would issue a revised NRP by the beginning of hurricane season on June 1  2007   The beginning of hurricane season passed  however  without a new NRP   In September 2007  the Department finally released a draft revised version of the NRP  re named the NRF  for comment     Perhaps of greatest concern  the version of the NRF that was released after this extended leadership review inexplicably appears to have eliminated  in some cases  important clarifications that had been incorporated in earlier drafts   Specifically  as noted above  the explanations of the role of the FEMA Administrator and of the respective roles of the PFO and FCO  appear to have been clearer and more comprehensive in what we understand to be the last discussion draft NRF circulated to key stakeholders     In closing  we would like to encourage you to work closely with government officials and first responders as you move forward in revising the draft NRF and developing operational plans     As we are sure you realize  a very large part of the value of a response plan is found in the process of actually doing the planning   Additionally  since State and local governments have a lead role in disaster response  it is imperative that the Federal government work hand in hand with State and local governments in planning       We look forward to working with you to finalize the NRF and to your responses to the questions raised by our comments     Sincerely      Joseph I
