                                                                                                                                                     This commencement season  thousands of foreign born students will be handed American diplomas     and then will be told to pack their bags and leave the country  That is bad news for America s economic growth       It s not that our economy lacks room for these talented graduates  U S  employers  facing critical skilled worker shortages  are eager to hire them  But the cap for skilled worker visas was exhausted in April  before members of the class of 2007 received the degrees required to apply       In effect  the visa program encourages a brain drain  sending graduates     and their world class educations     back to their home countries to compete against U S  businesses      Gone Quickly   Recent graduates are hardly the only foreign born professionals this outdated system keeps off our shores  Demand for the skilled worker visa  known as the H 1B  was so high this year that the government received 133 000 applications     more than double the annual 65 000 allowance     on the very first day applications were accepted  Even as the economy has changed dramatically over the past 17 years  the skilled worker visa cap is stuck at its 1990 level        We must ensure that our immigration policy responds to labor market realities  And that is why I am pleased that the comprehensive immigration reform bill now before the Senate would raise the annual H 1B cap from 65 000 to 115 000 and provide for a market based adjustment so that the cap can climb as high as 180 000  depending on economic needs       But while this plan is a vast improvement over the status quo  it falls short because it fails to exempt from the cap the foreign born professionals we need most        When the Senate resumes debating comprehensive immigration reform this week  I will fight to exempt from the cap foreign nationals holding a U S  graduate degree in any field  a non U S  graduate degree in science  technology  engineering or math  or medical specialty certification based on U S  training  Taken together  these reforms would deliver much needed relief     and vital human capital     to our innovative industries       The high tech sector has been particularly squeezed by a shortage of homegrown talent  At Microsoft alone  3 000 domestic positions remain unfilled  And the forecast is grim  Over the next decade  the Labor Department estimates the U S  economy will create more than 1 4 million jobs in the computer and information science industries       That s enough jobs to absorb a 75  increase in the number of U S  born computer science and math graduates     at a time when the number of American students studying science and technology continues to fall  and more than half of all U S  postgraduate degrees in math and engineering are awarded to foreign nationals       It s not just the high tech industries whose competitive edge is threatened  As a McKinsey study recently concluded  America s leadership in global financial services is quickly eroding  A key culprit  says the study  is that today s H 1B regime prevents U S  financial services firms from hiring the talent they need       Our immigration laws are pushing foreign nationals who receive U S  MBAs to take their degrees elsewhere  Many relocate to Britain  which automatically grants work permits to MBAs from the world s top 50 business schools  Shouldn t our country do the same for U S  business school graduates  It s no wonder U S  university officials voice concern that unless top international students can expect work authorization upon graduation  they will increasingly turn down U S  schools for foreign ones       Can t Wait   While H 1B reforms will most visibly benefit businesses facing high skilled labor shortages  in the long run American workers can also gain  Enabling American companies to access the talent they need ensures that they will keep jobs on our shores  and that they will continue to grow in this country  And by conducting cutting edge research and developing new technologies  foreign professionals create good paying jobs for American workers  In fact  over the past 15 years foreign born workers have started one in four U S  public companies that were venture backed       I support comprehensive immigration reform and believe that a critical element of any comprehensive package must be maintaining a talented work force  We cannot miss the opportunity to reform our immigration system for skilled foreign born professionals  Failing to act now threatens nothing less than America s competitive edge       Lieberman  an Independent Democrat  represents Connecticut in
