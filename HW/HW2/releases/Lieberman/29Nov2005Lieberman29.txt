                                                                                                                                              Senators Clinton  Lieberman Announce Federal Legislation to Protect Children from Inappropriate Video Games                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           The Family Entertainment Protection Act will prohibit the sale of inappropriate games to minors                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             Washington     Today  Senators Clinton and Lieberman announced that they will introduce the Family Entertainment Protection Act when Congress reconvenes in two weeks           Senator Clinton was motivated to take action on this issue when it was revealed in July that Rockstar Games had embedded illicit sexual content in the video game Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas   This game had received a Mature rating from the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB   which was unaware of the embedded content   When the content was revealed  Senator Clinton called on the FTC to investigate the source of the content and announced that she would work to develop legislation to address this problem   Rockstar Games subsequently recalled the game            I have developed legislation that will empower parents by making sure their kids can   t walk into a store and buy a video game that has graphic  violent and pornographic content     said Senator Clinton          Senator Clinton acknowledges that video games are fun and entertaining and does not support any limitations on the production or sale of games to adults     This is about protecting children     said Senator Clinton            There is a growing body of evidence that points to a link between violent videos and aggressive behavior in children   We are not interested in censoring videos meant for adult entertainment but we do want to ensure that these videos are not purchased by minors   Our bill will help accomplish this by imposing fines on those retailers that sell M rated games to minors     Senator Lieberman said        Illinois  Michigan  and California have all passed state laws to prohibit the sale of violent video games to minors         Today  on Capitol Hill  the National Institute on Media and the Family released its tenth annual Video and Computer Game scorecard  which revealed that retailers have become even more lenient in their selling policies than they were last year   Boys as young as nine were able to purchase Mature rated video games 42 percent of the time  according to the secret audits             Today s report is yet further proof that we need to make sure parents have the tools and support they need to make informed decisions for their children     said Senator Clinton         Summary of the Family Entertainment Protection Act         Video game content is getting more and more violent and sexually explicit  yet young people are able to purchase these games with relative ease    In its 2005  10th Annual MediaWise Video and Computer Game Report Card  The National Institute on Media and the Family found that retailers were more lenient in their selling practices this year compared to last   Boys as young as nine were able to purchase Mature rated games 42 percent of the time   At the same time  a majority of parents are feeling increasingly victimized by a culture of violence that makes it difficult to protect their children against influences they find to be inappropriate   This bill would help empower parents by putting them back in the driver   s seat  It would ensure that children can   t buy games the video game industry itself has determined to be inappropriate for them          I         Prohibition on Selling Mature and Adults Only video games to minors                   The centerpiece of this bill is a prohibition against any business for selling or renting a Mature  Adults Only  or Ratings Pending game to a person who is younger than seventeen   This provision is not aimed at punishing retailers who act in good faith to enforce the Entertainment Software Ratings Board  ESRB  system  That   s why retailers would have an affirmative defense if they were shown an identification they believed to be valid or have a system in place to display and enforce the ESRB system  Similar prohibitions have become law in the last several months in California  Michigan  and Illinois          II         Annual Analysis of the Ratings System                   Since the bill relies on the video game industry to continue rating the appropriateness of games for minors  this bill requires an annual  independent analysis of game ratings   This analysis will help ensure that the ESRB ratings system accurately reflects the content in each game and that the ratings system does not change significantly over time          III       Authority for the Federal Trade Commission  FTC  to Investigate Misleading Ratings                   Part of the genesis of this bill was the revelation that the makers of Grand Theft Auto  San Andreas had included  through embedded code that was discovered and made accessible to the public  sexually explicit content inconsistent with the game   s Mature rating   This bill requires the FTC to conduct an investigation to determine whether what happened with GTA  San Andreas is a pervasive problem  It also includes a Sense of Congress that the Commission shall take appropriate action if it determines that there is a pervasive problem          IV       Authority to Register Complaints                   This bill requires the Bureau of Consumer Protection  BCP  of the FTC to ensure that consumers can file complaints if they find content to be misleading or deceptive and requires the BCP to report on the number of such complaints to Congress           V                Annual Retailer Audit                   This bill authorizes the FTC to conduct an annual  random audit of retailers     sometimes referred to as a secret shopper survey     to determine how easy it is for young people to purchase Mature and Adults Only video games and report the findings to Congress           30
