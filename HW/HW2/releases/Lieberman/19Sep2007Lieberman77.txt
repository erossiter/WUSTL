Joe Lieberman  ID  Conn   Wednesday  testified in favor of a regional primary system before the Senate Rules Committee   Lieberman  along with Senators Amy Klobacher  D Minn   and Lamar Alexander  R Tenn   have introduced S  1905  the Regional Presidential Primary and Caucus Act of 2007 to reform the current  front loaded system with a process that is more democratic and open to greater voter participation     Following is the statement the Senator placed in the Rules Committee hearing record     Madame Chairman  thank you for this opportunity to speak about the legislation Senators Alexander  Klobuchar  and I have introduced to restore public faith in our increasingly cramped and unrepresentative presidential primary system     Our goal is to transform what has become an arbitrary and exclusive presidential selection process into one that is fair  deliberate  and open to participation by as many voters as possible  As my colleagues have explained  the bill would assign all states to one of four regions   corresponding to the Northeast  South  Midwest  and Western regions of the country  A lottery would determine which region goes first  and the regions would rotate in subsequent election years  holding primaries in March  April  May  and June   Each state within a region must hold its primary or caucus during the period assigned to that region  The bill would go into effect in 2012      There are two exceptions to the rule  New Hampshire and Iowa would continue to hold the first primary and caucuses  respectively  before any of the regional primaries took place  I personally would prefer to omit this provision  If we are going to change to a regional system  there should be no exceptions  and I am concerned that these two states will continue to have a disproportionate impact on the outcome of the nominating process   But Iowa and New Hampshire share an historic  first in the nation status in the presidential primary process and so  they remain the first caucus and primary states in this bill  Given the significance of choosing the most powerful officeholder in the world  our presidential selection process must test the strength of the ideas and character of all the candidates and expose them to the maximum number of voters   It must  above all  be democratic  Instead  what we have now is a densely packed primary season that  with each passing presidential election  becomes less and less democratic  States are forced to move their primaries up earlier in the calendar year in order to give their citizens a chance to participate  which in turn  gives early states disproportionate influence in the presidential selection  while voters in later states are effectively disenfranchised     All one has to do is look at the 2008 presidential primary schedule to recognize the system is out of control  In bids to increase their influence on the presidential nomination  34 states   with enough delegates to determine the nominee   are scheduled to hold primaries or caucuses before March 1  That s a complete reversal of what the calendar looked like in 2000 when just 11 states held primaries before March  And it seems like every month  another state announces a plan to move its primary forward on the calendar   This rush to select the nominee results in a process that starts too early and ends too soon  Before most Americans have started focusing on the presidential race  the nominees are effectively chosen  And then there is a six month gap between the time the nominee is chosen and the formal nominating convention      And there is another even more insidious effect  The more tightly packed the primary schedule  the more reliant candidates become on large campaign donations and the people who give them   The fund raising primary this year has already eliminated candidates who simply could not raise sufficient funds quickly enough to be competitive in the first two months of the presidential year  This is no way for the world s greatest democracy to choose its president  Our legislation offers a fair alternative that would transform the primary season into what it should be  a contest between candidates who take their cases to the broadest possible slice of the electorate  I was honored to co sponsor proposals to bring reason to the presidential primary system twice in the past   in 1995 and 1999   with former Senator Slade Gorton  What we are introducing today is very similar  By creating a series of regional primaries  we will make it more likely that all areas of the country have a voice into the nomination process  and that the candidates and their treasuries will not be stretched so thin by primaries all over the country on the same day   By spreading the primaries out over a four month period  we would provide the electorate with a better opportunity to evaluate the candidates over time   And we hope that voters    not just financial contributors    will have the lion s share of influence over who the parties  nominees will be  The guiding principle of our democracy is that every citizen has the opportunity to choose his or her leaders  But the sad truth is this principle no longer bears a resemblance to the reality of an increasingly squashed and arbitrary primary system  We need to change our presidential primary system to make it more reasonable  more inclusive  and better structured so that it properly reflects the significance it holds   not only every four years  but as a founding principle of our great nation  Thank you     30
