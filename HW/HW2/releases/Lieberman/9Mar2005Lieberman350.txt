Half for First Responders       WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Wednesday delivered the following statement at a hearing on the Department of Homeland Security   s Fiscal Year 2006 budget       Thank you  Madame Chairman  Not long ago  CIA Director Porter Goss told the Senate Intelligence Committee that     it may only be a matter of time    before terrorists try to attack us with weapons of mass destruction  At the same hearing  FBI Director Robert Mueller warned of possible terrorist operations now underway within our borders and said finding such terrorists is    one of the most difficult challenges    his organization faces        Protecting Americans from terrorists cannot be done on the cheap   Yet  in its Fiscal Year 2006 budget proposal for the Department of Homeland Security  the Administration once again underestimates what it will take to keep our citizens as safe as possible here at home         There are increases  but they are modest  only a three to four percent increase in DHS discretionary spending after inflation  and even that increase largely depends upon a controversial airline ticket fee that may or may not be approved by Congress  More important  the increases pale by comparison to what the experts tell us is necessary   And some key homeland security funding that was authorized by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorist Prevention Act     signed into law by the President last November     has simply been ignored       And that  I   m afraid  leaves us with far too many gaps in our defenses  gaps ranging from the inability of first responders to communicate between agencies and jurisdictions  to a lack of preparedness for a biological attack  to inadequately defended train  railway  and highway transportation networks        So  what needs to be done    I have proposed to the Senate Budget Committee an  8 4 billion increase in the budget for homeland security government wide  Of that amount   6 3 billion would be for programs within the Department of Homeland Security     over and above the President   s proposed  2 5 billion increase       About half of my proposed increase in the DHS budget would go for training  equipment  and salaries for first responders   And a significant proportion of that would be invested in interoperable communications equipment to allow first responders from different agencies and different jurisdictions to speak to one another during a crisis   I just cannot understand why the Administration is seeking to cut first responder programs     by  565 million in DHS  and a jarring  1 7 billion government wide        Homeland security expert Stephen Flynn  a former Coast Guard Commandant  describes our predicament in his recent book  America the Vulnerable   He says  open quote            Homeland security has entered our post 9 11 lexicon  but homeland insecurity remains the abiding reality  With the exception of airports  much of what is critical to our way of life remains unprotected       From water and food supplies  refineries  energy grids and pipelines  bridges  tunnels  trains  trucks and cargo containers  to the cyber backbone that underpins the information age in which we live  the measures we have been cobbling together are hardly fit to deter amateur thieves  vandals and hackers  never mind determined terrorists  Worse still  small improvements are often oversold as giant steps forward  lowering the guard of average citizens as they carry on their daily routine with an unwarranted sense of confidence            End of quote   Flynn further points out that homeland security spending is still very small compared to the overall Pentagon budget  suggesting that the federal government continues to believe that our primary threat will be found outside our borders   But we know that is not true       We must listen to the security experts who tell us that this terrorist threat is one we must live with     and defend against     at home and abroad for the indefinite future  And we must listen to the experts who say we should match the threat     at home and abroad   with the resources necessary to vanquish it       Mr  Secretary  I know you are hard at work  examining many of these shortfalls   I look forward to hearing from you about how we will close our country   s    insecurity gap      Thank you       30
