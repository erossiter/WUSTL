                                                                                                                                                      WASHINGTON   Citing concerns about the safety and efficiency of Coast Guard ships and aircraft  Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   are renewing their call for an acceleration of the 22 year timetable for the Coast Guard   s modernization program  known as the Integrated   Deepwater System       In a letter sent this week to Office of Management and Budget Director Joshua Bolten  the Senators asked that he consider a 10 year schedule  arguing that    the nation simply cannot afford to wait until 2024 or later for the Coast Guard to employ more effective and reliable assets to achieve more effective homeland security          Of the world   s 42 major naval fleets  the Coast Guard has the third oldest     behind the Philippines and Mexico   with some aircraft   and cutters dating back 30 and 40 years   Given a 25 percent increase in the Guard   s responsibilities post 9 11  the Senators expressed deep concern about the readiness of the fleet          With many aircraft and cutters dating back more than a quarter of a century and some to World War II  we believe that the Coast Guard cannot afford to wait 20 or more years to replace its deteriorating equipment     the Senators wrote     The daily demands on operational   Coast Guard assets are unrelenting in the post 9 11 environment  That unyielding pace is taking a serious toll on aging ships and aircraft    resulting in a surge in maintenance costs at the expense of Deepwater           Separate reports by the Coast Guard and the RAND Corporation  an independent  nonprofit research organization  indicate that accelerating the Deepwater program    is not only feasible  but would ensure delivery of a more robust homeland security presence and capability sooner          Further  the Coast Guard report concludes that speeding up the program would    provide up to one million more resource hours and save approximately  4 billion over the course of the acquisition          In a priorities list provided to Congress  the Coast Guard recently noted that it needs an additional  650 million in funding for the   Deepwater program  plus more than  60 million for additional legacy cutter and aircraft sustainment while the service waits for new Deepwater   assets   Earlier this month  in letters to the Chairman and Ranking Member of the Senate Budget Committee  Senators Collins and Lieberman   called for an additional  900 million to address the Coast Guard s needs and support acceleration of the Deepwater program to a 10 year schedule  The Senators have consistently called for accelerating the Deepwater program        Following is a copy of the letter       March 15  2005      The Honorable Joshua B  Bolten  Director  Office of Management and Budget  725 17th Street  NW  Washington  DC 20503      Dear Director Bolten       As you consider the Coast Guard   s new Integrated Deepwater System program baseline report which will identify revised acquisition timelines  a revised mission requirements description  and funding levels  we urge you to support accelerating this program to a 10 year schedule   The nation simply cannot afford to wait until 2024 or later for the Coast Guard to employ more effective and reliable assets to achieve more effective homeland security       The Coast Guard   s fleet is the 40th oldest out of the world   s 42 major naval fleets  with only the Philippine and Mexican Navies having older ships   Some aircraft and cutters date back 30 and 40 years respectively  with some cutters having been commissioned during World War II  These aging assets face declining readiness at a time when the Coast Guard is being called on to perform an approximate 25 percent increase in missions in response to the post 9 11 environment with the same amount of pre 9 11  obsolete  and out of date equipment         Deepwater   s original 20 year acquisition schedule has already slipped  and the program is currently on at least a 22 year timetable         Some estimates of this faltering schedule are even more dire  drawing this acquisition out between 23 and 27 years   With many aircraft   and cutters dating back more than a quarter of a century and some to World War II  we believe that the Coast Guard cannot afford to wait 20   or more years to replace its deteriorating equipment   The daily demands on operational Coast Guard assets are unrelenting in the post 9 11 environment   That unyielding pace is taking a serious toll on aging ships and aircraft  resulting in a surge in maintenance costs at the expense of Deepwater         Cutters and aircraft failures are occurring at an increasing rate affecting not only the Coast Guard   s efficiency  but also putting crew   members in danger in the field   There were 329 in flight power losses on Coast Guard HH 65 search and rescue helicopters in FY 2004  more   than five times the number that occurred 2003   The 110 foot patrol boat  the workhorse of the Coast Guard   s fleet  is well beyond its recommended service life and  in FY 2004  suffered 23 hull breaches requiring emergency repairs   The largest cutters have a similarly poor readiness record  having lost losing 358 patrol days in 2004   This amounts to the effective loss of two Cutters  or 5  of the fleet  for the entire year   The longer the Deepwater project takes to complete  the more money the Coast Guard will have to divert to maintenance of its decaying assets  and the higher the overall price tag will be in the end           The majority of the Coast Guard   s operational assets will reach the end of their projected service life by 2008   Without an increase in   funding for acquisition of new Deepwater assets  the failure rate of legacy assets and the costs to repair them eventually may surpass the   expenditures for new Deepwater assets   For example  in FY 2005  20 per cent of the Deepwater budget   150 of  724 million  will be spent   on legacy asset sustainment  in FY 2006 fully 25 per cent of the Administration   s Deepwater budget   240 of  966 million  is for legacy asset   sustainment   We understand that some of this funding is for improvements that are keeping older assets on line awaiting the arrival of new   Deepwater assets   But other expenses are for repair of assets that have exceeded their service life and are simply failing         Both the Coast Guard and an independent  nonprofit research organization  the Rand Corporation  have previously issued reports   on the feasibility of accelerating completion of the Deepwater acquisition from 20 years to 10 years   These reports conclude that speeding   up this important program is not only feasible  but would ensure delivery of a more robust homeland security presence and capability sooner         In addition  the Coast Guard report indicates that accelerating the Deepwater program would provide up to one million more resource hours   and save approximately  4 billion over the course of the acquisition       We therefore take this opportunity to urge your support for accelerating the Deepwater program   Funding Deepwater on a 10 year  versus a 22 year or longer schedule  is simply good government practice       Sincerely          Susan M  Collins  Chairman                                                               Joseph I
