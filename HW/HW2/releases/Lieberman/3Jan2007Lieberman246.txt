Michael Chertoff last week  Senator Joe Lieberman  ID  Conn   Ranking Member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee  joined Congressional colleagues in expressing concerns about shortcomings and delays in the implementation of the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act by the Department of Homeland Security  Enacted to prevent the recurrence of the failures seen in the preparation for and response to Hurricane Katrina  the legislation required a substantial overhaul of the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA   The letter stated that efficient  timely and effective implementation of the Act is critical to homeland security and highlighted indicators that DHS may not be effectively and promptly implementing the bill  The letter also asked DHS and FEMA to provide full and complete briefings to Congress no later than January 8  2007 on the Act  including on the actions being taken to ensure all specified components of the Preparedness Directorate  including the National Preparedness Task Force and the Office of Grants and Training  are transferred to FEMA        Lieberman was joined by Senator Susan Collins  R Me    Chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee and   Representatives Peter King  R NY  and Bennie Thompson  D Miss    Chairman and Ranking Member  respectively  of the House Committee on Homeland Security  in the letter to Chertoff       December 28  2006      The Honorable Michael Chertoff  Secretary   Department of Homeland Security  Washington  DC 20528      Dear Secretary Chertoff       On October 4  2006  President Bush signed into law P L  109 295  Title VI of this law is the Post Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act of 2006     the Act      The Act made substantial changes to FEMA and the Department of Homeland Security  including making the Administrator of FEMA responsible for all phases of emergency management     preparedness  response  recovery  and mitigation     effectively rejoining all preparedness and response activities within FEMA  Many parts of the Act had an immediate effective date  while other sections of the Act have an effective date of March 31  2007        Efficient  timely  and effective implementation of the Act is critical to homeland security and is a high priority for our Committees  As such  on several occasions some of our staff has requested briefings regarding the implementation of the Act  However  to date  neither DHS nor FEMA has provided any briefings  Moreover  there are already some indicators that DHS may not be effectively and promptly implementing the bill        For instance  under P L  109 295  DHS was required to report to Congress with any recommendations for transfers  reprogrammings  and necessary budget requests to implement the Act  In response to this directive  on November 1  2006  Scott Charbo  DHS Acting Under Secretary for Management  wrote to Senator Robert Byrd  the incoming chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee  that DHS had not identified any additional transfers  reprogrammings or budget requests needed to implement the Act  Given the Act   s vast changes  we question how the Act can be implemented within Congress   s intent without any transfers  reprogrammings  or budget requests       As another example that the implementation may be lagging  DHS has already missed the Act   s deadline for establishing the National Advisory Council  a board designed to ensure essential state  local  tribal  and private sector input into federal emergency preparedness and response        Due to these concerns  as well as our Committees    need for general information regarding DHS   s plans for implementing the Act and actual implementation of the provisions of the Act already in effect  we request that DHS and FEMA provide our staffs with full and complete briefings on the implementation of the Act no later than January 8  2007  Some of the issues we would like addressed include        1  One of the principal aspects of the Act is that preparedness and response be rejoined  The law mandates that all parts of the Preparedness Directorate as constituted on June 1  2006 are to be transferred to FEMA  except the Office of Infrastructure Protection  the National Communications System  the National Cybersecurity Division  and the Office of the Chief Medical Officer  Thus  this transfer would include  but not be limited to  the National Preparedness taskforce  formally known as National Preparedness Integration Program and all parts of the Office of Grants and Training     a  What actions are DHS and FEMA taking to ensure a smooth transition of these aspects of the Preparedness Directorate to FEMA     b  It is important that FEMA  with all of these additional pieces  work as a single coordinated agency  not simply as a collection of uncoordinated  unintegrated  independent offices  What actions are DHS and FEMA taking to fuse all aspects of FEMA into an integrated  coordinated agency        2  The Act requires that FEMA develop and coordinate the implementation of a risk based  all hazards strategy for preparedness  What are FEMA   s plans to implement this provision        3  What are the plans for the internal organization of FEMA  What positions  offices  departments  or divisions will be created within FEMA to carry out FEMA   s missions  activities  and responsibilities  Please provide an organizational chart of the proposed FEMA        4  The law requires FEMA to develop and maintain robust Regional offices  How does FEMA plan to achieve this directive  What are the plans for the implementation of the Regional Office strike teams        5  To provide for more effective and coordinated federal leadership of efforts to achieve operable and interoperable emergency communications nationwide  the Act establishes an Office of Emergency Communications within DHS  the Director of which is to report to the Assistant Secretary for Cybersecurity and Communications  The Office is to include most elements of the SAFECOM program  all the responsibilities and authorities related the Integrated Wireless Network  and the Interoperable Communications Technical Assistance Program  The provision establishing the Office of Emergency Communications was effective immediately upon enactment  Has the Office of Emergency Communications been established  If not  when does the Department intend to establish this Office  What is the structure of this office        6  Subtitle E of the Act makes several changes to the Stafford Act  How is FEMA implementing those provisions       7  As of November 1  2006  according to a letter from DHS to Senator Byrd described above  DHS had not identified any need for transfers  reprogrammings or budget requests  What is your current assessment of the need for any transfers  reprogrammings  or budget requests        8  The Act contains several provisions to prevent waste  fraud  and abuse  How is FEMA implementing those provisions        Sincerely yours       SUSAN M  COLLINS          JOSEPH I  LIEBERMAN  Chairman                  Ranking
