state attorneys general to investigate offenders       WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today urged his Senate colleagues to support legislation that would authorize state attorneys general to enforce consumer protection laws against devious interstate household movers on behalf of their residents          In a letter to Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine Subcommittee Chairman Kay Bailey Hutchison and Ranking Member Daniel K  Inouye  Lieberman commended his colleagues on their efforts to increase law enforcement options for protecting consumers from unscrupulous interstate moving companies and asked for their continued support for legislation to accomplish that           I am writing to commend you for your ongoing efforts to protect consumers against unscrupulous interstate household moving companies and to urge your continued support for provisions that address this issue when a Transportation Bill   is introduced this year     the letter said          The full text of the letter is below        January 12  2005       The Honorable Kay Bailey Hutchison      Chairman Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine      Committee on Commerce  Science and Transportation      427 Hart Senate Office Building      Washington  DC 20510       The Honorable Daniel K  Inouye      Ranking Member  Subcommittee on Surface Transportation and Merchant Marine      Committee on Commerce  Science and Transportation      427 Hart Senate Office Building      Washington  DC 20510        Dear Ms  Hutchison and Mr  Inouye        I am writing to commend you for your ongoing efforts to protect consumers against unscrupulous interstate household moving companies and to urge your continued support for provisions that address this issue when a Transportation Bill equivalent to HR 3550 is introduced this year        To illustrate the timeliness of your actions I have attached a letter from the Attorney General of Connecticut  Mr  Richard Blumenthal  He writes that his office is in receipt of many complaints about interstate moving companies  Typically these complaints involve consumers who were given estimates that were not honored and doubled or worse once the moving company packed the goods  the consumer is advised to pay the full amount  or the company will not release the consumer   s household goods        The federal government has preempted state action against such movers  making it impossible for a State Attorney General to address complaints  Mr  Blumenthal believes that the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration  FMCSA   which is the federal agency that is responsible for regulation and enforcement  has been ineffective in dealing with these abuses  It is seriously under funded and thus unable to adequately address consumer complaints        In his letter  Mr  Blumenthal relates similar experiences by State Attorneys General of many other States  Their position is confirmed by a March  2001 GAO report     Consumer Protection     Federal Actions Are Needed to Improve Oversight of the Household Goods Moving Industry     The report concludes that the activities of the United States Department of Transportation in this area    have been minimal     The report also states that    Consumer protections have the potential to be enhanced by expanding the States    role in the regulation of interstate household goods carriers           As you know  there are two ways to approach this problem  either adequately charter and fund the FMCSA or authorize the State Attorneys General to pursue these deceptive and devious movers  While the former solution may be difficult to implement in the current budget climate  the latter is contained in several legislative proposals currently pending before the Congress  Recent legislation includes HR 1070  which is supported by the National Association of Attorneys General and both House and Senate versions of the Safe  Accountable  Flexible and Efficient Transportation Equity Act of 2004  HR 3550   which     thanks to your efforts     contains language that is even stronger        Given the interest of Mr  Blumenthal  his colleagues and the people that they serve and assuming that bills with a similar purpose as HR 3550 will be introduced again this legislative year  I would like to ask for your continued efforts to maintain these provisions  You have my full support in enacting them        I want to thank both of you for your leadership on this issue thus far         Sincerely          Joseph I  Lieberman      UNITED STATES SENATOR         30
