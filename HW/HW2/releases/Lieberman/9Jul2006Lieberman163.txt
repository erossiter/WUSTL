tracking of avian influenza  the United States Agency for International Development  USAID  has awarded  5 million in support for a new initiative that will monitor wild bird populations for the disease around the globe  according to the New York based Wildlife Conservation Society  WCS   which will spearhead the project involving more than a dozen private and public partners   Called the Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance  GAINS   the initiative has also received an additional  1 million from the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  to continue global monitoring and surveillance efforts underway by WCS and its network of partners        Specifically  GAINS will help provide increased capacity to  detect avian influenza  including the highly pathogenic form of the virus  in wild migratory and resident bird populations  gain information on viral strains to track changes  use that information to guide domestic and global preparedness and vaccine development  and create an open database for real time information sharing on highly pathogenic avian influenza and other pathogens  WCS will work in tandem with USAID  the CDC  Wetlands International  Birdlife International  the Food and Agriculture Organization  and others on the initiative           We applaud USAID for taking this important step in the fight to prevent the spread of avian influenza     said Dr  Steven Sanderson  President and CEO of WCS     With help from key partners across the globe  we will be able to eliminate critical gaps in our understanding of this deadly pathogen  With continued funding  this network can become a great bulwark against global threats to public health           The funds for the new initiative were created when the President signed into law the Emergency Supplemental Appropriations for Pandemic Influenza  attached to the Defense Appropriations Act   which was passed by Congress in late December 2005   The package includes funds for international disease surveillance and tracking of the movement of avian flu in both wild and domestic bird populations           This new partnership marks another important step in U S  efforts to combat the threat of avian influenza     said Dr  Dennis Carroll  Director of USAID   s Avian and Pandemic Influenza Preparedness and Response Unit     The GAINS program will fill an important role in supporting the activities of the Food and Agriculture Organization  as well as the World Health Organization  We   re pleased to work with WCS and our international partners on this vital effort              The Global Avian Influenza Network for Surveillance will help provide us and the world with  valuable forecasts  on the emergence of viral storms so that we can prevent the spread of avian flu and prepare those communities in its wake     said Senator Joseph Lieberman  D CT   who introduced the Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance Act  S 1912  back in October 2005        The GAINS program enjoys strong bipartisan support in Congress from Senator Sam Brownback  R KS   Congresswoman Rosa L  DeLauro  D CT3  and Congresswoman Nita Lowey  D NY18   who have all championed the early warning system           As co chair of the Senate Conservation Caucus  I think the GAINS program will play an important role in developing a global pandemic influenza tracking infrastructure  which could ultimately help save millions of lives     added Senator Brownback     We should take steps such as monitoring viral mutations in wild birds so we can tackle any future pandemic influenza outbreaks              Fighting the threat of avian flu abroad means we do not have to do it here     said Congresswoman DeLauro  D CT3   sponsor of the Global Network for Avian Influenza Surveillance Act  the House companion to the Lieberman bill     GAINS will help us learn how the virus is changing to better prepare populations at risk in the wild bird flight path  With instances of this virus increasing in Asia  the funding for this initiative could not come at a more opportune time              This additional funding for GAINS is a big step forward in boosting our capacity to determine where avian influenza may pose a regional and even global threat     said  Congresswoman Lowey  author of the Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act to create an international plan to address avian flu     GAINS will help us better track and understand how to prepare for an avian flu pandemic               This new initiative will greatly expand the health community   s ability to look upstream to identify where the avian influenza virus is and where it may be headed     said Dr  William Karesh  director of WCS    Field Veterinary Program  which has been active in monitoring for the pathogen globally for nearly two decades     At the same time  the conservation community will be generating sound science to inform all parties on where wild birds may be a key factor  and where the focus should be more on the movements of poultry and poultry products  for example
