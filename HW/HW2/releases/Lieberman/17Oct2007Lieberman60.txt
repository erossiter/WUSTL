his four terms in the House  and now in his third term in the Senate  Jon has been a strong and steadfast advocate of America s duty to defend and advance the cause of freedom around the world and I m honored to have him present me with this award tonight    I also want to thank Frank  Gaffney  president and CEO of the Center for Security Policy  and the directors  scholars and members of the Center for Security Policy for honoring me with this award    But I think everyone in this room will agree we need to thank Frank and everyone involved with the CSP for the work they do every day to keep the flame of freedom burning bright by offering studied guidance to both policy makers and the general public on how we can most effectively use the broad shoulders of American power   military  economic and diplomatic   to secure our nation s liberties and advance freedom around the world    It s a full time job   and a much needed one   so thank you Frank and everyone at CSP for all of your hard work    And thanks to all of you who with your support make the work of the Center for Security Policy possible    You honor me with this award   the Keeper of the Flame   on an interesting day in the history of liberty s fires  On this very day  226 years ago  a British officer appeared atop the earthworks at Yorktown waving a white flag and asking General George Washington his terms for the surrender of the army of Lord Cornwallis    When the white flag appeared  the American gunners ceased their barrage of the British positions and cheers rang out through the length and breadth of the lines of the Continental Army   After six long and bitterly difficult years of fighting   in a cause that regularly seemed lost   they had finally won freedom and independence for their new nation   the United States of America    Who wouldn t forgive them for cheering    Well       George Washington  He ordered his army to silence  shouting out   Let history huzzah for you     And the army fell silent    And history  of course  has huzzahed for them and the nation they founded    In part  Washington may have ordered the silence out of respect for the defeated foe  But his words showed he had more than that in mind  His call to history meant he realized there was much work ahead for his new nation    He knew that the struggle for freedom was far from over and that Yorktown could have been just a footnote in history if that first generation of Americans didn t work hard to secure their newly won liberties   Indeed  every generation must fight to defend the great values and principles that are embodied in our Declaration of Independence and Constitution  Our nation is unique in history because it was formed by the ideals of human dignity and liberty and defined not by our borders but by these national ideals    And that brings me back to the silence Washington ordered at Yorktown    It was the same silence that descended over Appomattox Court House when we preserved our nation and ended slavery       it was the same silence that floated over the trenches of World War I as the hour of the armistice approached and that long bloody war came to an end       and it was the same silence that fell over the deck of the Battleship Missouri as World War II finally ended with the surrender of the last of the cruel and tyrannical axis powers  defeated by America and its allies    It was the silence that came with the realization that if we did not next tackle the hard work of building a just peace  all the sacrifices we had made   and all we that we had fought for   would be for naught and we would be forced to fight again     And that silence was also a recognition that we must listen for the future threats to liberty  Indeed  in the words of that great abolitionist Wendell Phillips   Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty    The principle of eternal vigilance is not a Democratic or Republican principle  It is not a liberal or conservative cause  Defending the ideals of human liberty is America s cause   For America is   as Ronald Regan reminded us   a  Shining city upon the hill     Moral passivity or neutrality is anathema to our very core    In recent years  unfortunately  too many in the Democratic Party have lost sight of the inseparable link between the defense of progressive values at home and abroad     I was born and came of age in that era after World War II when a generation of great Democratic leaders   while advocates of progressive social policies at home   understood that America   because of its military and economic might   had a duty to engage with the rest of the world   to protect liberty s flames where they were in danger       and advance them in places where the embers lay dark and cold    It was a liberalism that was not afraid to call evil by its name and confront it    Presidents like Franklin Roosevelt  Harry Truman  John F  Kennedy and Lyndon Johnson  along with great Democratic Senators like Scoop Jackson and Hubert Humphrey  helped build policies that contained the Soviet Union and Communist China through a combination of military might  aggressive diplomacy and economic aid  like the Marshall plan  that bolstered teetering democracies   Why did they set our nation on this course  Because they understood history s lessons and did not want to see the United States make the mistake it made after World War I   a retreat into the isolationism  which helped cause World War II     Hubert Humphrey  in a speech in 1965  said   Today we know that World War II began not in 1939 or 1941  but in the 1920 s and 1930 s when those who should have known better persuaded themselves that they were not their brother s keeper     The  happy warrior  was also a clear eyed warrior  He got that right   And Republicans of that era were also moved by the light of liberty s flame and the challenges freedom faced around the world   After World War II  with Soviet communism on the move  Senator Arthur Vandenberg preached that his party must not return to the isolationist policies that preceded World War II merely out of reflexive opposition to Democratic proposals    Politics must stop at the waters  edge   he said    Together  in that bipartisan spirit  both parties forged defense and foreign policies that spanned generations of Americans and the Administrations of both parties    During the 1980s  many voters identified themselves as Reagan Democrats  But  in fact  as the Cold War drew to a close under President Reagan s watch  it could easily be said that President Reagan was a Truman Republican    Now we face a new fight  A long fight  An intergenerational fight  The fight against radical Islam and its totalitarian state sponsors in nations like Iran and Syria    We must not be afraid to call this evil by its name and confront it with the kind of passion  power and dedication President Kennedy brought to his first inaugural address when he said this nation must be ready to  pay any price  bear any burden  meet any hardship  support any friend  oppose any foe  in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty    We must again form the kind of bipartisan coalitions we formed in the Cold War so we can create defense and foreign policies that Americans will believe in and support so those policies can span the generations it will take to succeed against Islamist extremists and terrorists    For that to happen  we must take politics out of this  With the security of our nation   and freedom around the world   at risk  politics must again stop at the water s edge  Our only retreat must be from today s poisonous  partisan name calling    Today  some on the left suggest that the just fight in Iraq is  Bush s war    They could not be further from the truth  This is America s war   My friends  Iraq is not a partisan adventure  it is a crucial theater in the larger war against Islamic extremism   a fight for freedom that we must win against al Qaeda and Iran   a fight we are winning   as surely as we had to prevail in the wars against fascism and communism in the last century    The cause to secure Iraq s future is America s cause   It is freedom s cause  It is the cause for which you fight    In this fight  we may never have a moment like Yorktown  Appomattox  a surrender signed on a battleship   or the sight of a hated wall of repression being torn down by a people newly freed   But if we stay true to our nation s mission in this new struggle  our children and grandchildren   and generations beyond   will have moments of silence  of victory  for which history will surely huzzah      I am greatly honored to accept this honor tonight  but I share it with the true keepers of the flame   the brave men and women in uniform who defend our liberty  and those not in uniform who serve our country at home and abroad  They keep the flame of freedom burning with their commitment and heroism     Last week  we were reminded of their extraordinary dedication to their country when President Bush announced that the Medal of Honor would be awarded posthumously to Lt  Michael Murphy  a Navy SEAL who gave his  last full measure of devotion  in the mountains of Afghanistan so others might live     In each generation  brave patriots have stepped forward to defend our great land from those who would threaten our freedoms  Tonight  let us salute Lt  Murphy and all those keepers of the flame who protect our families and guard our freedom     Let us rededicate ourselves to the cause for which the flame of liberty was lit in 1776  and this nation which embodies freedom s values and which we love     Thank you
