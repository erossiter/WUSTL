    WASHINGTON  D C    Senators Joseph Lieberman  ID CT  and John McCain  R AZ  today thanked the U S  Environmental Protection Agency for completing the analysis that they had requested of their Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act  CSIA  in February  On June 27  Lieberman and Senator John Warner  R VA  announced that the two of them would draw upon the CSIA  other existing bills  and new ideas to construct  by early August  a new  bipartisan  economy wide  cap and trade climate bill  They plan to bring that bill before the Senate Subcommittee on Private Sector and Consumer Solutions to Global Warming  Lieberman and Warner are the chairman and ranking minority member  respectively  of that subcommittee     While no economic model predicts the future perfectly  EPA s projections are informative and useful  Lieberman said  Senator Warner and I will use this analysis as we put together new bipartisan legislation designed to attract majority support on our global warming subcommittee     As the results of this EPA analysis demonstrate  the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act provides a valuable roadmap for finding a sound solution to the most difficult environmental challenge of our time  McCain said  Our legislation would not only address the environmental concerns of climate change  but would also serve as a stimulus for new technology development and deployment  Under our bill  the entrepreneurial spirit of America would have a chance to flourish in the marketplace  encouraging the growth of new businesses while at the same time promoting innovative technologies to better our planet  I look forward to seeing the proposal that will be put forth by the leadership of the EPW Subcommittee on Global Warming  Senators Lieberman and Warner  and am pleased that they plan to use the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act as a guide to providing the Committee with legislation that can be reported to the full Senate to address this serious global problem     EPA s analysis finds that if the US government enacted the CSIA this year  then   making conservative assumptions about the pace of emissions reductions in the rest of the world   the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere would remain below 500 parts per million  ppm  at the end of this century  According to the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change  keeping the concentration below 500 ppm would avoid a high risk of catastrophic global warming     EPA s detailed power sector modeling also finds that if the CSIA were enacted  coal would remain economically viable in the US as a fuel for electricity generation  with US coal production remaining essentially constant until around 2030  when US coal use would begin increasing due to the escalating deployment of carbon capture and storage technology for coal fired power plants     Lieberman and McCain reintroduced the CSIA in January  The bill s other co sponsors are Senators Tom

Olympia Snowe  R ME    EPA S ANALYSIS OF THE CLIMATE STEWARDSHIP AND INNOVATION ACT   A Fact Sheet Prepared by the Office of Senator Joseph Lieberman    On February 5  2007  Senators Joe Lieberman and John McCain asked EPA to estimate the economic impacts of S  280  the Climate Stewardship and Innovation Act of 2007  CSIA   EPA delivered its report to the Senators on July 24  2007   EPA finds that if the US government enacts the CSIA in 2007  then   making conservative assumptions about the pace of emissions reductions in the rest of the world   the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will remain below 500 parts per million  ppm  at the end of this century  According to the IPCC  keeping the concentration below 500 ppm will avoid a high risk of global warming that would cause severe impacts  EPA finds that if the US does not lead and the rest of the world does not follow  the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will approach 800 ppm by the end of the century  According to the IPCC  unmitigated global warming would entail exacerbated water scarcity in the Western US  increased pestilence  disease and fire in US forests  and increased number  intensity  and duration of heat waves endangering the elderly  the poor  and the infirm in US cities  EPA finds that if the CSIA is enacted  the US gross domestic product  GDP  will increase 111  over the 2005 level by 2030  That increase is 1  lower than the increase projected in the absence of the CSIA  EPA s analysis does not take into account the negative influence that a failure to curb global warming would have on US GDP  EPA finds that if the CSIA is enacted  average annual per household consumption in the US will increase 103  over the 2005 level by 2030  That increase is 2  lower than the increase projected in the absence of the CSIA  EPA s analysis does not take into account the negative influence that a failure to curb global warming would have on average annual per household consumption in the US  EPA states that  w hile the models do not represent benefits  it can be said that as the abatement of  greenhouse gas  emissions increases over time  so do the benefits of the abatement  EPA finds that if the CSIA is enacted  electricity rates will  over 15 years  rise from about 8 cents per kilowatt hour to about 8 5 or 9 cents per kilowatt hour  EPA s detailed power sector modeling finds that if the CSIA is enacted  coal will remain economically viable in the US as a fuel for electricity generation  with US coal production remaining essentially constant until around 2030  when US coal use will begin increasing due to the escalating deployment  beginning after 2020  of carbon capture and storage technology for coal fired power plants  EPA finds that enactment of the CSIA would have no effect on natural gas prices through 2030  at which point the CSIA would start reducing natural gas prices below what they otherwise would be     30
