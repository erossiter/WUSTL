Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Susan Collins  R Me   and Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday asked for a thorough investigation of the response to a recent anthrax scare at the Department of Defense in an effort to ensure its preparedness for a biological attack        Several aspects of the DOD   s response last month to a positive reading for anthrax in a mailroom led many to wonder if DOD had learned the lessons of the 2001 anthrax attack when five people  including a Connecticut woman  died  the Senators said        They asked the Government Accountability Office to review the DOD procedures now in place regarding response to a bioterror incident  whether the procedures had been followed  and whether they need to be revised         We have already seen the dangerous  potentially deadly effects of a biological attack through the mail   Collins said   We must ensure that we have safeguards in place to reliably detect biological agents that could be sent through our vast public and private mail delivery system  We must also have systems and resources in place to ensure we are prepared to react to an attack  particularly to prevent a biological agent from dispersing   We have asked GAO to determine what has been done since the Anthrax attacks  and where we must improve             We know that fast and clear communication is essential in the event of an attack     communication to the people who might be affected by a biological agent and communication among the various federal agencies and first responders responsible for public safety     Lieberman said     Three and a half years after a real anthrax attack killed five people   including Ottile Lundgren of Oxford  Conn      the response to this kind of incident should be well coordinated and effective  I want to know exactly where the missteps occurred in the DOD case so we can fix them           A government contractor waited four days to notify DOD that a routine swab of a DOD mailroom had tested positive for the presence of anthrax   On March 14  the facility and two others were evacuated while further tests were conducted  The incident turned out to be a false alarm and no injuries occurred        The Senators said the placement of biological sensors in mailrooms was a sign that important steps had been taken to protect workers  But they agreed that media reports of the delayed reaction and DOD   s failure to effectively coordinate with first responders  the Department of Homeland Security  and other public health officials during the scare were extremely troubling        Following is a copy of the letter        April 7  2005       The Honorable David Walker  Comptroller General  U S  Government Accountability Office  441 G Street  N W   Washington  D C   20548    Dear Comptroller General Walker        Recent incidents involving what was thought to be anthrax contamination at three mail facilities that handle Department of Defense and other U S  Government mail raise serious questions about the federal government s continued lack of preparedness to respond effectively to biological attack through the mails   According to published news reports  on Thursday  March 10  2005  routine swabs taken from mail screening equipment at the Pentagon s Remote Delivery Facility in Arlington  VA  tested positive for anthrax contamination   Not until four days later  on Monday  March 14  were Pentagon police reportedly notified  after which Arlington County Fire Department and hazmat units responded and evacuated the facility   Also on March 14  in what appears to be a coincidence  a mail sensor at the DOD s Skyline mail handling facility at Bailey s Crossroads in Fairfax County  VA  detected a suspicious biological substance  and the Fairfax County Fire and Rescue and hazmat units responded and about 800 employees were decontaminated and locked down while tests were completed   The U S  Postal Service also shut its main government mail center at V Street N W  in the District of Columbia and began medicating about 200 postal workers   On Wednesday  March 16  after a series of tests came back negative  DOD officials finally expressed confidence that no public health threat ever existed in the mailrooms        Although  thankfully  these incidents appear to have involved a false alarm  news reports about the incidents raise very troubling questions about the procedures by which the government  and particularly the DOD  responded   For example  had the apparent contamination at the Remote Delivery Facility been real  the four day delay in notifying DOD could have cost many lives   Even after DOD was notified of the apparent contamination  reportedly thousands of pieces of mail were sent to redistribution points within the Pentagon        Published news reports also contain allegations that there were significant delays and failures in notifying and coordinating with non federal first responders  and with the appropriate emergency response centers of the Homeland Security and Health and Human Services Departments   Further concerns were expressed that an effective and coordinated response was hampered by the fact that the Pentagon has established its own biohazard detection and response systems and procedures that are separate from  and inconsistent with  the national network of sensors  laboratories  and guidelines used by other federal  state  and local agencies to respond to bioterrorism           I am therefore asking that you conduct an investigation to help ascertain what useful lessons we can learn from these incidents   Specifically  please determine what actions were taken by each of the agencies involved  what were the applicable rules and procedures that governed the detection and response  whether those rules and procedures were followed  and whether those rules and procedures are adequate to protect the health and safety of federal workers and the public against bio contamination of the mails        Sincerely           Susan Collins                    Chairman      Joseph I  Lieberman  Ranking Member     30
