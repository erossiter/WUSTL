                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   issued the following statement Monday in response to the Administration   s Fiscal Year 2007 homeland security budget                       Once again  the Bush Administration   s reality does not match the President   s rhetoric when it comes to homeland security   His homeland security budget reflects a waning interest in funding the war on terrorism at home  at the same time that Hurricane Katrina has shown we are not as prepared as we must be to respond to a national catastrophe       Although the Administration says it has increased homeland security spending by 6 percent  that figure is contingent on an increase in passenger airline security fees  which Congress rejected last year  In fact  without the fee increase  DHS    budget increases by at most 2 3 percent  less than the rate of inflation                     For the third year in a row  the President   s budget slashes first responder funding to irresponsibly low levels  The men and women on the front lines of the domestic war against terror need better training  and equipment  Instead of responding to those needs  this budget continues a disturbing trend in cutting first responder grants by 24 percent from FY06 and 50 percent overall when compared to FY04                   The President eliminates dedicated funding for the Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  which provides grants to states and law enforcement organization to assist in the prevention of terrorist attacks  The budget also shamefully cuts grants to firefighters  reducing Fire Assistance Grants  which provide funding for training and equipment by 46 percent  and altogether eliminating the SAFER program  which assists in hiring additional firefighters   The total decrease in assistance for firefighters is over 55 percent                   Furthermore  grants to states  which traditionally have provided the largest source of funding for equipment and training   including critical interoperable communications equipment   are reduced by one third compared to FY06 and a whopping 71 percent from FY04                               The President   s budget also slashes minimum guaranteed homeland security funding to states by 78 percent   to  1 58 million  down from  7 13 million in FY06     which threatens to leave many states without enough o protect their citizens                     We know that the public health infrastructure is not prepared for a biological attack  or even a natural outbreak of pandemic flu   Yet  the Administration is calling for the complete elimination of the Metropolitan Medical Response System which provides funding to over 100 metropolitan areas to assist them in planning for and coordinating medical emergencies   And for the third year in a row  the Administration has provided no additional funding for FEMA   s National Medical Disaster System and its medical assistance teams   Finally  the Administration has again cut funding for the hospital preparedness program at HHS and provided no increase in funding for the grant program that helps state and local health departments prepare for health emergencies                    We know that our mass transit system remains vulnerable to the kind of attacks we saw last year in London   But  the Administration ignores Congress    FY06 appropriation of  150 million for rail and transit security grants and continues to provide no money dedicated specifically to rail and transit security   Instead  the Administration once again proposes to cover rail and transit security in an amorphous  585 million fund for targeted infrastructure protection  leaving the security of our daily commutes to a bureaucratic fight within DHS over which infrastructure asset should merit the most attention       Too many high risk chemical facilities are not secure  But the President   s budget dedicates only  10 million specifically to oversee the security of chemical facilities  a woefully insufficient amount of money for this dangerous problem  Senator Collins and I have proposed bi partisan chemical security legislation to address the need for greater security for high risk plants by authorizing DHS to require that those facilities assess and address their security risks       This Administration   s budget also jeopardizes the Coast Guard   s ability to do its job   It contains a modest increase  to pay for a move to a new headquarters and for protecting the airspace around Washington  D C   but too little to modernize the aging fleet of the Coast Guard  which performed heroically in response to Hurricane Katrina       In sum  the President   s budget shortchanges essential homeland defense programs  I intend to work with members of both parties in Congress to do better for our security       30
