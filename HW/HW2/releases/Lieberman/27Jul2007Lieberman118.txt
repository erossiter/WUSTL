                                                                                                                                           WASHINGTON  D C    The U S  Senate has passed legislation to strengthen and secure America s commitment to the expansion of freedom and the protection of human rights around the world       The just passed legislation to implement the remaining recommendations of the 9 11 Commission  S  4  included provisions of the ADVANCE Democracy Act of 2007   This bipartisan  bicameral legislation was sponsored by Senators Joseph Lieberman  I D CT  and John McCain  R AZ  in the Senate and Congressmen Tom Lantos  D CA  and Frank Wolf  R VA  in the House of Representatives   A vote is expected in the House today          The ADVANCE Democracy Act requires the State Department to develop new  written strategies for the promotion of democracy in all countries that are currently non democratic or transitioning to democracy  These strategies will help ensure that America s democracy promotion efforts are carefully tailored to the unique  long term challenges presented by each country  and that they are focused on more than just holding elections  but on building democratic institutions and fostering democratic values        The values of freedom  democracy  and justice have been at the bedrock of American foreign policy since the founding of our republic   said Senator Lieberman   Presidents from Wilson to Roosevelt  and Harry Truman to John F  Kennedy have argued that America s vital interests are best secured when we help others find their own voice of freedom  The ADVANCE Democracy Act sends a clear and unmistakable message to the world that the self evident truth  enshrined in the Declaration of Independence  knows no borders  and that the United States stands with those who struggle for freedom        The ADVANCE Democracy Act also authorizes the creation of a new position at the State Department  known as Democracy Liaison Officers  These positions will be filled by experts in democracy promotion who can be dispatched by the Secretary of State to U S  missions overseas  The Act also provides for enhanced training for members of the Foreign Service in democracy promotion and human rights       Promoting democracy and protecting human rights are core aspects of the American moral compass  and these aims are crucial to our national security interest   said Congressman Lantos  chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee   With this legislation  we take another step toward ensuring that we focus on the long term  difficult work of fostering budding democracies and those who support them around the world        At a time when some have questioned America s democracy efforts  this bill affirms that the promotion of freedom is an enduring element of American foreign policy   said Senator McCain    The expansion of democracy and freedom is inseparable from the long term security of the United States and is intimately bound with the values Americans hold dear   he added    We must  I believe  promote democracy  the rule of law and social modernization just as we promote the sophistication of our weapons and the modernization of our militaries   The ADVANCE Democracy Act will strengthen America s ability to do just that         The passage of this important legislation heralds a new era in the worthy effort of democracy promotion around the world   said Congressman Wolf  who co chairs the Congressional Human Rights Caucus with Lantos    The core values on which our country is founded   freedom of thought  of conscience  of religion   are affirmed as we promote the right of all persons to chart their own political destiny   I believe strongly that emphasizing democracy promotion through requisite training and funding of our foreign service appropriately reflects the priority that democracy promotion holds in our nation s foreign policy       The ADVANCE Democracy Act also       Affirms that the policy of the United States to promote freedom and democracy in foreign countries as a fundamental component of American foreign policy    Establishes a Democracy Fellowship Program that will enable State Department officers to gain democracy promotion expertise    Calls for the establishment of an ADVANCE Democracy Award  to be awarded annually to State Department personnel who have made outstanding achievements in promoting democracy    Calls for strengthening cooperation between and among democratic and democratic transition countries by authorizing a new State Department Office for Multilateral Democracy Promotion       30
