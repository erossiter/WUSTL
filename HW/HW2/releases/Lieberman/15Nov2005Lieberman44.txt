CT  joined his colleagues in the Senate today in approving a  491 6 billion defense spending blueprint to better equip our America   s armed forces to fight and win the global war on terrorism   As a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee and ranking member of the Airland Subcommittee  Lieberman helped craft key provisions of the Department of Defense Authorization Bill to better arm and protect our soldiers  sailors  airmen and Marines  to care for their families  and to benefit Connecticut   s defense workers and economy           As our troops gain ground in the war against terrorism  it is critical we not lose ground in our on going efforts to strengthen and transform America   s armed forces     Lieberman said      From New London to Baghdad  I have seen first hand how our servicemen and women are fighting with brilliance and bravery   But they are being stretched  and need our support   This defense spending plan will provide them with the reinforcements     in terms of technology  training  equipment  pay and family support     they require            The Senate today approved the Defense Authorization bill for fiscal year 2006  which sets funding levels and overall strategic goals for defense personnel  facilities  and weapons systems   The defense authorization bill sets forth Congress    priorities in supporting our military today and in the future   Differences between the Senate and House passed versions of the bill will be resolved in a conference later this year    As the ranking member of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Airland Forces  Lieberman advocated aggressively during committee debate to fund efforts to transform the military to keep pace with the security needs of the 21st century and to provide tools effective to our Army and Air Force today         Lieberman said the bill approved today contains several provisions that reaffirm the Connecticut defense industry   s place as cornerstone of our national security             I am pleased and proud of our success in securing significant funding increases for vital Connecticut defense priorities so far     Lieberman said      In particular  the  60 million in new submarine projects following our successful defense of Submarine Base New London along with the 81 new Blackhawks authorized by this bill  should keep Connecticut   s defense workers busy building the best           Lieberman along with Senator Collins sponsored a provision that was included in the bill that addresses the United States    eroding defense manufacturing base   US production continues to drift offshore  and without productivity breakthroughs  the US defense manufacturing base will continue to erode   The Lieberman Collins legislation aims to close the U S  defense manufacturing gap by investing in the research and development of new manufacturing technologies and processes and importantly outlines mechanisms to efficiently disseminate technological developments to the broader defense manufacturing base ensuring the products of these R efforts are effectively implemented        Senator Lieberman co sponsored an amendment with Senator Talent to keep the C 17 production line open   It provides authority for the Secretary of Defense to procure an additional 42 C 17 aircraft once the Secretary of Defense has certified to Congress that the additional airlift capacity provided by the planes is consistent with the Quadrennial Defense Review  QDR    The amendment then lists a number of factors requirements the Secretary must consider as part of his review   The goal of this amendment is to ensure the armed forces have the lift and mobility they need to respond to crises anywhere in the world in short order   The C 17 has proven itself to be a highly capable aircraft that reliably moves troops  equipment and supplies around the world        Senator Lieberman also was successful in adding an amendment to the bill increasing the number of Blackhawk helicopters to be procured in response to attrition from 2 helicopters to 4 helicopters         The bill increases the federal investment in many weapons systems produced by Connecticut companies
