of Millions of Veterans                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Thursday demanded answers about the theft of sensitive information belonging to 26 5 million veterans   A Veterans Affairs Department employee took the information home  in violation of Department rules  The information was later stolen  Lieberman demanded to know what was being done to track whether the information was being misused and what precautions were being put into place to prevent the same thing from happening again  Following is the statement he delivered at a joint hearing of the HSGAC and Veterans    Affairs Committee                    Thank you  Senators Craig  Collins  and Akaka  Thank you for holding this hearing as quickly as we have so that we can get some answers about how this enormous security breach occurred in the first place and how we can quickly assist those veterans to whom we owe so much and who have been put at risk by the loss of this confidential information                   The security of government computer systems and the vast databases contained within them is a subject we on the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee have been working on for some time   As information technology continues to advance by leaps and bounds  we must take equivalent leaps and bounds to protect against theft  misuse  and abuse of information brought together by that technology                   At various times in our lives  we  the American people  are required to provide the government with all sorts of personal information as part of paying their taxes  We do so out of necessity   But we also provide it on a basis of trust   They will not feel comfortable sharing the information the federal government needs if the federal government cannot guarantee it is kept private and secure  This latest incident at the VA is just the latest reminder that the federal government generally  I have concluded  is not doing enough to guarantee that security                     Three years ago  I asked the Government Accountability Office to assess and evaluate federal privacy protections   GAO looked into the privacy practices of 25 federal agencies and reported back that compliance was very uneven and that in nearly one third of cases when agencies disclosed personal information to non federal organizations  the agencies did not have procedures in place to ensure that the personal information disclosed was complete  accurate  relevant  and timely  as required by the Privacy Act                    Last year  Senator Collins and I took the Transportation Security Administration to task for violating the privacy of thousands of commercial airline passengers when it collected and stored personal information about those passengers   Not only did TSA violate its own privacy policy  it also failed to meet the basic requirements of the Privacy Act  which is law                    The VA security lapse is particularly infuriating because of the population of veterans that has been placed at risk  We are here today to get some answers                   I want to know how a Department of Veterans Affairs employee was able to take this sensitive data home in violation of department regulations  I   d like to know why the Department failed to inform the FBI for two entire weeks after the theft   What can the VA and law enforcement agencies do to track whether any of the data is actually used against veterans  so that they can take further precautions  What steps are you taking to make sure that this never happens again  And more generally  can this type of security breach occur at other agencies where sensitive personal information is routinely stored and if so  what are we doing to prevent it                    It is now up to you  Secretary Nicholson  and up to your Department  to help restore the American public   s trust in its Veteran   s Affairs Department  and in the ability of its government as a whole  to carry out its duties without jeopardizing personal and sensitive information the people of this great country have and gave to their government  As apart of that  I hope you will not shrink from holding accountable anyone who was responsible for this failure to protect the confidential information of millions of American veterans  Thank you         30
