volunteered to travel to the Gulf Coast last year to aid victims of Hurricane Katrina  Senator Joe Lieberman  D Conn   praised their willingness to sacrifice for others   But he also cited a report released Monday that shows federal search and rescue teams are still woefully unprepared for disasters                      A year ago this August  we were vividly reminded of the critical role of America   s first responders in times of great national disasters  The first responders from Connecticut who traveled to the Gulf Coast  and all first responders who protect our communities here in Connecticut each and every day  deserve our highest recognition and praise for the tremendous service they provide     Lieberman said                   Lieberman was joined by a group of Connecticut first responders and Red Cross volunteers who traveled to the Gulf Coast following Hurricane Katrina  Three speakers    John Cronin of the Fairfield Fire Department  Lt  Don Smith of the Fairfield Police Department  and Lt  Brad Sherman of the Fairfield Fire Department   offered accounts of their experiences assisting in the search and recovery efforts in the devastated area                   Lieberman also said a new report by the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security exposes the unreliability of FEMA   s Urban Search and Rescue teams  confirming a similar finding of the bipartisan investigation into Hurricane Katrina led by Senator Lieberman and Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Chairman Senator Susan Collins  R Me                         Hurricane Katrina exposed many great weaknesses in FEMA   s ability to respond to disaster     Lieberman said      One year later  it is gravely disappointing to receive this report that shows systemic failures of FEMA   s urban search and rescue teams  Our local communities rely on these federal teams in times of catastrophe  yet this report shows that these teams are still not prepared to perform their duty to assist our state and local responders                   The Inspector General investigated seven of FEMA   s twenty eight search and rescue teams and found that six of the seven were operating below 50  capacity                       I have spent much of the last five years fighting to convince this Administration to get more federal funding for the nation   s first responders  who far too often don   t have the training  equipment and manpower they need to respond to a catastrophe     Lieberman continued     But despite these dangers Katrina exposed  the President proposed cutting DHS   s first responder funding by  610 million for next year                      These cuts include slashing FIRE Act grants by 46 percent     the same program that last year helped the Fairfield Fire Department buy the personal protective equipment you need to do your jobs                        The President also wanted to totally eliminate the SAFER program  which  as you know  helps with the hiring and training of new firefighter recruits  We need to be strengthening these investments  not cutting them   I fought hard  alongside colleagues of both parties to save these programs and last month the Senate passed a homeland security appropriations bill that restores much  though not all of the funds the President wanted to cut                      Our committee also has approved legislation that would provide victims of catastrophic disasters with double the amount of assistance than is available from FEMA under current law  with 39 weeks of disaster unemployment insurance  and other benefits   It would enable FEMA to pay for transporting disaster victims back home after being evacuated  and promote the use of alternative permanent or semi permanent housing  rather than travel trailers   It also requires FEMA to fund more comprehensive mental health services  which is clearly a critical need for many for whom the emotional toll of Katrina has been overwhelming                        This critical legislation should have been passed months ago   But it is stuck in yet another partisan stalemate in Congress    This fall I will be working with Senator Collins to break through the gridlock to get the victims of Katrina     our fellow Americans     back into homes  back into jobs  back into schools and back on their feet
