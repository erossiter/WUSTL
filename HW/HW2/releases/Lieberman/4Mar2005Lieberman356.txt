to publicly reject private accounts funded with Social Security dollars       WASHINGTON     Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  Thursday joined 41 Senate Democrats in opposing President Bush   s Social Security privatization plan   In a letter to the President  the Senators urged the White House to    publicly  clearly  and unambiguously    reject private accounts funded with Social Security dollars                Funding privatized accounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program   s long term problems worse  but many believe it represents a first step toward undermining the program   s fundamental goals     the letter said      Therefore  so long as this proposal is on the table  we believe it will be impossible to establish the kind of cooperative  bipartisan process we need to truly address the challenges facing the program many decades in the future            The other Senators signing the letter include        Akaka  Baucus  Bayh  Biden  Bingaman  Boxer  Byrd

1600 Pennsylvania Avenue  NW  Washington  DC        Dear Mr  President        We write in the hope that we can achieve a bipartisan agreement to strengthen Social Security for the long term and enhance the retirement security of all Americans        Soon after your reelection  you made clear that your Administration   s top priority is to move toward the privatization of Social Security   Your proposal would cut Social Security   s funding by diverting payroll taxes into privatized accounts  which would weaken the program and force deep cuts in benefits   The Administration also has said that its proposal would require borrowing trillions of dollars  much of which we know would come from foreign countries like China and Japan        Democrats in the Congress believe strongly that this approach is unacceptable  and it appears that most Americans agree with us   Funding privatized accounts with Social Security dollars would not only make the program   s long term problems worse  but many believe it represents a first step toward undermining the program   s fundamental goals   Therefore  so long as this proposal is on the table  we believe it will be impossible to establish the kind of cooperative  bipartisan process we need to truly address the challenges facing the program many decades in the future        We were encouraged that Treasury Secretary John Snow suggested that you might be willing to abandon your privatization proposal and move instead to an alternative approach in which investment accounts would be established entirely separate and apart from Social Security   As you know  many Democrats  including President Bill Clinton  have advocated just such an approach  with benefits targeted to working and middle class families who need help the most   So long as such accounts remain entirely independent from Social Security and do not put the program   s guaranteed benefits at risk in any way  we believe they deserve serious consideration as part of a broader effort to promote retirement security        While Secretary Snow   s suggestion was initially encouraging  subsequent reports indicate that you remain committed to your privatization plan and his public comments were little more than a tactical maneuver toward that end   For example  according a story in today   s Washington Post     White House officials are privately telling Republicans that Bush is opposed to the idea  of accounts outside of Social Security   but does not want to say so because it would appear he is not willing to compromise           Given the conflicting and ambiguous reports on such a critical issue  we urge you to publicly  clearly  and unambiguously announce that you reject privatized accounts funded with Social Security dollars or otherwise linked to the provision of guaranteed Social Security benefits   Such a statement would eliminate a serious obstacle to the kind of bipartisan process that Democrats are seeking to truly deal with Social Security   s long term challenges and to improve the retirement security of all Americans          Thank you for your consideration of our views          30
