Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   Wednesday entered the following statement into the record following a Committee hearing on waste  fraud  and abuse in the Iraqi reconstruction contracting process                    I thank the Chairman for holding this essential hearing examining our reconstruction contracts in Iraq                     In virtually every past war  shameless profiteers have swindled the government for an easy buck  Investigations led to shocking revelations after both World Wars   It is the federal government   s job to do its utmost to prevent these abuses  to detect them when they occur  to punish the guilty  and to shed light on the offenses so that we can learn from them  Already  the Administration   s failure to ensure the integrity of the contracting process in Iraq has caused immeasurable harm  and gross neglect by contractors and by agencies responsible for overseeing them has undermined our war effort                   I supported our war in Iraq but I have always questioned the way it was being executed   From the beginning  I have called on the Administration to engage in better advance planning and to commit resources more effectively to ensure a successful reconstruction and transition to democracy   Instead  it has been a much rockier road than it had to be     a just cause marred by poor planning and implementation   For years I and others in Congress have criticized the Administration   s failure to ensure sound contracting practices with respect to Iraq reconstruction  but the problems continue   Our hearing today is focusing on lessons we can learn for the future  and our witness  the Special Inspector General for Iraqi Reconstruction  has provided a valuable set of recommendations that this Committee should seriously consider                     Waste  mismanagement  and fraud have occurred on a massive scale   Billions of taxpayer dollars have been squandered   Our soldiers in the field have been shortchanged  and the war effort impeded   And the only beneficiaries of waste and fraud are the same bad apples who are responsible for it   Halliburton  for one  has overcharged the government over  1 billion  with the apparent approval of the agency responsible for overseeing the contracts   U S  government employees have colluded with contractors in flagrant embezzlement schemes   Some have been prosecuted  but how many other crimes have gone unpunished                   The Special Inspector General has done an exceptional job bringing to light many of the abuses we do know about   Stuart Bowen quickly established a large office in Baghdad  and he and his staff courageously travel throughout Iraq to inspect projects large and small   In one report he documented that the Coalition Provisional Authority could not account for nearly  9 billion dollars it distributed to Iraqi ministries   He documented how Halliburton wasted  75 million on a failed pipeline river crossing project  after the company and the Army Corps of Engineers ignored the determination of its engineering consultant that the complex soil conditions required further study   Just this week  the IG released a damning report describing how the United States Agency for International Development resorted to accounting tricks to hide huge cost overruns from Congress                   Unfortunately oversight has been lacking elsewhere  and the IG has found few allies in this Administration   The Department of Defense Inspector General has never maintained a permanent presence in Iraq   Although the Department of Justice established a task force and announced a zero tolerance policy with respect to Katrina fraud  the Department   s investigative work on Iraqi contracts fraud has been less than zealous   I   m unaware of DOJ having initiated any criminal prosecutions other than those cases it received from the Special Inspector General   And the Administration has been attempting to phase out the office of the Special Inspector General for some time                   Poor policies and practices have marred every aspect of the contracting process in Iraq   In many instances U S  agencies awarded contracts without using competitive procedures at great expense to the Treasury and  ultimately  the American taxpayers   For example  the Department of Defense improperly awarded Halliburton a  7 billion contract for reconstructing Iraq   s oil sector  without first opening the award to competitive bidding   Similarly  USAID waived regulations requiring competition in its reconstruction contracts  an action it could have avoided with better planning   Our government contracting system relies on fair and open competition to ensure the best products and services will be provided at the best price  and in Iraq that principle was too readily abandoned                   Agencies also have failed to oversee contracts they awarded   The CPA lacked contracting regulations or trained contract officers  and the contracting environment there remained chaotic until the CPA   s dissolution   More inexcusable  established agencies sometimes seemed more interested in protecting their contractors than exercising their responsibility to oversee them                    The collusive relationship between the Army Corps of Engineers and Halliburton provides a telling example of this phenomenon   In December of 2003  a DOD auditing agency made a preliminary finding that Halliburton was overcharging the U S  and the Iraqi people tens of millions  if not hundreds of millions of dollars  for importing fuel into Iraq  the final audits determined that the contractor   s overcharges amounted to  263 million   The Army Corps went to great lengths to suppress the results of the audits and to ignore their findings   First  the Corps waived the regulatory requirement that Halliburton justify its prices with supporting data  in a transparent effort to negate the auditors    findings   When the U N  oversight board responsible for safeguarding Iraqi funds requested a copy of the final DOD audits  the Pentagon allowed Halliburton to redact all of the audits    negative findings before turning them over   Finally  the Corps rejected the audits    findings and paid Halliburton for 96 percent of the costs that had been challenged by DOD auditors                   This incident and similar ones starkly illustrate a central problem that has plagued the contracting environment in Iraq   The combination of lack of competitive bidding  poor oversight  and absence of accountability eliminated the safeguards designed to prevent waste and fraud by contractors   These safeguards are doubly important in time of war  as poor contractor performance can imperil our troops and undermine the war effort                    Committing troops to battle is the most consequential decision our government can make   When it does so  it must take no shortcuts in formulating and executing its strategy   When it came to planning and implementing the reconstruction of Iraq  this Administration took far too many shortcuts   We continue to suffer the consequences  as do the Iraqi people   Thank you         30
