Recommendations to Improve Safeguards in FEMA s Disaster Relief Program

Florida Hurricanes  held hearings on weaknesses in disaster relief program that make it susceptible to waste  fraud  and abuse       Washington  DC   Senators Susan Collins  R ME  and Joseph Lieberman  D CT  have made recommendations to the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  to improve the safeguards of its disaster relief program in order to help prevent fraud  waste  and abuse  Senators Collins and Lieberman also released findings of an investigation by the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee into FEMA s administration of its disaster relief program during the 2004 Florida Hurricane Season   Senators Collins and Lieberman led a Committee investigation to examine weaknesses in the program that made it susceptible to waste  fraud  and abuse   In May  the Committee held a hearing that exposed fraudulent claims  wasteful spending  and ineffective government management in FEMA s response to the 2004 Florida Hurricanes       In a letter to FEMA Director Michael Brown  Senators Collins and Lieberman offered extensive comments and 19 specific recommendations aimed at improving the safeguards in FEMA s program  Senator Collins is the Chairman and Senator Lieberman is the Ranking Member of the Committee  which has jurisdiction over FEMA as part of the Department of Homeland Security       We must ensure fairness  accountability  and transparency in the administration of FEMA s disaster relief programs   said the Senators in a joint statement    With the right safeguards  management practices  and oversight in place  we should be able to deliver necessary aid quickly to victims of natural disasters  and also prevent waste  fraud  and abuse       The following is the text of the letter that Senators Collins and Lieberman sent Friday to Director Brown          Dear Under Secretary Brown       Thank you for testifying at the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee   s May 18  2005  hearing regarding FEMA   s response to the 2004 Hurricane season   While the Committee will continue to review the matter and looks forward to receiving your responses to the post hearing questions  at this time we want to share with you some preliminary conclusions and recommendations we feel are necessary to ensure fairness  accountability  and transparency in the administration of disaster relief programs       As you know  the Committee conducted an extensive investigation of FEMA   s response to the 2004 Florida hurricane season   Our staff interviewed over 40 witnesses and obtained over 50 000 pages of documents   The Committee   s investigation found serious shortcomings at key stages of FEMA   s program     the points where FEMA initially designated areas as eligible for disaster relief and later added on areas as eligible for relief  and the point where FEMA contractors inspected individual claimants    damages and FEMA made awards   These serious shortcomings allowed taxpayer dollars to be wasted   FEMA   s administration of the Individual and Households Program  IHP  needs improvement  and FEMA needs to put controls in place to ensure that assistance is provided to only eligible disaster related needs   After a brief summary of some highlights of the Committee   s initial findings  we will describe improvements we believe FEMA must make        Designation of Areas Eligible for Disaster Relief       Florida began to feel some effects of Hurricane Frances on September 3  2004   According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration   s National Weather Service  Miami Dade County did not incur any hurricane force winds  tornadoes  or other adverse weather conditions that would cause widespread damage during Frances    visit to Florida   National Weather Service data indicates that Miami Dade experienced only tropical storm force winds  with the strongest gust reported at 47 mph   It also recorded rain fall accumulation for September 3 5  2004  to be 3 77 inches   The Miami Dade Emergency Operations Center reported that damage from Frances was minimal   Nevertheless  FEMA designated Miami Dade County eligible for Individual Assistance programs without first conducting  as it should have  a damage assessment to determine whether federal assistance was warranted       Although Miami Dade residents did sustain some level of damage  it was not necessarily enough to warrant federal assistance   Assessing damage is a critical function and component in determining whether an area should be designated as eligible for individual assistance disaster relief   Without such a damage assessment  the designation of Miami Dade County as eligible for relief was questionable   This designation made millions more individuals eligible for assistance  further straining FEMA   s limited inspection resources and making the program more susceptible to potential fraud  waste  and abuse        Our investigation demonstrates that this problem extended well beyond the designation of Miami Dade County as eligible for disaster relief   Committee staff interviewed FEMA   s Director of Recovery  who stated that he made both the decisions on which counties to recommend for initial designation as eligible for assistance and which to recommend for later add on designation chiefly based on weather maps   For the initial designation he recommended counties that were directly affected by the initial impact of the storm  and he then recommended counties to be added on to the declaration where the weather maps showed the county had sustained at least tropical storm force winds         Committee staff found that FEMA files generally did not contain adequate documentation     if they contained documentation at all     to support initial recommendations for counties eligible for assistance or to support counties that were later added on as eligible for assistance   Indeed  even though the Director of Recovery admitted he based his county eligibility recommendations on weather maps  the files did not contain the supporting weather maps   In many instances  the information submitted by the State of Florida in support of designating counties as eligible for disaster assistance appear to fall short of regulatory guidelines  which require such requests to be accompanied by appropriate verified assessments   Our investigation has also shown that FEMA does not follow clear or consistent policies and does not always apply factors laid out in federal regulations when making initial county designation decisions or add on county designation decisions         Such inadequacies leave the process through which initial county eligibility decisions and add on county eligibility decisions are made potentially subject to abuse and unfairness and waste of taxpayer dollars         Inspections and Awarding of Damages      Our investigation also found several serious inadequacies in FEMA   s distribution of aid under the IHP   Because the policies  procedures  and guidelines used in Florida were for the most part used throughout the nation  we are deeply concerned about the appropriateness of IHP awards nationwide         Among the many problems found with the inspection and award granting process by the Committee staff and or the Inspector General were   1  funds provided for repair and replacement of household items were based on what FEMA considered to be the value of a fully furnished room  regardless of the actual losses sustained by the applicant   2  inaccurate awards were made for personal and real property damage because of inspector errors in assessing damages   3  in many instances damages were awarded based solely on applicants    verbal representations of losses   4  FEMA failed to provide sufficient guidance for authorizing assistance to replace or repair automobiles and to require validation of damages to vehicles   5  FEMA failed to provide replacement value for automobiles based on the actual value of the damaged vehicle and instead gave  6500 for each destroyed vehicle  regardless of the actual value of the vehicle   6  FEMA failed to establish and apply sufficient criteria to determine when a death directly resulted from the disaster and thus was eligible for funeral expenses   7  there was a general failure to require an applicant to establish that an item was purchased for a disaster related need   8  FEMA   s inspection guidelines contained confusing criteria that inspectors failed to properly apply which resulted in inspection errors   e g   the    home unsafe    determination was often inappropriately and inconsistently applied     9  inspector training was inadequate   10  delays in quality control inspections allowed inspector errors to be repeated without correction   11  FEMA did not adequately oversee its inspection contracts and performance incentives in the contract did not put enough weight on making sure inspections correctly assessed damages   12  FEMA placed too much weight on increasing the speed and volume of inspections without adopting any corresponding safeguards to ensure quality or attempting to prioritize inspections in any way   13  some computer edit checks were disabled and other error checking systems were run only after payments were issued  and  14  FEMA failed to have adequate criteria to apply to determine when expedited rental assistance was warranted and failed to properly administer the program         Necessary Improvements     Based on the Committee   s investigation and the report of the Inspector General entitled    Audit of FEMA   s Individual and Households Program in Miami Dade County  Florida  for Hurricane Frances     which was released at the May 18 hearing  we believe that the following improvements  as well as the recommendations listed in the Inspector General   s report  are necessary to ensure fairness  accountability  and transparency in the administration of the IHP program       1   Modify and clarify regulations  procedures  and policies regarding the initial designation of counties eligible for individual assistance and the subsequent designation of counties as eligible for individual assistance   This should include   a  clarifying under what conditions the    unusual severity and magnitude    exception applies to the otherwise required preliminary damage assessment    b  designating the FEMA official s   if any  authorized to apply criteria to determine when the exception applies  and  c  clarifying documentation and procedures required for initial and add on designations of counties eligible for assistance         2   Review and revise criteria for determining that a home is    unsafe    or    uninhabitable    to provide for more objective and consistent determinations by inspectors and to prevent minor repairs from resulting in a    home unsafe    determination   FEMA should also require inspectors to record deferred maintenance         3   Take steps to ensure that recipients of funds provided for rental assistance know that such funds are for the intended purpose of securing alternative accommodations and  if they are not used for such purpose  they should be returned to the federal government  and take steps to help ensure such funds are actually used for their intended purpose         4   Identify and review those types of claims that are particularly vulnerable to fraud  including personal property losses based on verbal representations and    power surge    claims for appliances  and consider additional safeguards to prevent program abuse   One potential safeguard would be requiring that inspectors document the specific item in question and the evidence relied upon to substantiate the loss       5   Take steps to limit excessive personal property awards for furnishings   Excessive awards can result from the use of the    generic room    concept  which permits applicants to receive awards for furnishings that they never had  and from the use of the    X    level of damage  which enables applicants to receive awards for furnishings that in some instances have not been significantly damaged       6   Establish minimum qualification and training requirements for inspectors  and require that the training include how to detect and report fraud       7   Review and consider modifications to inspection guidelines to require that inspectors better document the types of disaster damages they find so as to enable more meaningful review of initial inspections by FEMA and contractor quality control personnel       8   Review and consider modifications to inspection guidelines to require inspectors to justify that funding recommendations for miscellaneous items  such as generators  chainsaws and dehumidifiers  are based upon disaster related needs       9   Develop criteria and guidelines for determining that a death is disaster related  including a requirement that FEMA document each request for funeral expense assistance in order to support its approval or disapproval        10   Review and improve inspection guidelines and eligibility criteria for determining the need to repair or replace automobiles  including provisions to ensure adequate verification of a disaster related need       11   Modify guidelines to establish a reasonable replacement value for destroyed vehicles  taking into consideration the cost of acquiring a comparable vehicle       12   Review use in response to the 2004 Florida hurricanes of the    expedited assistance    program  in which FEMA provided one month of rental assistance to applicants based on information the applicants provided during registration  prior to any inspection or verification   FEMA should consider ways in which this program  if used for future disasters  can be better targeted toward those with a genuine disaster related need for housing  and develop criteria to identify those situations  if any  under which the program can be used       13   Modify performance incentives under the contract with the inspecting companies to ensure the companies have adequate financial incentives to accurately assess damages and conduct high quality inspections       14   Institute mechanisms  including improved and expanded edit checking capabilities  to ensure  to the maximum extent feasible  that inspector work is reviewed prior to processing payments to applicants       15   Review and  if necessary  modify current contract requirements regarding criminal background checks for inspectors to ensure that background checks are completed prior to deployment of inspectors and that disqualification standards used by the contractors are adequate to protect the public safety       16   Establish standards to ensure the independence of inspectors and require that inspectors recuse themselves from inspections that present a reasonable possibility of an appearance of a conflict of interest       17   Consider the feasibility of prioritizing inspections so that applicants or areas with heavy damage are given priority over those with minimal or marginal damage       18   Review and revise criteria under which clothing awards are made so that awards are made only for eligible needs       19   Take measures to increase oversight of the performance of inspection contracting companies       While we recognize the importance of getting aid quickly to victims of natural disasters  we do not believe that there is any conflict between achieving that vital goal and implementing safeguards against waste  fraud and abuse   On the contrary  implementing prudent changes in the areas identified above will benefit both the real victims of disasters and the taxpayers who fund disaster relief efforts        We would appreciate hearing from you within 30 days on how you are addressing and will address our recommendations  as well as the recommendations of the Inspector General         30
