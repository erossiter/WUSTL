Secretary of State                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 WASHINGTON   Senator Joe Lieberman  D CT  today made the following statement on the nomination of Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State   Lieberman intends to vote in favor of Rice   s nomination when the Senate considers it this week        FLOOR STATEMENT OF SENATOR JOE LIEBERMAN      January 25  2005       Mr  President  I have always believed that our responsibility to advise and consent does not mean that we have to agree with every opinion or every action that the nominee has ever taken  but that that nominee deserves the benefit of the doubt and that our responsibility is to determine whether the nominee is fit for the position for which the President has nominated him or her and whether the nominee  in our judgment  will serve in the national interest   And I conclude that Dr  Condoleezza Rice meets that standard  at least  and much more          Secondly  this element of the context in which this nomination is put before us  we are at war   It is a war unlike any we have ever fought before  And here I speak of the world war with Islamic terrorism   It is joined on battlefield in places like Iraq  of course  but it is being fought in the shadows and corners against an enemy that is driven by a fanaticism and acts without regard to human life     others    or their own        I embrace the best tradition of American foreign policy that always has said that partisanship should end at the nation   s shores   And note that it doesn   t say policy differences should end   It doesn   t say ideological differences should end   It says partisanship should end at the nation   s shores  particularly so when our nation is engaged in a war     a global war on terrorism  a war in Iraq in which Americans have already lost their lives in the cause of freedom and in protection of our security        The nomination of a Secretary of State in a second term of a president naturally is an opportunity  appropriately  for people to raise questions about the foreign policy of that Administration   But in the final analysis I hope it is also an opportunity around this very qualified nominee for us to come together and say to one another and to the world     both our enemies and our allies     that in the final analysis Americans will stand together  shoulder to shoulder  against terrorism     against the enemy     in pursuit of the freedom and liberty and opportunity that Dr  Rice spoke of in her opening statement before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and that President Bush spoke to in his Inaugural Address last week        One of the great strengths that Condoleezza Rice will bring to the office of Secretary of State is that the world knows that she has the President   s trust and confidence and I respect the right of any of my colleagues to reach a different decision today and to oppose this nomination  But I hope and believe that the Senate today  across partisan lines  will resoundingly endorse this nomination and send the message to friend and foe alike that while we have our disagreements  ultimately what unites us around this very qualified nominee in this hour of war is much greater than what divides us        In times like these it is important that the world not only knows that this Secretary of State has the ear of the President  but that she has     if you will allow me to put it this way     America   s heart   A heart that beats with the freedom and security and opportunity that we dream of for our own people and for the people of the world        In the world today  we face a time of such grave peril and great promise   It is in many ways like the time that our predecessors faced after the Second World War at the outbreak of the Cold War         Now  as then  a hostile ideology threatens freedom around the world  as terrorism has replaced communism as liberty   s foremost foe        Now  as then  it is the United States that must show leadership and resolve  as the world   s strongest nation  in the face of this danger  from terrorism  to life and liberty   Not just ours  but everyone who does not exactly agree with the terrorists         Now  as then  the President and members of Congress must depend on the advice and counsel of the Secretary of State as we craft policies with an unblinking resolve that will rally our friends and rattle our enemies  that will diminish  we pray eliminate  the perils we face and realize the extraordinary promises of our time        As our very first Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson once wrote     We confide in our strength  without boasting of it  we respect that of others without fearing it           Jefferson   s 18th Century insights will serve us well in the face of the 21st Century threats that we confront   I know that Dr  Rice understands and appreciates that well        Economic development and trade and foreign direct investment and the spread of modern technology and telecommunications has raised the standard of living throughout the world and connected people of the world as never before   But too many nations and people left behind     because of failed governments or failed economies   They have become breeding grounds for terrorists that threaten us all        Today there is hope   Embers of democracy are beginning to glow where that powerful light has existed little or none before  The Afghans and the Palestinians have recently held successful elections  and this Sunday Iraq will hold an historic democratic election   I know the circumstances are difficult there but having been there myself just a few weeks ago I can speak with some confidence that the turnout will be large and the affirmation of the Iraqi people for a better freer future will be clear        Now whether those embers grow into beacons for the rest of the Arab world or fade into dark and cold will depend uniquely upon strong  skillful American leadership and diplomacy   And I conclude that Dr  Condoleezza Rice is capable of such leadership        Nuclear proliferation threatens the world as Iran and North Korea     and perhaps others     strive to develop deadly weapons that will make the arms race of the Cold War look sane in comparison       In response to these dangers President Bush in his Inaugural Address and Dr  Rice in her testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee last week have set down some basic principles which will guide our foreign and defense policy   They are based on values and hopes that have defined America  freedom  opportunity  faith and community          Let me read a paragraph from Dr  Rice   s opening statement to the Foreign Relations Committee last Tuesday           In these momentous times  American diplomacy has three great tasks            First  we will unite the community of democracies in building an international system that is based on our shared values and the rule of law            Second  we will strengthen the community of democracies to fight the threats to our common security and alleviate the hopelessness that feeds terror            And third  we will spread freedom and democracy throughout the globe  That is the mission that President Bush has set for America in the world   and the great mission of American diplomacy today           Let me read just a few words from President Bush   s Inaugural last Thursday           We are led  by events and common sense  to one conclusion  The survival of liberty in our land increasingly depends on the success of liberty in other lands  The best hope for peace in our world is the expansion of freedom in all the world            This is not primarily the task of arms  though we will defend ourselves and our friends by force of arms when necessary  Freedom  by its nature  must be chosen  and defended by citizens  and sustained by the rule of law and the protection of minorities           Democratic reformers facing repression  prison  or exile can know  America sees you for who you are  the future leaders of your free country            The rulers of outlaw regimes can know that we still believe as Abraham Lincoln did     Those who deny freedom to others deserve it not for themselves  and  under the rule of a just God  cannot long retain it               These principles and policies are neither Republican nor Democratic  they are American   In fact  the words spoken by President Bush last Thursday could just as easily have been spoken by some of the great Democratic presidents like Woodrow Wilson  Franklin Roosevelt  Harry Truman and John F  Kennedy   In fact  similar words were spoken by each of those Democratic presidents at times of crisis  similar in many ways to our own          I hope  therefore  that we will now come together to implement those principles and policies in a way that will spread hope and security and build bridges throughout the world  that the President will reach out to members of both Parties in Congress and we in turn will reach out  halfway at least  and meet him to implement these stirring  uniquely American goals  the policies and principles  with real programs that are effective with public diplomacy and outreach  of economic development  of trade of rule of law but ultimately most important the spread of freedom and democracy   I conclude that Dr  Condoleezza Rice is uniquely prepared by ability and experience to lead this effort as Secretary of State        And now  Mr  President  I want to say a final word about Dr  Rice herself  who I have come to know over the years   President Bush has clearly nominated Dr  Rice to be Secretary of State because he values her experience  he knows her skill and he trusts her counsel         No one believes that this president chose this nominee for Secretary of State fore reasons of gender or race   No one here will vote for her in the Senate for reasons of gender or race   But the fact is that that Dr  Condoleezza Rice is an African American woman and I think in addition to every other standard by which we judge and respond to this nomination we should celebrate the fact that when she is confirmed another barrier will be broken in American life   And we should celebrate this fact because Dr  Rice   s life speaks to the promise of America and in very personal terms says to people throughout the world what America is about and what we hope for them        Let us speak directly   Dr  Rice  born in 1954 in the then racially segregated South  knew the sting of bigotry   No one on the day of her birth could have rationally predicted that she would grow up to be the Secretary of State of the United States of America   But she was blessed with great natural abilities  with a strong family  with an abiding faith in God          She worked hard  as others worked in her time to break the barriers of segregation  to establish the rule of law  to create opportunity   She has earned the nomination that the President has given her          And just as no one in Birmingham  when this African American girl was born in 1954  could have dreamed that she would grow up to be Secretary of State of the most powerful country in the world  there are babies being born today in Baghdad and Ramallah and Kabul and Riyadh and countries and cities throughout the world where no one could dream that they might grow up to be president of their nation or prime minister or foreign minister or president of a high tech enterprise or a professor at a great university   But they will if we  working with the people of their countries  will it          A great man once said that if you will it  it is no dream   And in this hour when our security is being threatened the promise of opportunity can  in response to the source of those threats  become real for tens of millions of children being born and growing up in places today where there is no freedom and no hope   That is the great vision that our country has today          I know that Dr  Rice understands that   Her life speaks to the brave men and women like Dr  Rice who have  working with others  changed our nation  Now she can  and I believe will  help lead our nation to change the world and in doing so to advance our values and protect our security for our children and grandchildren as well          I urge my colleagues to support the nomination of Dr  Condoleezza Rice to be Secretary of State         I thank the Chair and I yield the floor         30
