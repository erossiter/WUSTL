                                                      WASHINGTON     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee Ranking Member Joe Lieberman  D Conn   said Tuesday the Administration   s Fiscal Year 2007 homeland security budget should be increased by  8 billion in order to prevent  respond to  and recover from acts of terrorism and catastrophic natural disasters          In the aftermath of the response to Hurricane Katrina  which exposed deep flaws in the federal preparedness and response system  the Administration   s homeland security budget proposal only recommends an actual 1 3 percent increase over Fiscal Year 2006  an increase that doesn   t even keep pace with the rate of inflation  This cuts or under funds many critical homeland security needs such as first responder training and equipment  port security  rail and transit security  bioterrorism preparedness  and chemical plant security         The Administration s Fiscal Year 2007 budget reflects an inadequate investment of resources that will prevent us from doing what is necessary to protect against  respond to  and recover from acts of terrorism and natural disasters     Lieberman said     Therefore  I am calling for  8 billion in additional funding above the Administration s proposal to restore risky cuts and make significant new investments in a wide array of critical security programs          Senator Lieberman   s requested increases would add  6 3 billion to the Department of Homeland Security   s budget and  1 8 billion to homeland security programs in other departments   The requests will make up the substance of a letter from Senator Lieberman to Budget Chairman Judd Gregg  R N H   and Ranking Member Kent Conrad  D S D       Above and beyond the Administration   s proposals  Lieberman wants                  2 8 billion more for first responders                 1 7 billion more for port security and the Coast Guard                 1 billion for rail and transit security                 1 billion for emergency health preparedness programs                 150 million for chemical security      More specifically  Senator Lieberman recommends a  1 6 billion increase to restore cuts in key homeland security grant programs such as the State Homeland Security Grant Program  SHSGP   Emergency Management Performance Grants  EMPG   the Metropolitan Medical Response System program  MMRS   Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program  LETPP   Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS   and the Fire Assistance and SAFER grants to bring them back to FY2006 levels        As part of the  2 8 billion first responder recommendation  Senator Lieberman is requesting  850 million specifically to help first responders achieve communications interoperability       He is recommending distinct grant security programs for ports   400 million   rails   500 million   transit   500 million   buses   10 million   and the trucking industry   5 million        Senator Lieberman is recommending a near doubling of the Administration   s proposed  934 million for the Coast Guard   s fleet modernization program     for a total of  1 8 billion to accelerate the Deepwater program to a ten year lifecycle  He also proposes restoring  233 million in funding cuts for traditional missions of the Coast Guard  And he is requesting an additional  19 million for the Customs Trade Partnership Against Terrorism  CTPAT  which allows expedited border processing for shippers who have voluntarily implemented certain security measures  and  105 million for the purchase and deployment of additional cargo container imaging systems         Regarding bioterrorism and other health emergency preparedness needs  Senator Lieberman is recommending a  500 million increase to the Centers for Disease Control  CDC  funding for state and local bioterrorism preparedness for a total of  1 3 billion   And he is recommending a doubling of the Health Resources and Services Administration  HRSA  hospital preparedness program within the Department of Health and Human Services to bring it to  1 billion       In light of across the board deficiencies at the Federal Emergency Management Agency  FEMA  demonstrated by Hurricane Katrina  the Senator is recommending doubling the  34 million Administration request for a total of  68 million for the National Disaster Medical System  NDMS  emergency response teams which have not seen a budget increase for three years   Furthermore  he is recommending a  456 million increase for FEMA   s two accounts that fund most of the readiness  response  and recover functions       The Senator recommends an additional  150 million for chemical security programs  to boost the Administration   s  10 million proposal  In Fiscal year 2006  the U S  Coast Guard spent  131 million on security of chemical plants located near ports  The additional  150 million will allow the Department of Homeland Security to invest in the security of inland chemical plants  as well       Finally  the Senator is recommending an increase of  752 million for various aviation security programs  including  92 million above the Administration s  8 3 million request to purchase  deploy  and maintain cutting edge checkpoint technologies   400 million above the Administration request for airport explosives detection equipment   250 million above the Administration s proposal of  50 million for air cargo security programs  and  10 million for general aviation security to address vulnerabilities highlighted in a recent Connecticut report on the subject       For the past three years  Senator Lieberman has criticized the Administration s proposed homeland security budgets for failing to provide the resources needed to protect this country adequately            Not only does the Administration budget cut and under fund critical programs  it fails to outline a comprehensive strategy for filling existing gaps in our homeland defense     Senator Lieberman said      The Administration   s approach simply does not reflect the urgency of the homeland security threats this nation faces          30
