Marshall Wittmann  202 224 4041                                                                                                Lieberman Address to Christians United for Israel                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             WASHINGTON  D C    Senator Joe Lieberman  ID CT  yesterday delivered the following remarks to the Christians United for Israel Conference         Thank you for that kind introduction and that warm welcome   May I in turn greet you with the ancient words of welcome offered to pilgrims in Jerusalem    Bruchim Habaim B Shem Hashem    blessed be those who come in the name of the Lord       That greeting is especially fitting for you because you have come to Washington not just as men or women  Republicans or Democrats  conservatives or liberals   You are here as Christians United for Israel   You represent a powerful force of people of faith in America who have pledged to never forget thee  O Jerusalem       And I know  as a Christian friend likes to remind me  that there are a lot more Christian Zionists in America than Jewish Zionists   And  I know the support of Christian Zionists today is critical to Israel s security and strength  and to America s security and strength       So I am honored by your invitation to speak tonight  to thank you for what you are doing  to exhort you to continue to do more    which is God s work  and to pray with you that you are successful         I begin by thanking your founder  Pastor John Hagee   I would describe Pastor Hagee with the words the Torah uses to describe Moses  he is an  Eesh Elo Kim   a man of God because those words fit him  and  like Moses he has become the leader of a mighty multitude in pursuit of and defense of Israel         You know his story   almost sixty years ago  a young John Hagee sat at his family s kitchen table in Channelview  Texas  heard the news about Israel s Declaration of Independence  and saw how moved his family was by it   Since then  he has been devoted to the defense of Israel  and to its vitality   He has done so because Israel s fight is his fight   Israel s values are his values   And Israel s hopes and dreams are his hopes and dreams         Pastor Hagee  I pray that God will bless you with all that you pray for  and I do so with great confidence because I know what the Lord said to Abraham in Genesis 12 3   If ever there was a man who will be blessed because he has blessed Israel  Pastor Hagee  it is you       And the same is true of all of you here tonight   You are a family of Americans who deeply believe that our nation and the nation of Israel share common origins  values  and bonds   You are a family of Americans who understand that today the same fanatics that shout death to America  also shout death to Israel   And you are a family that will not bend with the political winds because your support is rooted in your faith  which is steadfast  unwavering  and eternal         You reject the temptation of moral relativism   You understand that there is a difference between good and evil  between eternal and temporal  between Israel and other nations         Your values are rooted in the same history  ideals  and dreams that bind together Israel and America  and that form the foundation of these two great nations   both  faith based initiatives         In a literal sense  Christians United for Israel was founded a little more than a year ago  in February 2006   But in a larger sense  it began more than 4 000 years ago with the first words God spoke to Abraham in Genesis 12 1   Now get thee unto the land that I will show thee  and I will make thee a great nation        That was the covenantal promise God repeated to Isaac and Jacob and then to Moses  who  with God s help  delivered the children of Israel out of bondage to Mount Sinai where they received the Ten Commandments   their statement of national values and purpose   and then  40 years later  brought them to the land that was promised to them  to the land of Israel       There  more than 3 000 years ago  King David entered Jerusalem and declared it to be the capital of Israel   He brought the Ark of the Covenant and the Ten Commandments to the City where his son  Solomon  built the Holy Temple to house them and to honor God s creation and God s law   Thus  in one place was established both the political capital of a people and the religious center of that people s faith       Almost 2 600 years ago  on a dark day in history  the Temple was destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar   The Jewish people went into a brief exile  returning 48 years later to rebuild it   It was during that time that Jesus of Nazareth preached  taught  and healed in Israel   But the Temple was to be destroyed once more  a little more than 1 930 years ago  by Titus   And again  most   though not all   Jews were forced to flee Jerusalem and Israel       For nearly 1 900 years  Jews in the Diaspora prayed every day that they be allowed to rejoin their brothers and sisters who had remained in the Promised Land and to reestablish a Jewish nation there   And countless Christians prayed those same prayers  particularly here in America         That collective yearning gave rise to a new political movement at the end of the 19th century   the modern Zionist movement   It was led by Theodor Herzl and a small band of allies   Christian and Jewish   throughout the world  who recognized the threat from the pervasive anti Semitism that infected Europe and began the work to reestablish a Jewish homeland in Israel       Many people said the Zionists were na  ve dreamers  but as Herzl responded   If you will it  it is no dream    And will it they did   And work for it they did   In 1948  their dream was realized with the birth of the modern State of Israel       This is the long odyssey that has brought us here tonight   By standing with Israel today  each of you has joined that journey and taken up the torch that was lit in God s promise to Abraham 4 000 years ago  and carrying it forward to spread that light         I believe that Israel s rebirth in 1948 was divinely inspired by God  but I know that it was realized by the men and women here on earth who worked so hard to make it happen   Israel will be sustained by the work of men and women like you here on Earth   And I know you know how truly American is your support of Israel       Long before the miracle of 1948  the Nation of Israel was kept alive in the hopes and prayers and hard work of Christian Americans  In fact  from the very earliest days of our own nation s history  there has been an inseparable link between the promise of America and the promise of Zion         When William Bradford stepped off of the Mayflower onto Plymouth Rock in 1620  his first words were from Jeremiah   Come let us declare in Zion the word of God    The first American missionaries to the Middle East sailed from Boston in the fall of 1819 with the goal of restoring Palestine to Jewish sovereignty  These brave Christian Zionists and their followers were not peripheral figures on the fringes of American history   They were mainstream Christian Americans       In the first half of the 19th century  the proposition that the United States should actively assist the Jews in returning to Palestine was widely held       As you know  many of our nation s founding fathers were Christian Zionists  The president of the Continental Congress  Elias Boudinot  predicted that  the mighty power of God  would return the Jews  to their beloved land of Palestine         John Adams wrote in 1819   I really wish to see the Jews again in Judea an independent nation         And in 1844  a distinguished Christian professor of Hebrew at New York University became a national leader in the ingathering of Zionists  Jewish statehood  he wrote  would benefit all of mankind  forming a  link of communication  between humanity and God        That distinguished professor  as you may know  happened to share a name with one of his distinguished descendants  who also happens to be a great Christian Zionist today  The name  George Bush   And  when the modern state of Israel declared its independence on May 15  1948  it was officially recognized eleven minutes later by another great Christian Zionist  President Harry S  Truman for the United States of America       These bonds for that purpose explain why America and Israel have stood together and will continue to stand together  Americans and Israelis are the children of freedom  freedom based on our shared faith in God  as our Declaration of Independence makes clear  We share democratic ideals  a culture of economic opportunity  and our political pluralism  These are the values we cherish   the principles that define not just who we are but who we hope to be  They are also  unfortunately  the values that are under attack today        Israel and the United States now confront a common enemy in the forces of radical Islam  For many years  Israelis have been on the front lines as targets of this extremist and perverse theology that will brazenly and unapologetically attack innocent humans  children of God        We say we are in a war against terrorism  but terrorism is only our enemies  methods  not their end  Radical Islam is   a totalitarian theology every bit as hateful  violent and expansionist as the fascism and communism we fought and defeated in the last century   And we must unite again as we did then   as Americans  regardless of party  faith  race  or nationality to defeat the evil that seeks to kill us and our families and destroy the civilized ideals that we cherish       You have come to Washington at a critical time for the future of our country  The war in Iraq is the defining issue for this Congress   but the decisions we will make in the days  weeks  and months ahead about Iraq will have consequences that reach far beyond the terms of anyone now in office        It is my deeply held conviction those who crave for a hasty retreat from Iraq are not only wrong  they are dangerously wrong   for the withdrawal they demand would be a moral and security catastrophe for the United States  for Iraq  and for the entire Middle East  including Israel        Let there be no doubt   an American defeat in Iraq would be a victory for Al Qaeda and Iran    the two most threatening enemies America and Israel face in the world today      The fact of the matter is  you cannot claim to be tough on terrorism while demanding that our military withdraw from Iraq  because it is the terrorists   Al Qaeda   that our military is fighting in Iraq        You cannot claim to be committed to defeating Al Qaeda  while demanding that we abandon the heart of the Middle East to Al Qaeda  And you cannot claim to be tough on Iran  while demanding the very thing that the mullahs in Teheran want most of all and why they are engaged in the cold blooded murder through proxies of our troops in Iraq   the retreat of the American military from the Middle East in defeat  leaving a vacuum that Iran will rush to fill  and asserting its dominance over the entire region       My friends  as President Reagan once said  now is the time for choosing        If we stand united through the months ahead  if we stand firm against the terrorists who want to drive us to retreat  the war in Iraq can be won and the lives of millions of people can be saved  But if we surrender to the barbarism of suicide bombers and yield the Middle East to fanatics and killers  to Al Qaeda and Iran  then all that our men and women in uniform have fought  and died for  will be lost  we will be left a much less secure and free nation  and our Middle East allies   including Israel   will be endangered       Fortunately  you here tonight know that evil will not prevail if good people act   And I know you will not allow Iran and Al Qaeda to triumph over America and Israel         I also know that you are familiar with the Book of Esther   I am particularly fond of this story because its heroine is Esther  which in Hebrew is Hadassah   And Hadassah is the name of my beloved  my wife   so it is special to me       The Book of Esther tells us about the cruel Persian leader who sought to exterminate the Jews   But  a Jewish woman named Queen Esther bravely stepped forward and convinced the king to save her people         Remember  when she first expressed her reluctance to advocate the cause of her people before the King  her uncle Mordechai said to her   Think not with thy self that thou shalt escape in the king s house  more than all the Jews  For if thou altogether holdest thy peace at this time  then will relief arise to the Jews from another place  but thou and thy father s house shall be destroyed  and who knoweth whether have not been brought to the king s house for such a time as this        Dear friends  brothers and sisters in faith  you have heard Mordechai s call  for such a time as this    You are in this time like Joshua and Caleb in their time       Let me explain how I mean that you are like Joshua and Caleb  which grows out of this day in the Jewish religious calendar   This is the first day of the Hebrew month of Av   The celebration of the new month is usually festive  but this day begins a somber day period of reflection and ever mourning concluding in the fast day of Tisha B av  the ninth day of Av  corresponding this year to July 24  which is the day on which the first and second Temples were destroyed         Jewish tradition teaches that another event occurred on the ninth day of Av that speaks to us today and instructs us how to avoid the destruction that occurred on Av ninth  and that the story told in chapter 13 of the Book of Numbers where Moses selects out leaders of the Israelites    men of distinction    to explore The Promised Land and report back  and all of them but Joshua  son of Nun and Caleb  son of Yephunneh  bring back a report that is cowardly because it lacks faith       After they acknowledged that the land they had seen was indeed  flowing with milk and honey   they described the land was populated by giants  As they were quoted in Numbers 13 33   We appeared as grasshoppers to them  and that is how we appeared to ourselves        But Joshua and Caleb disagreed   We can surely ascend and conquer the land  we can surely do it   because they trusted in the promise God had made to Israel   Of that group  only Joshua and Caleb made it to the Promised Land of Israel       Dear friends  you Christians United for Israel clearly follow in the footsteps of Joshua and Caleb   Your faith is strong  and so is your confidence   And so great will be your effect       I thank you and pray that God will bless you and all that you do         30
