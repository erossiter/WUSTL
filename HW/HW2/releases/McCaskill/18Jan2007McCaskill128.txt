passed groundbreaking ethics legislations to enhance disclosure practices  strengthen earmark reform and limit travel  among other things  Presiding from the Chair during the passage of the first Senate bill  Senator Claire McCaskill lent her support for the bill  but was disappointed that a measure to create an independent ethics commission was rejected   Americans spoke loud and clear in November that they want a cleaner  more accountable government and that starts here with the people who represent them in Washington  McCaskill said  I was disappointed  however  that the Senate rejected creating an independent ethics commission to investigate wrongdoing in Congress  I will continue to press my colleagues to adopt this plan in the future   The ethics bill  S 1   which passed 96 2  would provide the strongest limitations on gifts and travel allowed for Members and staff by strengthening the gift ban and strictly restricts travel  including a provision to pay full charter amounts on private aircraft  The legislation would shut the revolving door of Congressional staffers who leave Capitol Hill to be lobbyists by forcing them to take a two year hiatus from their federal position  In addition to strengthening general Senate ethics procedures  the bill would require better lobbying disclosure and transparency practices  Finally  the Senate ethics bill passed tonight would require the most stringent public disclosures of earmark in history   This bill goes leaps and bounds beyond any attempt in the past to rid the Congress of the perks and pork that have cast a dark cloud over this institution  Im proud to bring about the change we need to restore confidence in the American people  McCaskill said   The Senate Ethics Bill   Strengthens Gift Ban   The
