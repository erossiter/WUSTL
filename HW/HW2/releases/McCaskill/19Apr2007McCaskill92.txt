                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senators Barack Obama  D IL   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Kit Bond  R MO   Daniel K  Akaka  D HI   Tom Harkin  D IA   Joe Lieberman  I CT   Patty Murray  D WA   Claire McCaskill  D MO   and Bernie Sanders  I VT  today sent a letter to the General Accounting Office  GAO  requesting a review of the Department of Defense s treatment of service related mental health conditions affecting troops that have served in Iraq and Afghanistan   The letter comes in the wake of reports of poor treatment and conditions at Walter Reed Army Medical Centers  where many patients and family members described not receiving adequate mental health care  and more recent reports that suggest the Department of Defense  DOD  has not effectively screened and diagnosed mental health conditions       Senators Boxer  Bond  and Obama had previously asked that the Department of Defense to examine command practices and culture related to mental health care with no response   As the DOD drags its feet  the senators have requested the GAO to investigate agency practices related to mental health screenings  diagnoses  referrals and treatment of service members        Recent reports suggest that the Department of Defense is ill equipped to effectively screen and diagnose the increasing number of service members who are suffering from mental health conditions such as post traumatic stress disorder   said Senator Obama    I m especially troubled by reports of some DOD commanders downplaying the serious mental health conditions confronting service members returning home from Iraq  and then redeploying those troops without proper treatment    It s time for a full accounting of how many of our troops are affected by post traumatic stress disorder  other service connected mental health conditions  and traumatic brain injuries  and for an evaluation of our readiness to help the generation of soldiers returning home from war rebuild their lives        Senator Boxer said   Two years ago  military doctors informed me that soldiers with serious mental health problems were being denied care and redeployed to Iraq   Sadly  even after we passed legislation and the Defense Department issued new mental health guidelines  they are not being followed   It is time for the GAO to investigate allegations of mistreatment and improper discharges   The health and well being of our service members must be a priority for the Pentagon and for all Americans         Combat stress and its impact on our soldiers and their families is a serious problem that continues to grow   Reports that our military is unprepared or unwilling to deal with Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome or other mental health problems are unacceptable   Being unprepared for these problems is no excuse for inaction  It is our duty to take care of the brave men and women who have answered the call to duty   said Senator Kit Bond        I am deeply concerned about the consequences of the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan on the mental health of those who serve   said Senator Akaka    PTSD and other mental health problems  the often invisible wounds of war  can be terribly debilitating   As a senior member of the Armed Services Committee and Chairman of the Veterans  Affairs Committee  I am working to ensure that our wounded warriors receive a timely diagnosis of mental health problems and prompt and effective response   This effort must begin while servicemembers are still on active duty and there have been far too many reports that this is not happening   The results of this requested GAO review will be of great importance as we seek to ensure that DOD and VA meet the needs of our newest war veterans         With news that our soldiers will be serving longer tours of duty with shorter periods of rest at home  there is no better time to ensure the men and women who serve our country are getting the mental health services they need   said Senator Harkin   We must do away with the stigma associated with mental illness and remove any obstacles to treatment         We have a moral obligation to care for our wounded troops and ensure they receive the best care   said Senator Lieberman    Post traumatic stress disorder is afflicting many of our service members and it is imperative that we accurately and efficiently diagnose and treat it  The stakes are high for those that are sacrificing their lives for our country and we must work together to correct any deficiencies that we find in our military s mental health system         We can t afford to wait until a year after our service members have returned home to discover the affects of the unseen wounds of this war   said Senator Murray   PTSD is taking a horrible toll on our service members and their families and we must be sure today that they are being properly screened  tracked  and treated  We can no longer be unprepared for this mounting problem         Our men and women returning from war should receive mental health care equal to the physical medical care they are given  and anything less is unacceptable   Senator McCaskill said    It took this country 15 years after Vietnam to look at the mental health needs of veterans   We can t do that to another generation of soldiers         The men and women who put their lives on the line for this country deserve the best care we can provide   Senator Bernie Sanders said    What has been revealed about Defense Department health care is a disgrace that needs to be addressed   We need to find out whether there is a concerted effort by the Defense Department to shortchange our soldiers and veterans who are in need of mental health care and other benefits they have earned
