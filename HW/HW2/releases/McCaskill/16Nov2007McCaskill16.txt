                                                        November 16  2007  McCaskill Column  Sick of Foreign Oil  Farming for a Remedy                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      The other day I was shocked to see that the price of oil per barrel shot up to a record breaking  no  make that a record shattering   98 per barrel  According to the handy website   today gas prices hover between  2 50 and  3 00 per gallon in most places in Missouri  This same time in 2002  gas prices were well under  1 50 per gallon   Were no longer just feeling the squeeze at the pump  this problem has us in a full on choke hold  And the pain in the pocketbook has been so excruciating for so long  its almost like were desensitized to it  Folks  we dont have to live with the pain  Together  we can start working toward a cure   The cost of foreign oil goes up when there is volatility in the Middle East  when fewer oil rigs are functional  and when challenges occur within the marketplace  As long as these elements exist  were going to suffer at the pump  But we have an opportunity to look for a solution  a remedy to our ill obsession with foreign oil   The prescription may be as simple as looking at the 2007 Farm Bill   When you think of energy and farming  corn probably comes to mind  right  Corn based ethanol has received a lot of attention for being the be all and end all solution to high gas prices  Frankly  corn based ethanol is only part of the answer   Its essential that we look at potential homegrown energy solutions as a three legged stool  Certainly corn based ethanol is one leg  Biodiesel made from soybeans and other products is another leg  And cellulosic alcohol is another leg with growing opportunities for Missouri   We need to ensure Missouri crops like corn and soybeans have the support they need  both in good times and in bad  We also need to continue to find ways to diversify the types of feedstocks we use to produce our fuel so we arent relying on one source  as we currently do with oil  One option is to provide funding for research and development projects dedicated to using different sources for the production of cellulosic alcohol  including switchgrass  corn stover and woody biomass  which can all be found in Missouri   Im not claiming that the 2007 Farm Bill is some sort of miracle that should replace the Energy Bill  But Missouri crops are an important part of what will be necessary for strong energy legislation   The significance of the Farm Bill to Missouri is not limited to crops alone  In fact  there are 11 titles  or sections of the bill  and they range from trade to livestock to nutrition to commodities  all of which are vital to our state  In these titles  we have an opportunity to provide healthy foods for school children  help the economies of rural communities  and protect farming interests with an adequate safety net   Part of establishing necessary safeguards includes ensuring viability for farmers even during tough times  such as winter ice storms  spring freezes  floods and droughts  Natural disasters have certainly done their fair share of damage to Missouris crop and livestock industries  This bill includes measures to make certain that Missouri farmers continue to be protected in the future   The 2007 Farm Bill also takes steps to reduce waste and abuse  Current corporate loopholes allow some people to take advantage of commodity subsidy programs while struggling family farms are left behind  I am hopeful that a final version of the farm bill corrects this imbalance    These traditional subsidies arent the only problem  The Crop Insurance Program and the Rural Broadband Loan program have also been vulnerable to mismanagement and abuse  Rounding out the rough edges on important programs like these would allow agribusiness to rightfully benefit while making sure tax dollars are spent more efficiently   This bill also helps protect our family farmers by leveling the playing field through the full implementation of Country of Origin Labeling by the 2008 deadline  If I can look at the tag on my shirt to find out where it was made  I should be able to tell where my store bought hamburger came from  Finally  the bill works to protect producers from anticompetitive practices  Keeping an eye out for the little guys means making sure they have a chance to compete   I was deeply disappointed that the Republicans blocked the Farm Bill this past week in the Senate  I look forward to working to bring this vital bill back to the floor  After all  the Farm Bill is voted on only every five years  so Im looking for opportunities to strengthen Missouris rural and farm communities for years to come  Whether its a way to help protect farmers from disasters or a way for our state to play a key role in curing our energy ills  I want to help do whats right for Missouri
