                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 Report Shows Devastating Effects of President s Budget on Rural America WASHINGTON  D C    U S  Senator Claire McCaskill joined Senators from rural states from across the country to release their  Rural Report Card   a report that illustrates the President s neglect of domestic programs critical to rural America  Immediately following the event  McCaskill held a press conference call to talk with local reporters about the specific effects on Missouri       Senators attending the earlier press conference include  Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid  NV  and Senators Blanche Lincoln  AK   Kent Conrad  ND   Byron Dorgan  ND   Debbie Stabenow  MI   Ken Salazar  CO   and Amy Klobuchar  MN                 Rural Report Card  The Bush Budget Fails to Address the Needs of Rural America      President Bush s budget for Fiscal Year 2008 would severely cut programs that directly affect the quality of life of rural Americans   The following  Rural Report Card  is an assessment of the President s annual spending plan and the negative impact it would have on working families  farmers  small businesses  and local economies across the heartland       As this analysis demonstrates  the President s reductions in funding for law enforcement  health care  education  economic development  and agriculture are disproportionately weighted toward rural America   At the same time  the budget would put affordable health care further out of reach for many working Americans     Democrats believe these are the wrong priorities not just for those who live in rural America  but for all Americans       Rural Law Enforcement      Since 2001  President Bush  with the help of Congressional Republicans  has cut funding for state and local law enforcement programs by more than fifty percent   This year s budget would cut  1 4 billion  or 54 percent  in funding for all state and local law enforcement programs in the Department of Justice  DOJ   including programs specifically designed to assist rural communities   Once again  the Bush budget will inhibit the ability of first responders to prepare for new threats and law enforcement to combat the growing methamphetamine problem       Firefighter Assistance Grants   The Bush budget includes a  375 million cut in Firefighter Assistance Grants relative to the level in H J  Res  20  the funding resolution for Fiscal Year 2007 passed by the House of Representatives on January 31  adjusted for inflation   This program  which provides direct assistance for local fire departments to better protect firefighters and the public   The Bush budget eliminates funding for the rural fire assistance program in the Department of the Interior which helps reduce the risk of damage resulting from catastrophic wildfires and supports rural fire departments   President Bush would also eliminate the state and local fire assistance program  which supports cost shared grants to local and rural fire protection districts that protect small communities         Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program   Funding for the Byrne JAG formula grant program is restructured into a competitive grant program under the President s budget   Proposed funding in 2008 is  350 million   This represents a cut of  180 million  or 34 percent  from the H J  Res  20 level adjusted for inflation   This program provides grants to assist state and local governments to improve the functioning of the criminal justice system   with an emphasis on violent crime and serious offenders          Community Oriented Policing Services  COPS    The Bush budget proposes only  32 million for this important program  which is  510 million below the level in H J  Res  20   This program assists state and local law enforcement agencies by providing grants  training  and technical assistance   In particular  the COPS Program has helped cities and counties procure equipment and technology  advance community policing  and combat methamphetamine use and distribution   The Bush budget would provide only  32 million for the COPS program  which supports only programs that currently exist and provides no funding for the hiring of new police officers       Juvenile Justice Programs   The Bush budget proposes elimination of the Juvenile Accountability Block Grants  which support state and local efforts to prevent juvenile delinquency and crime   Under H J  Res  20  the program is slated to receive  50 million in funding   The Bush budget also reduces funding for rural domestic violence and child abuse enforcement grants       Rural Health Care      The Bush budget proposal slashes programs designed to help rural communities address their unique health care challenges   It proposes cutting rural health programs by  146 million  or 89 6 percent  from the H J  Res  20 level   The President proposes terminating outreach grants  rural hospital flexibility grants  the rural and community access to emergency devices program  and area health education centers  which provide vital health and health education services to rural areas       Medicare   Medicare is a crucial source of health coverage for rural America   Approximately one fourth of Medicare s 43 million beneficiaries live in rural areas   The President proposes  76 billion in legislative and regulatory Medicare cuts over five years and  252 billion in legislative cuts over ten years   His budget would reduce payment updates to hospitals and other health care providers participating in the traditional fee for service Medicare program       Medicaid   More than 50 million low income people  about one out of six Americans  depend on Medicaid for their health care   Just last year  the Republican controlled Congress enacted  6 9 billion in Medicaid cuts over five years   Now the President is looking for more   The President s budget  through legislative proposals and regulatory changes  proposes  25 billion in Medicaid cuts over five years       Education      The President has proposed cutting Department of Education discretionary funding by  2 3 billion  for a total of  56 billion   This represents a 3 9 percent cut from the H J  Res  20 level adjusted for inflation   In addition  the President s budget proposes eliminating 44 programs  including Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants  education technology state grants  arts in education  LEAP  and school counseling  and making large cuts to numerous other programs including career and technical education  and safe and drug free schools state grants         School Improvement Programs for Rural Education   The President s budget cuts funding for two vital programs that help rural schools address their unique challenges   the Small  Rural Schools Achievement program which helps fund rural local educational agencies  and the Rural and Low Income Schools program  which targets rural local education agencies that serve poor students   The President s budget provides  168 9 million  the lowest level since 2004 and  3 3 million below H J  Res  20 adjusted for inflation       After School Programs   21st Century Learning Centers provide enrichment and a safe and supervised environment for students after the school day ends   But the President proposes keeping funding for this program flat  at  981 million  which is  19 million less than is needed to provide the same level of services provided in 2007       Special Education   The President s budget proposes that  for the third year in a row  the federal government provide a smaller share of States  total costs for special education   Funding for the Individuals with Disabilities in Education Act  IDEA  Part B State Grants would decrease by  393 million  to a total of  10 5 billion   This would provide just 16 5 percent of the national average per pupil expenditure for educating students with disabilities   down from 17 2 percent in Fiscal Year 2007   In addition  the Administration plans to reduce Medicaid based reimbursements related to services for special education students by  615 million in Fiscal Year 2008 and  3 645 billion over the next five years   Together with the proposed cut in IDEA State Grants  this amounts to more than  1 billion less in 2008 for schools to serve students with disabilities       Economic Development      Rural businesses face a changing global economy and increasing costs  and economic development programs provide them with skills and tools to help them compete   The Bush budget would drastically cut economic initiatives relied on by rural communities   The economic development initiatives specifically benefit communities of 3 000 or fewer residents   These cuts will be detrimental to rural America       Community Development Block Grants   The Bush budget proposes to cut funding for the Community Development Block Grant  CDBG  program by  736 million below the H J  Res  20 level   The budget would also eliminate funding for rural empowerment zones   The CDBG program provides eligible metropolitan areas with annual direct grants that can be used to revitalize neighborhoods  expand affordable housing and economic opportunities  and improve community facilities and services        Economic Development Administration   The Bush budget would cut funding for the Economic Development Administration  EDA  by nearly  80 million   Funding for EDA s traditional economic development assistance programs   public works  economic adjustment and technical assistance   would be eliminated       Manufacturing Extension Partnership   The Bush budget proposes a  58 million cut to the Hollings Manufacturing Extension Partnership  MEP  program  which provides business support and technical assistance services to small manufacturers   The MEP helps American small businesses improve productivity and compete in the global marketplace       Small Business Administration  The Bush budget once again proposes the elimination of funding for the microloan and microloan technical assistance programs  which were funded at  22 million and  13 million respectively in 2007       Rural Housing   The Bush budget would eliminate funding for Rural Housing and Economic Development programs  RHED  and Direct Rental Housing Loans  and would provide  24 million for the Homeless Veterans Reintegration program  which helps homeless veterans become employed in urban and rural areas       Water and Sewer Assistance   Water and sewer grants would be cut by  117 million from 2006 appropriated levels to  349 million in Fiscal Year 2008   These grants assist smaller cities and towns in rural America to provide their residents with safe water and sewer service   Hundreds of thousands of people in the United States continue to have inadequate or no water or sewer service       Rural Businesses   The Bush budget would eliminate Economic Impact grants  Rural Business Enterprise grants  Rural Business Opportunity grants  Rural Community Facility grants  and Rural Empowerment Zone and Enterprise Community grants   These programs provided  80 million toward economic development in rural communities in Fiscal Year 2006       Rural Utilities   Grants and loans to rural utilities would be cut by  1 361 billion  from  7 98 billion appropriated in 2006 to  6 619 billion in Fiscal Year 2008   The budget proposes cutting mandatory broadband assistance loans by  203 million  from  503 million in Fiscal Year 2007 to  300 million in Fiscal Year 2008         Energy   The Administration would increase funding for the grant and loan program for farmers  ranchers  and rural small businesses to buy renewable energy systems and making energy efficiency improvements to  34 million  including  15 million in grants and  19 million in loans   Funding for this program was blocked for the last two fiscal years   In addition  the budget proposes to eliminate high energy cost grants when farmers are struggling to cover skyrocketing energy costs       LIHEAP   The Bush budget requests  1 782 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program  LIHEAP   a  420 million cut from what is needed to maintain LIHEAP funding at the H J  Res  20 level adjusted for inflation   Since 2001  home heating costs have increased by 59 percent while the Bush budget requests have not kept pace       Payment in Lieu of Taxes   The President s budget would cut funding for Payment in Lieu of Taxes  PILT  for the fourth year in a row  from  233 million in H J  Res  20 to  190 million in Fiscal Year 2008  a cut of  43 million   PILT payments help local governments carry out such vital services as firefighting and police protection  construction of public schools and roads  and search and rescue operations       Agriculture       The President s budget includes funding for its proposal for the new Farm Bill  due to be reauthorized this year   The proposal would add  500 million in 2008 and  5 billion over the 2008 to 2017 period for agriculture and nutrition programs  but it is not yet clear how those funds would be distributed         Crop safety net   The Bush budget and Farm Bill proposal would cut the crop safety net and insurance programs by close to  14 billion over ten years and redistribute these funds to other USDA programs   Even when accounting for the increase in direct payments  the Bush proposal would cut the crop safety net by  7 billion       Disaster assistance   Neither the President s budget nor its Farm Bill proposal would provide disaster assistance for farmers   Agriculture producers across the nation suffered from a series of natural disasters during the 2005 and 2006 production years  ranging from excessive rainfall to drought and wildfires   Significant agricultural losses from heavy snowfall and unexpected freezes have also occurred in several Western states thus far in 2007   The Secretary of Agriculture designated nearly 80 percent of all U S  counties as agriculture disaster areas last year   This is an emergency that must be addressed as expeditiously as possible in order for many farmers to secure needed financing for their operations during the current crop year and ensure thousands of farm families are not forced from the land due to events beyond their control       Nutrition   The Bush budget for food and nutrition programs contains several proposals that would eliminate nutrition program eligibility or otherwise have a negative impact on federal nutrition programs for low income individuals   First  the Bush budget for Fiscal Year 2008 proposes eliminating categorical eligibility for food stamp recipients who receive TANF funded work support services   This proposal would eliminate food stamp eligibility for 329 000 individuals by 2009 and cut almost  1 4 billion from federal nutrition programs   The budget also proposes eliminating the Commodity Supplemental Food Program for low income children and senior citizens  eliminating modest monthly food packages for almost half a million individuals  the vast majority of them senior citizens   In addition  the budget proposes to cut funding for nutrition services and education in the WIC program for mothers and children  restricting the WIC Program s ability to provide critical nutrition support and health referral services       Conservation   The Bush budget and Farm Bill proposal would consolidate and restructure conservation programs   The budget contains a  157 million placeholder for conservation programs in 2008 pending reauthorization of the Farm Bill  a cut of  45 million   These programs will receive  202 million in H J  Re
