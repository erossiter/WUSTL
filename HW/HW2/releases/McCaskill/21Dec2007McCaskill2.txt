                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Bond  Boxer  Obama  McCaskill Demand Fair Treatment of Combat Vets WASHINGTON  D C  U S  Senators Kit Bond  R MO   Barbara Boxer  D CA   Barack Obama  D IL   and Claire McCaskill  D MO  are urging President Bush to create aSpecial Review Board fordischargedtroops who served in Iraq and Afghanistan and to place a moratorium on the militarys use of Personality Disorder Discharges   Our government has a lifelong responsibility to care for the brave volunteers who have served our nation honorably in combat  unfortunately  the government is failing some of our wounded warriors  said Bond  It is critical that the government starts treating all of our troops battle wounds  physical and mental  visible and invisible   It belittles the sacrifice of our men and women in uniform when you punishinstead of treatthose with combat injuries  said Boxer  When our brave service members are injured in combat  we cannot deny them benefits  blame their conditions on a pre existing disorder  or refuse them the care and support they deserve   With thousands of American service members suffering every day from the less visible wounds of war  reports that the Pentagon has improperly diagnosed and discharged service memberswith personality disordersare deeply disturbing  said Senator Obama Theseheroes make incredible sacrifices for our country  and our brave men and womenshouldn t have to fight a second war at home to get the benefits and care they deserve  ThePresidentshould halt this practice until the military can review its policies and establish a specialreview board to examine the cases in question   The horrors of war are bad enough without a service member coming home only to have to fight against the government they fought to protect  McCaskill said  Im please to be fighting side by side with Senator Bond in requesting a review board to study personality disorder discharges  so that those men and women who bravely fought for us and returned home with the mental scars from war get a fighting chance to receive the benefits they so greatly deserve   This bipartisan group of Senators has been examining mental health care for service members returning from Iraq and Afghanistan and leading the effort to end the militarys inappropriate use of personality disorder discharges   Much like the program created by President Carter to examine the records of Vietnam veterans discharged less than honorably  the Senators are urging the President to create a Special Discharge Review Program to look at administrative discharges for veterans of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan  If established  the Board would give service members who served honorably in combat but subsequently received a discharge that does not entitle them to benefits the opportunity to have their cases reviewed   This is particularly important for those who failed to receive an appropriate diagnosis of or treatment for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder  PTSD  or Traumatic Brain Injury  TBI   The Senators believe such a process will help reduce the stigmaassociatedwithsuch discharges and allow those whoserved our nation honorablyto resume normal livesafter their service   The discharge review board will also look at cases where service members were diagnosedfor personality disorders In the past six years  more than 22 500 service men and women have been discharged with a pre existing personality disorder  The Senators have expressed concern thatsome ofthese dischargesappear to bethe result of misdiagnoses and arebeing used to force out troopswho may instead besuffering from service connectedpsychological injuries  like Post Traumatic Stress Disorder or Traumatic Brain Injury The use of a personality discharge can result in a loss of disability benefits and medical care from the VA  and can even lead to service members having to repay thousands of dollars in re enlistment bonuses   The Senatorscontinue to urge forthe adoption of short term  commonsense safeguards to protect service members  The Senators emphasize that just limiting the use of this discharge is not enough A moratorium  which would temporarily suspend the Pentagons use of personality disorder discharges for those service members who have served in combat  is necessary until there is a comprehensive review of the current procedures and additional safeguard to prevent misdiagnosis   Bond  Boxer  Obama and McCaskill were joined by a bipartisan group of their Senate colleagues including  Joseph Biden  D DE   Sam Brownback  R KS   Hillary Clinton  D NY   Thad Cochran  R MS   Chuck Grassley  R IA   Blanche Lincoln  D AR   Edward Kennedy  D MA   Patty Murray  D WA   Barbra Mikulski  D MD   Ken Salazar  D
