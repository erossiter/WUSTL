                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   McCaskill amendment creates commission modeled after the Truman Committee WASHINGTON  D C   A landmark provision sponsored by U S  Senator Claire McCaskill  and modeled after a committee established by Harry S  Truman as a Senate freshman  establishing an independent  bipartisan Commission to investigate U S  wartime contracting in Iraq won approval in the Senate in a late evening vote on the Senate floor  The provision won Senate passage during floor debate of the Defense Authorization Bill  which authorizes funding for the U S  Department of Defense for fiscal year 2008   Inspired by the legacy of Harry Truman  who established a committee to fight wartime contracting abuse when he was a freshmen in the U S  Senate  Senator McCaskill and her colleague Senator Jim Webb  VA  led all nine Democrat freshman Senators in offering this legislation which creates a Commission on Wartime Contracting that will assess the extent of waste  fraud  abuse  and mismanagement of wartime contracts  and the extent to which those responsible have been held accountable  The Truman Committee conducted hundreds of hearings and investigations into government waste  saving American taxpayers more than  15 billion  1943 dollars    Never before in U S  history have we seen such waste  fraud  and abuse  costing the American people billions of dollars  This amendment is not about politics  its about reform  It is about looking forward and finding a way to contract that is fiscally responsible while still protecting the strength of our military  said Senator McCaskill tonight   McCaskill spent much of Wednesday and Thursday discussing the amendment with her fellow senators  attempting to win over the votes of colleagues on both sides of the aisle  After debating the merits of the amendment on the Senate floor with Republican Senator John Warner  VA   the former Chairman of the Senate Committee on Armed Services  who became more receptive to the provision during the debate  stated   I must say having been on this Armed Services committee for 29 years with my good friend Senator Levin  we old bulls  as we re referred to  are very impressed with our new member and her vigor and her foresight and her determination to get things done  You ve stirred us up  I think  in a very constructive way if I may say   The commission created by this amendment will significantly increase transparency and accountability  and address longstanding  systematic contracting problems with defense contracting by studying and investigating the impact of the governments growing reliance on civilian contractors to perform wartime functions  Contractors in Iraq and Afghanistan now outnumber U S  troops   In a closing statement following passage on the Senate floor  Senator McCaskill rose and invoked the words of Truman to crystallize the importance of this legislation  We intend to see that no man or corporate group of men shall profit inordinately on the blood of the boys in the foxholes   The modern War Contracting Commission would work in partnership with the Special Inspector General of Iraq Reconstruction  SIGIR   The legislation expands the oversight of the SIGIR to include investigations of all contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan  not just Iraq reconstruction  This expansion is in response to recent reports of contractor abuses  including the latest federal investigation of Blackwater which had the largest security contract in Iraq   The measure attracted the bipartisan support and had the backing of taxpayer watchdog groups including  the Project on Government Oversight  Taxpayers for Common Sense  the Government Accountability Project  OMBWatch  Common Cause  U S  PIRG and Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America   Specifically  the amendment     Establishes an independent  bipartisan eight member Commission on Wartime Contracting to study and investigate federal agency contracting for   1  the reconstruction of Iraq and Afghanistan   2  the logistical support of coalition forces in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom  and  3  the performance of security and intelligence functions in Operation Iraqi Freedom and Operation Enduring Freedom      Expands the Special Inspector General for Iraq Reconstructions  SIGIRs  jurisdiction beyond Iraq Reconstruction and Relief Funds to virtually all wartime contracts executed in support of either Operation Iraqi Freedom or Operation Enduring Freedom  In consultation with the Commission  the newly expanded SIGIR will conduct audits of wartime support contracts for logistics and security functions in Iraq and Afghanistan  as well as reconstruction contracts in Afghanistan  The collaborative effort between the Commission and SIGIR is designed to lead to specific findings and recommendations to improve inter agency wartime contracting  among other things     Requires a study and investigation into the impact of the governments growing reliance on civilian contractors to perform wartime functions  The commission will assess the extent of waste  fraud  abuse  and mismanagement of wartime contracts  and the extent to which those responsible have been held accountable  The number of contractors  180 000  now exceeds the number of American troops in Iraq and Afghanistan  156
