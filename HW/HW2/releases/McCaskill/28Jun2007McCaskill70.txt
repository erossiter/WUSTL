                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Senator s first bill would strengthen key oversight offices of the federal government WASHINGTON  D C   Thirty years after Congress first created Inspector General  IG  offices to review the efficiency of government programs  U S  Senator Claire McCaskill introduced legislation to further strengthen the system and ensure that government remains fully accountable to its citizens  The legislation  entitled the Improving Government Accountability Act  would work to guarantee qualified individuals are appointed to inspector general positions  IGs remain independent from inappropriate influence or pressure from the government agencies they oversee  and IG reports are easily accessible to the public   If we cant keep government accountable to the people  we arent doing our job  McCaskill said  Inspectors General have been rooting out government waste and inefficiencies for three decades  and its time to update our laws to make sure that these offices have the tools and resources they need to remain independent and effective watchdogs for decades to come   Recent allegations against a few IG and government officials have called into question whether current law goes far enough to ensure that IG offices fulfill their designed purpose  In the case of NASA IG Robert Cobb  who had no audit or investigatory experience before his appointment  he has been accused of consulting with agency heads for guidance and interfering with search warrants  apparently trying to protect the agency from public embarrassment    Other IGs have been tied to potential misconduct as well  The Office of Special Council concluded that Department of Commerce IG Johnnie Frazier had wrongfully retaliated against employees who had questioned his excessive travel  and the Acting IG for the Environmental Protection Agency is currently being investigated for his plan to cut 60 staff members  Around the same time  he took a  15 000 bonus from the agency  In an instance of apparent misconduct by agency officials  former Homeland Security IG Kent Irvin has claimed he was not re appointed to his position because some in the agency had labeled him a traitor and a turncoat   McCaskills bill  the first to which she is the lead sponsor  will strengthen IG offices by addressing some of the systematic problems that have led to such incidents   Specifically  the legislation will require that    All IGs be appointed for seven years and are removable only for cause  Congress must be notified about the removal of an IG before it occurs and given a specific reason for the action   No IG can accept a bonus   Instead of submitting their annual budget requests to the agencies they oversee  IGs would submit those requests to the Office of Management and Budget  OMB  and to Congress  OMB is the budget arm of the entire executive branch that determines the Administrations budget request to Congress     All IGs have their own legal counsel  allowing them to avoid a conflict of interest created by using agency counsels   The Council on Integrity and Efficiency for Inspectors General will receive  review  and refer for investigation allegations of wrongdoing against Inspectors General or certain other staff members  In the event of a vacancy  the Council for Integrity and Efficiency will recommend three possible replacements to the appointing authority    Credentials required of all IGs would be strengthened to assure that those in these oversight positions have oversight and management experience    All IG websites be directly accessible from the home pages of agency websites and reports are posted within 24 hours of their release  An informal survey of government agencies found that many IG websites are not updated regularly and many agencies fail to include direct links to the IG page on their website    The legislation is similar to a bill that is gaining momentum in the House of Representatives  Congressman Jim Cooper  D TN s bill was the subject of a recent House oversight committee hearing   IGs are the government s first line of defense against waste  fraud and abuse  Sen  McCaskill has already built an impressive reputation as a Senate watchdog  and I m thrilled to have her leading the fight over there for IG reform  I m confident we can convince our colleagues to strengthen the role of IGs and give them greater independenceCooper said   McCaskills legislation also has been endorsed by the Project for Government Oversight  POGO   a non profit government watchdog                    Questions or comments        Text Size
