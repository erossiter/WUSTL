                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             A column by Senator Claire McCaskill                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              When the U S  Senate recently took up the immigration bill  there were hours and hours of complicated discussions about what to do about the problem  I believe it could be addressed in a very simple way  As a former prosecutor  I believe it is about following the law  As an auditor  I believe it is about following the money   We have crimes we can deter in this country  and we have crimes we cannot deter  A crime we can deter is the hiring of illegal immigrants  if we prosecute the people who are hiring them  Other business owners will stop hiring illegal immigrants if they see businesses being held accountable  However  what is hard to deter is families who are trying to feed their children    As to putting up a wall  yes  border enforcement is a critical part of the answer As a former law enforcement official  I support enforcing the law against anyone who breaks the law  But let s be realistic about this  as an auditor  I want to be both efficient and effective    Is it going to be efficient and effective to think we are going to solve this problem at the border  It is not the border that is going to stop the people coming into our country illegally  It is what is on the other side of the border  It is the promise of that job and the hungry mouths they are trying to feed    So when I looked at the raid that occurred in Butterfield  Missouri a few weeks ago when over 100 illegal immigrants were arrested  I kept watching the news for some word about that employer  but there was nothing    I know what theyll say  The employers defenders will say  but that employer down near Springfield at the chicken processing plant didnt know  the workers had fake IDs  They had fake Social Security numbers  If anyone believes that employer did not know they had illegal immigrants working there  I have a bridge I want to sell you  Of course they knew    If you had a good prosecutor and a couple of investigators  in no time at all youd have the evidence to prove that thousands of employers in this country are not playing by the rules  But thats not happening right now and the employers who hire illegal immigrants know they dont have to worry because no one is interested in putting them in jail   Is that fair  No  it is not fair  Its not fair to American workers  Furthermore  its unfair to the businesses that are playing by the rules  It is fundamentally unfair that many businesses in America are requiring the kind of documentation that assures them they are following the law while other employers are paying cash under the table to pad the bottom line  Follow the money    Under current law  employers right can serve up to 6 months in prison  If we prosecuted more employers  it would do more to shut the flow of illegal immigrants  frankly  than all the legislation we could ever pass in Congress because it would send the message to American employers that they are not going to be rewarded with more profits by breaking the rules    If we want to stop illegal immigration in this country  we have to get serious about the magnet that is drawing these people to our country  instead of looking the other way when people hire illegal immigrants  Until we stop looking the other way  ignoring those businesses that are not playing by the rules  we will never effectively deal with immigration in this country    This doesnt have to be complicated  Enforce the law  It is a mistake to toy and allow bureaucrats to decide who has broken the law  like one amendment I opposed  Rather  when someone breaks the law they should be brought in front of our criminal justice system and be accountable to the courts   But frankly  we dont even need this legislation to be effective  If this Administration would only enforce current law  it would make a tremendous difference   In fact  I voted against the Senate immigration bill for a number of reasons  but there were two that really stuck out at me  I could not support the expansion of a broken guest worker program and I did not think the employer sanctions were tough enough    Despite the fact that the immigration bill failed  we can still be effective at curbing the illegal immigration problem we have in this country if we are serious about cracking down on employers   And if this President is serious about illegal immigration in this country  I suggest he call his Attorney General and tell him that he wants employers who are knowingly hiring thousands of illegal immigrants to be prosecuted under the law and to spend some time in jail  That would get to the bottom of the problem                     Questions or comments        Text Size
