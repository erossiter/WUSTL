                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Mortgages today  credit cards tomorrow                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           If you havent heard about subprime mortgages before now  brace yourself  This looming financial crisis isnt going away anytime soon   Sadly  weve only just begun to hear about the impending economic consequences that will result from the plummeting housing market  predatory lenders who knowingly took advantage of at risk consumers  pursuits of the American dream gone awry  local job loss as a consequence  and the worsening national economic forecast that some characterize as a recession   As the housing bubble bursts  it will be felt by the nation as a whole  In fact  reports indicate that by 2009  approximately 20 000 Missourians will lose their homes due to this unfortunate trend   While everyone should have seen this crisis on the horizon  Washington is desperately trying to do whats necessary to head it off at the pass  To start with  the U S  Treasury recently announced that they are temporarily freezing interest rates to allow homeowners to refinance  This week  even central banks in North America and Europe  including the United States  put forth a plan to help ease the oncoming threat to the credit markets   The U S  House of Representatives passed encouraging legislation to prevent future abuses and I  for one  was eager to sign on as a cosponsor of the Senate bill introduced this week that would provide a comprehensive approach to tackle this issue   If theres one thing I know to be certain about Washington  its that nothing moves very quickly through the system  As a result  while I believe these policies can be effective  I dont expect many of these solutions to provide the immediate assistance some homeowners need   For the thousands of Missouri homeowners who are at risk of foreclosure or who have lost their homes already  awareness and education are the first steps  I was pleased to recently kick off the first of several free foreclosure clinics around the state  The idea is to bring together industry and government experts to provide information and advice to Missourians about foreclosures   Those who attended the clinic were comforted by the fact that they arent the only residents faced with this difficult scenario and  hopefully  walked away with a better understanding of their options   Undergoing a financial crisis is a personal tragedy for a family  but enough families are affected that it is beginning to take a toll on the U S  economy   But debt associated with the mortgage crisis is not the only problem that will harm our economy in the coming years  The Federal Reserve says that in 2006  American credit card debt was as high as  887 billion  which is  100 billion more than in 2003   This is just a matter of waiting for the other shoe to drop  and well be facing a similar crisis with credit cards  But Congress may have an opportunity to help stop the downward spiral of the massive debts people are incurring   I recently participated in a hearing before a Senate subcommittee that investigated the tactics credit card companies use to raise interest rates on accounts  It was astonishing  Credit card companies are setting consumers up for failure   If youve ever opened an account at a department store to save the extra 10   paid the minimum balance on your credit card on time month after month  or come close to without exceeding your credit limit  did you know that could result in a higher interest rate on one or more of your credit cards    In other words  play by their rules and pay your bills on time and your interest rate is still likely to go up  Before a consumer realizes what happened  they have credit card debt that may take decades to pay off and  if the interest rate is high enough  it may be an even worse consequence   Whether its a mortgage lender who misleads a consumer into biting off more than they can chew on a loan  or a credit card executive who comes up with the next sneaky way to rope a consumer into debt that will strap them for life  these abusive practices are just plain wrong    The government can help curb these abuses and aid consumers by making policies to ensure that credit card companies are clear about the fees and interest rates consumers will have to pay  even when they pay on time  I am fighting for legislation to stop these unfair practices  and hope to see it enacted soon  In the meantime  we all have a responsibility to say no to credit card companies that use abusive tactics  It may seem nave  but if more us pointed out their dirty tricks  maybe theyd start to clean up their act                    Questions or comments        Text Size
