                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senator Claire McCaskill today joined 78 of her Senate colleagues in passing final higher education legislation aimed at making college more affordable and accessible to low income and middle class students  As the bill makes its way to the President  McCaskill urged him to sign the legislation into law and offer thousands of Missourians a shot atbetter opportunities   More and more Missourians are finding college to be financially out of reach due to rising college tuition  McCaskill said  The bill we sent to the President today gives more students a chance to get a quality college education and help America remain competitive in a growing global marketplace  I urge the President to sign this bill into law to help achieve that goal   Statistics show that it is becoming harder and harder for American families to afford to college  In Missouri  between the 2000 2001 and 2005 2006 school years  the cost of attending a four year public college in Missouri  including tuition  fees  room and board  increased 45 percent  from  8 201 to  11 861  The cost of attending a four year private college in Missouri has increased 26 percent Meanwhile  family incomes in Missouri are not keeping up  the median household income actually decreased by 5 percent over the same time period   As a result  Missouri students are taking on more debt to pay for college  59 percent of Missouri students graduating from four year institutions in the 2004 2005 school year graduated with debt  owing an average of  16 505   The bill heading to the presidents desk today is a compromise between the House of Representatives and Senate versions of higher education legislation McCaskill voted for earlier this year  Like that bill  todays legislation contains provisions that will directly help middle class college students and their families   The legislation will work to address these problems by   Increasing Student Aid and Addressing Rising College Debt   Increases access for low income students by increasing the maximum Pell Grant by  500 next year and to  5 400 by 2012  and simplifies the financial aid process for low income students by increasing the income level at which a student is automatically eligible for the maximum Pell    Eases the burden on borrowers by cutting student loan interest rates in half to 3 4 percent for undergraduate students with subsidized student loans    Protects borrowers by capping monthly loan payments at 15 percent of discretionary income    Protects working students and ensures they are not penalized by increasing the amount of student income that is sheltered from the financial aid process  and   Encourages public service by providing loan forgiveness for public service employees    Increasing College Access and Preparation Programs   Restores funding for Upward Bound  a key college access program  and creates College Access Challenge Grants to increase college outreach activities in every state    Bringing Good Teachers to the Schools That Need Them Most   Creates incentives for good teachers to teach in high need schools by establishing new TEACH Grants that provide scholarships of  4 000 year for high achieving undergraduate and graduate students who commit to teaching a high need subject in a high need school    Reforming the Student Loan System so it Works for Students  Not Banks   Ensures the system works for students and saves taxpayer dollars by directing unnecessary lender subsidies to student aid and injecting competition into the loan program    Strengthening Minority Serving Institutions   Invests an additional  500 million in these institutions    The Senate Higher Education Act Reauthorization Bill Would Build on These Efforts By    Protects students by ensuring colleges recommend lenders to their students based on the best interest of students  not the self interest of financial aid officers  and cleans up the industry by prohibiting payments from lenders to schools school officials that create conflicts of interest    Simplifies the FAFSA  by immediately creating a new 2 page EZ FAFSA for low income students  and phases out the current 7 page FAFSA for all applicants within 5 years    Facilitates student planning by creating a pilot program that allows students to receive an aid determination or estimate in their junior year of high school  and   Holds colleges accountable for rising costs by publicizing colleges whose costs increases outstrip those of their peers  and ensures students and parents have access to objective data about the cost of college                      Questions or comments        Text Size
