                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              The Senate Armed Services Committee approves three McCaskill provisions and sends bill to the Senate floor WASHINGTON  D C   The Senate Armed Services Committee today adopted three amendments offered by U S  Senator Claire McCaskill  all aimed at further boosting the military healthcare and benefit improvements included in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act  The provisions expand the bill to require a landmark study of needs of troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  enhance healthcare for family members caring for wounded warriors  and ensure that the unique needs of women service members are considered as the Department of Defense develops and implements health care and disability policies   McCaskills amendments  all passed unanimously  significantly strengthen the broader bill  which also includes the major provisions of the legislation she introduced with Senator Barack Obama  D IL  to address serious problems in patient care at Walter Reed Army Medical Center earlier this year  Like McCaskill and Obamas Dignity for Wounded Warrior Act  the committee legislation already included key provisions that would cut Pentagon red tape  improve military medical facilities  and increase oversight at our nations military hospitals   The men and women fighting for our country deserve only the best  and they shouldnt have to fight for good care when they return  McCaskill said  This bill  along with the additional provisions we were able to add today  will go a long way towards helping service members and their families receive the treatment they truly deserve   McCaskill was successful in adding an amendment that will require the National Academy of Sciences to complete a comprehensive study of the physical health  mental health  and readjustment needs of those returning from Iraq and Afghanistan  The study  which is modeled after the landmark readjustment study conducted ten years after the Vietnam War  will examine the mental health needs of service members and their families  the diagnosis and treatment of post traumatic stress disorder and traumatic brain injuries  and vocational training needs for veterans re entering the civilian workforce  The study also will look closely at the needs of military children affected by their parents deployments to war   The study conducted after the Vietnam War gave us a wealth of knowledge about how to better treat the brave servicemen and women who came home with very unique injuries  It was just too bad that it took ten years before we had that vital information  McCaskill said  We now have the chance to take abroad look at the unique injuries of the men and women coming home fromoverseas combat tours so that we can learn how to take care of them adequately and immediately   The committee also approved a McCaskill provision that will expand health care coverage for family members caring for wounded members of the military  Non dependent family members of those wounded often lose health insurance when they leave their jobs to relocate in order to care for their loved ones being treated at military hospitals   McCaskill s third amendment addresses the unique health care needs of women service members  It is well documented that women veterans at times have differing medical and recovery needs then male veterans  The McCaskill provision will require the Department of Defense to take the needs of women into consideration as they are developing and implementing healthcare and disability policies    Acclaimed veteran advocate Bobby Muller  a paralyzed Vietnam veteran whofoundedthe Vietnam Veterans of America and is current head of Veterans for America  made the following statement in regards to committee passage of the measures   Veterans for America applauds Senator McCaskill and Senator Obama for their work on behalf of our troops who have served in Iraq and Afghanistan  Senator McCaskills amendments to the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act address many of the unmet needs of this generation of service members  veterans  and their families  as highlighted by the shortcomings at Walter Reed  as well as elsewhere in the DOD and VA health care systems   Muller is also co founder ofThe International Campaign to Ban Landmines  which won the 1997 Nobel Peace Prize largely as a result of Muller s efforts    The McCaskill provisions included in the legislation come just weeks after she traveled across Missouri meeting with veterans  Both the amendments and bill reflect priorities the veterans asked McCaskill to take back to Washington including bringing an end to an unfair policy where combat related veterans  disability benefits are reduced by their active duty disability severance   McCaskill said today she is pleased the Senate is moving forward with reforms to the healthcare system for active service members  but she is pushing for the Senate to quickly turn its attention to reforming VA health care and benefits                    Questions or comments        Text Size
