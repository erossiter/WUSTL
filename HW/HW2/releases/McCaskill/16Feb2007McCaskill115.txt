                                                        February 16  2007 McCaskill Makes Good On Campaign Promise to Cut Middle Class Taxes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                WASHINGTON  D C   U S  Senator Claire McCaskill and her freshman colleagues joined Senator Chuck Schumer to introduce the  Middle Class Opportunity Act of 2007   which would provide tax relief for middle class families  Similar to the tax cut package McCaskill presented during her campaign  this measure would focus on tax relief for families balancing work  caring for children and parents  and saving for college and retirement         For the past six years the President has cut taxes for millionaires and as a result  corporate executives are making out like bandits by way of economic growth limited to Wall Street while the rest of America still feels the squeeze   McCaskill said   The middle class is the real engine that drives our economy  It s time we reroute those tax cuts to give the middle class a break in a way that helps fuel our economy for all Americans        The Middle Class Opportunity Act would provide  80 billion of tax relief from 2007 to 2010 through four main provisions  The Middle Class Opportunity Act would help families with young children by doubling the child tax credit in the first year and expanding the dependent care tax credit  It would allow families to avoid unfair tax penalties by providing additional relief from the individual AMT  It would make it easier for families to send kids to college via the simplification  consolidation  and expansion of the various tax benefits for higher education  Finally  it would provide a new elder care credit for families caring for their aging parents        The years of favoring the wealthy and big oil companies are over   Schumer said   This bill makes good on our promise to provide real relief for middle class families  Everyone should be able to afford a house  raise a family  help their kids get ahead with a college education  and care for their elderly parents without having to take on a second job or extra shifts        Many of the freshman Senators have been credited with winning their races in November and turning the tide for the Democratic majority in Congress by focusing on the needs of middle class families  like education  health care and jobs  McCaskill and her freshman colleagues were pleased to have an opportunity to be involved in legislation that would allow them to move forward on many of the ideas they focused on in the campaigns that sent them to Washington        The vibrant middle class that made this country great has been abandoned  said Senator John Tester  D MT    We need legislation that will help folks that are struggling to pay for health care  putting kids through school  taking care of an aging parent  or maybe all three   This bill does just that and it s the kind of policy that the people of Montana sent me here to support        Senator Amy Klobuchar  D MN  said   Our proposal offers real solutions that that will make a real difference in the pocketbooks and wallets of working families  It puts the interests of the middle class front and center  and it does so in a fiscally responsible and appropriate manner         Corporate driven myopia on our economic policies has favored the wealthiest one percent for too long  These tax cuts are an important first step toward directing policies in Washington that support our nation s middle class   said Senator Sherrod Brown  D OH       The Middle Class Opportunity Act      Doubling the Child Tax Credit in the First Year   Middle class families spend an average of  20 000 on a newborn child before he or she turns two  This bill would double the child tax credit to  2 000 in the first year of a child s life  or in the first year after a child is adopted  to help parents defray the expenses of a new baby         Expansion of Dependent Care Tax Credit  DCTC    The bill would extend the Dependent Care Tax Credit to cover 35 percent of qualified childcare expenses for families earning up to  75 000         Relief from the Alternative Minimum Tax   Under current law  families with incomes between  75 000 and  100 000 are in danger of falling under the AMT for the first time in 2008  sticking more than 20 million taxpayers with an average tax increase of  1 000  This bill would extend AMT relief through 2008 to prevent these families from falling under the AMT         Higher Education Tax Relief   This bill will help cut through the confusion that parents face when trying to pay for college by consolidating the three major tax deductions and credits for higher education into one easy to understand tax credit that will cover tuition  fees  and even textbooks  The credit can be used for undergraduate or graduate education  saving middle class families up to  2 500 per student       Caring for Aging Parents   Under current law  only families who have elderly parents living with them are eligible to claim the dependent care tax credits  This bill would allow families to claim the dependent care tax credit or the earnings exclusion under a dependent care assistance program for qualified dependent care expenses paid on behalf of an aging parent who does not live with the family   Given that nearly half of caregivers contribute financially this care  this would save families an average of  200 per month                    Questions or comments
