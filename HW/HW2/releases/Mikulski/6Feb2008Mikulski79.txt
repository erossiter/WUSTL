SEN. MIKULSKI PLEDGES TO CONTINUE FIGHT FOR BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE MILITARY CONSTRUCTION IN MARYLAND
  Senator Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the fiscal year 2009 budget proposal includes $1.28 billion for construction at Maryland military installations, including nearly $865 million for projects related to executing the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's recommendations. Senator Mikulski also vowed to continue her fight to restore the $1 billion President Bush cut for BRAC-related military construction projects last year.
   "My promises made to BRAC-impacted communities are promises kept. BRAC brings opportunities, but it also brings great challenges. We must now work together to help Maryland address the increased demands on our communities," said Senator Mikulski. "President Bush continues to spend billions of dollars every week to pay for the War in Iraq, while at the same time cutting funding to support the everyday needs of Americans and our military here at home. How can President Bush ask so much while providing so little? I will continue to focus on how federal dollars can help our counties, and fight for an increased federal investment in these priorities." 
   In response to the veto threats from President Bush, Congress cut $1 billion from the BRAC Military Construction account in the fiscal year 2008 omnibus spending bill that became law in December. One day after the bill passed Congress, Senator Mikulski, chair of the Maryland Congressional Delegation, was joined by all of her "Team Maryland" colleagues in sending a letter to Secretary of Defense Robert M. Gates, urging him to fund the military construction projects in Maryland that are required under the 2005 BRAC process. For more information, go to: http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=289781. Senator Mikulski and Team Maryland will continue to fight to ensure that Maryland's BRAC military construction projects are fully funded.
