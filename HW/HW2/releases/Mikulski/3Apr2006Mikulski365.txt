SEN. MIKULSKI GOES DOUBLE OR NOTHING FOR SECOND NORTH CAROLINA MATCH-UP IN MARYLAND-DUKE GAME
  With the University of Maryland Terrapins victory against the University of North Carolina Tar Heels in the Women's NCAA Final Four basketball game Sunday night, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) is doubling the stakes in her wager with Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) as the Terps go on to face North Carolina's Duke University Blue Devils in the final game tomorrow at 8:30 p.m.  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   April 3, 2006 
   Dear Senator Dole: 
   I could gloat. I could make you do the walk of defeat to my office, bringing the sweet smell of North Carolina barbeque to my door. Because last night, the University of Maryland Terrapins brought the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to their knees. 
   But I won't. Because the Terrapins will face your state once again in a Duke University Blue Devils match-up tomorrow. And that means more barbeque for me. 
   I propose we raise the stakes and go double or nothing on the final game. The Terrapins are ready to "duke" it out with you, but 5 million Marylanders stand united in warning you once again to "fear the turtle!"
