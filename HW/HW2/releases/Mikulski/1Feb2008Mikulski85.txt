SEN. MIKULSKI KICKS OFF AMERICAN HEART MONTH WITH VOW TO CONTINUE FIGHT FOR HEART FOR WOMEN ACT
  As American Heart Month kicks off today, Dean of the Senate Women Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) said she will continue her fight to pass the Heart Disease Education, Analysis and Research, and Treatment (HEART) for Women Act, which she re-introduced with Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Ark.) last February.  
   "Today, doctors, scientists, members of Congress, and the American public know that women and men have different bodies and different health care needs. Despite these differences, men's health needs have set the standard for our health care system and our health care research agenda," said Senator Mikulski. "One study on heart disease risk factors was conducted on 13,000 men - and not one woman. But the results of studies like these were applied to both men and women. This neglect put women's health and lives at risk. As Dean of the Senate women, I will continue to fight to get this bill signed into law and to improve the health of American women." 
   The HEART for Women Act would improve heart disease and stroke prevention, diagnosis and treatment by: 
   * Raising awareness among women and their health care providers by authorizing grants to educate health care professionals about prevention and treatment of cardiovascular diseases. It also authorizes the Medicare program to conduct an educational awareness campaign for older women. 
   * Providing sex- and race-specific information for clinicians and researchers. The legislation would require that health care data that is already being reported to the federal government be stratified by sex, race and ethnicity. This includes clinical trial data, pharmaceutical and medical device approval data, and medical errors data. 
   * Improving screening for low-income women at risk for heart disease and stroke. This legislation would expand the Well-Integrated Screening and Evaluation for Women Across the Nation (WISEWOMAN) program from 14 to all 50 states. The program provides prevention screening, such as tests for high blood pressure and high cholesterol, to low-income, uninsured and underinsured women.
   Heart disease is the number one killer of women and stroke is the number three killer. While the number of men who die from heart disease has steadily declined since 1979, heart disease is now killing more women than men every year.
