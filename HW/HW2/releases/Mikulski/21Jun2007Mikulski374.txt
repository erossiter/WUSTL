SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $21.6 MILLION FOR BAY, WATER & SEWER, COMMUNITY PROJECTS IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Interior, Environment and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the 2008 spending bill provides nearly $21.6 million for several Maryland priorities, including Chesapeake Bay programs, park improvements, and water and sewer projects. The bill, which passed the full committee today, includes $27.2 billion for programs nationwide, which is $1.5 billion more than the President requested and a $790 million increase from fiscal year 2007. 
   "Maryland's communities want to do the right thing by the environment, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have worked so hard to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment."  
   CHESAPEAKE BAY
   "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and it's part of who we are as Marylanders - our heritage and our culture," said Senator Mikulski. "This funding will help preserve Maryland's greatest natural resource for future generations of Marylanders." 
   The bill includes funding for the following initiatives in the Chesapeake Bay watershed: 
   * $10 million for the Targeted Watersheds program, which provides financial and technical support to projects that expand the most innovative, sustainable and cost-effective strategies for reducing excess nutrients within the Bay's tributaries. 
   * $2 million for the Chesapeake Bay Small Watersheds program, which helps local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Bay watershed. 
   * $950,000 for the Forest Service's Chesapeake Bay Program to continue the forest buffer and urban forestry programs, which have positively impacted the Bay's restoration efforts. 
   * $400,000 for the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge to purchase land to serve as a wetland and buffer habitat for rare, threatened or endangered plants and animals, as part of several large-scale conservation plans. 
   PARKS AND RECREATION 
   "This funding helps ensure that children and families can continue to delight in the magic and charm of Maryland's parks and trails," said Senator Mikulski. "By improving and developing our outdoor recreational facilities, we are encouraging revitalization in the area, as well as giving our kids a safe place to play." 
   The bill includes funding for the following parks and recreation projects around the state: 
   * $4 million for the Patuxent Research Refuge for continued renovations of its deteriorating facilities which are unsafe and unusable because of public health concerns. This funding is in addition to the $1.9 million Senator Mikulski secured last year to connect Patuxent to the local public water and sewer system. These funds were included in the Department of Interior's fiscal year 2007 operating plan. 
   * $2 million for the Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails program to support continued development of the gateways network which provides public access to the watershed. The program is linking natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network by providing grants to non-profit organizations and state and local governments. 
   * $700,000 to complete restoration of the historic Glen Echo Park in Montgomery County to provide adequate facilities for its cultural and educational programming. 
   * $125,000 to preserve the Lloyd Street Synagogue in Baltimore, the first synagogue in Maryland and the third oldest synagogue in the nation, as part of the Save America's Treasures program. 
   WATER & SEWER PROJECTS 
   "Maryland cities and towns need to upgrade their sewer systems, but they shouldn't have to do it by themselves," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to secure this funding so taxpayers won't have to bear the burden of paying for these important upgrades alone." 
   The spending bill includes federal funding for water and sewer projects through State and Tribal Assistance Grants in Baltimore ($700,000), Frostburg in Allegany County ($300,000), Cumberland in Allegany County ($200,000) and Westernport in Allegany County ($200,000). 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
