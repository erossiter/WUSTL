SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS IN CELEBRATION TO ANNOUNCE NEW WORK FOR BALTIMORE'S COAST GUARD YARD
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today joined leaders of the Coast Guard Yard and her Congressional colleagues in welcoming the Coast Guard Cutter TAMPA, the first ship to be serviced by the Coast Guard under a new long-term maintenance and repair project recently awarded to the Yard.  
   Under this new contract, the Yard will be overhauling 210' and 270' cutters. This project is expected to bring over $250 million to the Coast Guard Yard over the next seven to ten years. Senator Mikulski joined Senator Paul Sarbanes and Congressmen Ruppersberger, Cardin and Cummings in sending a letter to the Commandant of the Coast Guard in November 2004 urging him to assign this critical mission to the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay. 
   "What better place to perform this work than right here at Curtis Bay?" said Senator Mikulski. "For 106 years, the Yard has built, repaired and renovated ships that are critical to the Coast Guard's core missions. And they've done it on time, under budget and at a competitive rate. That's why I fight for the Coast Guard Yard in the United States Senate. I want to make sure that you are recognized as a core logistics facility and to make sure that you have the work to maintain your core expertise. I want to ensure that we have the world's best-equipped Coast Guard. I'm so proud to work with Curtis Bay to make sure they are an integral part of this mission." 
   Specifically, the Mission Effectiveness Project (MEP) repair and maintenance project would extend the service life of the Coast Guard's medium endurance cutters (WMEC) until replacement Maritime Security Cutters are delivered under the Coast Guard's Integrated Deepwater Acquisition Project over the next 15-20 years. This project will help reduce maintenance costs and increase mission effectiveness as vessels are outfitted with more modern equipment.
