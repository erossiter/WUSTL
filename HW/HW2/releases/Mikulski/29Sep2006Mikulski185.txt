VICTORY COMES ONE DAY BEFORE CAP EXEMPTION WAS SET TO EXPIRE
 Hours before Congress adjourns for recess, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced she successfully included language in the Department of Defense (DOD) authorization bill to extend - for one year - a crucial provision from her Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act that will save small and seasonal businesses from what appeared to be a devastating cut to their workforce. Both the U.S. House and Senate are expected to approve the DOD bill by the end of the day. The Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act was signed into law by President Bush in May 2005.  
   "My promises made are promises kept! I told small businesses they could count on me to keep fighting until we had a solution and they had the seasonal workers they needed to stay in business," said Senator Mikulski. "Without these seasonal workers, many businesses would not survive - forced to limit services, lay off permanent U.S. workers or, worse yet, close their doors. I am so proud to have worked with my colleagues, especially Senator John Warner (R-Va.), Chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, to make sure that we got this provision extended before the deadline." 
   The Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act made significant changes to the federal H2B (non-skilled seasonal worker) visa program that resulted in saving thousands of small businesses around the country. Among the changes, it exempted returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people, created new anti-fraud provisions, and ensured a fair allocation of H2B visas among spring and summer employees. The cap exemption provides significant relief to Maryland's crab industry that often hires the same dependable workers every year. 
   The H2B extension: 
   * Protects our borders by rewarding immigrants who play by the rules - returning to their home countries after finishing their job. 
   * Protects American workers by requiring employers to recruit American workers before hiring immigrant workers. 
   * Keeps small and seasonal businesses open by guaranteeing the labor supply needed during their peak seasons when they can't find American workers to take the jobs.
