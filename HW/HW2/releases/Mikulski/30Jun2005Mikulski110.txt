SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE SENATE APPROVAL OF FUNDING FOR CHESAPEAKE BAY RESTORATION, CLEAN-UP EFFORTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced that the full Senate has unanimously approved the Department of Interior Appropriations bill for fiscal year 2006 and included funding for several environmental restoration and research programs which will aid and enhance on-going efforts to clean-up the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries.  
   "This federal commitment of funds is vitally important if we are to maintain our efforts in cleaning-up the Chesapeake Bay," said Sarbanes. "While the Bush Administration severely underfunded or in most instances zero funded many of these important programs, I am pleased that through the efforts of my colleague, Senator Mikulski, that we have been able to restore this funding and move forward with these programs that are so crucial to the Bay's overall health and vitality." 
   "The Chesapeake Bay is our heritage - it is part of who we are as Marylanders," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment. This money is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the Bay." 
   Included in the bill is funding for the following programs and initiatives:
   * The Chesapeake Bay Gateways and Watertrails Program is slated to receive $2 million. The program, first initiated in 1999, is linking the natural, historic, cultural and recreational resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries into a unified network by providing grants to non-profit organizations and state and local governments. To date 140 sites throughout the watershed have been designated gateway sites. The Bush Administration proposed zero funding for this program and the House of Representatives passed bill also included no funding; 
   * $2.25 million has been provided for the Chesapeake Bay Small Watersheds Grant program which helps local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. The program was first created in 1998. The Bush Administration also proposed no funding for this program and the House of Representatives passed bill also included no funding; 
   * $20.75 million has been earmarked for the overall EPA Chesapeake Bay Program; 
   * $1.1 billion has been provided nationwide for the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds which are used to help states and local communities meet water quality standards, improve sewage treatment plants, and restore the health and safety of our nation's waterways; 
   * $6 million for efforts to reduce nutrient pollution in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. High levels of nitrogen coming from non-point sources such as sewage treatment plants, runoff from farmlands, and strormwater runoff from urban and suburban areas is the single major cause of the pollution in the Chesapeake Bay. President Bush proposed not funding this program in his 2006 budget request to the Congress; 
   * $950,000 for the USDA's Forest Service's State and Private Forestry Office to support the Chesapeake Bay Program's Office in its reforestation effort. According to reports, the states closest to the Bay lost 350,000 acres between 1987-97 or almost 100 acres per day. This decline in forest reserves poses a threat because many forests perform many important functions such as controlling storm water runoff, erosion and air pollution, all of which are critical to the Bay clean-up effort. There is no money in the House passed bill for this program; and 
   * Approval of $200,000 to the United States Geological Service (USGS) Biological Resources Division to continue the efforts to protect the populations of Diamondback Terrapins in the Chesapeake Bay. The Diamondback Terrapin, the Maryland state reptile, is a species that is declining in population. Unfortunately, little is known about the habitat requirements, nesting activities and population dynamics of this species. The USGS and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources have been working together to evaluate the physical features of terrapin habitats and identify major risk factors for critical life stages. There is no money in the House passed bill for this research. 
   Differences in funding between the Senate and House passed bills must be reconciled before being sent to the President for signature.
