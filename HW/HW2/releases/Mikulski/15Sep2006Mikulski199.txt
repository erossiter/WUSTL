SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONDS TO DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE DECISION ON NOAH JAMAHL JONES CASE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today following the U.S. Department of Justice's (DOJ) decision not to bring civil rights charges against the six white men accused of killing Noah Jamahl Jones, 17, in 2004. Over the past two years, Sen. Mikulski has been an active partner with civil rights and community groups who urged for a swift decision from the DOJ:  
   "I am very disappointed that DOJ has decided not bring any charges in this case. The death of Noah Jamahl Jones - at only 17 - was a huge loss to his family and to the community. The decision to close the civil rights investigation and hold no one accountable for his death is a travesty. 
   "I fought hard for over two years to make sure the Department of Justice investigated the death of this young man. During this time I, and his family, waited to hear the outcome - confident justice would be served. Yet, today the Department of Justice has announced that there will be no justice for this young man, for his family or for his community. There is still no answer to: Who will be responsible for the death of Noah Jamahl Jones?"
