SEN. MIKULSKI'S AMENDMENT CALLING FOR GAS-GOUGING INVESTIGATION PASSES SENATE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) demanded an explanation for soaring gas prices on the Senate floor today as she celebrated the unanimous passage of her amendment to the Commerce, Justice, Science spending bill, which requires the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) to conduct an immediate investigation into gasoline price-gouging.  
   The amendment, cosponsored by Senator Mark Pryor (D-Ark.), directs the FTC to investigate any evidence of price-gouging throughout the supply chain and distribution markets, the effects of price-gouging on economic activity in the United States and how price spikes are impacting people's purchasing power. 
   The Department of Energy reported this week that the average national price of gasoline dropped below the $3 mark, but the state of Maryland has the third highest prices in the country: $3.17 today compared to $2.46 one month ago. 
   Earlier this month, Senator Mikulski sent a letter to President Bush that urged him to direct administration officials to immediately investigate unfair practices at the pump. The letter can be found online at: http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=245250.
