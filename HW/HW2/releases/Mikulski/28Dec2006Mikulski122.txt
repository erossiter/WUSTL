SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONDS TO FDA RESEARCH, CALL FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON CLONED
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement after today's release by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of critical documents, which will influence the FDA's decision to endorse the use of meat, milk and other food from cloned animals. In a November 2006 letter to then Acting FDA Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach, Sen. Mikulski complained that the research had not been made public for several years (http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=265761):  
   "I am pleased to see that the FDA has shared the research I requested, which will help the FDA decide whether or not to endorse the use of meat and milk from cloned animals in America's food supply. I have opposed this, because these products have not been proven safe for consumers and are a threat to animals. 
   "When I supported Dr. von Eschenbach to head the FDA, I said the agency needed strong leadership. This is an opportunity for Dr. von Eschenbach, an experienced and respected scientist, to show his commitment to reforming food and drug safety based on science, not politics. 
   "I hope the American people take advantage of the public comment period to share with FDA officials their concerns about the use of food from cloned animals. In my role on the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, I will continue to do my part to stand sentry over FDA's standard of excellence. The American people's confidence in the FDA has been compromised by poor leadership in recent years, and it must be restored."
