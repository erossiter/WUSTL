SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE $2.7 MILLION FOR GARRETT COUNTY AIRPORT RUNWAY EXTENSION
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the Garrett County Airport $2.7 million grant to complete the runway extension from 3,000 feet to 6,000 feet.  
   "Our regional airports play a key role in maintaining Maryland's robust economy. An efficient and safe Garrett County airport is critical to keeping Western Maryland's economy moving," said Senator Mikulski. "This federal funding will keep the airport's runways safe and keep businesses and Marylanders on the go. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   "Airports are important to the economic development and health of a region," said Senator Cardin. "This federal funding will enable Garrett County to extend the runway so that larger aircraft can utilize the airport, bringing more business to Garrett County and the surrounding region." 
   Construction to expand the runway started 2005 and is expected to be completed by the end of the year. The new runway will be in compliance with Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and state safety regulations.
