DEMOCRATIC WOMEN SENATORS ON SENATE FLOOR: CHALLENGE REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESS REAL ISSUES
  The Dean of the Senate Women, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined her Democratic Women Senate colleagues on the Senate floor to call on Republican leadership to change direction, and address the real needs and priorities of the American people.  
   "Republican leadership has squandered time, opportunity and taxpayer money. The Senate has spent time with bills focused on re-electing Republicans, instead of helping American families. It's time to bring real issues to the floor," said Senator Mikulski. "We have less than 50 days left in session to get something done. We don't have a lot of time, we have to move forward now to change the way we are doing things." 
   Senators discussed their "Checklist for Change," a list of nine issues Congress can immediately address to better the lives of the American people, which was originally unveiled at a press conference last week.
