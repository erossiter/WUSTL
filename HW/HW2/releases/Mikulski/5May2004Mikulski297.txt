SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS FOR ECONOMIC PATRIOTISM
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today called for economic patriotism when she joined Sen.  
 Byron Dorgan (D-ND) to introduce legislation that would repeal a federal tax subsidy for U.S. companies exporting jobs overseas. 
   The legislation, offered as an amendment to the Jumpstart Our Business Strength (JOBS) Act, would end tax deferral where U.S. companies produce goods abroad and ship those products back to the U.S. market. If companies export jobs out of America and import those products back into this country, this amendment would ensure they pay U.S. taxes on their profits. 
   "I think it is wrong to give companies incentives to send millions of jobs to other countries when millions of Americans are losing their jobs. It is wrong to put companies who stay in America at a competitive disadvantage because they hire their workers at home, pay their share of taxes, and provide healthcare to their employees. It is time that we look at our tax code and call for a patriotic tax code," said Mikulski. 
   "The Dorgan-Mikulski Amendment is step one. It ends the huge tax break for manufacturing companies that send jobs overseas, only to sell the products that they make right here in the United States of America," she continued
