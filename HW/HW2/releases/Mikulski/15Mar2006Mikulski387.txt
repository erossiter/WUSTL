SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON APPOINTMENT OF VON ESCHENBACH AS FDA COMMISSIONER
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement this afternoon following President Bush's appointment of Dr. Andrew C. von Eschenbach as Commissioner at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):  
   "I am pleased to see that the Administration has appointed a competent, permanent head of FDA instead of a temp. Today's announcement is a move towards reforming FDA as the agency recovers from several years of weak leadership. 
   "FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining drug safety and drug efficacy. The American public, and our devoted FDA employees, deserve a full-time leader who can help restore our faith in an agency that has been politicized and degraded.  
   "I have fought for years for the right facilities and the right resources for FDA, located in my home state of Maryland. I will continue to look out for its well-being, and look forward to working with its new leadership."
