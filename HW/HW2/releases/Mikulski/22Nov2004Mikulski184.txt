FEDERAL FUNDING FOR KEY PROJECTS COMING TO WESTERN MARYLAND
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that several key projects in the Baltimore region are slated to receive funding in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is now sent to the President for his signature. The more than $388 billion omnibus spending bill completes the 9 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government through fiscal year 2005. To stay within the spending constraints demanded by the White House, all programs in the bill were cut by 0.80 percent.  
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook to create jobs and build communities. This final legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of work with Maryland communities to identify where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best of local, state and federal priorities. Maryland can count on me to keep standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation." 
   "We are bringing a bounty of federal funds to the State of Maryland that will aid our communities, our economy, our transportation network, and our environment; and thereby enhancing the quality of life and providing opportunities for people throughout the entire State," added Senator Paul S. Sarbanes. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes worked together to secure funding for the following projects: 
   TRANSPORTATION 
   * $4.96 million for the critical work associated with the I-70 Project in Frederick County. These funds will continue the upgrading of the 5.3 miles on I-70 in Frederick in order to meet current interstate standards. Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes have secured over $105 million for this project over the last 9 years. 
   * $992,000 for I-81 improvements south of I-70 to North Halfway Boulevard. 
   CHESAPEAKE BAY AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
   * $248,000 for the Maryland Bureau of Mines for an acid mine drainage remediation project in Maryland's Appalachian Mountain Region. 
   * $5.456 million for the NOAA Climate Database Modernization Program. Maryland is helping to facilitate the date processing work that is essential to the Modernization Program. This funding ensures that Maryland will continue to do part of the modernization work, protecting important jobs in Garrett County 
   The omnibus bill includes federal funding for the "State and Tribal Assistance Grants" (STAG) for special needs water and wastewater infrastructure projects. These grants are typically used for wastewater infrastructure improvements that reduce the amount of nutrients entering waterways, and the associated health and environmental impacts. Maryland communities have received $3.2 million this year in STAG grants, including the following federal grants for Western Maryland communities: 
   * $744,000 for Cumberland 
   * $496,000 for Frostburg 
   * $248,000 for Brunswick 
   HISTORIC PRESERVATION 
   * $3.51 million for Monocacy National Battlefield. Funds would be used to relocate the visitor's center to a less flood prone area of the Park. The current Visitor's Center, located in the Monocacy River flood plain was intended to serve as a temporary facility when it opened in 1991. 
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee and is the Senior Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. Senator Sarbanes serves on the Budget Committee.
