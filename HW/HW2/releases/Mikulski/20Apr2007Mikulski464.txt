SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON MINERS FOUND IN GARRETT COUNTY
  Mikulski Statement on Miners Found in Garrett County  
   Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today after confirmation from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) that the two miners trapped underground in a mine in Garrett County have been found dead: 
   "My thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the two miners who have been found after several days trapped underground. I applaud the hard work of the federal, state and local emergency crews on the scene. I'm very concerned about mine safety. We need to review the laws on the books and make sure they're enforced, and also see if we need new approaches for new mining technology. I will do what I can in the U.S. Senate to fight for legislation that expands mine safety requirements. We must do what we can to ensure that miners are safe and secure."
