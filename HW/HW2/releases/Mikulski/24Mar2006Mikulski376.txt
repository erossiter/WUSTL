SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF SEN. BEALL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today on the passing of former Sen. J. Glenn Beall Jr.:  
   "Senator J. Glenn Beall Jr. devoted his life to public service - as a naval officer, state and federal lawmaker. He will be most recently remembered as the founding chairman of the Canal Place Preservation & Development Authority, which is a direct result of his tireless efforts to establish the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park in the early 1970s. We worked together in the spirit of bipartisanship to create economic development opportunities throughout Western Maryland. 
   "Senator Beall was a member of a prominent and extraordinary Western Maryland family who was dedicated to improving the lives of all Marylanders. He had great ideas and Senate know-how. It was a pleasure working with him."
