SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $4 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SALISBURY-OCEAN CITY-WICOMICO REGIONAL AIRPORT
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that the Salisbury-Ocean City-Wicomico Regional Airport will receive a $4.4 million aviation grant from the United States Department of Transportation (DOT).  
   This new funding comes in addition to a $380,000 runway improvement grant announced by the two Senators in August of 2004. Specifically, the federal funding will be used to continue the restoration and rehabilitation of airport runway 14/32. 
   "Improving our state's transportation infrastructure is one of my top priorities," said Sarbanes. "These funds will provide for the improvements for a growing passenger population at the Salisbury-Ocean City-Wicomico Regional Airport and will enhance the safety of the passengers and pilots using these facilities." 
   "Our regional airports play a key role in maintaining Maryland's robust economy. An efficient and safe Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport is critical to keeping the Eastern Shore's economy moving," said Senator Mikulski. "This federal funding will help rehabilitate the airport's runways and keep businesses and Marylanders on the go. I'm proud to have worked with Senator Sarbanes to help secure this important funding."
