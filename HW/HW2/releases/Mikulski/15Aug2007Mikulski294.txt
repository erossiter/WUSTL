SEN. MIKULSKI RENEWS CALL FOR AMERICAN SCHOLAR'S RELEASE FROM JAIL
  On the 100th day of Montgomery County resident and American scholar Dr. Haleh Esfandiari's imprisonment in an Iranian prison, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today renewed calls for her immediate release:  
   "It is unacceptable that 100 days have passed and Dr. Esfandiari remains jailed in Iran. I will continue to stand with Dr. Esfandiari's family as they fight for her freedom. 
   "My heart goes out to Dr. Esfandiari, Kian Tajbakhsh, Parnaz Azima, and Ali Shakeri, and my prayers are with them and their families at this difficult time. All four Iranian-Americans have been unjustly targeted by Iran's government. 
   "We know the government of Iran is watching what we do, and we want them to know we will not relent. We want all four released immediately and allowed to return to their families. In the meantime, these prisoners must be allowed to consult with lawyers, to be visited by international humanitarian organizations, and to see their families." 
   Dr. Esfandiari, the Director of Middle East programs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, has been jailed by the Iranian government since May 8 after more than four months of virtual house arrest following a visit to her ailing 93-year-old mother.

   Senator Mikulski met with Dr. Shaul Bakhash, Dr. Esfandiari's husband, earlier this year, and pledged to do everything in her power to secure her immediate release and safe return home.
