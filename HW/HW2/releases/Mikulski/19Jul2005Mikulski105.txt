REP. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUDGE JOHN ROBERTS' NOMINATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) issued the following statement today following President Bush's nomination of Judge John Roberts Jr. of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to the United States Supreme Court:  
   "The President has the right to make nominations to the Supreme Court. The Senate has the responsibility of advice and consent - it is not a rubber stamp. When I evaluate nominees, I base my consideration on three criteria: judicial competence, personal and professional integrity, and a commitment to core constitutional principles, the bill of rights and the implicit right to privacy. "I look forward to thoroughly examining Judge Roberts' qualifications and record by reviewing the background reports, the American Bar Association evaluation, his Judiciary Committee testimony, and his opinions and writings."
