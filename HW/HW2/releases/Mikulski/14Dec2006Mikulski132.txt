SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES NEW ALLEGHENY HIGHLANDS TRAIL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined retiring Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), Allegany County Commissioners, state and local officials this afternoon for an official ribbon-cutting ceremony for the new Allegheny Highlands Trail at the Western Maryland Railway Station. This 21-mile portion of the passage links the Great Allegheny Passage trail, which runs from Pittsburgh, Pa., to the Mason-Dixon Line and the C & O Canal Towpath, which runs from Cumberland to Washington, D.C.  
   "The C&O Canal is home to one of Maryland's treasures - a pathway into our history and the beauty of Western Maryland. I'm so proud that Allegany County was able to use these funds to continue to develop, grow and draw in new visitors," said Senator Mikulski. "This funding is a federal investment in Western Maryland today and tomorrow." 
   Senator Mikulski fought to bring $5.5 million in federal funding to the project, including $2 million in the 2006 transportation authorization bill (SAFETEA) and $3.5 million in the 1998 transportation authorization bill (TEA-21). The total cost of the project is roughly $11.5 million, and is a joint investment with state and regional funding. 
   Today's ribbon-cutting celebrates the final construction of the trail's Maryland section, creating a continuous trail of 380 miles from Washington to Pittsburgh. It will feature a series of hiking and biking trails that will bring more than 100,000 visitors to the county, with an anticipated economic impact of over $2 million dollars annually. 
   "This new trail will offer opportunities for Maryland families to enjoy the beauty of Western Maryland. This is critical to continued economic growth and tourism in Allegany County," said Senator Mikulski. "Know that I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Western Maryland communities."
