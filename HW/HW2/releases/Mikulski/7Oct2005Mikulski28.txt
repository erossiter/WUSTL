SENATE PASSES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES FUNDING FOR HARFORD AND CECIL COUNTY ARMED FORCES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski and Sen. Paul Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that the Senate has passed the 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which includes an additional $125 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment for them to successfully carry out their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $33 million in additional funding for Harford and Cecil County projects, including: 
   ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND 
   * $1.5 million for the Aberdeen Technology Transfer Initiative 
   * $2 million for Spinel Tactical Armor Manufacturing Technology (STAMT) - a transparent, lighter, better armor material for vehicles and aircraft 
   * $5 million for a Rotorcraft Survivability Assessment Facility to better protect military helicopters 
   MARYLAND NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 
   * $16 million for a M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm (ACADA) 
   * $4 million for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS) 
   U.S. MARINE CORPS 
   * $8 million for All Purpose Environmental Clothing System 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Defense Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
