SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS FOR HAGERSTOWN
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes and Barbara A. Mikulski (both D-Md.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved a $250,000 grant to upgrade the water and sewer system in Hagerstown. The money comes from the USDA's Rural Development Program and will be disbursed in the form of a $250,000 Rural Business Enterprise Grant.  
   Specifically, the funding will be used to construct a new sewer line which will run from the City's pump station #3 to the Newgate Interceptor. Water will then be moved to the Conococheague Wastewater Treatment Plant for further treatment. Currently the wastewater is being sent through the Nicodemus Treatment Plant. However, due to the plant's age and condition the facility is being phased out. 
   "These funds are critical in maintaining a clean, safe, and healthy water supply for the residents of Hagerstown," said Sarbanes. "USDA's Rural Development Program continues to provide the communities of Western Maryland with funding to enhance and upgrade their town operations and I am pleased with the program's on-going support." 
   "I am proud to work in the U.S. Senate to build communities and create jobs. This federal investment to improve the area's sewer system will do just that," said Senator Mikulski. "Maryland cities and towns need to upgrade their water and sewer infrastructure but they can't do it on their own, and rate payers shouldn't have to bear the full burden. This grant is a double value for the taxpayer dollar, creating jobs while helping this community grow." 
   The USDA's Rural Development Program's aim is to help the people of rural America develop sustainable communities and improve their quality of life through guaranteed loans, grants, technical assistance, research and educational materials.
