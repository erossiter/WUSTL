SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON ADMIRAL MCCONNELL NOMINATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement as the committee held its confirmation hearing on the nomination of Admiral Mike McConnell to be the Director of National Intelligence (DNI) today:  
   "Based on what I know about Admiral McConnell after knowing him for more than a decade, and based on my conversations with him, I will support his nomination to be Director of National Intelligence. He has clearly demonstrated his competence, having spent more than 25 years as a military intelligence officer and leading the National Security Agency (NSA) at a critical time in the agency's history. 
   "I have no question about his personal integrity and commitment to the core mission of the intelligence community. I believe he will bring the same effective leadership to the DNI position as he did at NSA, with a passion for reform and respect for our intelligence workers. He has been, in his public and private sector roles, a strong advocate for the intelligence community as it struggles to redefine itself. 
   "The only concern I have as his nomination moves to the Senate floor, is that we need a DNI who will be independent and speak truth to power - to whoever is President and to the congressional oversight committees. We have seen too many 'Yes Men' and too few 'Independent Voices' these past years. Admiral McConnell has assured me that, if he is confirmed, he would let intelligence analysts do what they do best - provide unvarnished intelligence analysis that is independent of political concerns. It is our responsibility, as members of this committee, to keep a close eye on the DNI and his office, to make sure we do not see the agency politicized like we have seen in our intelligence community before."
