SEN. MIKULSKI URGES GOVERNOR'S LEADERSHIP IN PROVIDING ACCURATE INFORMATION ON PUBLIC SAFETY
  Following recent news reports, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today urged Maryland Gov. Robert Ehrlich to take full responsibility for providing accurate information to the public about the safety of rockfish in the Chesapeake Bay.  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   March 16, 2006 
   The Honorable Robert L. Ehrlich, Jr.
  The Governor's Office
  State House
  Annapolis, MD 21401 
   Dear Governor Ehrlich: 
   The recent Washington Post article, "Chesapeake's Rockfish Overrun by Disease," left many of Maryland's citizens wondering if rockfish are safe to eat or handle. 
   Rockfish season begins soon, and the livelihoods of our watermen, charter boat operators and related business owners depend on public confidence that rockfish are safe to eat and handle. The Post article seriously called this into question. 
   That is why I am very concerned about the need for quick, clear, authoritative responses to reports like these. Maryland's citizens need to hear immediately from the state official in charge to tell them if Bay fish are safe to eat and handle. I don't believe that a statement buried on the Baltimore Sun website is adequate. 
   I am prepared to assist the state in obtaining any federal support you believe is required to help the state fulfill the important responsibility of providing accurate information to the public about the safety of fish in state waters. 
   Thank you for your attention to this very important issue. 
   Sincerely, 
   Barbara A. Mikulski
  United States Senator
