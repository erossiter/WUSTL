SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES STAND UP FOR HARFORD, CECIL COUNTY ARMED FORCES IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski today joined her colleague Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) in announcing that the Senate version of the $440.2 billion Defense spending bill includes an additional $125 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment for them to successfully carry out their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $33 million in additional funding for Harford and Cecil County projects, including: 
   ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND 
   * $1.5 million for the Aberdeen Technology Transfer Initiative 
   * $2 million for Spinel Tactical Armor Manufacturing Technology (STAMT) - a transparent, lighter, better armor material for vehicles and aircraft 
   * $5 million for a Rotorcraft Survivability Assessment Facility to better protect military helicopters 
   MARYLAND NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE 
   * $16 million for a M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm (ACADA) 
   * $4 million for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System (ECWCS) 
   U.S. MARINE CORPS 
   * $8 million for All Purpose Environmental Clothing System 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has been tentatively scheduled for next week. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Both Houses of Congress will vote on the conference bill. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Defense Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
