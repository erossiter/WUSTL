SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $6 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR SOMERSET COUNTY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that the United Stated Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded Somerset County, MD a $2 million grant and a $4.2 million loan to create a water and waste disposal system. The funding comes from the USDA's Rural Development Program in the form of a Water and Waste Disposal Grant and Loan.  
   Specifically, the grant and loan will be used to fund a regional sewer system for over 300 homes and businesses in the Westover area of Somerset County that are currently served by wells and septic tanks. 
   "These funds are critical in maintaining a clean, safe, and healthy water supply for the residents of the Westover area," said Sarbanes. "When completed, this project will help to improve the quality of life and support future economic development in the area." 
   "I am proud to work in the U.S. Senate to build communities and create jobs. This federal investment to improve Somerset County's regional sewer system will do just that," said Senator Mikulski. "Maryland cities and towns need to upgrade their water and sewer infrastructure but they can't do it on their own, and rate payers shouldn't have to bear the full burden. This federal loan and grant is a double value for the taxpayer dollar, creating jobs while helping our Eastern Shore communities grow." 
   The USDA's Rural Development Program's aim is to help the people of rural America develop sustainable communities and improve their quality of life through guaranteed loans, grants, technical assistance, research, and educational materials. In addition, the Program helps rural communities build or improve community facilities, such as schools, health clinics, and fire stations.
