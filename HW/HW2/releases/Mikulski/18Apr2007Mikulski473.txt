SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE $2.2 MILLION FOR FREDERICK AIRPORT EXTENSION PROJECT
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded the Frederick Municipal Airport $2.2 million to purchase land for a runway extension. The extension would increase the runway from 5,220-feet to 6,000 feet.  
   "Our regional airports play a key role in maintaining Maryland's robust economy. This federal funding is an investment in Frederick County that will provide new opportunities today and tomorrow," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting for the resources our Maryland communities need to foster growth and economic development." 
   "The Frederick Municipal Airport has become an important facility to the Washington region and Western Maryland," said Senator Cardin. "This project is a win-win for economic growth and development because it will enable larger aircraft with greater range and on-board payload to utilize the airport." 
   Construction on the runway extension project is expected to be a multi-year project and will begin once the necessary land acquisition is completed.
