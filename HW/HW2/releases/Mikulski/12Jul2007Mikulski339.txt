SEN. MIKULSKI DELIVERS ON COMMITMENT TO BRAC-RELATED TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced she has fought to include funding in the 2008 spending bill for key Maryland transportation projects, fulfilling her promise to help communities manage growth related to the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's recommendations.  
   "My promises made to BRAC-impacted communities are promises kept. BRAC brings great opportunities, but it also brings great challenges. That's why I want to make sure Maryland has what it needs in the federal checkbook to implement the BRAC decisions and meet the increased demands on our communities," said Senator Mikulski. "More money for Maryland highways and public transit systems means safer and faster commutes to work. This funding will help BRAC-ready our transportation systems to keep Marylanders on the move." 
   Senator Mikulski has been fighting for several years to prepare Maryland communities and military bases for the BRAC process, which will bring thousands of new employees to the state. This includes 10,000 new jobs that will never leave the country, in addition to 85,000 existing jobs on bases and up to 40,000 non-direct jobs. 
   The spending bill includes: 
   * $13 million for the MARC Commuter Rail System. The funding will be used for new locomotives and railcars, to study new station locations, and to improve existing stations. 
   * $3 million to improve access to Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) in Harford County. 
   * $3 million to improve access to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda by making adjustments to the already congested Maryland Route 355. 
   * $1 million for the Central Maryland Transit Center at Fort Meade to house and maintain Maryland Transportation Authority (MTA) buses that will serve Anne Arundel, Howard and northern Prince George's Counties. 
   * $1 million for the Bi-County Transit Center in Langley Park to serve as an off-street bus transfer facility for residents of Prince George's and Montgomery Counties. 
   The legislation passed the full Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon. In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
