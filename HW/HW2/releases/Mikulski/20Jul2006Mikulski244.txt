SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS FOR KEY EDUCATION, NURSING PROGRAMS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
 Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the Senate version of the Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies 2007 spending bill includes federal funding for priority issues in higher education and nursing opportunities. The legislation was passed by the full Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon. 
   EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES  
   "Education is the opportunity ladder of this nation. We must do all we can to make sure no child is left out or left behind. We must create a safe environment for young students to succeed," said Senator Mikulski. "Throughout my career I have fought to ensure children have the resources they need, and I am proud to have fought to put money in the federal checkbook for these key projects." 
   * $300,000 to support the Science and Math Academy at Aberdeen High School. This partnership between Harford County Board of Education and the Army Alliance at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) brings students and APG scientists together, allowing students and staff to use APG's laboratories and facilities, and providing mentoring opportunities. 
   * $300,000 for Coppin State University's Urban Education Corridor, a partnership with several Baltimore City public schools in West Baltimore. This research-based educational program reaches out to urban youth as part of a broader intervention strategy. 
   * $150,000 for Johns Hopkins University's (JHU) Center for Talented Youth (CTY) to examine short and long-term outcomes of CTY summer programs and to develop a national program model for gifted and talented children across the country.
  NURSING OPPORTUNITIES 
   "Too often, America's nurses are overworked, underpaid and undervalued. America is facing a nursing shortage and it is only getting worse," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have worked to make nursing recruitment, education and retention a priority in the federal law book and the federal checkbook." 
   * $1.25 million for the Maryland Association of Community Colleges to expand their nursing programs. Maryland community colleges educate over 60 percent of the RN and LPN nurses working in the state today. Funds will support nursing programs at all 16 Maryland community colleges and enhance current programming and resources. 
   * $750,000 for the University of Maryland at Baltimore School of Nursing Institute, which prepares nurses for teaching roles and develops new resources to help increase nursing faculty. 
   * $500,000 for Villa Julie to expand their Nursing Distance Learning Program. This innovative partnership allows students to access nursing education using distance learning methods. 
   * $350,000 for the Maryland Hospital Association's Council for Adult and Experiential Learning (CAEL) Nursing Lattice Program as part of a national effort to create training and education models to address the country's nursing shortage. 
   This year's spending bill also includes: 
   * $300,000 to support JHU's Critical Event Preparedness and Response (CEPAR) Program, which was created to utilize JHU resources to maximize regional and national preparedness. CEPAR is recognized among state response agencies as a leader and valuable partner in developing preparedness plans. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the bill will go to the President for his signature.
