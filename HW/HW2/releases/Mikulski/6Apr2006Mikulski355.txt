SEN. MIKULSKI, MARYLAND DELEGATION GOES TO WHITE HOUSE TO HONOR TERRAPIN NATIONAL CHAMPS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined several members of the Maryland delegation including Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) at the White House today to join President Bush in congratulating the University of Maryland Terrapins women's basketball, field hockey and men's soccer teams on winning 2006 NCAA championships.  
   "The grit, heart and maturity of the 2006 University of Maryland Terrapins women's basketball team will be the standard-bearer for years to come in women's college basketball. They are champion student athletes and proved their grace under pressure," said Senator Mikulski. "But the University of Maryland had more than one team win a NCAA Championship - their women's field hockey and men's soccer teams also showed the country why to 'fear the turtle.' I am so proud of the athletes from my own home state and I am really looking forward to next season when we defend our National Championship titles!" 
   President Bush congratulated the teams in a ceremony this afternoon on the South Lawn of the White House. Photos are available at: www.mikulski.senate.gov/whitehouse.htm.
