SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES RETURN OF SPACE SHUTTLE DISCOVERY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today applauded the safe return of NASA's Space Shuttle Discovery from a 13-day flight. Sen. Mikulski, senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds NASA, recently introduced an amendment to provide $1 billion in federal funding to pay back NASA for the costs of returning the Space Shuttle to flight.  
   "With the return of the Space Shuttle Discovery to Earth, let us honor the men and women who are working at NASA on the future innovations and discoveries that will lead us to the explorations of tomorrow," said Senator Mikulski. "Discovery and innovation should be the hallmarks of our space program - not budget cuts and cancelled missions." 
   The amendment, introduced with Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas), Chairwoman of the Science and Space Subcommittee on the Senate Commerce Committee, will serve as a down payment to pay back the costs of returning the Shuttle to flight and restore cuts to science, aeronautics and exploration programs that were cut in order to pay for the return to flight. The $1 billion will be declared as an emergency under the terms of the budget resolution. 
   "Maryland is the epicenter of NASA's science programs. I fought for Hubble, I fought for Pluto, and I will keep fighting for science, innovation and discovery. I will not let NASA back down from its commitment to science - it's too important to Maryland, to America and to the world," said Senator Mikulski. "I am committed to restoring this agency's budget to ensure the continued safety of our astronauts, and to supporting the critical programs that are the hallmarks of their success."
