SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ALLEGANY COUNTY ACCESS ROAD
  Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today announced the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded Allegany County a $400,000 grant to construct an access road for the Barton Business Park. It is anticipated that this project will support the creation of approximately 500 new jobs in the business park.  
   "This is a federal investment in Western Maryland communities today and tomorrow. I'm so proud that Allegany County will be able to use these funds to continue to develop and grow," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep Allegany County communities a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   "ARC grants provide important funding to stimulate economic development and growth," said Senator Cardin. "I am particularly pleased that this $400,000 grant will result in an access road for the Barton Business Park with a potential of creating hundreds of new jobs in Allegany County."
   The funding will be used to construct about one third of a mile of access road connected to two completed sections of the access road. The road will provide access to 150 acres of marketable park sites to serve advanced manufacturing firms. 
   In addition to ARC funds, the Department of Business and Economic Develop of the State of Maryland will contribute $500,000 and Allegany County will provide $100,000 for the project, which is estimated to cost a total of $1 million.
