SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF 'PHASE II' REPORT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement today after the release of two of the five parts of its "Phase II" investigation into the use of Iraq intelligence. The panel issued Phase I of the report, identifying failures in intelligence-gathering, in July 2004:  
   "The Intelligence Committee's Phase II Report is a damning assessment of the Bush Administration's use of intelligence in the run-up to the Iraq war. 
   "The report shows how the Bush Administration skewed, selected and exaggerated intelligence about the threat of Weapons of Mass Destruction in Iraq and about the link between terrorism and Iraq. For example, the Bush Administration ignored intelligence assessments when it stated that Iraq was connected to al-Qaida. Yet the Bush Administration accepted the misleading information provided by the Iraqi National Congress (INC) - and even made lavish payments to the INC. The Bush Administration used this misinformation to push us into war. 
   "This report is only part of the story. The rest of the report dealing with the manipulation of intelligence that led our country into war must also be completed and released. The American people have a right to know the whole story of how we got into Iraq."
