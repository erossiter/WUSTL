SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS TO IMPROVE VETERANS' BURIAL BENEFITS
  With Memorial Day approaching, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today introduced the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act, which would increase burial benefits and plot allowances for veterans to help ease the financial burden of funeral expenses on families.  
   "I am deeply concerned that burial benefits for the families of our deceased veterans have not kept up with inflation and rising funeral costs. I want to thank the millions of veterans - Marylanders and people across the nation - for their patriotism and commitment to honoring the true meaning of Memorial Day," said Senator Mikulski. "We must honor our military men and women who died in the name of their country, not just with words, but with deeds." 
   More than 1,000 World War II veterans die each day, but Congress has failed to increase veterans' burial benefits to keep up with rising costs and inflation. While these benefits were never intended to cover the full costs of burial, they now cover only a fraction of what they covered in 1973, when the federal government first started paying veterans' burial benefits. 
   The Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act brings burial and plot reimbursement totals back up to the level they were at in 1973. It also adjusts these benefits each year to keep up with inflation. Specifically, the bill: 
   * Increases burial benefits for veterans who die of service-connected disabilities from $2,000 to $4,100. 
   * Increases burial benefits for veterans with non-service connected disabilities from $300 to $1,270. The increase would apply to veterans who are entitled to receive pension or compensation at the time of death, or who die in a veterans' facility, a nursing home under Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) contract or a state veterans' nursing home. 
   * Increases the burial plot allowance from $300 to $745 for veterans not buried in a cemetery under U.S. jurisdiction if they were discharged from active duty because of disability incurred or aggravated in the line of duty, if they were ineligible for compensation or pension, or if they died in a VA facility. 
   * Provides for all of these benefits to be adjusted for inflation annually. 
   * Senator Mikulski has been a leader in the fight to increase burial benefits. She first introduced the Veterans Burial Benefits Improvement Act in 2003, but it never became a law. In December 2001, she also successfully fought to increase the service-connected benefit from $1,500 to $2,000, and the plot allowance from $150 to $300.
