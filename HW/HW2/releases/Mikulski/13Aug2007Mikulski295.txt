SEN. MIKULSKI PROMISE TO FALLEN SERVICE MEMBER'S FAMILY IS REALIZED IN DHS HELPLINE
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today applauded the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services' (USCIS) launch of a toll-free hotline for military service members attempting to become U.S. citizens. The service hotline was one of the provisions outlined in the Kendell Frederick Assistance to Citizenship Act, which Senator Mikulski introduced following the 2005 death of U.S. Army Spc. Kendell Frederick of Randallstown, Md., in Iraq. 
   "Every military death in Iraq is a tragedy, but Kendell Frederick's death did not need to happen. His death, caused during a desperate attempt to become a citizen of the country he was defending, shows how broken our bureaucracy is," said Senator Mikulski. "Kendell Frederick's death will not be in vain. This must not happen to another man or woman serving in our Armed Forces."  
   A citizen of Trinidad, Spc. Frederick, 21, was serving America in Iraq as a generator mechanic. He did not usually leave the base, but on October 19, 2005, he was sent off in a convoy to get fingerprinted in order to process his citizenship application. En route, he was killed when the convoy hit a roadside bomb. Spc. Frederick had tried for more than a year to become a U.S. citizen, but his application was delayed several times due to miscommunication and misinformation from the U.S. government. He was granted citizenship a week after he died. 
   The helpline, 1-877-CIS-4MIL (1-877-247-4645), will be accessible both inside the United States and overseas. It will be available for service members and their families, with expedited service for Soldiers set to deploy or for families applying posthumously. 
   Callers will receive assistance Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. until 4:30 p.m., with: 
   * Tracking their application for naturalization (Form N-400); 
   * Notifying USCIS of a new mailing address or duty station; 
   * Checking the status of an application or petition; 
   * Bringing a spouse, fiancée or adopted child to the United States; 
   * Obtaining posthumous citizenship for a deceased member of the Armed Services; and 
   * Submitting an application for expedited processing. 
   "Thousands of immigrant Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines have made extraordinary sacrifices for America," said USCIS Director Emilio Gonzalez. "As such, at USCIS, we are committed to exhausting every effort to ensure that the application process for immigrant service members is convenient, quick and secure. These brave men and women, and their families, deserve this service, and we are proud to assist." 
   In December 2005, Senator Mikulski introduced the Kendell Frederick Assistance to Citizenship Act to make it easier for U.S. service members to become citizens, demanding better coordination among U.S. immigration and military officials. It outlined several steps to improve the process. Although the bill was never brought to the Senate floor for a vote, Senator Mikulski's office has worked closely with the USCIS to make administrative changes to the visa processing system for those serving in the military. 
   "There are over 40,000 non-U.S. citizens serving in the military today. Many are on the front lines in Iraq, Afghanistan and throughout the world, fighting terrorists. If you are willing to fight and die for America, you should be able to become an American," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to cut through the bureaucracy and improve this process, because service members and their families have enough to worry about." 
   In addition to the helpline, USCIS has developed a web page, http://www.uscis.gov/military, providing information and links to services specifically for the military and their families.
