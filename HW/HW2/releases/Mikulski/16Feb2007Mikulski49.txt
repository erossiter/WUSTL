SEN. MIKULSKI: SENATE MUST BE ALLOWED TO VOTE ON DISAPPROVAL OF BUSH ESCALATION IRAQ
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), today hailed Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's (D-Nev.) call for a vote to begin consideration of a resolution to express Congress' disapproval of President Bush's plan to send more than 20,000 troops to Iraq (S.574). In a procedural move to bypass Senate Republicans' filibuster of a vote of disapproval, the Senate will vote tomorrow afternoon on a "motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed" to the resolution, a first step towards the long-awaited vote.  
   "We need our vote on this resolution. I oppose this escalation. I oppose this war. And I oppose this effort to keep America from knowing where every member of the Senate stands on this critical issue," said Senator Mikulski, who was one of 23 Senators to vote against the war in Iraq in 2002. "Every American should know how their elected leader feels about this plan to send more of our young men and women into harm's way without a plan to bring them home safely and swiftly."
