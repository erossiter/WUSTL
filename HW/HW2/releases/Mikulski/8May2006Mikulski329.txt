SEN. MIKULSKI CONGRATULATES MARYLAND FACILITIES ON NEW NASA PROJECTS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today applauded Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., and the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) in Laurel, Md., on being chosen to lead two key NASA satellite missions.  
   The Johns Hopkins University-APL will manage the development and operations of the Radiation Belt Storm Probe mission. This mission will be launched in 2012 to develop space weather predictions and effects in order to better design and operate new technology on Earth and in space. This is the second mission under the Living With a Star Program, which studies the sun's impact on the Earth. 
   Goddard will manage the design and development of the Magnetospheric Multiscale mission, which will launch in 2013 to make coordinated, high-resolution observations of the Earth's magnetosphere - the region of space closest to the planet. This is a major victory for Goddard, and ensures continued work for its scientific and engineering workforce. 
   "These are huge wins for Maryland. The Goddard Space Flight Center and the Applied Physics Laboratory are vital to our national interests. Their contributions to science, exploration and discovery are truly extraordinary," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects will bring more jobs to Maryland and demonstrate the innovative scientific and engineering work being done in our state. I will continue to fight to keep Maryland a leader in innovation - creating the building blocks that will carry us through the next decade and even set the stage for the next century." 
   Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice and Science, which funds NASA.
