SEN. MIKULSKI BILL TO PREVENT SENIOR CITIZEN FALLS PASSES SENATE COMMITTEE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee passed her legislation to prevent falls among seniors. The Keeping Seniors Safe from Falls Act, introduced with Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), authorizes new programs to help prevent falls among older adults through public education, research and demonstration projects.  
   "Falls don't discriminate," said Senator Mikulski, senior Democrat on the HELP Committee's Subcommittee on Retirement Security and Aging. "This is a serious public health problem that directly affects our seniors and their family members. This legislation provides a framework to reduce and prevent elder falls through public education campaigns and important research." 
   Falls are the leading cause of injury deaths among persons over 65. In 2003, falls among elderly persons accounted for 12,900 deaths and 1.8 million emergency room visits. Fall-related injuries for people 65 and older cost a total of $27.3 billion in 2003 alone. 
   The bill focuses on prevention of falls among older adults in four areas: 
   * Public Education Campaigns: Establishes public education campaigns for older adults, family members and health care providers to reduce falls and prevent repeat falls. 
   * Research Initiative Legislation: Supports research in areas including identifying older adults who have a high risk of falling by designing, implementing and evaluating the most effective ways to prevent falls, improving the diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of older adults who have fallen, and examining barriers to adopting proven fall-prevention strategies. 
   * Demonstration Projects: Authorizes federal grants for demonstration projects that will focus on the utility of targeted fall-risk screening and referral, programs that use multiple approaches to prevent falls such as physical activity, medication assessment, and home modification, targeting newly discharged fall victims at high-risk for second falls, and developing technology to prevent falls. 
   * Study on Effects of Falls on Health Care Costs: Requires the Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the effect of falls on health care costs, the potential for reducing falls, and the most effective strategies for reducing health care costs associated with falls. 
   The bill now moves to the full Senate for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
