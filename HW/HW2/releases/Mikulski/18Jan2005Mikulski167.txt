SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S HEALTHCARE
  "I am pleased that Secretary Thompson has returned $643 million to help states provide health insurance to the children of many of America's working families through the SCHIP program.  
 This money is critical to ensure our children have access to the health care they need and deserve. 
   "Maryland will receive $20 million: this will mean healthier children and healthier families right here. Healthcare is just too expensive for too many working families. This program fills the gap - for the children who might otherwise have to go without any healthcare at all. 
   "I fought to create the SCHIP program in 1997 and I have been fighting ever since to expand coverage and increase payment to states, fighting for the federal government to pay its fair share. I know that states want to do the right thing, but they can't do it on their own. That's why I will keep standing up for a federal government that fulfills its responsibilities to America's families, America's children and America's future."
