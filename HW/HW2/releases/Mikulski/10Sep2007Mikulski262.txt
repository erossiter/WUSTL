SEN. MIKULSKI HOSTS HUBBLE ASTRONAUT ROUNDTABLE
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, today hosted a roundtable discussion and lunch with all seven NASA astronauts who will take part in the next Hubble servicing mission. This includes Mission Commander Scott Altman, Captain Gregory Johnson who will pilot the mission, and Mission Specialists John Grunsfeld, Michael Massimino, Andrew Feustel, Michael Good and K. Megan McArthur.  
   "I am honored and thrilled you are here on L - 332, with only 332 days until the Hubble Servicing Mission launch on August 7, 2008! After NASA cancelled the Hubble Mission in 2004, I asked for a second opinion. I promised that if the NASA Administrator said a servicing mission was safe, I would fight for the funding to get it done," said Senator Mikulski. "Hubble has been the single most important scientific instrument since Galileo's telescope and its best years are still ahead of it." 
   Also attending today's event were NASA Administrator Michael Griffin, NASA Associate Administrator Space Operations Dr. Bill Gerstenmaier, Director of NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md. Dr. Ed Weiler, CJS Ranking Member Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) and Science and Space Subcommittee of the Commerce Committee Chairman Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). 
   The CJS fiscal year 2008 spending bill provides almost $17.5 billion for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) - $150 million above the President's budget request. This includes full funding for the Hubble Servicing Mission. The spending bill passed the full Appropriations Committee in June 2007, and will now move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
