SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF DOD BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE LIST
  "Overall, today's announcement is good news for our national security and for Maryland.  
   "Maryland bases develop the smart weapons that protect our troops and protect our nation. From Indian Head's bunker-buster bombs that rooted the Taliban out of its caves, to the armored trucks now being tested at Aberdeen Proving Ground, and the test pilots at Pax River - Maryland bases add real value to our military. 
   "Since the last round of base closings, I've worked hard with our military alliances to BRAC-proof our bases, making sure they have the facilities and technology they need to serve our nation. We've also worked hard within the Pentagon to highlight the value of our bases. Today's announcement is a testament to our military alliances, and to the workforce at Maryland's bases. 
   "Yet there is a serious yellow flashing light. The most flawed recommendation is the proposal to move the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency headquarters from Bethesda. This is an unnecessary and costly move - for no apparent benefit. At a time when reform of our intelligence community should be our highest priority, the Secretary of Defense should not waste time and resources on shuffling vital intelligence assets around the beltway. 
   "As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I will continue to stand up for Maryland's military facilities - based on their mission, merit, and value to our nation."
