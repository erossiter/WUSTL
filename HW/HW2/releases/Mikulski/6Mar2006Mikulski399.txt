SEN. MIKULSKI INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO BLOCK U.S. FUNDING FOR HAMAS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined colleagues Sens. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.) and Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to introduce the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, which prohibits U.S. funding for the Palestinian Authority unless Hamas complies with a detailed set of guidelines to ensure peace.  
   "We can't afford to put our faith in a terrorist organization. I won't even consider providing financial support before this new government rejects terrorism, ends calls for the destruction of Israel and reaffirms commitment to existing peace agreements," said Senator Mikulski. "We can't risk Israel's security or the lives of innocent people." 
   The bill restricts U.S. interaction and assistance to the Palestinian Authority if Hamas doesn't publicly acknowledge Israel's right to exist and adhere to previous agreements with the United States and Israel. The legislation also requires the Palestinian Authority to combat and dismantle terrorist organizations within the territory and to support democracy. 
   If these and other outlined objectives for peace are not met, the bill would prohibit U.S. diplomatic contact with the Palestinian Authority and cut off direct and indirect financial assistance to the territory. It would also place travel restrictions on anyone associated with the Palestinian Authority. 
   "We can't let Hamas off the hook. Hamas must make clear its commitment to peace - not just with words, but with deeds," said Senator Mikulski. "They must prevent terror attacks from the Palestinian territory." 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Foreign Operations Appropriations subcommittee.
