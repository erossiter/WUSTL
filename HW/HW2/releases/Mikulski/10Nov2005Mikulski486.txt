SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES JOIN REPS. CARDIN, CUMMINGS TO ANNOUNCE KEY FEDERAL FUNDING TO KEEP BALTIMORE SAFER
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) joined Reps. Ben Cardin and Elijah Cummings (both D-Md.) today to announce that the conference report on the Science, State, Justice, Commerce, and Related Agencies 2006 spending bill includes key funding to keep Baltimore communities safer.  
   "We need to continue to work to protect Baltimore neighborhoods and families - that means safer streets and safer communities," said Senator Mikulski. "This funding will help the people of Baltimore clean up their streets and fight the crime that is destroying neighborhoods. I am so proud to have fought for this federal investment, and will continue to do all I can to make our communities safer. We have again shown that together, we can do better." 
   "This funding represents a multi-pronged approach to keeping Maryland communities safer," said Senator Sarbanes. "From crime-fighting research to providing opportunities for our youth to steer clear of actions that could put them in crime's way, these federal funds are important to an overall crime fighting and crime prevention effort." 
   "I am particularly pleased that this funding provides the Baltimore City Police Department with $100,000 for lab top computers. It's important that we have a modern, effective police force that can use technology to fight crime and protect our citizens," said Congressman Cardin. "This funding helps to move the police force into the 21st Century." 
   "These funds will be of great benefit to our region in furthering our efforts to both fight and prevent crime," Congressman Cummings said. "Maryland is fortunate to have Senator Mikulski as the Ranking Member of this critical Appropriations Subcommittee." 
   This year's spending bill includes the following funding for Baltimore: 
   * $2 million for a statewide anti-gang initiative led by the U.S. Attorney for Maryland. The U.S. Attorney will lead an effort to coordinate local, state and federal law enforcement, prosecutorial and anti-gang programs around the Baltimore Metro area and throughout the State of Maryland to fight gang activity in neighborhoods, communities and schools. 
   * $2 million for the University of Baltimore to expand its Forensic Crime Studies program, which was developed in partnership with the Baltimore City Police Department. The program will help train a new generation of forensic scientists and crime fighters. 
   * $1 million for the Safe and Sound After School Programs to set up successful after school programs in Baltimore schools. This initiative sponsors 83 different programs throughout Baltimore City that provide after school programs and employment opportunities for school-aged youth. After school programs help reduce juvenile crime and delinquency. 
   * $1 million for the City of Baltimore's Health Department for the Multi-systemic Therapy program, which is an intensive, home-based intervention program assisting the most high-risk juvenile offenders and their families. 
   * $750,000 for the Kennedy Krieger Institute for early childhood intervention programs to help families cope with at-risk children and prevent juvenile delinquency. It will serve families from Baltimore City and the surrounding counties. 
   * $500,000 for Baltimore City to help ex-offenders return to the community through the employment connections program. The Mayor's Office of Employment Development (MOED) will create a one-stop center providing a wide-range of training and counseling services to ex-offenders under parole, probation, and mandatory supervision to prevent and reduce recidivism among ex-offenders returning to Baltimore's neighborhoods and communities. 
   * $100,000 to equip the Baltimore City Police Department with mobile workstations for police vehicles, providing necessary technology to reduce and prevent crime. 
   The conference report was passed by the U.S. House yesterday with a vote of 397-19. A vote in the U.S. Senate is expected soon. Once passed by both Houses of Congress, the bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
