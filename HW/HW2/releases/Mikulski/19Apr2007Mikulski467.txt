SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON SUPREME COURT REPRODUCTIVE CHOICE DECISION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today following yesterday's Supreme Court decision to limit a woman's reproductive choice. Sen. Mikulski is an original co-sponsor of the Freedom of Choice Act (FOCA), which was introduced in the Senate today. FOCA would codify the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision into law. It also affirms a woman's fundamental right to choose whether or not to have a child and allows her to make that choice free of governmental interference at any time prior to fetal viability:  
   "Yesterday's Supreme Court decision sets a dangerous precedent in disregarding the life of a mother when dealing with issues of reproductive choice. 
   "I absolutely support a woman's right to choose. As someone who represents a constituency that includes so many different religious and philosophical viewpoints, I feel that federal legislation should respect the rights of the individual conscience. I firmly believe it is up to a woman to determine whether or when to bear a child. 
   "I have fought to improve women's health during the more than two decades I have served in Congress. Whether it is establishing offices of women's health, fighting for insurance coverage of contraceptives, or requiring federal quality standards for mammography, I will continue the fight to improve women's health. 
   "The Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade decision acknowledged the fundamental right to privacy in our Constitution and gave every woman the right to decide what to do with her own body. This decision is important to women's rights, women's health and public health. Since that historic day, women all across the country and the world have had improved access to reproductive health care and services. Yesterday's decision begins a dangerous trend in turning back the clock."
