SEN. MIKULSKI PLEDGES SUPPORT FOR NEW IRAQ RESOLUTION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today expressed her support for a binding joint congressional resolution (S.J. Res. 9) that requires the removal of U.S. troops from Iraq by March 31, 2008, with a phased redeployment within 120 days of the proposal's enactment. The resolution will be debated on the Senate floor this week.  
   The resolution directs the President to: 
   * Promptly transition the mission of U.S. forces in Iraq and begin a phased redeployment within 120 days of enactment; 
   * Set the goal of redeploying all combat forces by March 31, 2008, except for limited number of troops essential for: force protection, training and equipping Iraqi troops, and targeted counter-terror operations; 
   * Develop a new comprehensive strategy to ensure stability in Iraq, by implementing the redeployment as part of comprehensive economic, diplomatic and political strategy that includes a sustained engagement with Iraq's neighbors and the international community. 
   "As a U.S. Senator, I have an obligation to make sure our troops are brought home not only swiftly, but safely. I will consider any option to bring our troops home, but I will not abandon them while they are on the battlefield or when they come home needing health care," said Senator Mikulski. "I will not vote to end funding for: the troop pay that allows them to support their spouses and children, the body armor and up-armored Humvees they need to survive, the tourniquets and surgical hospitals on the battlefield, the jet fuel for the airplanes that take injured troops from Baghdad to Germany and then home, or the medical care they need when they get here." 
   Next week, Senator Mikulski and her colleagues on the Senate Appropriations Committee will consider the emergency spending package, which will be an opportunity for the kind of debate on the President's war that many Republican Senators have filibustered. Expected to be included is funding for the day-to-day needs of troops on the ground, and additional support for our military hospitals, like Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C., which has seen its reputation for troop care tarnished by the Bush administration's failure to look out for wounded Soldiers when they return from the battlefield.
