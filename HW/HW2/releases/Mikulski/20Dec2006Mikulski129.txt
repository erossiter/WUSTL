SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES PLEA TO CONSIDER CUMBERLAND VETERANS' FACILITY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today sent a request to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Nicholson, urging him to consider creating one or more long-term health care facilities in Western Maryland. On a recent trip to the area, Sen. Mikulski heard of her constituents' concerns about unmet long-term health care needs of veterans in the region.  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   Dear Secretary Nicholson, 
   There are over half a million veterans living in Maryland. Charlotte Hall in St. Mary's County is the state's only veterans' long-term care facility. This means that veterans and their spouses living in Western Maryland must drive at least 200 miles to receive the long-term care they need and deserve. Clearly there is a great need for one or more long-term care facilities in Western Maryland. I believe that there is an opportunity to make this happen. The Western Maryland Health Care System has decided to close two hospital facilities in Cumberland. City officials are now conducting a feasibility study on whether to turn these buildings into long-term care facilities for veterans. 
   I strongly support the creation of one or more veterans long-term care facilities in Western Maryland. I encourage the VA to work with Governor-elect Martin O'Malley and the Maryland Department of Veterans Affairs to determine how many veterans in Western Maryland have unmet long-term health care needs. I also ask that you take a close look at the recommendations of the City of Cumberland's feasibility study when it's complete. 
   Our promises made to our nation's veterans must be kept. There is a huge need for long-term care for veterans and their spouses. We have a commitment to providing adequate and convenient health care services for those who risked everything for our country.
