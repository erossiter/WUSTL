SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES FUNDING TO EASE NURSING SHORTAGE AND FOR KEY NURSING PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that several key projects in the Baltimore region are slated to receive funding in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is now sent to the President for his signature. The more than $388 billion omnibus spending bill completes the 9 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government through fiscal year 2005. To stay within the spending constraints demanded by the White House, all programs in the bill were cut by 0.80 percent.  
   "Too often, America's nurses are overworked, underpaid and undervalued. America is facing a nursing shortage, and it is only getting worse," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I worked to make nursing recruitment and retention a priority in the federal law book with the Nurse Reinvestment Act in 2002. I have been fighting ever since to make nursing recruitment and retention a priority on the federal checkbook." 
   An increase of $8 million for Nursing Workforce Development Programs. The omnibus increases funding for the Nurse Reinvestment Act and other nursing workforce development programs (Title VIII) by almost $8 million, bringing the total funding to almost $151.9 million for these vital programs. Prior to passage of this bill, Senator Mikulski successfully increased funding for those nursing programs by over $45 million. 
   * $48,000 for Villa Julie College in Baltimore County to establish a Nursing Distance Learning program. This money will be spent on distance learning technology to coordinate between Villa Julie College and a group of Maryland community colleges and hospitals. This program is providing leadership to deal with the severe nursing shortage. 
   * $248,000 for University of Maryland at Baltimore to establish an institute for nursing educators. These funds would help registered nurses and masters' students rapidly complete doctoral studies in preparation for faculty positions. This program will help address the critical shortage of faculty in nursing schools, that consequently forces schools to turn away nursing students. 
   * $297, 600 for Howard Community College to expand nursing education to accommodate more students each year. Funding will be used for laboratory equipment, new faculty and staff, and renovation of the lab space. Expanding the nursing education program at Howard Community College will help alleviate the nursing shortage in Maryland.
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee and the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
