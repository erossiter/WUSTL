CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES MORE THAN $34.4 MILLION FOR BALTIMORE METRO AREA ARMED FORCES
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2006 Defense spending bill, which includes an additional $150 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry out their missions." The spending bill includes more than $34.4 million in additional funding for Baltimore metro area defense projects, including: 
   * $3.5 million for the Air Force Reserve Command to upgrade radars in their F-16 fighter aircraft
