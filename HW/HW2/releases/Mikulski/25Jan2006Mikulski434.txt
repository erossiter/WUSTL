SEN. MIKULSKI, COLLEAGUES INTRODUCE BILL TO BOOST U.S. COMPETITIVENESS IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.), Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) today introduced a package of three bills aimed at helping America maintain its leading edge in science and technology. The bills are collectively titled the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act. The PACE Act implements 20 recommendations contained in a recent report by the National Academy of Science titled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm."  
   The Senators prepared the following statements for today's press conference held at 10:15 a.m. in room SD-366: 
   Senator Mikulski's statement: 
   "The whole foundation of American culture and economy is based on the concept of discovery and innovation. When you look at what has made America a superpower, it's our innovation and our technology. We have to look at where the new ideas are going to come from that are going to generate the new products for the 21st century. The PACE Act will help to set the framework and creates the building blocks that we need for a smarter America." 
   Senator Bingaman's statement: 
   "The PACE Act will sustain our vibrant science and technology sector, and with it our well-being, health, environment, and security. It will invest in R&D, encourage education, and nurture a business environment that transforms new knowledge into new high wage jobs. The passage of this farsighted public investment initiative will ensure that the United States is stronger, smarter, and leads the world in scientific and technological innovation well into the future." 
   Senator Alexander's statement: 
   "We're now playing in a tougher league. China and India are competing for our jobs. The best way to keep those jobs in America is to maintain our brainpower edge in science and technology. We asked the experts who should know exactly what we should do. They've told us. Now we should do it." 
   Senator Domenici's statement: 
   "It is clear to us that energizing American brainpower must be a priority. Every facet of our lives, from national security to modern medicine to the everyday household goods, relies on technology. There are troubling signs we are not keeping pace with other advancing nations. We must change, and that change is reflected in the PACE Act."
