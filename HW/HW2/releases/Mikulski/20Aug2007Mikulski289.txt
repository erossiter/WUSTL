SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR WORCHESTER COUNTY POLICE
  Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today announced that the Snow Hill Police Department in Worchester County has been awarded $23,561 in federal funding though the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development Community Facility Grant Program.  
   "The Federal government has a responsibility to ensure our nation's law enforcement officers have the equipment and training they need to do the job," said Senator Cardin. "Our local police officers are on the frontlines every day protecting our communities, and it is critical that they have the resources to deal with any emergency or life-threatening situation." 
   "Law enforcement officers work hard every day to prevent crime and keep our neighborhoods safe. We must protect our protectors with more than just words," Senator Mikulski said. "I will continue to fight to keep our community police departments a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   USDA Rural Development Community Facility Grants fund essential community facilities for health care, public safety, and community and public services, including the purchase of equipment required for a facility's operation. 
   The Snow Hill Police Department has been awarded $23,561 to assist the department in purchasing computer equipment, a generator, and a vehicle. Two of the department's three vehicles have been taken out of service and their computer system requires updating to enable the department to merge data with the Worchester County Sheriff's Office system.
