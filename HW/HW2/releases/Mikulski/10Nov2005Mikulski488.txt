SENATE APPROVES PROPOSAL TO PROTECT HEALTHCARE SERVICES FOR LOW-INCOME SENIORS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced that a proposal, which allows eight states to continue providing Adult Day Health Care (ADHC) services as an optional benefit under state Medicaid plans, has passed the U.S. Senate as an amendment to the Deficit Reduction Omnibus Reconciliation Act of 2005.  
 Without the amendment, seniors in these states would be at risk of losing affordable, critical health and social services. 
   "This effort helps assure that seniors have access to the healthcare they need and deserve," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to make sure that the federal government is doing all it can to help all seniors live healthy lives." 
   For more than 20 years, Maryland, California, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Texas and Washington have offered ADHC services as a benefit under Medicaid. 
   ADHC provides the following services, which reduce the risk factors for more expensive nursing home placement and institutional care: 
   * Skilled nursing care to monitor, intervene and treat health conditions before they become acute; 
   * Therapeutic activities and socialization with peers to improve and maintain mental status, decrease isolation and depression; 
   * Individualized dietary and nutrition services, which are critical to health; 
   * Physical therapy, which restores and maintains large muscle functioning to maintain independence in activities of daily living and prevent falls; 
   * Occupational therapy, which restores and maintains the independent living skills needed to manage household activities. 
   Senator Mikulski joined several Democratic Senate colleagues in co-sponsoring the legislation including Senators Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.), Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jon Corzine (D-N.J.), Frank Lautenberg (D-N.J.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), and Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.).
