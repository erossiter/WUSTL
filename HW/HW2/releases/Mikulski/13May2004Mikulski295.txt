SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS ON CHINA TO RELEASE DR. YANG JIANLI
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) is calling for the immediate release of Dr.  
 Yang Jianli on humanitarian grounds. Dr. Yang was recently sentenced to five years in prison by the People's Republic of China. Dr. Yang, a scholar and democracy activist, has been detained in violation of his human rights and international law by the People's Republic of China since April 2002. 
   "Dr. Yang has been held in violation of his human rights and international law," said Senator Mikulski. "He should be freed now. I strongly urge the Chinese government to respond to the continual requests for Yang's freedom by the United States government and human rights groups around the world." 
   Senator Mikulski has been a strong advocate for Dr. Yang's release from prison. She co-sponsored a Senate Resolution (S.Res.184) in June 2003 that said the United States should work to secure the immediate humanitarian release of Dr. Yang Jianli by the Government of the People's Republic of China. The Resolution unanimously passed the Senate in July 2003.
