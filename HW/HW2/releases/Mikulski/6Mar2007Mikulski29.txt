SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS FOR EQUAL PAY FOR WOMEN
  On this day in Women's History Month, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined a group of her Senate colleagues to reintroduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to help achieve true pay equity for women in the workforce. The group was led by Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Tom Harkin (D-Iowa).  
   "Women make this country run - we are business leaders, entrepreneurs, politicians, mothers and more. But even in 2007, women who work full-time, year-round earn only 77 cents for every $1 their male counterpart makes," said Senator Mikulski. "This is unacceptable. I am proud to reintroduce the Paycheck Fairness Act to continue the fight to close the wage gap between men and women." 
   The Paycheck Fairness Act outlines a number of steps to empower women to negotiate for equal pay, create strong incentives for employers to obey the laws that are in place, and to strengthen federal outreach and enforcement efforts, including: 
   * Creating a training program to help women strengthen their negotiation skills. 
   * Enforcing equal pay laws for federal contractors. 
   * Requiring the Department of Labor to enhance outreach and training efforts to work with employers to eliminate pay disparities. 
   * Prohibiting employers from retaliating against employees who share salary information with their co-workers. 
   * Allowing women to sue for punitive damages in addition to the compensatory damages now available under the Equal Pay Act. 
   * Requiring the Department of Labor to continue collecting and disseminating information about women workers. 
   While there has been much progress in closing the wage gap over the past three decades, research still shows that pay discrimination continues to be a problem between men and women who perform the same job. And the disparity occurs in jobs all over the pay scale - not just low-income positions.
