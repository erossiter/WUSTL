SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $46.7 MILLION FOR BALTIMORE-AREA PRIORITIES IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Energy and Water Development 2008 spending bill, which passed the full committee, provides more than $70 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in Maryland, including $46.7 million for Baltimore-area priorities.  
   "This bill is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on Maryland's waterways. These projects will help clean up our waterways, as well as ensure that freight carriers and cruise ships can safely navigate Baltimore's channels so the Port can continue to serve as an important economic engine for the state," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep the Port of Baltimore and Maryland's waterways a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   The bill includes $250,000 for the University of Maryland, Baltimore's Center for Nanomedicine and Cellular Delivery to develop nanoconstructs to deliver medication to diseased tissue. This promising and innovative research will be crucial in America's fight against cancer. 
   The spending bill also includes funding for the following U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in the Baltimore area:
   * $18.7 million for annual maintenance dredging of the Port of Baltimore shipping channels. 
   * $13.9 million for operations and maintenance of the C&D Canal and approach channels. 
   * $10.4 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project, which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems. 
   * $1 million for improvements to the Gwynns Falls watershed, including restoring wetlands, stabilizing streambanks, rehabilitating the sewer system, and retrofitting storm water management features. 
   * $700,000 for Herring Bay and Rockhold Creek in Anne Arundel County for maintenance dredging. This project is a critical harbor serving Deal, Md. It also serves 50 commercial fisherman, crabbing and oyster operations, and the seafood packing industry. 
   * $600,000 for the Baltimore Metropolitan Patapsco Urban River Restoration Initiative for navigation improvement analysis, sediment sampling, trash management, and restoration concept design. 
   * $600,000 for the Mid-Bay Island Study, which is examining the potential beneficial use of placing clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore on James and Barren Islands in Dorchester County. 
   * $335,000 for drift removal in the Port of Baltimore shipping channels. 
   * $200,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Marshlands Study in Dorchester County to examine how to restore the marshlands in and around the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge using clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore. More than 8,000 of the 17,000 acres of tidal marsh at Blackwater has been lost since 1933 due to sea-level rise, invasive species and shoreline erosion. 
   * $60,000 for Parrish Creek in Anne Arundel County to complete engineering and design for a maintenance dredging. This project will benefit approximately 50 commercial fishing vessels. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
