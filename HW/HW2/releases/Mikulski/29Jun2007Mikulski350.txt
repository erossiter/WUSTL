SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $19.6 MILLION FOR EASTERN SHORE, BAY PRIORITIES IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Energy and Water Development 2008 spending bill, which passed the full committee, provides more than $70 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in Maryland, and $19.6 million for Eastern Shore and Chesapeake Bay initiatives. 
   "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is Maryland's greatest natural resource. This is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the Bay," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep the Bay and Eastern Shore communities a priority in the federal checkbook."  
   THE SPENDING BILL INCLUDES: 
   * $10.4 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project, which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas, and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems. 
   * $2 million for the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration Program, which will be used to initiate construction at the Ewell Wastewater Treatment Plant on Smith Island in Somerset County, and to continue the evaluation of the risks and benefits of introducing non-native Asian oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay. 
   * $2 million for the Chesapeake Bay Oyster Restoration program to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on the reefs. 
   * $1.9 million for Assateague Island in Worcester County for restoration efforts that will protect the northern end of the island and its fragile habitat. 
   * $1 million for the Honga River and Tar Bay in Dorchester County to begin the engineering and design for a future maintenance dredging project. This project serves as a thoroughfare between the Chesapeake Bay and the Honga River, and is used by fishing vessels from several harbors in lower Dorchester County to get to their fishing grounds. It cuts off nearly 20 miles of additional travel distance around Hooper Island. 
   * $800,000 for the Wicomico River to dredge the upper river. This navigation project serves the Delmarva Peninsula with approximately eight facilities for grain exports and petroleum imports that are vital to the economic health of the region. 
   * $600,000 for the Mid-Bay Island Study, which is examining the potential beneficial use of placing dredged material on James and Barren Islands in Dorchester County. 
   * $250,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Shoreline Erosion Study to develop a Maryland shoreline master plan and a low-cost shoreline protection manual for the public. 
   * $200,000 for the Chesapeake Bay Marshlands Study in Dorchester County to examine how to restore the marshlands in and around the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. More than 8,000 of the 17,000 acres of tidal marsh at Blackwater has been lost since 1933 due to sea-level rise, invasive species and shoreline erosion. 
   * $200,000 for Atlantic Coast of Maryland Beach Protection in Ocean City for periodic nourishment and maintenance of the beach to prevent coastal flooding and erosion. 
   * $140,000 for the Twitch Cove and Big Thorofare in Somerset County for the engineering and design for future maintenance dredging. This project serves the communities of Smith Island. 
   * $120,000 for Goose Creek in Somerset County to begin engineering and design of a maintenance dredging project important to a seafood packing house and commercial fishing vessels. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
