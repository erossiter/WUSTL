SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY LEADERS FOR NATIONAL HARBOR GROUNDBREAKING
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) joined Governor Robert Ehrlich, Sen. Paul Sarbanes, Rep. Steny Hoyer, Rep. Al Wynn and Prince George's County Executive Jack Johnson today to celebrate the groundbreaking of the National Harbor. This project is located on 537 acres of riverfront property in the Smoot Bay area of Oxon Hill. The $560 million center will consist of a 2,000-room hotel and 400,000 square foot convention center under one roof. It is considered to be the largest commercial investment in Maryland history.  
   "National Harbor is the latest piece of our work in Prince George's County, and will be an economic engine for the region," said Senator Mikulski. "I have fought to make good things happen, like revitalize Route 1 and empower local communities with federal investments. I have also worked to stop bad things from happening, like preventing the Administration from building a maximum security federal detention center here in Prince George's County. Residents can count on me to keep standing up for their day-to-day needs and the long-range needs of the country." 
   This project is expected to have a significant economic impact upon Prince George's County. It is predicted that the National Harbor will generate more than 13,000 jobs, 52 percent of which are estimated to be filled by County residents. National Harbor is also expected to generate $785 million in net tax revenue over the next 30 years. 
   Senator Mikulski has fought for more than $1.5 billion in federal funding to replace the Wilson Bridge. She also fights each year to increase the amount of federal formula dollars Maryland receives for transportation. This federal funding is essential to maintain and update roadways near National Harbor.
