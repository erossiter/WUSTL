SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE ALMOST $800,000 IN SCHOOL SAFETY GRANTS FOR MARYLAND LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that 4 local Police Departments throughout Maryland will share a total of $788,351 to enhance safety in our schools. This grant comes from the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services' (COPS) Secure our Schools, program which provides funds to improve security at schools and on school grounds. The program is administered by the Department of Justice.  
   Secure our Schools is one of several COPS initiatives. It gives the awardees the opportunity to establish and enhance a variety of safety equipment, such as metal detectors, locks, lighting, and other deterrent measures. It also provides security assessments and security training for students and personnel, as well as programs to continue to enhance school safety efforts within their communities. These grants are for one year and will fund 50 percent of the total costs, with a minimum 50 percent local match. 
   The Police Departments receiving funding are as follows: 
   * Baltimore County Police Department - $150,000 
  * Baltimore City Police Department - $500,465 
  * Cecil County Sheriff's Office - $107,866 
  * Dorchester County Sheriff's Department - $30,000 
   "Combining community policing and education is an excellent way to help prevent school violence," said Sarbanes. "Students should be free to learn and grow in the safest environment possible. I am pleased to see that these local police departments have been awarded the funding they need to enhance the technologies needed to keep our students safe." 
   "I am committed to doing all I can to make our schools and our communities safer," said Senator Mikulski. "This federal money puts the resources of Maryland's law enforcement in our schools to reduce crime and protect our students, teachers and staff. I will continue to work in the Senate to provide the equipment and resources needed to keep our children safe."
