SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES CONGRESSIONAL PASSAGE OF OLDER AMERICANS ACT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), senior Democrat on the Retirement Security and Aging Subcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, tonight celebrated Congress' unanimous passage of the Older Americans Act (OAA) reauthorization bill. Created in 1965, the OAA is essential for the delivery of social and nutritional services for America's seniors. The bill will now go to the President for his signature.  
   "Seniors today are living longer, healthier lives. We must do what we can to help them be as independent and active as possible, and provide the resources necessary to meet new challenges," said Senator Mikulski. "By passing the OAA, we have honored one of the responsibilities we have to our seniors. Promises made when the OAA was created must be promises kept." 
   The reauthorization bill strengthens current OAA programs and creates new innovative initiatives to address the needs of our country's aging population. The legislation supports programs such as information and referral services that are the backbone of OAA programs, senior nutrition programs, and elder abuse programs. 
   The bill contains several priorities that Senator Mikulski has been fighting for: 
   * Meals on Wheels: The bill strengthens this critical, national program. 2.75 million people receive meals through this program at senior centers or in their homes each year, including more than 42,000 in Maryland. 
   * National Family Caregiver Support Program: Increases the federal investment over the next five years to make sure there are adequate resources for this program. The program helps provide family caregivers with information, resources and respite care. The bill removes any age eligibility restrictions for individuals with Alzheimer's. 
   * Naturally Occurring Retirement Communities (NORC) Aging in Place Initiative: Provides for a new national innovative grant program that will support and enhance the ability of seniors to age in place by providing them with necessary support resources, including transportation, health programs and social work services. The program builds on the success of established NORC programs, which have a proven track record in Maryland's Baltimore and Montgomery Counties. 
   * Emergency Preparedness for Seniors: Requires states and Area Agencies on Aging to coordinate and develop plans to establish guidelines for addressing the senior population during a disaster or emergency. 
   * Senior Community Service Employment Program: Supports critical program that helps seniors gain employment in community service settings such as Meals on Wheels programs, senior centers and public libraries.
