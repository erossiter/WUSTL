SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI PROTEST SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN AMTRAK FARES
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) have sent a letter to the President of Amtrak expressing their "deep concerns" about the recently announced increase in Amtrak fares scheduled to go into effect on September 20 and urging him to reconsider the magnitude of the increases.  
   In their September 13 letter to David Gunn, the President and CEO of Amtrak, the two Maryland Senators, who are both strong supporters of Amtrak, wrote, "While we recognize that Amtrak, like all transportation providers, is experiencing higher fuel costs, it would appear that the fare increases - particularly for Smart Pass passengers -substantially exceed the rate of increase in locomotive diesel fuel prices. It is our understanding that, over the past year, diesel fuel has increased by approximately 40 percent, while Amtrak fares for commuters traveling between Baltimore and Philadelphia would increase by 67 percent. Moreover, the Northeast corridor is electrified and electricity costs have not increased substantially over the past year. Your decision to raise fares would place a disproportionate and unjustified burden on Amtrak's loyal riders in the Northeast corridor." 
   "We are concerned that this substantial increase in fares will force commuters to stop riding the train and further reduce revenues for Amtrak. Such a counter-productive policy could place Amtrak in further jeopardy while also increasing traffic congestion and pollution in metropolitan areas around the country," the Senators added. 
   According to press reports, nearly all Amtrak trains in the Northeast, including the Acela express that runs between Washington, New York, and Boston, will see fare increases. They also report that the sharpest fare increase will affect the Northeast Corridor train riders using multitrip passes.
