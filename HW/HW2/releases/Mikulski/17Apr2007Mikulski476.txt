SEN. MIKULSKI SENDS OPEN LETTER TO VIRGINIA TECH
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) sent the following open letter to the student body of Virginia Tech today:  
   A copy of the letter is below: 
   On Monday, like the rest of the nation, I watched in shock and horror as your campus came under fire and a student senselessly took the lives of at least 30 of your own, and brutally injured 15 others. I was devastated for the victims, for their families, for you, and for your community. My heart and prayers go out to all of you. 
   As the Senator from your neighbor state, which itself has more than 13 colleges and universities, the pain of this tragedy hit close to home for me. My heart broke for the young people - just starting off their lives - who fell victim to such senseless violence. They were at a world-class university, on the path to success, and in an environment where they should have been able to feel safe. 
   In 2002, the people of Virginia and my own state of Maryland were united in tragedy when the citizens and students of the Washington, D.C., metro area were also terrorized by gunmen - snipers that left 10 people dead and three wounded. We all remember the fear and heartache when that happened. I can only imagine what you must feel now. 
   While no one but yourselves can understand the full scale of your grief, we can offer you our whole-hearted, deepest empathy and sympathy. 
   You are in my thoughts and prayers. 
   Sincerely, 
   U.S. Senator Barbara A. Mikulski.
