SEN. MIKULSKI GETS 'A' FOR COMMITMENT TO DARFUR
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) was recognized today for her strong support of aggressive U.S. action in the Darfur region of Sudan, receiving an 'A' grade on a congressional scorecard from the Genocide Intervention Network.  
   "The United States can not stand idly by while the people of Darfur continue to suffer. We need a Special Envoy dedicated to building a peace plan for Sudan that will halt the violence, ensure the return of refugees, and establish a system of accountability," said Senator Mikulski. "I am outraged that the Khartoum regime is supporting another campaign of killing and committing other atrocities. I will continue to fight in the U.S. Senate for the people of Darfur to find the peace they deserve." 
   In her fight against the crisis in Darfur, Senator Mikulski has: 
   * Co-sponsored Senate Concurrent Resolution 133, which declares the atrocities unfolding in Darfur are genocide and urges President Bush to address the humanitarian crisis and peacefully resolve the conflict. 
   * Supported a measure in the 2006 Emergency Supplemental spending bill to provide $514 million for humanitarian assistance, and supported amendments to increase funding for a United Nations peacekeeping force and to establish a special envoy for Sudan to help develop peace agreements. 
   * Co-sponsored Senate Resolution 531, which urges President Bush to appoint a Special Envoy to the region. 
   * Co-sponsored the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act, which authorizes President Bush to provide assistance to reinforce the operations of the African Union, and blocks the assets of and denies visas to any individual responsible acts of genocide in Sudan. 
   The Genocide Intervention Network is a non-profit organization working to stop genocide around the globe. Today they released their first-ever scorecard, grading members of Congress on their support of legislative efforts to address the crisis in Darfur.
