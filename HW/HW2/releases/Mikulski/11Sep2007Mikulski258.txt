SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $20 MILLION FOR D.C. METRO AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate version of the Department of Defense 2008 spending bill includes $61.5 million for defense projects in Maryland, including $20 million for defense projects in the Washington, D.C., metro area. The legislation, which passed the subcommittee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops with the equipment they need on the battlefield, the benefits and services they deserve when they return home, and support for their families on the home front. We know how critical these funds are for our troops to fulfill their mission and return home safely," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for our troops."  
   The $20 million for Washington area defense projects includes: 
   * $5 million for Naval ship hydrodynamic facilities at Carderock to replace and improve ship testing facilities. 
   * $5 million for the Army Research Laboratory and University of Maryland PEM Fuel Cell Tactical Generators Initiative to develop lighter and more fuel efficient generators. 
   * $3 million for the Tactical Automated Security System (TASS) Advanced Communications Module, which upgrades communications for an existing deployable perimeter security system. 
   * $2 million for Post-IED Craniofacial Injury Reconstruction at Fort Detrick. The funding will be used for pre-surgical planning for reconstructive facial and cranial surgery for damage caused by Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs). 
   * $2 million for a Battlefield Extraction-Assist Robot (BEAR) to retrieve injured troops from the battlefield. 
   * $2 million for Fibrin Adhesive State (FAST) Dressing, which is used to treat burns and wounds on the battlefield. 
   * $1 million for a multi-purpose Biodefense Immunoarray to develop additional immunoarrays for pathogens, and to develop multi-agent arrays for other types of bio-threats, including encephalitis viruses, hemorrhagic fever viruses, and multiple toxins.
   A full Appropriations Committee vote is expected tomorrow morning on the spending bill. The bill will then move to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
