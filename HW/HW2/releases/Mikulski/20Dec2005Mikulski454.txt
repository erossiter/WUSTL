SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES CELEBRATE OPENING OF BALTIMORE'S POTEE STREET BRIDGE
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) applauded the opening of the Potee Street Bridge today, four years after they secured $11 million in federal funding for its reconstruction in the fiscal year 2001 transportation spending bill.  
   "Every day, Marylanders depend on our roadways, bridges and tunnels to get them back and forth to jobs, schools and home. It's my job as a member of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds transportation to fight for the resources Maryland needs to make sure our roads are safe, efficient and reliable," said Senator Mikulski. "I'm proud to be able to keep our promises to Maryland commuters." 
   "It's potholes no more as a result of the construction of this new bridge," said Senator Sarbanes. "This investment of public funds for the new Potee Street Bridge will benefit motorists, bicyclists and pedestrians alike." 
   The bridge spans the Patapsco River, connecting downtown Baltimore with heavily populated South Baltimore, Glen Burnie and northern Anne Arundel County. It also provides much needed access to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel Thruway and the Baltimore Beltway. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
