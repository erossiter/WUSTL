SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR CUMBERLAND NEIGHBORHOOD HOUSING SERVICES
  Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today announced the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded $5,000 to the Cumberland Neighborhood Housing Services to perform an economic analysis for the redevelopment of the Wills Creek neighborhood. 
   "This is a federal investment in housing today and tomorrow in Western Maryland. I'm proud that these funds will help Cumberland Neighborhood Housing Services continue to look for innovative solutions to redevelop the Wills Creek neighborhood," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep Western Maryland communities a priority in the federal checkbook."
   "Strong neighborhoods are the critical ingredient to the success of any community," said Senator Cardin. "I support this federal commitment to help ensure that the Wills Creek community has a strategic plan for its viability and success."
   Cumberland Neighborhood Housing Services will use its funds to undertake an economic analysis of the housing market potential in the Wills Creek community that will support a master plan redevelopment of the neighborhood. The analysis will determine competitive housing factors, development trends for the neighborhood, and determine the potential market. The final report will include a strategy for new development and it is expected that the project will help create 25 jobs and two new businesses.
   In addition to ARC funds, local sources will provide $5,000 bringing the total project funding to $10,000.
   The ARC is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
