SEN. MIKULSKI PUSHES FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF 9-11 COMMISSION RECOMMENDATIONS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) is pushing for legislation that would bolster the nation's homeland security efforts by implementing all 41 recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission.  
 These recommendations include intelligence reform, border and transportation security, information sharing and outreach to the Muslim world. The bipartisan legislation, authored by Sens. John McCain (R-AZ) and Joe Lieberman (D-CT), was introduced today in the Senate.
   "America owes the 9/11 Commissioners gratitude and appreciation," said Senator Mikulski. "They approached their work with integrity, independence and intellectual rigor. Now it's time for the Administration and Congress to work just as hard and with the same commitment to make America safer. We need a sense of urgency and we need to get it right. That's why I'm fighting to make sure all the recommendations made by the 9/11 Commission become law."
   Among other things, this legislation would: 
   * Create a strong National Intelligence Director with real budget authority and a National Counterterrorism Center to pull together intelligence activities;
   * Establish a far-reaching information sharing network to promote sharing of intelligence and homeland security information throughout government, including with state and local agencies;
   * Develop an integrated screening system using a network of screening points at U.S. borders, in the transportation system and other critical infrastructure that need to be protected against terrorist attacks;
   * Increase aid to Afghanistan, renewed support for Pakistan and open new avenues of dialogue and diplomacy with the Muslim world; and 
   * Ensure that civil liberties and privacy rights are protected as reforms are implemented.
