SEN. MIKULSKI DEMANDS ANSWERS FROM CIA ON DESTRUCTION OF INTERROGATION TAPES
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, issued the following statement as CIA Director General Michael Hayden prepares to testify in front of the committee this afternoon on the agency's destruction of terror suspect interrogation videotapes. 
   "I am deeply concerned at the lack of clarity coming out of the CIA - first on methods of interrogations, second on the destruction of videotapes showing the interrogation of terrorist suspects. These were our record of what the CIA was doing and who they were doing it to. I will demand answers from General Hayden at today's hearing. We need to know from General Hayden, and anyone else who has relevant information:
   * Who did the CIA interrogate on the tapes? Were they 'ticking time bomb' suspects with information on immediate, significant threats or loss of life?
   * Who ok'd the orders to destroy these tapes?
   * What techniques were used on the tapes? What are some examples?
   * How long were the techniques used for? What was the frequency? What was the time frame?
   * What benefit did the CIA get out of taping interrogations?
   "People must be held accountable for their actions. I will work closely with my colleagues on the Intelligence Committee to get to the bottom of this investigation."
