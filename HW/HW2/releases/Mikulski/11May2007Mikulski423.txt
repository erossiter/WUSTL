SEN. MIKULSKI MEETS WITH DELTA SIGMA THETA SORORITY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) met with members of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority yesterday to discuss priorities for American families, including health care, access to higher education and the War in Iraq.  
   "There are many freedoms - speech, the right to organize, freedom of religion. But the real freedom is the freedom to achieve - to be yourself and to follow your dreams. That means access to higher education," said Senator Mikulski. "The war in Iraq costs close to $2 billion per week. If we bring our troops home even one week early, that's money we could use for education, for structured after school programs, for health care, and for aid to the elderly."
