SEN. MIKULSKI WELCOMES QUEEN OF ENGLAND TO GODDARD SPACE FLIGHT CENTER IN GREENBELT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) welcomed today's announcement that the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh will visit NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., on Tuesday, May 8. Sen. Mikulski will be in attendance for the visit, which will include a formal welcome and satellite phone call with astronauts at the International Space Station.  
   "I am so proud to welcome the Queen of England and the Duke of Edinburgh to Maryland's world-class space facility, and to show Her Majesty and His Royal Highness the truly extraordinary contributions that Goddard makes to science, exploration and discovery," said Senator Mikulski. "When astronauts go out into space, they stand on the shoulders of Goddard. Goddard is the astronaut's communication lifeline, handling all communication between the shuttle and mission control. But they're not only important to the shuttle. The scientists, engineers and administrative staff at Goddard keep Maryland a leader in innovation by creating the building blocks that will carry us through the next decade and set the stage for the next century." 
   All media credentials will be handled by Steve Atkins at the British Embassy Press Office at 202-588-6593. In addition to certain fixed point opportunities outside event sites (for arrival shots), there will be a number of pool opportunities during the day's event. Due to space limitations at venues, pools will be of limited size and will include TV, photographers and print journalists.
