SEN. MIKULSKI SWORN IN FOR FOURTH TERM
  Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) today was sworn in for her fourth term as a United States Senator.  
 In a ceremony on the floor of the Senate, Vice President Cheney administered the oath of office. 
   "I am the Senator from Maryland and the Senator for Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "I'm so proud to be returning to the United States Senate, to make Maryland and America safer, stronger and smarter. I thank the people of Maryland for their continued support and confidence in me." 
   Senator Mikulski was reelected to her fourth term in November, breaking her own record to receive the highest number of votes of any candidate in the history of Maryland, over 1.5 million. Senator Mikulski received a majority of votes in counties in every region of the state, and every congressional district.

She will continue her membership on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.
