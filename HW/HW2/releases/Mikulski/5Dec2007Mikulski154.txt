SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES KENT COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL TO RECEIVE COMPUTER DONATIONS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced today that Kent County High School in Worton, Md., has been awarded 25 computers through the U.S. General Service Administration's (GSA) Computers for Learning (CFL) program. The CFL program matches excess federal agency and private sector computers with schools and educational non-profit organizations in need. Senator Mikulski arranged for the donation to assist Kent County in meeting an increased need for technology in the classroom.  
   "I am so pleased I could help Kent County High School receive these much-needed computers. Public schools and educational organizations help prepare our children to compete in a growing world," said Senator Mikulski. "Not every family has a computer in their home, but every student should have access to a computer in their classroom. The Computers for Learning Program helps our communities make sure our young people can compete in the world today with the most up-to-date resources available." 
   Initiated by an Executive Order signed by President Clinton in 1996, the CFL program is designed to help schools and educational non-profits meet their increasing technology needs by matching them with government agencies and private sector companies who have excess computers. By placing computers in classrooms, the CFL program assists schools in preparing students to compete and participate in an increasingly technology-focused workplace. 
   "In our society, technology is the tool and empowerment is the outcome. We need to make sure that our young people are given every opportunity to compete, to learn, and to be prepared," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight for Maryland's public schools in the Senate so that our students have the opportunities they need to succeed."
