SENATE APPROVES KEY FUNDING FOR SAFER, STRONGER, SMARTER MARYLAND, NATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski today joined her colleague Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) in announcing that Congress will give final approval to the $57 billion Science, State, Justice and Commerce 2006 spending bill this week. The bill will now go to the President for his signature.  
   The legislation provides funding for the Department of Justice, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Patent and Trademark Office, Small Business Administration, National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation and other regulatory agencies. 
   SAFER 
   * $21.7 billion for the Department of Justice, including: 
   - $5.8 billion for the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). 
   - $1.69 billion for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). 
   - $802 million for the United States Marshals Service, the agency that pays for judicial security, prisoner handling and fugitive apprehension. 
   - $5 billion for the federal prison system. 
   - $924 million for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). 
   - While the President's budget proposed devastating cuts to local law enforcement, Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes fought to add over $1 billion to local law enforcement programs, including $480 million for the COPS program and $340 million for juvenile justice programs. 
   - $64 million to fight methamphetamine production, use and addiction. 
   - $48 million to continue and expand the Missing and Exploited Children Program, which includes a sexual predator tip-line and a 24-hour telephone hotline for missing children. 
   - $2.7 million for the FBI's innocent images program to investigate and capture child pornographers who use the Internet to prey on children. 
   - $1.6 million for the criminal division to target, prosecute and seize the assets of those who commit crimes against children. 
   - The conference bill does not include a $1.3 billion rescission from The Crime Victims Fund, as proposed in the President's budget. The Crime Victims Fund makes grants to help victims of crime, including abused women and children. Grants are paid for out of fines collected from convicted felons. 
   "As a nation fighting a war on terrorism, we need to be safer, stronger and smarter so that we are able to better detect, prevent and respond to acts of terrorism," said Senator Mikulski. "While we are protecting the homeland, we also have to protect the hometown. This legislation gets us closer to these goals by standing up for our first responders and our law enforcement." 
   "This bill funds critically needed programs that help to protect our children, our families, our local communities, and our nation," said Senator Sarbanes. 
   STRONGER 
   * $3.95 billion for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), including: 
   - $696 million For the National Marine Fisheries Service to protect, restore, and enhance our Nation's fisheries that are so important to our economy. 
   - $836 million for the National Weather Service, because timely and accurate forecasts help save lives and protect property. 
   - $964 million for the National Environmental Satellite, Data and Information Service, so current environmental information can be transmitted quickly and accurately to the public. 
   * $284 million for the Economic Development Administration (EDA), saving the EDA from proposed elimination. 
   "NOAA saves lives and livelihoods - in Maryland and around the Nation," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I fought to restore over $300 million in cuts to the NOAA." 
   "These agencies help to serve as our early warning systems in the event of bad weather and also conduct needed research relating to our climate and our atmosphere and how they interrelate to our environment and our daily lives," continued Senator Sarbanes. 
   SMARTER 
   * $16.5 billion for NASA, which includes $250 million for a Hubble servicing mission. This fully funds all major space science and earth science programs, the space shuttle, space station, the Crew Exploration Vehicle (CEV) and the Moon-Mars initiative. 
   * $5.7 billion for the National Science Foundation, a $58 million increase over last year. This preserves funding for all major NSF programs, as well as funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities. 
   * $762 million for the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). NIST research helps develop new technologies and breakthroughs that create jobs and make the U.S. more competitive. 
   * $812 million for the Census Bureau, which will allow the 2010 census to move forward without delay and without any disruption to the workforce in Suitland, Md. 
   "I want to be strategic about investing our resources to win Nobel prizes and win market share," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I am standing up for an innovation economy, led by some of our best and brightest minds at our federal agencies." 
   "In order to compete in an ever-increasing global environment, we must provide the resources to those agencies that are on the cutting edge of our next major discovery, be it in space, or here on the ground. The funding for these agencies helps us to accomplish many of those goals," said Senator Sarbanes. "I stand alongside Senator Mikulski to fight to restore the cuts to the Census Bureau which provides research, demographic information and a snapshot of our people that is vital to all government agencies in determining how we look as a nation and the needs of our people as a result of that snapshot." 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move back to the House and Senate floors for final votes. Once passed by the House and Senate, the bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
