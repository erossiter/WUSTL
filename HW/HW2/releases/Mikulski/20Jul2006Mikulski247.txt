SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES STAND UP FOR BALTIMORE AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced the Senate version of the 2007 Department of Defense spending bill includes $1 billion for defense projects in the Baltimore area. The legislation, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families."  
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $1 billion in funding for Baltimore area defense projects, including: 
   * $390.9 million for the Air Force E-10A Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft to develop the next generation of technology, including wide-area surveillance, wideband communications, and near real-time comprehensive air views and surface battle space. 
   * $300 million for the Navy Littoral Combat Ship surface combatant, which makes Navy ships capable of operating in coastal areas and providing a key role in total Maritime Domain Awareness in support of the Global War on Terror. 
   * $166 million to develop Space Radar, which will provide the United States with a persistent, worldwide, near-instantaneous system to detect moving surface targets, including those inside territory. 
   * $135 million to replace Cobra Judy, a 50-year-old ship-based radar suite used for data collection against ballistic missiles for treaty monitoring and verification. 
   * $12.6 million for Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS) for system improvements to a manned combat submersible. 
   * $8.5 million for Advanced Surface Radar Technologies to develop and integrate radar technology on Navy ships. 
   * $6 million for Project Ancile, which will research, design, build, demonstrate, test and evaluate a suite of building protection systems that are capable of protecting critical U.S. government buildings against the already existing and evolving threats. 
   * $5 million for accelerating the development of a Heavy Fuel Engine for the Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to reduce Army logistics by requiring one type of fuel on the battlefield. 
   * $4 million for Marine Advanced Combat Garments, which will procure combat desert jackets used to enhance the U.S. Marine's survivability in a high desert and cold/dry environments similar to those experienced in Northern Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   * $4 million for Laser Marksmanship Training Program (LMTS), which contributes to individual soldier and unit readiness, greatly reduces training costs, and lessens the environmental impact of live fire training. 
   * $3 million for the Center for Resuscitation Research, which will use the Maryland State Trauma System as a trauma testbed for the Army. 
   * $2 million for the Phraselator Language Translation System, a machine-based language translation device that allows Army personnel deployed in the field to immediately translate phrases from English to other languages. 
   * $2 million to develop Affordable Towed Array Construction to allow anti-submarine and at-sea surveillance technology to be towed behind Navy ships. 
   * $1.3 million for Fort Meade Fire Department to purchase new fire fighting vehicles. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
