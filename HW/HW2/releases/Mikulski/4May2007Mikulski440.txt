SEN. MIKULSKI APPLAUDS DECISION AGAINST CONSOLIDATION OF CUMBERLAND MAIL PROCESSING CENTER
  After nearly two years of advocacy, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) applauded today's decision by the U.S. Postal Service to forgo its anticipated consolidation of the Cumberland Area Mail Processing Center (AMP). Sen. Mikulski has consistently expressed her opposition of the consolidation, which would have moved operations nearly 100 miles away to Frederick, Md., and compromised the safety and efficiency of the postal service across the rugged terrain of Western Maryland.  
   "Today's announcement is a great victory for the hardworking employees and residents of Cumberland. Postal facilities are part of the fabric of our neighborhoods," said Senator Mikulski. "Residents can count on me to continue to fight for Western Maryland." 
   In a letter to Senator Mikulski today, U.S. Postal Service District Manager C. Michael Harlow said: "After careful review, it has been determined that currently there are less than significant opportunities to improve efficiency and/or service through consolidation of mail processing operations at the Cumberland Post Office. So, no significant changes will be made at this time." 
   In her most recent correspondence with Postmaster General and CEO John E. Potter in February 2007, Senator Mikulski said: "I have received more than 2,000 letters from my constituents protesting any further consolidation and I share their concerns. Such action can only have a negative effect on mail service and delivery for residents and businesses in far Western Maryland."
