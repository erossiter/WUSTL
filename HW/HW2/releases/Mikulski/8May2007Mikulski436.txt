   "Good morning Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, distinguished guests. 
   "It is my distinct honor and privilege on behalf of the United States Senate, to welcome you here to the Goddard Space Agency. 
   "Your Majesty, Your Royal Highness, we are so proud of Goddard - one of NASA's premier facilities - and its amazing contributions to science, exploration and discovery. It is the home to a Nobel Prize winner in Physics. It is the home to the Hubble Space Telescope and, as Your Majesty saw this morning, it is the communication lifeline to the astronauts of the world exploring new galaxies. 
   "Your Majesty, we're so grateful of our nations working together to make this a better and safer world. The U.K. and our government's recent agreement to continue space exploration is truly an amazing endeavor in and of itself. We look forward to making new discoveries with you and looking out among the stars and the galaxies to come up with new knowledge to look out for the common heritage of mankind. 
   "Your Majesty, in honor of your visit, we present you with one of Hubble Telescope's spectacular images. The Hubble telescope is our window to the galaxies. Hubble takes pictures of our ever-expanding universe, like the great friendship the United States has with the United Kingdom."
