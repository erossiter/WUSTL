SENATORS APPLAUD DEPARTURE OF ADMINISTRATION IDEOLOGUE
  Fourteen U.S. Senators today applauded the departure of Deputy Assistant Secretary for Population Affairs, Dr. Eric Keroack. As Deputy Assistant Secretary, Keroack, who spent his career promoting abstinence-only education, had control over Title X funds which support low-cost, confidential family planning and health screening services to millions of Americans.  
   Led by Senator Patty Murray (D-WA), Sens. Edward Kennedy (D-MA), Christopher Dodd (D-CT), Tom Harkin (D-IA), Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Harry Reid (D-NV), Patrick Leahy (D-VT), John Kerry (D-MA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), Russ Feingold (D-WI), Frank Lautenberg (D-NJ), Barack Obama (D-IL), and Robert Menendez (D-NJ) sent a letter to Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt in November of 2006 urging the Administration to withdraw Dr. Keroack's appointment based on his ideological history. 
   Their request was ignored by the Bush Administration. 
   Today, the Senators renewed their calls for the position to be filled by a health expert who would complete his duties based on sound science and public health interests. 
   "Dr. Keroack's resignation is welcome news for women and families across America. His departure is an opportunity to select a Deputy Assistant Secretary who is both qualified and in line with mainstream America. 
   "Americans deserve someone in this vital role who supports providing access to contraception, family planning services and comprehensive, accurate sex education. The nation also deserves an appointee who will vigorously administer Title X as intended by Congress under current law. 
   "We urge President Bush to place science above ideology and appoint a qualified public health expert who will ensure that the needs of women and families are more adequately met."
