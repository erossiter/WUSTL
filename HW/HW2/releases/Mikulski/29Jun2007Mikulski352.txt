SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $1 MILLION FOR WESTERN MARYLAND WATER PROJECTS INCLUDED IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Energy and Water Development 2008 spending bill, which passed the full committee, provides more than $70 million for projects statewide, including $1.4 million for Western Maryland priorities.  
   "This bill is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the waterways of Maryland. This funding will help preserve the history of the C&O Canal, as well as improve the quality of Western Maryland waterways," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep Western Maryland a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   The spending bill includes: 
   * $700,000 to restore and rewater the C&O Canal terminus in downtown Cumberland. The Corps of Engineers determined in the late 1990s that it was feasible to rewater the canal successfully without compromising the flood protection of the City of Cumberland. Since 1999, Senator Mikulski has been working to move this project toward completion, obtaining more than $15 million in federal dollars for the project. 
   * $200,000 for a comprehensive plan for the Middle Potomac River watershed that will assist Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia in implementing nutrient reduction tributary strategies. 
   * $140,000 for improvements to Jennings Randolph Lake in Garrett County. This project provides water quality control, flood damage reduction, water supply and recreation. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
