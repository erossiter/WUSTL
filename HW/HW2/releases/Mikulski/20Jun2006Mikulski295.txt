SEN. MIKULSKI APPLAUDS BALTIMORE'S INCLUSION IN CHIP PROGRAM
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) applauded today's announcement by the U.S. Department of Justice that Baltimore will be included in the federal CHIP (Computer Hacking and Intellectual Property) program. The initiative brings together local and federal prosecutors with the FBI and other agencies to create a strong relationship with the local high-tech community. This will help law enforcement combat cyber crimes.  
   "We can't innovate without protecting our intellectual property - our inventor's ideas and discoveries. As we work to promote U.S. innovation and competitiveness, we must protect research and development," said Senator Mikulski. "Technology is changing quickly - so are the strategies used by internet criminals. Law enforcement needs to be able to keep up and we need to make sure officials have the tools and resources they need." 
   The initiative is part of the Department's ongoing efforts to combat cyber crime and intellectual property theft. The program has three components: 
   * Prosecution: CHIP units will prosecute computer intrusions, copyright and trademark violations, theft of trade secrets and economic espionage, theft of computer and high-tech components, and other Internet crimes. 
   * Regional Prevention and Outreach: Prosecutors will work with the FBI and other agencies to establish good working relationships with the high-tech community and to encourage victims of high-tech crime to report such crimes to law enforcement. 
   * Regional Training: Cyber crime fighting requires special skills. CHIP units will receive high-level training, but will also be expected to develop and offer regional training programs to increase expertise among federal, state and local prosecutors. 
   Cities chosen for CHIP units are based on a number of factors, including their proximity to high-tech industry areas, their potential for growth in that area and the presence of adequate FBI resources to investigate these crimes. 
   Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, which funds the U.S. Department of Justice.
