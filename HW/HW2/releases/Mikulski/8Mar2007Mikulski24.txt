SEN. MIKULSKI INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO CONTINUE, STRENGTHEN HOPE VI PROGRAM
  At a press conference today, Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Mel Martinez (R-Fla.) announced they are introducing the HOPE VI Reauthorization bill. The bill builds on the past success of the HOPE VI program and makes several improvements to ensure grants are cost-efficient, and effective at improving resident and community life. Renee Glover, President and Chief Executive Officer of Atlanta Housing Authority, joined the Senators at a press event this afternoon. 
   "HOPE VI has always been about creating new opportunities for residents of public housing and new hope for the communities surrounding it," said Senator Mikulski. "Where HOPE VI has been most successful, it has transformed communities and the lives of people living in public housing."  
   HOPE VI has been one of the most important federal programs for revitalizing communities and offering real opportunities for residents of public housing. HOPE VI was created by Senator Mikulski in 1992 with the aim of replacing dilapidated public housing with mixed-income developments connected to schools, retail and community services. Since the program started, over $5 billion has been appropriated for it and billions more has been leveraged from the private sector. This legislation incorporates lessons learned to ensure the future success of the program. 
   "We've had 13 years to see the successes of HOPE VI and the areas where we need change. Our reauthorization bill takes HOPE VI into the new century - reformed, refreshed and reinvigorated," said Senator Mikulski. "Our bill will turn the best practices from around the country into law to reform the program so new physical and social architecture can create real opportunity to change lives, not just addresses." 
   The legislation, which reauthorizes the program through 2012 at $600 million, specifically sets five clear goals for HOPE VI: 
   * End concentration of the poor in distressed neighborhoods 
   * Create healthy, sustainable communities with an emphasis on high-performing schools 
   * Create mixed-income communities 
   * Develop communities though public-private partnerships 
   * Provide adequate supportive resources to help residents achieve self-sufficiency 
   The legislation also: 
   * Connects HOPE VI with local school revitalization 
   # Requires that every HOPE VI grant recipient establish, in partnership with local schools and the school superintendent, a comprehensive education reform and achievement strategy to turn the school that serves the HOPE VI development into a high-performing school 
   # In order to receive a HOPE VI grant, proposals must demonstrate a comprehensive strategy for transforming neighborhood schools that serve the HOPE VI development 
   * Ensures that grantees make best use of federal dollars 
   # Grant criteria now includes the strength of local government support for the HOPE VI proposal, including, at a minimum, the signature of the locality's chief executive and financial assistance of at least 5 percent of the HOPE VI grant 
   # Allows the Housing & Urban Development (HUD) Secretary to conduct site visits to HOPE VI applicants to assist in making funding decisions 
   # Requires that Public Housing Agencies (PHA) set new performance benchmarks for each component of their HOPE VI project, including benchmarks for: 
   * Linkages with schools 
   * Relocation of residents 
   * Achievement of self-sufficiency 
   # A PHA's failure to meet benchmarks will result in the HUD Secretary imposing appropriate sanctions, such as the appointment of alternative administrator, imposition of financial penalties or withdrawal of funding 
   * Improves relocation and support services for residents 
   # HOPE VI applications are selected in part based on the effectiveness of the plan for temporary and permanent relocation of existing residents, making sure that residents are fully aware of their relocation choices and are supported throughout the process with case management and counseling 
   # Applicants are judged on the extent to which their HOPE VI proposal provides effective relocation of existing residents, meaning: 
   * Residents are fully informed of their choices, and are given the choice to relocate to an area with a lower concentration of poverty 
   * Residents are offered comprehensive and ongoing supportive services to achieve a successful relocation and self-sufficiency 
   * Residents are offered the option to return to the newly revitalized HOPE VI development 
   * There is minimal impact on children, and relocation is coordinated with school calendars
