SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS TO IMPROVE G.I. BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced she will continue to fight for Senate passage of the Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007 (S.22), which will improve education benefits for our troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The bill was re-introduced by Senator Jim Webb (D-Va.) today with significant improvements to increase parity for all veterans. Senator Mikulski co-sponsored the bill when it was originally introduced in February 2007, but it never received a vote.  
   "President Bush has no problem asking our troops to serve third and fourth tours of duty - but he is not even looking out for the service members who are already there or the veterans who are coming home," said Senator Mikulski. "We owe our veterans a debt of gratitude - not just with words, but with deeds. Our active and retired service members need to know that America is with them." 
   The Post-9/11 Veterans Educational Assistance Act of 2007, which mirrors the G.I. bill developed by the nation's leading veterans service organizations, expands the educational benefits our nation offers to the men and women who have served since Sept. 11, 2001. This bill will give returning troops educational and training benefits that mirror the benefits provided to veterans after World War II - including the cost of college tuition and a monthly stipend. Existing law provides only a maximum of $9,000 per year, and requires service members to pay $1,200 during their first year of service in order to even qualify for educational benefits. 
   Senator Webb today announced a list of revisions to make the bill more equitable for all the men and women who have served since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, including: 
   * Ensuring that service members using their benefits will not lose them if they are forced to discontinue school because of deployment. 
   * Providing more equitable benefits for Reservists based on the length of their service. 
   * Expanding eligibility to Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) and academy-commissioned officers. 
   "Our military men and women serve overseas in difficult and dangerous circumstances to keep America safe. They honor our country by volunteering to serve," said Senator Mikulski. "We must honor them by providing access to education when they come home that reflects the sacrifices they have made."
