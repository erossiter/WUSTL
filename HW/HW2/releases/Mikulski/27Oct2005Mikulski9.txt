SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON MIERS WITHDRAWAL
  Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement following Harriet Miers' withdrawal from Supreme Court consideration this morning:  
   "Harriet Miers' withdrawal today shows that the President needs a better process to nominate his Supreme Court justices. 
   "I urge the President to be deliberate in his next nomination. A Supreme Court nominee must be independent. We owe it to the American people. 
   "I use three criteria when I examine any judicial nominee: competence, personal and professional integrity and a commitment to protecting core constitutional values, the Bill of Rights and the implicit right of privacy. I believe that it is essential for every successful nominee for the highest court in the land to possess these characteristics."
