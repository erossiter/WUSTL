SEN. SARBANES, SEN. MIKULSKI, REP. CARDIN ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS IN ANNE ARUNDEL COUNTY
  At a press conference today at the Chesapeake Ecology Center, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Rep. Ben Cardin (Md.) announced that 6 organizations throughout Anne Arundel County were among 28 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants Initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 28 Maryland recipients this year. 
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."  
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own. The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watershed Grants Program is critical to the health of the Bay and its rivers and streams," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why Senator Sarbanes and I work hard to fund effective projects that save the Bay and help the Marylanders who depend on it for jobs and for recreation." 
   "The Chesapeake Watershed Grant program is a critical tool in preserving the Bay for future generations. Congress provides the funding, but it's the individuals and communities closest to the Bay doing the actual work of restoring and protecting the Bay and its many tributaries," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), a strong advocate of the program. 
   Those Anne Arundel County projects receiving funding are: 
   * The Alliance for Community Education will use a $25,000 grant to address non-point source pollution of storm water runoff from residential streets and commercial parking lots that have contributed to the deterioration of Beaver Creek. This project will restore one mile of shoreline along Beaver Creek, provide information regarding runoff problems and solutions to 1,000-2,000 citizens, and engage citizens in the installation of rain barrels and rain gardens; 
   * The Center for Chesapeake Communities will use $35,000 to provide a landscape level perspective to coordinate management and restoration activities among 4 Federal landowners in the Baltimore-Washington corridor. Through these efforts, this project seeks to improve the ecological services of natural landscapes and reduce the environmental impacts of the land and facility management activities; 
   * The Chesapeake Ecology Center will use a $35,000 to develop a Watershed Assessment and Restoration Plan for College Creek in Anne Arundel Co. This assessment and resulting action plan will provide strategic focus and science-based direction to local restoration efforts. The action plan will include a list of specific actions and a priority list of restoration projects, with the results of the assessment being made available for public comment during a stakeholder workshop; 
   * The Spa Creek Conservancy, Inc. will use a $35,000 grant to complete a Tidal Restoration Management Plan to encourage strategic restoration and implementation for 1,300 acres of Spa Creek. This project will provide community awareness through an understanding of the link between lifestyle and the health of Spa Creek; 
   * The West/Rhode Riverkeeper, Inc. will use an $18,900 grant to stabilize 500 linear feet of badly eroded shoreline and restore the tidal marsh and other sensitive habitat in the Shady Cove Natural Area. This project will include surveying, designing and permitting in the first of two phases to stabilize the shoreline; and 
   * The London Towne Property Owners Association will use a $30,000 grant to restore approximately 300 linear feet of severely eroded shoreline on Almshouse Creek. This demonstration project will construct stone sills and sand containment structures and engage volunteers to plant wetland grasses and other native plants. 
   In addition, two statewide projects are slated to receive funding: 
   * The Cacapon Institute will use a $35,000 grant to recruit science, social studies, and vocational-agricultural classes from high schools throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed to participate in an internet-based Stream Cleaner Environmental Forum on best management practices to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. The Forum will engage students in a simulated Tributary Team stakeholder process to explore the science and challenges of non-point source pollution reduction. Following the Forum, up to 10 classes will complete water quality restoration projects to serve as visible demonstrations of best management practices as well as living classrooms for future academic study; and 
   * The Izaak Walton League of America will use a $35,000 grant to hold workshops to train 60 certified volunteers to conduct water quality monitoring throughout Maryland. Monitoring will occur at 100 sites throughout Maryland and will be integrated into an annual water quality report. Data gathered during this study will be used to identify and prioritize watershed restoration projects that volunteers with Izaak Walton League can undertake in the future. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Grants Program, which was established by Senator Sarbanes, promotes community-based efforts to develop and implement conservation strategies to protect and restore the diverse natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. The program provides grants to local governments and community organizations working to improve the condition of their local watersheds while building citizen-based resource stewardship. This year more than $2.6 million is being awarded for 68 restoration projects throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed.
