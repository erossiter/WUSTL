SENATE UNANIMOUSLY APPROVES SEN. MIKULSKI EFFORT TO INCREASE CANCER RESEARCH AND PREVENTION FUNDING
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today applauded the unanimous passage of an amendment to the FY2007 budget that provides an increase of $390 million for cancer research and prevention programs. Sen. Mikulski joined Senate colleagues Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) to fight for this federal investment.  
   Under the amendment, the budget for cancer research and prevention at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) will receive a $244.6 million increase, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) will receive an increase of $120.48 million, and the He alth Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) will receive an increase of $25 million. 
   "How can we search for cures for America's illnesses without the proper funding for research? I'm on the side of cures - that's why I have fought for years to increase our federal investment in research," said Senator Mikulski. "These funds will improve the health of the nation by supporting research on the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. Our research institutions need adequate resources to meet their mission and that's why I will keep up my fight to make sure they get the federal investment they need." 
   "I am also pleased our colleagues supported important funding for the Nurse Reinvestment Act and related nursing programs. As our population continues to grow and age, the need for nurses will continue to increase," continued Senator Mikulski. "Today, our nation faces a shortage of nearly 500,000 nurses. Congress must do more to address this crisis." 
   Specifically, the Feinstein-Mikulski-Collins Cancer Research and Prevention Funding Amendment provides: 
   * $244.6 million increase in the budget for the National Institutes of Health (NIH) for the National Cancer Institute and the National Center on Minority Health and Health Disparities
