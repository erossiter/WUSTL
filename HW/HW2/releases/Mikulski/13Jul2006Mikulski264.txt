SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES FOCUS ON INNOVATION ECONOMY IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined her colleague Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) in announcing the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, Science 2007 spending bill includes their priorities for a stronger innovation economy in the United States. The legislation, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, reflects a number of the recommendations presented by the National Academy of Sciences' (NAS) 2005 report, Rising Above the Gathering Storm, which addressed the top actions federal policymakers could take to enhance U.S. science and technology enterprise. 
   "The whole foundation of American culture and economy is based on the concept of discovery and innovation. When you look at what has made America a superpower, it's our innovation and our technology. We have to look at where the new ideas are going to come from that are going to generate the new products for the 21st century," said Senator Mikulski. "When the NAS presented their report, I pledged to work on the Appropriations Committee to put money in the federal checkbook to support these important initiatives. I am proud to have fought for this down payment to set the framework and create the building blocks we need for a smarter America."  
   "In order for our Nation to maintain its competitiveness in the ever-increasing global environment, we must provide the resources to those federal agencies that are on the cutting edge of technology and innovation," said Sarbanes. "The funding to these agencies helps to accomplish many of those goals and its spillover effect into the private sector is critical." 
   The NAS report recommended action in three areas funded by this year's spending bill: 
   Increase the pipeline of future scientists and engineers: 
   * $836 million for National Science Foundation (NSF) education programs, including math, science and engineering, as well as increased funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), including the Louis Stokes program. 
   * $120 million for National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) education initiatives to promote better understanding and stewardship of our oceans, and to get children interested in science. 
   Strengthen the nation's commitment to research: 
   * $16.76 billion for NASA, which includes $10.49 billion for science, aeronautics and exploration activities that inspire future scientists and keep America competitive globally. 
   * $4.6 billion for National Science Foundation (NSF) research programs and initiatives, a 7 percent increase from last year. 
   * $4.43 billion for NOAA, including $495 million for research to improve weather, air quality and climate prediction; and $240 million for ocean research, exploration and observation. 
   * $926 million for the National Weather Service (NWS), which develops new technologies for more timely and accurate forecasts that help save lives and protect property. This includes 
   * $22.9 million for NOAA's new Center for Weather and Climate Prediction, which is located at University of Maryland at College Park. The Center will provide atmosphere and ocean monitoring and prediction services to the nation. 
   * $764 million for the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST), which develops new technologies that will create jobs for the future. 
   Create an innovation-friendly government: 
   * $1.77 billion for the Patent and Trademark Office (PTO) to reduce application backlogs and processing times. 
   * $528 million for strong enforcement of our trade laws and agreements, and protection of our intellectual property, including: 
   # $422 million for International Trade Administration (ITA). 
   # $64 million for International Trade Commission (ITC). 
   # $42 million for United States Trade Representative (USTR). 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Both Houses of Congress will vote on the conference bill. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
