SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES ISSUE STATEMENT ON WALTER REED MOVE TO BETHESDA
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) released the following statement today following the Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's decision to move the Walter Reed Medical Facility to Bethesda, Maryland:  
   "We welcome the BRAC Commission's support for the Pentagon's plan to create a modernized joint operational medical facility in Bethesda. Locating the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda also promotes partnering with the nearby Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, our military medical school and the National Institutes of Health. 
   "Maryland is happy and proud to have this opportunity to provide world-class medical care for our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. 
   "Our federal, state and local officials will continue to work together to ensure a smooth transition for those currently receiving medical care at the Walter Reed facilities in Washington, DC." 
   Final BRAC recommendations will now go to President Bush for approval.
