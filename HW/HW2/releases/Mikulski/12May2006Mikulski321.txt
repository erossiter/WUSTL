SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES CRUCIAL FUNDING TO PROTECT CHILDREN FROM INTERNET CRIMES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced a $450,000 grant for the Maryland State Police to continue its Internet Crimes Against Children (ICAC) Task Force Program.  
   "The internet is a virtual playground for our kids. Technology is changing quickly - allowing child predators new ways to operate," said Senator Mikulski. "Law enforcement needs to be able to keep up." 
   The task force offers a multi-agency, multi-disciplinary response to internet crimes against children - combining efforts of federal, state and local law enforcement and child welfare agencies. The ICAC launches investigations, prosecutes offenders and serves as a community resource. 
   "Kids are sharing personal information on websites as a way of connecting with friends. We need to make sure they do not fall prey to child predators in the process," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep our kids safe in the virtual playground." 
   Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee, which funds the U.S. Department of Justice. At a recent hearing, Senator Mikulski commended the work of U.S. Attorney General Alberto R. Gonzales in his work to make the internet safe for children. 
   "We need to make sure that the law enforcement tools we have at our disposal are working well, and that officials have the resources they need," said Senator Mikulski.
