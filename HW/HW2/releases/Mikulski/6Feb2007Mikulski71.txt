SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONSE TO BUSH BUDGET IMPACT ON VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), an original champion of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), released the following statement today on the President's decision, in his proposed 2008 budget, to eliminate congressionally authorized grant programs, leaving all discretion instead to the U.S. Attorney General:  
   "Congress clearly intended for the Department of Justice (DOJ) to allocate specific monies for specific grant programs for victims of domestic violence and sexual assault. The President's proposal flies in the face of the recent VAWA reauthorization that clarified this process. President Bush talks about creating a better life for Americans, but his budget fails to deliver on his words yet again."
