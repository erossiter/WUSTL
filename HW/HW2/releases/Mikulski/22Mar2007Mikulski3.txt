SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS TO BRING TROOPS HOME, IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH CARE IN EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL
  In the emergency supplemental spending bill that passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, senior member Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) continued her fight to not only bring our troops home from Iraq, but also to protect them while they are on the battlefield, and to improve their health care when they come home. The bill includes a provision that would start bringing troops home within 120 days of its enactment, with the goal of bringing most home by March 31, 2008.  
   "Our troops who serve in Iraq and Afghanistan have my steadfast support. This means not only bringing them home as swiftly and safely as possible, but providing them with the resources, services and protection they need - in combat and after they come home needing care," said Senator Mikulski. "We have a sacred trust with those who risk their lives so that we may live in freedom. This bill helps us make good on our promises to the men and women of our Armed Forces." 
   The bill outlines significant aid and improvements to military and veterans' health care, including specific provisions for Walter Reed Army Medical Center, where deplorable living conditions for returning troops were recently exposed in a Washington Post series. More specifically, it includes: 
   * $2.46 billion for health care for our returning troops. This is $1.3 billion more than President Bush requested. It rejects Bush administration proposals to increase TRICARE fees and copays and cut corners in patient care by providing additional funding for health care coverage and medical services. It also funds improvements to the diagnosis, care and treatment of physical and mental trauma. 
   * $20 million for operations and maintenance at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. It prohibits the use of funds to downsize staff, or to close, realign or phase out essential services at Walter Reed until equivalent facilities have been constructed, equipped and approved by the Secretary of Defense. 
   * Provisions requiring the Department of Defense (DoD) to complete inspection of every military medical treatment facility and military quarters for medical hold patients within six months to ensure they meet acceptable standards for maintenance and operations. It also requires commanders to submit detailed plans to correct deficiency and report to Congress on the results of their inspections. 
   * Nearly $1.8 billion in funding to help the Department of Veterans Affairs provide care for Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, including new polytrauma centers, enhanced mental health services, upgraded facilities and equipment, medical and prosthetic research, and additional staff to process benefits claims.
