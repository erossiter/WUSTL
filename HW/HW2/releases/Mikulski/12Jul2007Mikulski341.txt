SEN. MIKULSKI STANDS UP FOR WOUNDED WARRIORS, APPLAUDS AMENDMENT'S PASSAGE
  As the Senate considers the National Defense Authorization Act, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today applauded the passage of the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors amendment, which improves health care for veterans and returning injured service members. Senator Mikulski co-sponsored the amendment, which was introduced by Senators Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and John McCain (R-Ariz.). 
   "Our worst fears have come true. It seems our troops are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and then at war at home to get the health care they need and deserve," said Senator Mikulski. "We know our military medical doctors and nurses are performing heroically, saving lives on the battlefield and in acute care. But what happens when they come home? If we really want to support our troops, we need more than yellow ribbons; we need action."  
   The Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors amendment outlines several steps to improve and enhance care for our veterans and returning service members, including: 
   * Requires a comprehensive policy for severely injured service members - Mandates that the Secretary of Defense (DoD) and the Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) develop a comprehensive policy for severely injured service members' care, management and transition from the military to VA or civilian life. 
   * Enhances health care for veterans and returning service members - Allows medically retired service members to receive the active duty health care benefit for three years. It also allows the VA to provide vocational rehab to active duty service members in VA facilities, authorizes certain family caregivers at military or VA hospitals to receive medical care and counseling, and establishes a DoD/VA Interagency Program Office to develop a joint electronic health record. 
   * Improves Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI) and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) prevention, diagnosis and treatment - Requires the DoD, in consultation with the VA, to develop a comprehensive plan, including training and education to reduce the negative stigma. It also requires the DoD to establish separate centers of excellence for TBI and PTSD, and authorizes $50 million for improved diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation of service members with TBI or PTSD. 
   * Improves the disability system - Adopts the VA presumption that a disease or injury is presumed to be service-related when the member has six months or more of active duty and the disability was not noted at the time the member entered active duty. It requires military departments to use VA standards to make disability determinations. It also establishes a board to review disability determinations and increases severance pay for some service members. 
   * Improves facilities housing military patients - Requires the DoD to establish uniform standards for military medical treatment facilities, specialty medical care facilities and military quarters housing patients. 
   * Extends the period of eligibility for care - Extends the period of eligibility for health care from two years to five years after discharge or release for combat veterans of the Persian Gulf War or future hostilities. 
   * Mandates mental health evaluation - Requires that veterans or returning service members receive initial mental health evaluations not later than 30 days following requests. 
   * Expands dental care for returning service members - Extends the application period for dental benefits from 90 days to 180 days following discharge from active duty. 
   * Creates homeless programs - Institutes a demonstration project that will identify service members at risk of becoming homeless after discharge or release from active duty, and will provide referral, counseling and support services to prevent them from becoming homeless. 
   Following a Washington Post series revealing deplorable living conditions facing returning Iraq and Afghanistan war veterans at the Army's flagship military hospital, Walter Reed Army Medical Center in Washington, D.C., Senator Mikulski specifically questioned Acting Secretary of the Army Peter Geren about his, and the Army's, commitment to the long-term care of America's Soldiers at a Defense Appropriations Subcommittee hearing in March 2007. 
   "Many of the injured men and women coming home from Iraq and Afghanistan are now in their 20s, and many are in need of chronic care. Some will need assisted living; some will need assistance with living," said Senator Mikulski. "We have to think about the next 50 years for our wounded veterans in terms of compensation, care, and how we are going to help families get through this." 
   Specifically, Senator Mikulski asked Acting Secretary Geren how he intends to reform the Army's Disability Benefits System on the heels of the Army Inspector General's report, which analyzed 32 Army posts in the United States and overseas, and confirmed that the system is understaffed and ill-equipped to properly care for the large numbers of wounded Soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan.
