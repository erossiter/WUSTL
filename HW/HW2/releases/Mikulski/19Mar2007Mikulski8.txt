SEN. MIKULSKI: WE MUST BRING OUR TROOPS HOME
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today on the fourth anniversary of the War in Iraq:  
   "I voted against giving President Bush unilateral authority to launch a preemptive war against Iraq. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against this reckless war. Since then, I have looked at every opportunity to bring our troops home. I voted against the escalation of the war - Bush's plan to add 30,000 additional troops to Iraq. It is time to send in the diplomats, not more troops. That's why, most recently, I voted for a clear timetable to bring our troops home. The vote was 48-50. I wish there were more. 
   "Four years ago, America went to war with Iraq. Now we are at war within Iraq - enmeshed in a civil war. More than 3,000 Americans have died in this war. I honor their sacrifice and will continue to fight to end this war and bring our troops home safely and swiftly."
