SEN. MIKULSKI PUSHES FOR OSHA REFORM AS WORKERS MEMORIAL DAY APPROACHES
  As Workers Memorial Day approaches Saturday, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined a group of her colleagues in introducing the Protecting America's Workers Act (PAWA) to reform the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and improve the safety of our nation's workforce.  
   "Last week, we mourned the loss of two coal miners who died after being trapped in a mine in Western Maryland. Mr. Dale Jones and Mr. Mike Wilt, both fathers, will be deeply missed by their families and communities," said Senator Mikulski. "Their loss is a tragic reminder that we must do more to protect our workers on the job." 
   PAWA honors the memory of those who have died at work by expanding and strengthening our workplace safety laws. The bill would amend OSHA to cover more workers, increase penalties, strengthen protections, enhance public accountability, and clarify an employer's duty to provide safety equipment. 
   This Saturday, April 28, marks Workers Memorial Day, which is designated to honor those killed in the workplace and renew a commitment to improving worker safety. 
   "This Worker's Memorial Day, I vow to pay tribute to the lives of the miners we lost in Maryland, and to all those who have lost their lives at work - not just with words, but with deeds," Senator Mikulski said. "I will continue to fight in the U.S. Senate to strengthen workplace safety laws to protect the men and women who work so hard to support their families and make this nation run." 
   The landmark Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 promised a safe and healthy workplace for all of America's hardworking men and women. While great progress has been made, much still needs to be done. In 2005, more than 5,700 workers were killed in workplace accidents and 4.2 million were injured. Every year, 50,000-60,000 workers die from work-related disease.
