SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $4 MILLION FOR MARYLAND'S BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE COMMISSION IMPLEMENTATION
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the Department of Defense's Office of Economic Adjustment (OEA) has awarded the State of Maryland a $4 million grant to address the challenges and opportunities that come with implementing the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) recommendations.  
   "I told Maryland's leaders I would do everything I could to help them navigate the federal resources and grants available to them as they plan for BRAC-related opportunities. My promises are promises kept," said Senator Mikulski. "BRAC brings opportunities, but it also brings great challenges. We must continue to work together to help Maryland address the increased demands on our communities. I will continue to focus on how federal dollars can help our counties, and fight for an increased federal investment in these priorities." 
   In March 2007, Senator Mikulski sent Secretary of Defense Robert Gates a letter asking him to elevate the priority for this grant application. 
   "BRAC will bring tremendous benefits to Maryland, but only with significant planning and new development. I applaud the State for approaching this challenge in a collaborative and thoughtful way," wrote Senator Mikulski. "This funding will lay the groundwork essential to the implementation of the BRAC Recommendations. It anticipates both the staffing and infrastructure these communities will need as they work to upgrade their roads and mass transit, and expand housing and schools." 
   Senator Mikulski has been fighting for several years to prepare Maryland communities and military bases for the BRAC process, which will bring thousands of new employees to the state. This includes 10,000 new jobs that will never leave the country, in addition to 85,000 existing jobs on bases and up to 40,000 non-direct jobs.
