SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE AID FOR DISPLACED EASTALCO ALUMINUM WORKERS IS IN PIPELINE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced today that workers of Eastalco Aluminum Company in Frederick, who have lost their jobs as a result of the decision by Eastalco's parent company, Alcoa, to close the plant and shift production overseas, have been approved for financial aid through the Labor Department's Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program. 
   The two Maryland senators recently sent a letter to Labor Secretary Elaine Chao urging the Department to, "make all appropriate federal resources and assistance programs available to the workers at Eastalco who have been severely impacted by Alcoa's decision to move operations out of the United States." The senators continued by saying that, "the federal government is obligated to assist these hard working individuals who have lost their jobs due to economic circumstances beyond their control."
   As a result of the decision, eligible workers may receive a weekly cash benefit, or "trade readjustment allowance" (TRA) assistance for 52 weeks when rights to regular and extended unemployment compensation benefits have been used up and a job training requirement has been met. An additional 52 weeks of support is provided if they are enrolled in a training program and another 26 weeks if they are in need of remedial education. They would then work through their local workforce services agency to receive the temporary allowance and training benefits so that they are able to find a new job.
   The Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) program extends income support and provides job training for workers dislocated by import competition.
