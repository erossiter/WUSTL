FEDERAL FUNDING FOR KEY PROJECTS COMING TO DC METRO AREA
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that several key projects in the Baltimore region are slated to receive funding in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is now sent to the President for his signature. The more than $388 billion omnibus spending bill completes the 9 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government through fiscal year 2005. To stay within the spending constraints demanded by the White House, all programs in the bill were cut by 0.80 percent. 
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook to create jobs and build communities. This final legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of work with Maryland communities to identify where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best of local, state and federal priorities. Maryland can count on me to keep standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation."  
   "We are bringing a bounty of federal funds to the State of Maryland that will aid our communities, our economy, our transportation network, and our environment; and thereby enhancing the quality of life and providing opportunities for people throughout the entire State," added Senator Paul S. Sarbanes.
