SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSAGE OF METRO FUNDING
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, issued the following statement today after the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee approved the National Capital Transportation Amendments Act of 2007 (S. 1446), which provides the Washington-area Metrorail system with $1.5 billion in funding over a 10-year period. 
   "This bill will mean great news for commuters and visitors to the National Capitol Region. It authorizes much-needed funding for the Washington Metro system - America's metro. Metro means more than just transportation - it means residents and visitors to our nation's capital can live, work, worship and play throughout the metro area without ever getting in their cars."
   Senator Mikulski joined with Senators Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), John Warner (R-Va.) and Jim Webb (D-Va.) to introduce the legislation in May 2007. The bill now heads to the full Senate for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
