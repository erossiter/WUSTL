SEN. MIKULSKI, COLLEAGUES URGE SENATE ACTION ON HOPE VI LEGISLATION
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) led Senate colleagues Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) today in a bipartisan call on the Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee to move forward with consideration of the HOPE VI Reauthorization and Improvement Act (S. 829). The bill, which was introduced by Senator Mikulski in March 2007, builds on the past success of the HOPE VI program and makes several improvements to ensure grants are cost-efficient, and effective at improving resident and community life.  
   In a letter sent to Committee Chairman Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) and Ranking Member Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), the Senators pointed out that the U.S. House passed a HOPE VI Reauthorization bill in early 2008, and "though there are differences between the House and Senate versions, the bipartisan support it received shows how important it is for the Senate to take immediate action on this legislation." 
   "We've had 13 years to see the successes of HOPE VI and the areas where we need change. This bill takes HOPE VI into the new century - reformed, refreshed and reinvigorated," said Senator Mikulski. "Our bill will turn the best practices from around the country into law to reform the program so new physical and social architecture can create real opportunity to change lives, not just addresses. We had a productive hearing on the bill last year, but with as many as 81,000 public housing units still in need of rehabilitation, we must pass HOPE VI as soon as possible." 
   HOPE VI has been one of the most important federal programs for revitalizing communities and offering real opportunities for residents of public housing. HOPE VI was created by Senator Mikulski in 1992 with the aim of replacing dilapidated public housing with mixed-income developments connected to schools, retail and community services. Since it began, more than $6 billion has been appropriated for the program, with billions more leveraged from the private sector. 
   The legislation, which reauthorizes the program through 2012 at $600 million, specifically sets five clear goals for HOPE VI: 
   * End concentration of the poor in distressed neighborhoods 
   * Create healthy, sustainable communities with an emphasis on high-performing schools 
   * Create mixed-income communities 
   * Develop communities though public-private partnerships 
   * Provide adequate supportive resources to help residents achieve self-sufficiency
