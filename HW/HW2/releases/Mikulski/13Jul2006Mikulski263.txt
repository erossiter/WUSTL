SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES STAND UP FOR SAFER MARYLAND, AMERICA IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, Science 2007 spending bill includes their priorities for a safer Maryland and America. The legislation, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, restores critical funding to state and local law enforcement despite $1.2 billion in drastic cuts by President Bush, provides increased resources to combat child predators, and enhances national security.  
   "No one can do it alone, that's why I fought in the Senate to create a federal partnership," said Senator Mikulski. "It's a tough year - with President Bush's cuts to critical law enforcement grants, COPS and juvenile justice programs - but I will continue to do what I can to get the resources we need for a safer Maryland and America." 
   "This bill funds critically needed programs that help to protect our children, our families, our local communities, and our nation," said Senator Sarbanes. 
   The bill includes $2.1 billion for state and local law enforcement programs, an increase of $900 million above the Administration's proposed budget, including: 
   * $555 million for Byrne Formula Grants to states. 
   * $538 million for the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) program. 
   * $390 million for Violence Against Women Act programs. 
   * $300 million for juvenile justice programs. 
   * $85 million to combat the nation's growing methamphetamine problem. 
   The bill also includes robust funding to track down and prosecute child predators, including: 
   * 31 new FBI agents to investigate internet-related crimes against children. 
   * $55 million for state and local governments to locate, arrest and prosecute sexual predators. 
   * $50.5 million for the Missing Children Program, which targets, dismantles and prosecutes child molesters and pornographers through the Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force, AMBER Alert, and the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
   * $6 million for U.S. Marshals to track down unregistered sex offenders. 
   * $5 million for the U.S. Attorneys to prosecute interstate and international child exploitation cases. 
   The bill provides resources for federal law enforcement, with an emphasis on combating terrorism and protecting our national security, including: 
   * $22 billion for the Department of Justice. 
   * $5.97 billion for the FBI. 
   * $5.3 billion for the federal prison system. 
   * $1.72 billion for the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA). 
   * $1.65 billion for the United States Attorneys. 
   * $985 million for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF). 
   * $856 million for the United States Marshals Service. 
   * $65 million to fund the newly created National Security Division, which will coordinate national security functions within the Justice Department. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Both Houses of Congress will vote on the conference bill. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
