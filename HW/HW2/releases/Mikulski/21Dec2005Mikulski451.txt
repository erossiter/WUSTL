CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES $28.5 MILLION FOR DC METRO AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2006 Defense spending bill, which includes an additional $150 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry out their missions." The spending bill includes $28.5 million in additional funding for defense projects in the Washington, D.C., metro area, including: 
   * $4.2 million for Project ANCILE to develop building protection systems to protect critical U.S. government buildings against existing and evolving threats. 
   * $3 million for a Center for Integrated Security and Logistics to develop, demonstrate and deploy systems to connect combat units with weapons and ammunition supply securely and in near real-time. 
   * $2.5 million for VET-HEAL, to develop complimentary and alternative approaches to relieve pain and suffering for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, veterans with Gulf War Syndrome, and veterans in need of hospice care. 
   * $2.3 million for the USUHS Graduate School of Nursing for the newly designed GSN Doctoral and Clinical Nurse Specialist Programs and to support administrative costs, infrastructure, general maintenance, technology, instructional and distance learning. 
   * $2.1 million for the M-9 Pistol Modernization Through Spares program, which will replace pistol slide mechanisms. 
   * $1.5 million to fund the Army Medical Department Enterprise Resource Planning program to use off-the-shelf commercial software to reduce the time needed to assemble and issue medical records to a deploying field hospital. 
   * $1.4 million for a Multipurpose Biodefense Immunoarray program to develop technology to detect biological threats to our troops in the field and to our allies, and to monitor non-proliferation compliance. 
   * $1.3 million for the Asymmetrical Protocols for Biodefense program to research approaches for enhancing immunities and blocking pathogens to a degree commensurate with the biological warfare threat using currently available FDA-approved drugs. 
   * $1.2 million for procurement of the Movement Tracking System, for real-time tracking of multiple vehicles. This program has proven success in Iraq and in response to Hurricane Katrina. 
   * $1 million for an Applied Research Demonstration Project to increase participation of state public and private colleges in advanced research. 
   * $1 million for USUHS Centers and Activities in response to Chemical, Biological, Radiological, Nuclear and Explosive incidents to provide more staffing and to implement discipline-specific programs for EMTs and paramedics, nurses, physicians, hospital administrators and emergency managers. 
   * $1 million for the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center's Project LIFE at Fort Detrick to provide high quality medical intelligence in support of the global war on terrorism, expanded troop deployments and humanitarian efforts. 
   * $1 million for PEM Fuel Cell Tactical Quiet Generators to develop quieter, more reliable energy sources for military generators supporting advanced communications, sensors and other systems. 
   * $1 million for Virtual Explosives Detection Image Matching technology, which can be combined with current technology to help battlefield commanders identify potential ambushes without putting soldiers at risk. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
