SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF CIA DIRECTOR TENET
  Statement of Senator Barbara Mikulski on Resignation of CIA Director George Tenet. 
   "George Tenet led the CIA during a tremendously difficult time in our nation's history. He brought a record of skill and expertise to a challenging job where he served Presidents of both parties. I thank him for his years of public service. 
   "The Administration must use this change in leadership as an opportunity for modernization and reform of our intelligence community. Now more than ever, the security of our nation depends on timely and reliable intelligence. We depend on intelligence to detect, disrupt and deter terrorist attacks, and to help policymakers make the right decisions about diplomacy and deployment of troops. 
   "The new intelligence leadership must focus on recruiting and retaining the right personnel and maximizing the use of technology to deal with the threats of today and threats of tomorrow. The intelligence community must also stand as an independent voice, delivering unvarnished, unedited information to this and future Administrations."
