SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES ANNOUNCE $10.47 MILLION GRANT FOR ASSOCIATED JEWISH FEDERATION
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced The Associated Jewish Federation in Baltimore has received a $10.47 million grant to build, acquire or rehabilitate rental housing with supportive services for the elderly. 
   "Providing safe, affordable and adequate housing for America(s elderly population has always been one of my priorities," said Senator Mikulski. "This money will help The Associated Jewish Federation provide the resources necessary for seniors to obtain the affordable housing facilities they need and deserve."
   "This grant helps to ensure that our seniors age in place by providing coordinated federal support services," said Senator Sarbanes. "We need to be doing more to prepare for the needs of our growing elderly population that includes more than bricks and mortar. We need to make it easier for seniors and their families to access housing and supportive services together, and this grant helps in those endeavors."
   The grant will help the elderly, including those who are frail, to live as independently as possible by increasing the amount of available rental housing with supportive services. The housing will be available to low-income people who are more than 62 years old.
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies. Senator Sarbanes is the ranking member of the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.
