CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES $2 MILLION FOR WICOMICO COUNTY PROJECT
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2007 Defense spending bill, which includes an additional $2 million for a project in Wicomico County. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much-needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "The funding provided to develop this new blast resistant technology will help protect our troops as they continue to serve our country," added Sarbanes. "The funding being awarded to Life Shield Engineered Systems in Salisbury is an example of the significant spillover opportunities in our hi-tech and defense related sectors associated with our close proximity the Pentagon and the quality of work being performed at Maryland's military installations." 
   The spending bill includes $2 million for Life Shield Blast Resistant Panels, developed by Life Shield Engineered Systems in partnership with Sherwin Williams, which employs 50 people in Salisbury. This funding will allow for the continued development of these panels, which provide a superior and cost-effective method of blast resistance to structures.
