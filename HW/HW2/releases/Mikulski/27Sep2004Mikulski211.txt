SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES EXPANSION OF COLUMBIA, MARYLAND COMPANY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today visited Essex Corporation to congratulate them on a contract expansion with the National Security Agency and cut the ribbon on their new 50,000 square foot secure system integration facility in Annapolis Junction, MD.  
 The new facility will house over 170 people from Essex and its subcontractors working on the NSA technology integration and deployment contract. 
   "Essex Corporation is about innovation," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why they are growing from a team of 30 employees to a team of 170. They have taken a solid tradition of research and turned it into a booming 21st century company. Their entrepreneurship makes our economy stronger and their products make our country safer. I'm proud to celebrate Essex's latest contract with NSA." 
   "I'm proud to serve on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence," continued Senator Mikulski. "I am committed to the great work happening in the high-tech industry, in our Intelligence agencies, in Maryland and across the country. I am fighting to provide the resources the Intelligence community needs to modernize signals intelligence so companies like Essex can continue to prevent, disrupt and deter terrorist attacks." 
   Senator Mikulski joined Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in spring 2001 to help modernize the National Security Agency. These kinds of partnerships with private sector companies are an important part of that modernization effort. 
   Following this visit to Essex Corporation, Senator Mikulski will travel to the National Security Agency to tour the Counterterrorism Unit and meet with General Michael Hayden.
