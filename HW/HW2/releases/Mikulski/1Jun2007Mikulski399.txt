SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE $4.6 MILLION FOR SALISBURY-OCEAN CITY AIRPORT
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded Wicomico County $4.6 million to complete reconstruction of the main runway at the Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport.  
   The funds will be used to complete the final phase of reconstruction of the main runway, which dates back to World War II. The rehabilitation includes new pavement, lighting and signage, bringing the airport up to Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) standards. The runway project is expected to be completed by Fall 2007. 
   "Airports are critical to the economic development and health of a region," said Senator Cardin. "This federal funding will enable Wicomico County to complete the final phase of the runway reconstruction project to ensure the safety of passengers and airport personnel." 
   "Our regional airports play a key role in maintaining Maryland's robust economy. The reconstruction of this runway will help the Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport run safely, while keeping Marylanders on the go," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to keep Eastern Shore communities a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   The Salisbury-Ocean City Wicomico Regional Airport is the only airport on the Delmarva Peninsula with scheduled airlines service provide by U.S. Airways. In addition, Piedmont Airlines, a subsidiary of U.S. Airways, has its corporate headquarters and primary maintenance facility in Salisbury.
