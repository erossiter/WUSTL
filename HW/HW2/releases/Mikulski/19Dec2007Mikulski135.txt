SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE OMNIBUS BILL FUNDS CRITICAL MARYLAND PRIORITIES DESPITE BUSH-MANDATED CUTS
  Senators Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today announced they have secured critical funding for domestic priorities for Maryland and the nation in the fiscal year 2008 omnibus package that has been passed by Congress. The bill now heads to the President for his signature. 
   "President Bush refuses to cooperate with Congress by threatening to veto the bills that fund America's priorities here at home, while continuing to ask for more money for the war in Iraq. The omnibus spending package tells President Bush we will not shoulder the cost of his war by sacrificing our safety, security and everyday needs on the home front," said Senator Mikulski. "I told Marylanders I would fight for their day-to-day needs. My promises made are promises kept, despite the President's refusal to come to the table to discuss how we can help Americans with their priorities at home: education, health care and keeping their communities safe."  
   "Nearly a year ago when I first came to the Senate, my pledge was to work as a partner with Senator Mikulski to push forward key domestic, economic and national security priorities important to all Marylanders. Clearly, the omnibus bill passed by the Senate does a better job than the President's original budget in providing federal funds for many of America's priorities, especially support for our veterans, homeland security, education, healthcare and research, the environment and key infrastructure," said Senator Cardin. "I recognize that there is much more left to accomplish and I will continue fighting to right this country's course." 
   The fiscal year 2008 omnibus package combines 11 spending bills that fund domestic priorities and have not yet become law because President Bush's vetoes and veto threats have delayed their passage. With fiscal year 2008 already underway, the omnibus funds government agencies, cabinet departments, and critical domestic American priorities. 
   Senator Mikulski is a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, and Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee. Senator Cardin is a member of the Budget Committee. 
   Funding for Maryland projects is detailed below, and is grouped according to the following topics: BRAC, transportation, military construction, veterans, housing and community development, health facilities, education, foreign operations, Chesapeake Bay, parks and sewers, energy and water, agriculture, homeland security, conservation, justice and space. 
   BRAC 
   The bill addresses military construction, transportation and implementation projects related to the execution of the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission's recommendations. The Commission's recommendations were great news for Maryland and will bring thousands of new employees to the state. This includes 10,000 new jobs that will never leave the country, in addition to 85,000 existing jobs on bases and up to 40,000 non-direct jobs. 
   BRAC military construction projects: In response to the President's veto threat, Congress cut $1 billion from the BRAC Military Construction account. The executive branch will now re-evaluate BRAC funding for individual initiatives across the nation with the almost $7.3 billion allotted. Team Maryland will continue to fight to ensure that Maryland's BRAC military construction projects are fully funded. Senator Mikulski and her fellow appropriators will push to restore funding when Congress considers the next emergency supplemental proposal early next year. 
   BRAC transportation projects: The spending bill includes more than $15.36 million for BRAC-related transportation projects, including: 
   * $9.8 million for the MARC Commuter Rail System. The funding will be used for new locomotives and railcars, to study new station locations and to improve existing stations. 
   * $2.2 million to improve access to Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) in Harford County. 
   * $1.97 million to improve access to the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda by making adjustments to the already congested Route 355.

   * $245,000 for U.S. 15 at Monocacy Boulevard to improve access to Fort Detrick in Frederick County. 
   BRAC implementation efforts: In meetings with Maryland's local leaders to discuss the impact of BRAC, both Senators pledged to fight for increases to Impact Aid and Individuals with Disabilities Education (IDEA) Act programs, which could dramatically ease pressure on local and state government budgets and allow more funds to support BRAC-implementation efforts. For more information on the IDEA and Impact Aid programs, go to: http://mikulski.senate.gov/record.cfm?id=287194. This bill includes: 
   * $11 billion in increased funding for IDEA, a $500 million increase over the President's request, which entitles children with disabilities to a public education and provides federal funds to help schools with the cost. 
   * $1.24 billion for the federal Impact Aid program, a $12 million increase over the President's request. The program provides federal funding to school districts that have increased enrollment due to federally connected children. 
   TRANSPORTATION 
   The bill includes $42.6 million for key state transportation projects not related to BRAC: 
   * $34.3 million for the purchase of additional railcars for the Washington Metro system.

   * $735,000 for Maryland Statewide Bus and Bus Facility Program. 
   * $328,300 for acquisition of an abandoned railroad bridge for inclusion in the Gwynns Falls Trail. 
   The bill also provides an additional $1 billion for the Federal Highway Administration's Bridge Replacement and Rehabilitation Program following this year's terrible tragedy in Minnesota. This program provides grants to states for bridge replacement, rehabilitation, preventative maintenance and inspections. The funding will provide an additional $23 million for Maryland, which received $58.4 million this year based on a formula authorized in the 2005 transportation authorization bill (SAFETEA). 
   MILITARY CONSTRUCTION

   * $829,000 to plan and design an Army National Guard Readiness Center in Dundalk. 
   VETERANS: 
   The bill includes $87.6 billion for critical veterans programs, a significant $3.7 billion more than the President requested and the largest increase for veterans' health care in the 77 years of the Department of Veterans Affairs' (VA) existence. This increase is designated as emergency funding, which gives the President discretion over whether or not to spend it. The spending bill rejects President Bush's attempt to double veterans' co-pays and charge enrollment fees, and includes:

   * $2 million to continue supporting Department of Housing and Urban Development's (HUD) Big Buy program, which allows owners of Section 8 (low-income) housing to apply for free lead-based paint inspections. This is a particular issue in Baltimore, where residents are at higher risk because of older housing stock. 
   HEALTH CARE FACILITIES 
   The bill provides nearly $5.1 million for Maryland health facilities, as well as priority nurse training facilities, women's health initiatives and seniors programs.

  * HOMELAND SECURITY 
   This omnibus invests key funding for Maryland's security assets. The legislation addresses several high-priority items, including grants for firefighters, first responders, port security and a major project for the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay in Baltimore. 
   Firefighter grants: The bill includes $750 million in federal funding for our nation's firefighters. This includes $560 million, an increase of $13 million, through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). This competitive program awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments nationwide. Fire departments can apply for federal assistance for training, equipment, staffing, fire education and awareness programs, or firefighting vehicles. It also includes $190 million, an increase of $75 million, for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants, also under the AFGP. President Bush's budget cut federal support for the AFGP nearly in half, requesting only $287 million, and eliminated funding for SAFER grants for the second year in a row. 
   Port Security grants: The omnibus fully funds the Port Security Grant program at $400 million, a $190 million increase from last year and the President's budget request. These funds are granted to localities and port operators to finance security enhancements at critical national seaports. Approximately 11 million containers come into the country each year, including 19,000 containers daily. With this funding, the Port of Baltimore, which is the 14th largest port for foreign cargo, will no longer have to compete with 16 other ports for a share of a tiny $40.2 million pot for federal grants as it did this year. The Port of Baltimore supports more than 42,000 maritime-related jobs in Maryland and almost 20,000 direct jobs. 
   Coast Guard Yard: The bill also includes $75 million for maintenance and repair projects at the Coast Guard Yard at Curtis Bay. This will extend the service life and increase mission performance for the Coast Guard's aging fleet of boats. 
   Senator Mikulski is Chairwoman of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds the federal agencies and initiatives listed on the following pages:
