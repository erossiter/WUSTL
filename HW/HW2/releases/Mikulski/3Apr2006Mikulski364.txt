SEN. DOLE ACCEPTS SEN. MIKULSKI DOUBLE OR NOTHING CHALLENGE
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) has accepted the double or nothing wager set by Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) on the outcome of Tuesday evening's Women's NCAA Championship game. Sen. Mikulski issued the challenge earlier today after the University of Maryland Terrapins brought the University of North Carolina Tar Heels to their knees in defeat last night. Sen. Mikulski has put up her Maryland crab cakes against Sen. Dole's Carolina barbeque on the win.  
   Senator Mikulski said, "The Terrapins are ready to 'duke' it out with you, but 5 million Marylanders stand united in warning you once again to 'fear the turtle!'" 
   Senator Dole's response to Senator Mikulski is below: 
   Dear Senator Mikulski, 
   I congratulate you and the Maryland women's basketball team for their hard-fought win against North Carolina Sunday night. The Tar Heel women are a resilient team, and I expect they will have a very strong showing again next season. Of course, the Terrapins' chance to bask in victory will soon end, as they now face the Duke Blue Devils, my alma mater, for the NCAA championship. 
   There is no shortage of basketball talent or good barbeque in North Carolina, so I am happy to accept your challenge to go double or nothing on the Duke-Maryland match up. I look forward to yet another great ACC game!
