SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS FOR TRANSITION ASSISTANCE FOR RETURNING TROOPS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has joined a group of her colleagues led by Sen. Robert Menendez (D-N.J.) in co-sponsoring the Veterans Navigator Bill (S. 882), which would establish a pilot program to address problems facing service members when they return home and transition into the Veterans Administration (VA).  
   "I am extremely concerned about the problems facing our men and women when they come home from Iraq and Afghanistan, but our returning wounded warriors are terrified. They are worried that if they go into the VA, they will face a huge backlog while continuing to suffer from chronic, long-term injuries," said Senator Mikulski. "It seems our troops are facing an enemy overseas, and then a bureaucratic enemy at home. I support this effort to improve their transition from active duty to veterans. I will not abandon our troops - on the battlefield or after they come home needing care." 
   The bill will provide $25 million in federal grants over the next five fiscal years to pioneer a pilot program that would ease service members' transition to veterans. The program would develop "Veteran Navigators" who would serve as advocates to help veterans enter the VA system and get the benefits they deserve. Navigators would bridge the gaps between the Department of Defense (DoD) and the VA, building on existing programs run by veterans service organizations and other experienced organizations. More specifically, navigators would: 
   * Make sure that veterans don't get lost between the time they leave the service and enroll in the VA. Often, when a service member is wounded and can't return to active duty, it can take months or years before they are enrolled in the VA system. Service members get lost in the lag time between the decision to discharge and the actual discharge and, according to the Government Accountability Office, the VA often cannot find them to connect them to the VA system. 
   * Help veterans deal with confusing paperwork and complex regulations in the VA system and ensure the process is done correctly the first time to minimize delay or disqualifications. 
   * Help relieve the overload on DoD and VA patient advocates and case workers who are assigned to help returning service members and veterans get health care. These employees are often overworked with disproportionately large caseloads and a high turnover rate, making consistency in care and support nearly impossible.
