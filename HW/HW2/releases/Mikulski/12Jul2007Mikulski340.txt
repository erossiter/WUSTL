SEN. MIKULSKI SECURES FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN MARYLAND COMMUNITY, HOUSING PROJECTS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the 2008 spending bill includes $2.2 million for key community development projects in Maryland. The bill also protects Baltimore City from being stripped of its status as a "Moving to Work" demonstration program participant, shielding the city and public housing residents from severe implications. 
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook that builds and protects communities. This legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of working to identify places where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best list of local, state and federal priorities. Marylanders can count on me to continue standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents."  
   Senator Mikulski specifically fought to include language in the spending bill that prohibits the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from revoking Baltimore City's designation as a "Moving to Work" city. "Moving to Work" is a demonstration program that offers public housing authorities the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed housing and self-sufficiency strategies for low-income families. The program gives the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC) greater flexibility and increased resources to meet the needs of low-income residents who are trying to build better lives for themselves and their families. HUD recently threatened to revoke Baltimore City's status based on a HUD technical error identified in an Inspector General report. 
   The spending bill also includes $2.2 million for community development projects in Maryland:
   * $700,000 for the City of College Park for blight removal along the Route 1 Corridor. 
   * $400,000 for Montgomery County to provide for pedestrian safety in the Long Branch community in Silver Spring through pedestrian safety linkages and way-finding community markers. 
   * $300,000 for the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation's Library Square Revitalization Project in Baltimore, to continue the revitalization of an under-used area in the Library Square commercial district. 
   * $200,000 for the Washington County Free Library to facilitate the design and construction of a new library branch in Boonsboro. This small community has raised nearly $1 million to build this new library and computer center. 
   * $200,000 for the East Baltimore Development Project to continue providing for workforce development, clean and safe programs, and infrastructure improvements. The organization is leading the nation's most ambitious community revitalization effort, transforming 80 acres of blighted land around Johns Hopkins Hospital into a mixed-use, mixed-income community. 
   * $200,000 for the Jewish Foundation for Group Homes in Rockville to acquire and renovate a single-family home into an Alternative Living Unit for three adults with developmental disabilities. 
   * $200,000 for the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center in Columbia to provide the last stage of construction funding for the only emergency services shelter in Howard County. 
   The bill also restores funding for the HOPE VI housing program to $100 million, despite the President's elimination in his budget request. HOPE VI was created by Senator Mikulski in 1992 with the aim of replacing dilapidated public housing with mixed-income developments connected to schools, retail and community services. Since the program started, over $5 billion has been appropriated for HOPE VI and billions more have been leveraged from the private sector. Senator Mikulski and a bipartisan group of her congressional colleagues introduced the HOPE VI reauthorization bill this spring. This is the second year that President Bush has attempted to cut this vital program. 
   "We need to support federal programs that help those who help themselves. The President talks about creating a better life for Americans, but his budget fails to deliver on his words yet again," said Senator Mikulski. "HOPE VI has always been about creating new opportunities for residents of public housing and new hope for the communities surrounding public housing. I will continue my fight to not only reauthorize this vital program, but to make sure the President does not succeed in cutting funds for the program." 
   The legislation was passed by the full Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon. In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
