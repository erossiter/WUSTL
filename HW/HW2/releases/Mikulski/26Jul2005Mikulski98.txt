SEN. MIKULSKI RECEIVES 100% RATING FROM NATIONAL HISPANIC LEADERSHIP AGENDA
  The National Hispanic Leadership Agenda (NHLA) has awarded Sen.  
 Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) a 100% approval rating in honor of her strong support for the Hispanic community. In particular, NHLA congratulated Sen. Mikulski for her stances on key appropriations and education legislation during both sessions of the 108th Congress. The perfect score reflects Sen. Mikulski's ongoing commitment to securing basic civil rights and providing a better quality of life for all Americans. 
   "I take pride in representing Maryland's increasingly diverse population. Hispanics play an active and important role in our community and enrich us with their work ethic and family values," said Senator Mikulski. "I am honored to have received such a high rating from the National Hispanic Leadership Agenda because it acknowledges my commitment to the needs of my Hispanic constituents. I will continue to fight for equal opportunities for Hispanics in education, health care and all other situations." 
   The NHLA scorecard is based on votes on a diverse set of issues that have a direct impact on Hispanics and their families. Senator Mikulski consistently voted in favor of helping the Hispanic community move ahead on issues such as education, health care, economic mobility, workforce and civil rights. She has also secured funding for building and social development in many of Maryland's Hispanic neighborhoods. 
   The NHLA is a nonpartisan coalition of Hispanic public policy and civil rights organizations. Drawing members from all of the nation's diverse Hispanic communities, the NHLA works to grant Hispanics a stronger voice in national affairs.
