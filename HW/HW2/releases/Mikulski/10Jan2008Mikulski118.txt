SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS MAYOR DIXON TO ANNOUNCE LARGEST FIREFIGHTER GRANT IN BALTIMORE CITY HISTORY
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined Baltimore City Mayor Sheila Dixon today to announce that the Baltimore City Fire Department has been awarded nearly $1.43 million in federal funding through the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program (AFGP). This is the largest grant ever awarded to the Baltimore City Fire Department since the beginning of the AFGP in 2001. Senator Mikulski addressed Baltimore City firefighters this afternoon, and vowed to continue her fight for America's firefighters and first responders.  
   Senator Mikulski is on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the AFGP and worked to increase funding despite President Bush's drastic cuts. In his 2008 budget, President Bush only requested $287 million for the AFGP, down from $547 million last year. The Subcommittee increased funding to $560 million in the omnibus spending package that the President signed into law in December. It also includes $190 million, an increase of $75 million, for Staffing for Adequate Fire and Emergency Response (SAFER) grants, also under the AFGP. President Bush's budget eliminated funding for SAFER grants for the second year in a row. 
   "Helping our firefighters is not a political issue, it's a safety issue. If you are willing to put your life on the line every day for the benefit of others, you should never feel short-changed by your government. That's why I will continue to fight for the federal support first responders need to get the equipment, training and resources they deserve," said Senator Mikulski. "First responders are our true heroes - protecting our homes, our businesses and our communities. I'm grateful for the sacrifices they make every day." 
   The Baltimore County Fire Department will use its nearly $1.43 million to purchase 1,200 sets of turn out gear. This is the sixth award for the department, which has received a total of nearly $4.37 million since 2001. In 2005, it received $1.3 million for communications equipment and software. In 2004, it received a $336,900 fire prevention and safety grant, as well as $371,910 for interoperable communications equipment. It received $632,800 for fire prevention and arson investigation in 2002, and $301,000 for operations and safety in 2001. 
   AFGP grants fund firefighting equipment, personal protection equipment, training, firefighting vehicles, firefighter/first responder safety projects, and staffing recruitment and retention. Since 2001, Maryland fire departments and fire service organizations have received approximately $55 million through the AFGP.
