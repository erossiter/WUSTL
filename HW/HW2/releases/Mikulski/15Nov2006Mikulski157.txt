SENATE APPROVES $90.6 MILLION FOR DC METRO AREA MILITARY FACILITIES
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced the full Senate has approved the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs 2007 spending bill. The bill includes $138 million for important projects at Maryland's military bases, including nearly $90.6 million for facilities in the Washington, D.C., metro area. The legislation contains provisions providing military installations nationwide with federal funding totaling nearly $94 billion to support new construction costs.  
   "A stronger America begins at home. We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words but with deeds. Every year, I fight to make sure our military has the tools they need to keep us safe," said Senator Mikulski. "Now, more than ever, we need to take their needs to heart. I will keep fighting to make sure there is funding in the federal checkbook for our military bases." 
   "We've worked hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations continue to fare well in the annual appropriations process, both enhancing these state-of-the-art facilities and in making quality of life improvements at these bases," said Senator Sarbanes. "These facilities are not only important to our overall national defense, but also our State's economy, resulting in significant spillover opportunities in our hi-tech defense related sectors." 
   The spending bill includes: 
   * $29 million for the Strategic Planning & Development Facility at Andrews Air Force Base in Prince George's County. 
   * $29 million for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick in Frederick for stage one of the construction of a new high-containment laboratory. 
   * $13.8 million for the Armed Forces Reserve Center at Fort Detrick, to serve Army and Marine Corps Reserve units. 
   * $11.8 million for the National Maritime Intelligence Center in Suitland. 
   * $5.6 million for the Maryland Army National Guard Readiness Center in Gaithersburg. 
   * $1.4 million for the Joint Medical Command Headquarters Facility in Bethesda to serve joint occupants from the Army, Navy and Air Force. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
