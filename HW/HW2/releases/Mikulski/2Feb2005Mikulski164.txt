SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $1.77 MILLION FOR MARYLAND TO HELP WORKING FAMILIES PAY THEIR HEATING BILLS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced today that the Department of Health and Human Services is releasing over $100 million in emergency funds to states, territories and tribes from the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP).  
 These funds will be used by working families to help pay for heating their homes this winter. Maryland is slated to receive $1,772,335. 
   "No American family deserves to be cold this winter," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have long urged the Administration to release these funds into the hands of the working families that need them. I am proud that this money is going to help Maryland families to heat their homes." 
   Senator Mikulski has repeatedly joined her colleagues to ask President Bush to release emergency funds. In a letter dated January 27, 2005, she writes, "Congress appropriated the LIHEAP emergency funds to help consumers meet the cost of rising energy prices and reduce energy debt remaining from last winter...many low-income consumers entered this winter without heat or electricity due to unaffordable energy prices last year, and thousands of these families remain without heat. Emergency funding is needed immediately..."
