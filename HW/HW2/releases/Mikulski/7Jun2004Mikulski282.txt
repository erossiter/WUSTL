SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Statement of Sen. Barbara Mikulski on the Death of President Ronald Reagan 
   "My deepest condolences go out today to the Reagan family. My own father passed away from Alzheimer's. I know how tremendously difficult it is when a loved one suffers from this disease. It is a challenge that Nancy Reagan has met with grace, dignity and dedication. Her courage is a model for the nation.
   "President Reagan will be remembered for his strong convictions, his unfailing optimism and his deep and abiding patriotism. He was dedicated to ridding the world of communism - a conviction that I shared. I will always be grateful for his support of the Solidarity movement in Poland and dissidents throughout Eastern Europe in their fight for freedom. Today, Poland is a free and democratic country and stands as an ally of the United States. President Reagan would take great pride in the end of the cold war and creation of new Europe that includes many of the former Soviet bloc countries as members of NATO.
   "As our nation mourns the passing of President Reagan, our thoughts and prayers are with his family."
