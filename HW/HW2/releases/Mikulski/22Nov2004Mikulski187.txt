FEDERAL FUNDING FOR KEY PROJECTS COMING TO BALTIMORE AREA
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that several key projects in the Baltimore region are slated to receive funding in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is now sent to the President for his signature. The more than *$388 billion omnibus spending bill completes the 9 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government through fiscal year 2005. To stay within the spending constraints demanded by the White House, all programs in the bill were cut by 0.80 percent. 
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook to create jobs and build communities. This final legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of work with Maryland communities to identify where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best of local, state and federal priorities. Maryland can count on me to keep standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation."  
   "We are bringing a bounty of federal funds to the State of Maryland that will aid our communities, our economy, our transportation network, and our environment; and thereby enhancing the quality of life and providing opportunities for people throughout the entire State," added Senator Paul S. Sarbanes. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes worked together to secure funding for the following projects: 
   HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
   Senator Mikulski met with Randallstown and Dundalk leaders earlier this year and is proud to deliver on her promise to help build community centers and empower residents in these two Baltimore neighborhoods. 
   * $396,800 to build the Randallstown Community Center. This community center, to be built adjacent to the Liberty Court and Liberty Plaza shopping centers, will offer recreational activities and personal development opportunities to residents of the Randallstown area.

   * $248,000 for Associated Catholic Charities to build a new facility and renovate an existing facility for Our Daily Bread, Christopher Place Employment Academy and My Sister's Place Women's Center. Our Daily Bread serves nearly 250,000 meals annually to the poor and homeless. Christopher Place Employment Academy assists men moving from homelessness, unemployment and addiction to full-time employment, self-sufficiency and recovery. Currently only 32 men may enter the program per six-month session; relocating will increase that number to 90 men per year. My Sister's Place Women's Center provides safe haven to homeless women and their children. New facilities will significantly increase the program's space, resources and accessibility. 
   * $992,000 for East Baltimore Development Inc., to support ongoing revitalization within Middle East Baltimore City. This project will help transform this neighborhood into a thriving mixed-income, mixed-use community that will include a state of the art Life Sciences and Technology Park, new and renovated housing, neighborhood retail, streetscape improvements, and a pre-K to 8th grade school. 
   * $297,600 for the City of Baltimore to relocate the City's central automotive repair facility ("Central Garage").

   * $248,000 for Villa Julie College to establish a Nursing Distance Learning program.

The system serves 30,000 travelers daily, providing vital public transportation stops to business districts within the Baltimore Metro area, MARC and AMTRAK train service at Penn Station, and to the BWI Airport. Single-tracking can cause trains to be delayed while waiting for passage of oncoming trains or during routine maintenance, rendering certain sections impassable. This double tracking project will expedite commuter service offering better links between neighborhoods and jobs, particularly for those individuals commuting to suburban jobs. 
   * $3.968 million for the statewide bus program. This funding will be used by the Maryland Transit Authority (MTA) to expand bus fleets and facilities and replace older buses throughout the state.

In 1999, the State of Maryland had over 96,000 clients receiving cash assistance under its TANF program, over 27,500 of which were working age. This funding will ensure that Maryland counties can operate their transit systems during expanded hours of service which benefits entry-level employees working second and third shift jobs.
