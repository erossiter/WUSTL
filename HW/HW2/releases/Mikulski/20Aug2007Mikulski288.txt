SEN. MIKULSKI WELCOMES NEW PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY STAFFER SCHOULTZ
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that Nichelle Schoultz has been hired as Special Assistant to the Senator for Prince George's County.  
   "I am pleased to have Nichelle Schoultz join my staff. She will be my catcher's mitt in Prince George's County - the first call for my constituents in the region," said Senator Mikulski. "She has the experience and the enthusiasm to serve the county well. I know she will be a valuable addition to our team." 
   Schoultz will be Senator Mikulski's eyes and ears in Prince George's County - meeting with constituents and ensuring their views are heard, bringing issues of concerns and priority to the Senator, and assisting with her work to resolve them. She will assist the Senator with meetings and visits with residents, businesses and institutions. She will also help keep constituents aware of what Senator Mikulski is doing on Capitol Hill to meet the day-to-day and long range needs of Prince George's County residents. 
   A graduate of Howard University, Schoultz has served as State Relations and Grassroots Manager at the Epilepsy Foundation since July 2000 where she coordinated all of the foundation's advocacy activities. She will continue her volunteer work with Sisters in Touch, a Prince George's County non-profit organization known for its community service throughout the county and in the Washington, D.C., area, including school supply and food service drives for low-income families. No stranger to Senator Mikulski's work, Schoultz previously worked as a constituent services coordinator for the Senator from 1993 to 1995. 
   Schoultz will work out of the Senator's field office in Greenbelt beginning September 4.
