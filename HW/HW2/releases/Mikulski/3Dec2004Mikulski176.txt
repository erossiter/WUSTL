SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES ANNOUNCE HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING FOR MARYLAND
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that Maryland is set to receive a total of $42,249,934 in federal funding from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The funds will be used for training and equipment for first responders in order to prevent, deter, and respond to terrorist attacks and are part of the nearly $2.5 billion being made available to states, localities and U.S. territories through the Office of State and Local Government Coordination and Preparedness (SLGCP).  
   "Keeping Maryland and America safe is my top priority. That's why I fought hard to make sure people on the front lines protecting our homeland - our first responders, border guards, secret service agents and airport security teams - have the equipment and resources they need to do their jobs and keep us safe," said Senator Mikulski. 
   "While I am pleased by this funding, it is a drop in the bucket compared to the vast unmet needs of our first responders," said Senator Sarbanes. "I will continue to work side-by-side with Senator Mikulski to increase this critical homeland security funding for Maryland's local communities." 
   Specifically, Maryland will receive $42.2 million through five programs from the Department of Homeland Security. 
   State Homeland Security Grants: 
   * State Homeland Security - $19,866,423 Critical to Maryland's first responders, this funding will help state and local public safety and law enforcement personnel pay for training, equipment, and planning exercises to prevent, respond to and recover from terrorist attacks or other emergencies. 
   * Law Enforcement Terrorism Prevention Program (LETPP) - $7,224,154 Funds for this program will provide law enforcement communities with enhanced capabilities for detecting, deterring, disrupting and preventing acts of terrorism with a specific focus on the prevention of a weapon of mass destruction (WMD) incident. 
   * Citizen Corps - $252,204 Maryland's Citizen Corps engages residents to develop and implement homeland security, community preparedness, and family safety plans. 
   * Emergency Management Performance Grant Program - $3,242,046 
   The Emergency Management Performance Grant (EMPG) program is designed to help state and local emergency managers develop, maintain and improve their emergency management capabilities, which are key components of a comprehensive national emergency management system for all hazards. The EMPG program is an essential source of funds to help emergency managers reduce the threats to their state. 
   * Metropolitan Medical Response System Program - $227,592 
   The Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) program funds highly populated jurisdictions to develop plans, conduct training and exercises, and acquire pharmaceuticals and personal protective equipment, to achieve the enhanced capability necessary to respond to a mass casualty event caused by a WMD with their locally controlled and operated resources, until significant external resources arrive. 
   Urban Area Security Grants: 
   * City of Baltimore - $11,437,517 
   These funds are used to enhance local emergency, prevention and response agencies' ability to prepare for and respond to threats or incidents of terrorism involving WMD. Funds provided under this grant are designed to address the unique needs of large urban areas. Funds can be used for equipment, training, exercises and planning. 
   This federal funding was included in the Fiscal Year 2005 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill that passed Congress in October 2004. The legislation directed each state to pass on 80% of the total funding awarded to them to local communities. Senator Mikulski serves on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security, which funds these programs.
