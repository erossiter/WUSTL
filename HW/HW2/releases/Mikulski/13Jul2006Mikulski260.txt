SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS FOR FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN OCEANS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced the Senate version of the Commerce, Justice, Science 2007 spending bill, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, includes a $700 million down payment towards the recommendations presented by the Joint Ocean Commission Initiative (JOCI). In June 2006, Sen. Mikulski received the report she had requested from JOCI - From Sea to Shining Sea: Priorities for Ocean Policy Reform - on needed reforms for the sustainability of the world's oceans. Sen. Mikulski organized a bipartisan group of her Senate colleagues to request the report as part of a national initiative to increase visibility and conservation for oceans.  
   "Oceans contribute $120 billion to our economy and support over 2 million jobs. Investments to protect and understand our oceans provide enormous value to our taxpayers," said Senator Mikulski. "I asked for the JOCI report to give us a framework for future action - things we can accomplish today and tomorrow. As the senior Democrat on the subcommittee that funds the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), I am proud to have fought this year to make a down payment on oceans programs." 
   From Sea to Shining Sea recommends a number of steps Congress can take to better fund and assist the implementation of the commission's previous proposals to ocean policy reform. Senator Mikulski has included federal funding for a number of JOCI's recommendations: 
   * Education: $120 million for NOAA education initiatives to promote better understanding and stewardship of our oceans, and to get children interested in science. 
   * Observation: $138 million for ocean observation, which is critical to the safety and efficiency of marine operations, and the protection and restoration of coastal resources. 
   * Exploration: $25 million for ocean exploration - 70 percent of Earth is oceans, but 95 percent of our oceans are unexplored. 
   * Research: $80 million for ocean research, which can lead to better weather predictions and breakthroughs in health and science. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Both Houses of Congress will vote on the conference bill. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
