SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $2 MILLION FOR WESTERN MARYLAND DEFENSE PROJECT IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate version of the Department of Defense 2008 spending bill includes $61.5 million for defense projects in Maryland, including $2 million for a defense project in Western Maryland. The legislation, which passed the subcommittee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops with the equipment they need on the battlefield, the benefits and services they deserve when they return home, and support for their families on the home front. We know how critical these funds are for our troops to fulfill their mission and return home safely," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for our troops." 
   The $2 million will be used by Volvo Powertrain in Hagerstown to complete development of a Heavy Duty Hybrid Electric Vehicle for the U.S. Air Force. This project is aimed at reducing dangerous emissions and greatly improving fuel economy. The project supports 1,500 jobs in Washington County. 
   A full Appropriations Committee vote is expected tomorrow morning on the spending bill. The bill will then move to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
