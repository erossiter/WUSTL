   "We need to continue our work to protect neighborhoods and families - that means safer streets and safer communities. I am proud to have secured funding in this year's bill to support programs with proven track records that are making a difference in Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "We need to take a comprehensive look at gang problems. No one can do it alone. That's why I will continue to work for federal investments to help clean up our streets and fight the crime that is destroying our neighborhoods."  
   MARYLAND PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK YOUTH 
   Senator Mikulski secured nearly $5.5 million in this year's spending bill for programs targeting the prevention, intervention and prosecution of gang activity in Maryland. This includes critical funds for programs that target at-risk youth with after-school programs and support services. 
   * $3 million for the Maryland Statewide Anti-Gang Initiative for the U.S. Attorney to continue to fight gangs through intervention, prevention and prosecution. 
   * $750,000 for the Latin American Youth Center in Prince George's County, to expand job training programs and continue after-school educational programs for at-risk youth. 
   * $500,000 for Baltimore's Safe and Sound Campaign to assist at-risk high school youth with job training, support at-risk pregnant women, and provide summer programs for kids. 
   * $400,000 for KidsPeace in Columbia, which provides support services for foster care parents 
   * $300,000 for the Asian American Leadership Empowerment and Development in Wheaton, to help families support their children's academic and social development, offer academic assistance, mentoring and one-on-one tutoring, and increase opportunities for youth to move out of poverty. 
   * $300,000 for the To Work in Gaining Skills (TWIGS) program at the Baltimore School for the Arts to continue expansion of after-school programs. 
   * $200,000 for the Rejecting Violence, Building Resilience program at the Patterson Park public charter school in Baltimore for after-school programs for at-risk youth. 
   TOOLS FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
   Senator Mikulski also included nearly $3.8 million to upgrade equipment and technical capabilities for local law enforcement agencies in Maryland: 
   * $1 million for a new interoperable radio system for Prince George's County. 
   * $1 million for the Capitol Wireless Information Network (CapWIN) to increase operational data sources, enhance technical capabilities, and provide additional tools to first responders in the state. 
   * $750,000 for the State of Maryland's First Responder Interoperability Project to improve operability and communication among all state law enforcement agencies as well as local jurisdictions. 
   * $500,000 to improve and upgrade Baltimore County's Forensics Lab. 
   * $500,000 to improve and upgrade Baltimore City's Forensics Lab. 
   The bill also provides more than $1.6 million for Baltimore City organizations that provide training, job placement and support for ex-offenders: Baltimore City Felony Diversion Initiative ($500,000), New Song Urban Ministries At-Risk Youth and Ex-Offender Program ($450,000), Goodwill Industries of the Chesapeake Bay ($250,000), the Project Serve Program at the Living Classrooms Foundation ($225,000) and the Johns Hopkins Prisoner Career Re-Entry Program ($200,000). 
   The 2008 CJS spending bill emphasizes congressional oversight, accountability and fiscal stewardship. The bill requires each agency to notify the Committee immediately after learning of program cost overruns greater than 10 percent. The Government Accountability Office (GAO) is directed to conduct biannual reports of programs and projects greater than $100 million to identify cost overruns and mismanagement. The bill also requires that Inspectors General conduct audits of grant funding. 
   Chairwoman Mikulski instituted criteria for all congressionally designated projects in this year's spending bill, requiring that they be specifically focused on the mission and mandate of the organization. The CJS bill substantially reduces earmarks, and all projects in the bill comply with the requirements of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act (S. 1), as passed by the Senate. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the spending bill will go to the President for his signature.
