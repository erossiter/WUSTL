SEN. MIKULSKI: COMMUNITY NEEDS MORE TIME TO VOICE OPINIONS ON PROPOSED LNG SITE AT SPARROWS POINT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), joined by a bipartisan group of her Maryland U.S. Senate and House of Representatives colleagues, sent a letter to Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Joseph T. Kelliher today, urging him to extend the public comment period on the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) facility at Sparrows Point in Baltimore. Sen. Mikulski has expressed her opposition to the proposed facility in the heavily populated area and said Southeastern Baltimore City and County communities and the new state government need more time to voice their comments.  
   "I am deeply concerned for the safety of communities surrounding the site and the potential environmental impact of the facility. Residents need more time to make sure their voice is heard before a LNG site is built in their neighborhood," said Senator Mikulski. "I need to know that all of Maryland will be secure."
