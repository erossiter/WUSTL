  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, issued the following statement today following the release of a Government Accountability Office (GAO) review she requested in February 2006 on the policies and practices of federal science agencies including the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). 
   "I will continue to stand sentry to ensure that our scientists are able to research and report their findings to the public without fear of censorship or intimidation. As we draft the 2008 CJS spending bill, I will require that our science agencies implement the GAO's recommendations to ensure clarity in their policies."
