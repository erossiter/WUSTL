SENATE APPROVES FUNDING FOR KEY ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN BALTIMORE
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) and Paul S. Sarbanes(D-MD) have announced that the full Senate has unanimously approved the FY 2006 Department of Interior Appropriations bill, allocating $1 million for Baltimore to upgrade its wastewater systems.  
   "Maryland's communities want to do the right thing by the environment, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have worked so hard to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment. Congratulations to Baltimore for this well-earned federal investment." 
   "This funding will help improve the quality of life for the residents of the City of Baltimore by providing a safer water supply, as well as aiding the overall Chesapeake Bay water clean-up efforts," said Senator Sarbanes. "I'm proud to join with Senator Mikulski in announcing this federal funding." 
   With the Senate's passage of the 2006 Interior spending bill, Maryland communities will receive $2.65 million in grants for special-needs water and wastewater infrastructure improvements. These grants, known as "State and Tribal Assistance Grants" (STAG), are typically used for wastewater infrastructure improvements that reduce the amount of nutrients entering waterways and the associated health and environmental impacts. Baltimore is noted in the spending bill to receive $1 million in funding to construct and rehabilitate the sewer system, to prevent overflows. 
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee as the Senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes serves as Ranking Member on the Banking, Housing and Urban Development Committee and serves on the Budget Committee.
