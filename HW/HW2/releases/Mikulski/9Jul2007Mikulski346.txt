SEN. MIKULSKI CONGRATULATES SERVICE ACADEMY APPOINTEES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the 13 Marylanders who will be attending U.S. military academies this year. After a rigorous application and interview process, Sen. Mikulski nominated these students who will begin instruction this fall. Over 200 Maryland students sought Sen. Mikulski's nomination to one of the military academies this year.  
   "I am so proud of the young men and women who have worked so hard to have the opportunity to serve our country in one of the military academies," said Senator Mikulski. "These young people are America's future leaders. The military academies, through rigorous course work and discipline, will prepare them to take up the challenge of making the world a safer, better place to live." 
   Competition for academy appointments is intense among the high school seniors throughout the state of Maryland who rank in the top 10 percent of their class academically. Each student seeking an appointment must submit an application. This application is rigorously examined by Senator Mikulski and by an independent review panel assembled by the Senator for this purpose. 
   After this review process, Senator Mikulski recommends 10 names for each academy vacancy. The academy then makes an offer of appointment to as many of Senator Mikulski's nominees as space permits. An applicant must have a nomination and an offer of appointment to gain entry into one of the four competitive service academies. While the U.S. Naval Academy, Air Force Academy and Military Academy at West Point accept nominations based on the number of vacancies, the Merchant Marine Academy only accepts 10 names per year for consideration.
