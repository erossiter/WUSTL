SEN. MIKULSKI COMMENTS ON RETIREMENT OF SEN. SARBANES
  "Sen. Sarbanes is a man of great intellect and great integrity.  
 He is a steadfast champion for Maryland and for the little guy. He is a passionate environmentalist and a strong advocate for the Chesapeake Bay. He led the fight against corporate greed, and he is a relentless fighter for strong communities and affordable housing. 
   "I have worked hands-on with Senator Sarbanes for over two decades. He is a leader: steadfast and duty driven. He always puts principle above politics. He is a work-horse - not a show horse. 
   "I have no better friend in the United States Senate than Paul Sarbanes. When I first came to the Senate, he helped me develop a strategy for getting on the Appropriations Committee, which has served Maryland so well. Senator Sarbanes made sure that the first Democratic woman Senator had access to the Senate's unique corridors of power. 
   "I treasure the way our partnership has served the people of Maryland. We will continue to work together in the years ahead.
