SEN. MIKULSKI WELCOMES NEW EASTERN SHORE STAFFER TYLER PATTON
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that Tyler Patton has been hired as Special Assistant to the Senator for the Eastern Shore.  
   "I am pleased to have Tyler Patton join my staff. He will be my catcher's mitt on the Eastern Shore - the first call for my constituents in the region," said Senator Mikulski. "He has the experience and the enthusiasm to serve the Eastern Shore well. I know he will be a valuable addition to our team." Patton will be Senator Mikulski's eyes and ears on the Eastern Shore - meeting with constituents and ensuring their views are heard, bringing issues of concerns and priority to the Senator, and assisting with her work to resolve them. Patton will assist the Senator with her meetings and visits with Shore residents, businesses and institutions. He will also handle community outreach for the region and help keep constituents aware of what Senator Mikulski is doing on Capitol Hill to meet the day-to-day and long range needs of Eastern Shore residents. 
   Patton brings with him experience in state government and politics. Before joining Senator Mikulski's team, he worked as a Legislative Committee Analyst at the Office of the President of the Maryland Senate. He also served as the Campaign Director for two Maryland House of Delegates campaigns, worked as a Legislative Aide for Delegate Norman H. Conway, and held positions at the Circuit Court of Washington County and the Baltimore County Office of Government Affairs. 
   Patton grew up in Hagerstown, Md., and moved to the Eastern Shore in 2001. He is a graduate of Salisbury University with a degree in political science and minor in communications. 
   Patton will work out of the Senator's field offices in Salisbury and Annapolis beginning April 23.
