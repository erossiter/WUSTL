SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $3.1 BILLION IN BASE REALIGNMENT AND CLOSURE FUNDING RESTORED IN EMERGENCY SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Senate version of the emergency supplemental spending bill includes $3.1 billion in critical funding for military construction projects required to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) decisions. Last month, Sen. Mikulski, chair of the Maryland congressional delegation, was joined by many of her "Team Maryland" colleagues in urging that the funds be restored. This funding was approved by the committee in the 2007 Military Construction/ Military Quality of Life and Veterans Affairs spending bill, but the bill was not brought up for a Senate floor vote in the 109th Congress, and was not included in the Continuing Resolution (CR) signed into law last month. The bill will be passed out of Committee this afternoon, and will be debated on the Senate floor next week.  
   "While I applaud the bipartisan effort that worked on the CR, I was very frustrated that the failure of the Republican leadership in the 109th Congress meant that crucial programs and funding were cut. But I promised to keep up my fight, and I am proud we have restored these critical funds," said Senator Mikulski. "A stronger America begins at home. We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. That means making sure our military has the tools they need to keep us safe." 
   The 2005 BRAC recommendations will bring significant military assets and thousands of new Department of Defense (DoD) employees into Maryland. BRAC military construction funding is critical to ensuring that necessary infrastructure is in place to prevent a disruption in the military missions of incoming organizations, including those providing direct support to troops on the battlefield. 
   In Maryland alone, this funding will allow the DoD to move forward on more than $300 million in projects, including the construction of critical facilities to directly support our warfighters: 
   * $1.37 million for planning and design for new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda 
   * $389 million for Aberdeen Proving Ground, including funding for Fort Lee, Va., to construct the new Ordnance School 
   * $42.8 million for Fort Detrick 
   * $15.6 million for Fort Meade 
   "BRAC brings opportunities, but it also brings great challenges. We need to focus on how federal dollars can help our states and counties," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep up my work to make sure Maryland communities have what they need in the federal checkbook to implement the BRAC decisions."
