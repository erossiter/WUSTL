SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS TO TAKE OFFICIAL SENATE WOMEN PORTRAIT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined her colleagues last week to take the official portrait of the record 16 female Senators.  
   As Dean of the Senate Women, Senator Mikulski also convened the first monthly Senate Women bipartisan dinner of the 110th Congress following the photo. The dinner is a tradition, initiated by Senator Mikulski, that allows the women to discuss ways to work in coalition to get things done with civility and respect. Three rules govern the dinners: no staff, no memos, no leaks. 
   "I bring the women together for monthly bipartisan dinners so we can get together and talk about the issues without our staffs," said Senator Mikulski. "The women Senators are not a caucus; we're a force." 
   There are now a record 16 women serving in the U.S. Senate. Before Senator Mikulski's election in 1986, only 15 women had ever served in the Senate. The first woman Senator was Rebecca Latimer Felton in 1922, who was appointed to fill a two-day vacancy in the seat. Prior to 1992, there were never more than two women serving in the Senate at the same time.
