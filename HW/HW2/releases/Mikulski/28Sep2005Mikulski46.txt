SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES STAND UP FOR DC METRO AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski today joined her colleague Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) in announcing that the Senate version of the $440.2 billion Defense spending bill includes an additional $125 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $18 million in additional funding for defense projects in the Washington, D.C. metro area, including: 
   * $4 million for a Tactical Hyperspectral Imaging System for the Shadow UAV to help detect, identify and geo-locate a wide variety of difficult targets including search and rescue applications, camouflaged and concealed vehicles, personnel or equipment. 
   * $3.6 million for Moving Tracking System production, a system that provides an encrypted position location system with near real-time messaging worldwide. 
   * $3.5 million for VET-HEAL, a complimentary and alternative healing practice that offers promising and effective ways to relieve pain and suffering that may be useful for soldiers returning from Iraq and Afghanistan, those with Gulf War Syndrome, and those in need of hospice care. 
   * $2 million for a Multipurpose Biodefense Immunoarray to provide the Department of Defense's biodefense program with a tool to support force protection, intelligence/threat assessment and non-proliferation compliance monitoring. The funding will be used to develop arrays for anthrax, encephalitis viruses, hemorrhagic fever viruses and multiple toxins. 
   * $2 million for Next Generation Non-Tactical Vehicle Propulsion - a program to design, develop and demonstrate technology to enhance mission performance capability, increase fuel economy and reduce exhaust emissions of U.S. military non-tactical vehicles. 
   * $1 million for the Armed Forces Medical Intelligence Center's Project LIFE at Fort Detrick in Frederick, Md. The project will work to build new capabilities for providing the highest quality medical intelligence in support of the global war on terrorism, expanded troop deployment and humanitarian efforts. 
   * $1 million for an Applied Research Demonstration Project to increase participation of state public and private colleges in research. 
   * $1 million for USUHS Centers and Activities in Response to CBRNE/WMD Incidents to provide more staffing and to implement discipline-specific programs for EMT/Paramedics, nurses, physicians, hospital administrators, and emergency managers. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has been tentatively scheduled for Friday, September 30, 2005. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. Both Houses of Congress will vote on the conference bill. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Defense Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
