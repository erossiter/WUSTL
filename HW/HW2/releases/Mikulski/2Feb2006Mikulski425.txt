SEN. SARBANES, MIKULSKI SEEKING AID FOR DISPLACED EASTALCO ALUMINUM WORKERS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) are urging Bush Administration officials to move more quickly in aiding those workers of Eastalco Aluminum Company in Frederick, who have lost their jobs as a result of the decision by Eastalco's parent company, Alcoa, to close the plant in an effort to shift its production capabilities to foreign countries. 
   As a result of this decision announced by Alcoa in November to cease operations at the Frederick plant in December, more than 600 workers are without jobs. The plant was closed because Alcoa is in the process of expanding capacity at its aluminum facility in Brazil and is planning on opening new facilities in Iceland and Trinidad and Tobago.
   According to the two Maryland Senators, a request was filed for Trade Adjustment Assistance with the Department of Labor in November of 2005 and those workers who lost their jobs still have not heard from the federal government as to whether they are eligible for federal assistance. The federal government is obligated to assist these hard working individuals who have lost their jobs due to economic circumstances beyond their control.
   In a letter to Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, the two Maryland Senators wrote that, "We urge the Department to make all appropriate federal resources and assistance programs available to the workers at Eastalco who have been severely impacted by Alcoa's decision to move operations out of the United States."
