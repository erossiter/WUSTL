SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS FOR FBI INVESTIGATION OF CHARLES COUNTY HATE CRIMES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has called on FBI Director Robert Mueller to investigate a series of 25 recent hate crimes directed at racial and ethnic groups in Charles County, Md.  
   "I am extremely troubled by this rash of hate crimes in my own home state. Families deserve to know their neighborhoods are safe and free from intolerance and discrimination. No one should have to worry about falling victim to these despicable hate crimes, which are happening in victims' own backyards," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to work with the FBI, my constituents and the NAACP of Charles County to help bring justice to these communities and to protect them from hate crimes." 
   A group of Senator Mikulski's constituents, including the leadership of the Charles County National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), have been in contact with the Senator regarding 25 recent, disturbing hate crimes in the area. The crimes have occurred at a variety of community pillars, including churches, playgrounds, shopping centers and even private homes. 
   Senator Mikulski sent a letter to Director Mueller, urging him to have his "staff investigate this series of crimes to determine how the FBI can help both bring justice to this community and prevent these crimes from happening again." 
   "We need to reexamine what this country must still do to ensure equality every day," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I'm calling for a thorough FBI inspection of what is happening in Charles County. These dreadful crimes of hate will not be tolerated in Maryland, or across the nation."
