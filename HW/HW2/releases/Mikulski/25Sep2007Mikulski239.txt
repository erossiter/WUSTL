SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES NEARLY $13.7 MILLION IN GRANTS TO KEEP CRIME OUT OF MARYLAND COMMUNITIES
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded nearly $13.7 million statewide in Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants (Byrne/JAG grants) to fight crime in our communities. Senator Mikulski is Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the DOJ, fighting every year to keep this program funded.  
   "This funding is a federal investment in keeping our communities strong and thriving. It will help prevent lost youth and lost opportunity, and keep Marylanders safe in their neighborhoods," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to give law enforcement the tools they need to clean up the streets, protect our families, and fight the crime that is destroying communities." 
   Chairwoman Mikulski has criticized President Bush's fiscal year 2008 budget, which dramatically reduced federal resources to fight and assist state and local communities in fighting violent crime. Senator Mikulski restored funding in this year's CJS spending bill to provide assistance for local and state law enforcement to nearly $2.7 billion, filling a major gap after the President cut its budget in half. This funding provides $1.4 billion for competitive grants to state and local law enforcement agencies, including $660 million for the Byrne/JAG grant program. 
   Byrne/JAG grants are used to help communities improve their criminal justice systems, and to prevent drug abuse and crime. Local jurisdictions apply for grants through the Governor's Office of Crime Control and Prevention, and grants are awarded based on their individual needs. The nearly $13.7 million was awarded in 20 grants around the state, including:
