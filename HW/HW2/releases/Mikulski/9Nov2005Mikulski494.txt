SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE AGREEMENT ON FUNDING FOR EASTERN SHORE WATERWAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes and Barbara A. Mikulski (both D-Md.) announced that the full House and Senate have reached agreement on the final numbers for the FY 2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, that includes millions of dollars in federal funding for navigational improvements to waterways as well as environmental and habitat restoration projects throughout Maryland's Eastern Shore.  
   Of note is the inclusion of $245,000 in new federal funding to the Corps of Engineers to initiate a study of the feasibility of using dredged materials from the Baltimore shipping channels to restore lost wetlands at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. More than 8,000 acres of valuable marshlands have been lost at Blackwater since 1933 due to sea-level rise, invasive species and shoreline erosion. 
   "The waterways of the Eastern Shore - its rivers, bays and Atlantic Ocean beaches - are the lifeblood or the region's economy and quality of life," said Senator Sarbanes. "Funding for these projects represents a renewed and continuing commitment to protect and enhance these assets and bolster our economy. I am particularly pleased that we were able to include funding to begin to examine ways to restore the marshlands at Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge which is a critical habitat for birds and other wildlife in the area." 
   "This is a federal investment in the lives and livelihoods that depend on the waterways of the Eastern Shore," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work in the Senate with my colleague, Senator Sarbanes, to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment." 
   The agreement includes funding for the following projects: 
   For the Chesapeake Bay: 
   * $13.4 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems; 
   * $2.25 million to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on these reefs; 
   * Funding of $2 million provided as part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program. The money is given non-federal interests in the Chesapeake Bay for environmental restoration efforts. Funding of $273,000 is included in this amount for continued efforts by the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the risks and benefits of the introduction of non-native oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay; 
   * $500,000 for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration techniques and technologies in the Chesapeake Bay. SAV or "sea grasses" are vital to marine and estuarine ecosystems, providing not only food and habitat for a wide variety of species, but also serving as sediment traps to help prevent shoreline erosion. In the Chesapeake Bay, the level of grasses in the bay has dropped to under 70,000 acres, about one-tenth of their historic level. The funding is to be used for extensive research to improve restoration techniques as well as continue SAV restoration efforts; 
   * $975,000 to continue the shoreline erosion study of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries by the Army Corps of Engineers. Shoreline erosion around the more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline amounts to approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material being deposited into the Chesapeake Bay annually; and 
   * Funding of $500,000 to continue the Eastern Shore Waterways Study of potential beneficial use of dredged material projects similar to Poplar Island in the mid-Bay area. 
   For the Atlantic Ocean Beaches: 
   * $4.9 million for beach replenishment efforts along the Atlantic Coast of Maryland, including Ocean City. The Bush Administration zero funded this needed hurricane protection effort. The project will consist of widening and raising the beach in Ocean City, Maryland, the building of a steel bulkhead along 1.5 miles of the boardwalk, and the construction of a sand dune north of the boardwalk; and 
   * Funding of $765,000 for restoration efforts at the northern end of Assateague Island National Seashore. The two Senators have been strong proponents in obtaining both long and short term funding commitments to replenish and restore the island's beaches to avoid breaches which would not only damage and possibly destroy the island, but also to protect the fragile habitat that resides behind the barrier island. The Bush Administration did not include funding in the budget for these efforts and the two Senators worked to ensure that this restoration project keeps moving forward. 
   For Eastern Shore River and Harbor Navigation Improvements: 
   * $1.71 million to the Army Corps of Engineers for maintenance dredging of the Ocean City Harbor, Inlet, and Sinepuxent Bay; 
   * $630,000 for maintenance dredging of Knapps Narrows. The project was last dredged in 2000 and has shoaled to a depth of only 4.5 feet. The project supports a seafood-packing house, 7 of the remaining 10 working skipjacks in Maryland, 4 large marinas and numerous other commercial fishing vessels. The Tilghman Island community relies largely on the commercial fishing industry for their economy. The project provides for a channel 9 feet deep and 75 feet wide; 
   * $450,000 for the dredging of the upper portion of the Wicomico River and to identify and construct a new placement site for the next cycle of dredging scheduled for FY 07 for the down river portion of the project. With the Port of Salisbury serving as the second largest port in the State and supporting facilities for grain exports and petroleum imports, the continuation of these dredging operations is essential to the economy of the Delmarva Peninsula; 
   * $405,000 for maintenance dredging and operations in Tilghman Island Harbor; 
   * $250,000 for the Army Corps of Engineers to investigate potential improvements to Nanticoke Harbor which silts in rapidly following maintenance dredging operations. Emphasis will be on possible ways to reconfigure, lengthen or heighten the current stone jetties to slow the silting in of the waterways; and 
   * $216,000 for dredging operations in the Nanticoke River. 
   The Senate and House must give final approval to the agreement before being sent to President Bush for his signature.
