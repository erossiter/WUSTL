SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE APPROVAL OF FUNDS TO BENEFIT PORT OF BALTIMORE, BALTIMORE AREA, OTHER MARYLAND WATERWAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the FY 2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill which will provide funding for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to undertake efforts to maintain and improve the Port of Baltimore's harbor and other shipping channels leading into the Port. Funding is also included for other water and waterway improvement projects important to Baltimore City, the Greater Baltimore area and other efforts to improve the water quality and habitat of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. 
   "The Port of Baltimore and its shipping channels are vital to the economic well-being of our State," said Sarbanes. "During my years in the United States Senate I have fought to ensure that the Port of Baltimore has the means and continued federal support necessary to help it grow and meet the needs of its customers. In addition, we have sought to provide critically needed funding for our on-going efforts to improve the Chesapeake Bay and its habitat. We must continue these efforts if we are to protect and enhance these assets and bolster our State's economy."  
   "These projects will help ensure that freight carriers and cruise ships can safely navigate Baltimore's channels so the Port can continue to serve as an important economic engine for Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work with Senator Sarbanes to create jobs and protect the environment." 
   The funding approved by the Senate Appropriations Committee as part of the Energy and Water Development bill for FY 2007, includes the following projects: 
   * $15.482 million for annual maintenance dredging of the Baltimore shipping channels and $330,000 for drift removal in the shipping channels; 
   * $13.1 million for the continuation of the Poplar Island environmental restoration project which is taking clean dredged materials from the shipping lanes leading to the Port of Baltimore and using it to stabilize the shoreline, create habitat areas and restore the wetlands of one of the Chesapeake Bay's most valuable island ecosystems; 
   * $12 million for operations and maintenance of the C&D Canal and approach channels; 
   * $2 million to continue efforts to increase the oyster population in the Chesapeake Bay by restoring oyster habitat, creating new reefs, and planting disease-free oysters on these reefs; 
   * $1.5 million for improvements to the Gwynns Falls watershed including restoring wetlands, stabilizing streambanks, rehabilitating the sewer system, and retrofitting stormwater management features. The projects will be part of regional restoration actions for the Patapsco River; 
   * Funding of $1 million provided as part of the Chesapeake Bay Environmental Restoration and Protection Program. The money is given to state and local governments in the Chesapeake Bay for environmental restoration projects, such as wastewater treatment, and sediment and erosion control efforts. Funding of $118,000 is included in this amount for continued efforts by the Corps of Engineers to evaluate the risks and benefits of the introduction of non-native Asian oysters into the waters of the Chesapeake Bay; 
   * $1 million for submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) restoration techniques and technologies in the Chesapeake Bay. The Chesapeake Bay program has established a goal of planting at least 1,000 acres of SAV (bay grasses) by December 2008. At present most SAV planting projects are small in scale and labor-intensive. The funding is to be used for extensive research to improve restoration techniques as well as continue SAV restoration efforts; 
   * $950,000 to complete and begin to implement a coastal master plan that addresses problems and proposes opportunities to reduce the impacts of shoreline erosion of the Chesapeake Bay and its tributaries. Shoreline erosion around the more than 7,000 miles of tidal shoreline amounts to approximately 4.7 million cubic yards of shoreline material being deposited into the Chesapeake Bay annually; 
   * $600,000 as part of the Baltimore Metropolitan Patapsco Urban River Restoration Initiative. The Patapsco is one of the most heavily utilized and populated waterways within the Chesapeake Bay. Funding will be used to perform sediment sampling, trash management planning, develop restoration concept designs, and conduct a navigation improvement analysis; 
   * $450,000 for the initiation of a feasibility study which will examine how to restore the Chesapeake Bay marshlands in and around the Blackwater National Wildlife Refuge. More than 8,000 acres of valuable marshlands have been lost at Blackwater since 1933 due to sea-level rise, invasive species and shoreline erosion; 
   * $300,000 to continue the Eastern Shore Waterways Study of potential beneficial use of dredged material projects similar to Poplar Island in the mid-Bay area; and 
   * $150,000 to begin to develop a coordinated, comprehensive plan within the Army Corps of Engineers mission areas for restoring, preserving, and protecting the Chesapeake Bay ecosystem. The master plan, when completed, will be helpful in integrating existing and future work of the Corps of Engineers and assisting in the implementation of the goals of the Chesapeake 2000 agreement. 
   The bill will now go to the Senate floor for consideration. Once passed differences between the House and Senate version must be reconciled before being sent to President Bush for his signature.
