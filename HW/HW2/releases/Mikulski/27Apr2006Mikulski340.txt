SEN. MIKULSKI INTRODUCES AMENDMENT TO ADDRESS CAPITOL TUNNEL HEALTH HAZARDS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Sens. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and Wayne Allard (R-Colo.) in introducing an amendment to the Emergency Supplemental bill to provide $27.6 million in federal funds to repair unsafe working conditions in the tunnels below the Capitol Building. The legislation follows multiple letters from Sen. Mikulski to the Architect of the Capitol (AOC) expressing outrage over health hazards for workers that have gone without remedy and ignored for years.  
   "I am outraged at the Architect of the Capitol's failure to ameliorate hazardous conditions that exist in the tunnels beneath the Capitol. These conditions endanger the health of the tunnel workers and their families," said Senator Mikulski. "Something needs to be done, and it needs to be done now." 
   Senator Mikulski initially sent a letter to the AOC demanding action in fixing the problems after she was contacted by Capitol employees. When the AOC responded, Senator Mikulski wrote a second letter saying their response did not in any way lessen concerns about worker safety. 
   "There was very little in your response to indicate that you have taken any steps since these issues were brought to my attention to protect these workers. Tunnel workers should not have to wait another day to be assured of a safe and secure working environment," said Senator Mikulski. "They have already waited too long." 
   A structural assessment that was done six years ago, according to the tunnel workers, found "a substantial number of areas that were in danger of collapsing or severely injuring or killing tunnel personnel." In the six years since the Office of Compliance issued its first citation, the AOC has only addressed one of the four areas of concern.
