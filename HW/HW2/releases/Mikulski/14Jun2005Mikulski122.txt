SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE $325,000 TO SUPPORT MARYLAND BUSINESS, TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration (EDA) has approved the Maryland Technology Development Corporation's application for an EDA investment.  
 The $325,000 in funding will be used for a number of programs that will help further develop Maryland high-tech businesses and make the State's business incubation network more effective. 
   Specifically, the investment will be used to support a revolving loan fund for technology businesses affiliated with the TEDCO network and provide technical assistance to improve coordination within the network, especially for those in economically distressed areas of the State including portions of Western Maryland, Baltimore City and the Eastern Shore. 
   "I support the continued growth of small business development throughout Maryland," said Sarbanes. "Emerging high-tech companies need the support of organizations like TEDCO and the funding necessary to carry out their visions. This investment will help to better coordinate their efforts and see to it that those visions have the chance to be realized." 
  "I am working in the United States Senate to make our economy stronger, make America smarter and make our troops and our communities safer - that's what TEDCO does too," said Senator Mikulski. "TEDCO is an anchor tenant of Maryland's 21st century economy. I am so proud to have fought for this federal investment."
   The Maryland Technology Development Corporation (TEDCO) was established by the General Assembly as a tool for Maryland to use in maintaining and enhancing its reputation as a leader in technology.
