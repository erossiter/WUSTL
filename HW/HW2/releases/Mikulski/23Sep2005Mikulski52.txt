SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE FUNDING FOR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN WASHINGTON COUNTY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has awarded Washington County a grant totaling $300,000.  
 The federal funding, along with an additional $940,000 in local funding will be used to provide the Hopewell Valley area with a quality waste water disposal system. 
   The project will involve the construction of a new sewer pump station, as well as the installation of 1.5 miles of sewer line. This new service will increase the attractiveness of the area for economic development and it is estimated that as many as 1500 new jobs could be created over the next three years. 
   "These funds are critical in maintaining a clean, safe, and healthy water supply for the residents of the Hopewell Valley area," said Sarbanes. "The Appalachian Regional Commission continues to provide the towns of Western Maryland with funding to enhance and upgrade their localities and I am pleased that we have been able to provide continued financial support to these local jurisdictions." 
   "I am proud to work in the U.S. Senate to build communities and create jobs. This federal investment to improve the Hopewell Valley area's sewer system will do just that," said Senator Mikulski. "Maryland cities and towns need to upgrade their water and sewer infrastructure but they can't do it on their own, and rate payers shouldn't have to bear the full burden. This grant is a double value for the taxpayer dollar, creating jobs while helping this community grow." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
