SEN. SARBANES, SEN. MIKULSKI, REP. CARDIN ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS IN FREDERICK, CARROLL COUNTIES
  At a press conference today at the Chesapeake Ecology Center, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Rep. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) announced that 4 organizations in Frederick and Carroll Counties were among 28 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants Initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 28 Maryland recipients this year. 
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."  
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own. The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watershed Grants Program is critical to the health of the Bay and its rivers and streams," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why Senator Sarbanes and I work hard to fund effective projects that save the Bay and help the Marylanders who depend on it for jobs and for recreation." 
   "The Chesapeake Watershed Grant program is a critical tool in preserving the Bay for future generations. Congress provides the funding, but it's the individuals and communities closest to the Bay doing the actual work of restoring and protecting the Bay and its many tributaries," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), a strong advocate of the program. 
   Those Frederick and Carroll County projects receiving funding are: 
   * The Thorpe Foundation will use a $35,000 grant to create a ? acre model native plant demonstration garden in Frederick. The site will educate landowners and contractors about the benefits of conservation landscaping through an awareness and education initiative that will include a series of workshops, a "How To" DVD, educational signage, reference materials, and community wide event to celebrate conservation landscaping; 
   * The Interstate Commission on the Potomac River Basin will use a $35,000 grant to develop a water resource model for use as a planning tool for understanding the availability and limits of water resources in the Upper Monacacy Basin. This model will assist managers in managing water quantity in a way that supports water quality and aquatic habitat; 
   * The Chesapeake Bay Foundation will use a $48,000 grant to install forested buffers and stream bank fencing within the Monacacy watershed to help improve water quality by filtering and absorbing nutrients and sediment from run off and decreasing stream bank erosion. It is anticipated that citizen volunteers will assist in the restoration of 5 miles and 35 acres of buffer land and 5 acres of wetlands through this program; and 
   * In addition to the three Small Watershed Grants for Frederick and Carroll Counties, the Town of Myersville, Maryland has received a $75,000 2006 Community Legacy Grant. The funding will be used to help restore the Little Catoctin stream to a stable self-maintaining state. The project involves a comprehensive assessment of the Little Catoctin and will include design and implementation of stream channel restoration, stream bank stabilization, and the planting of buffer plants. 
   In addition, two statewide projects are slated to receive funding: 
   * The Cacapon Institute will use a $35,000 grant to recruit science, social studies, and vocational-agricultural classes from high schools throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed to participate in an internet-based Stream Cleaner Environmental Forum on best management practices to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. The Forum will engage students in a simulated Tributary Team stakeholder process to explore the science and challenges of non-point source pollution reduction. Following the Forum, up to 10 classes will complete water quality restoration projects to serve as visible demonstrations of best management practices as well as living classrooms for future academic study; and 
   * The Izaak Walton League of America will use a $35,000 grant to hold workshops to train 60 certified volunteers to conduct water quality monitoring throughout Maryland. Monitoring will occur at 100 sites throughout Maryland and will be integrated into an annual water quality report. Data gathered during this study will be used to identify and prioritize watershed restoration projects that volunteers with Izaak Walton League can undertake in the future. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Grants Program, which was established by Senator Sarbanes, promotes community-based efforts to develop and implement conservation strategies to protect and restore the diverse natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. The program provides grants to local governments and community organizations working to improve the condition of their local watersheds while building citizen-based resource stewardship. This year more than $2.6 million is being awarded for 68 restoration projects throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed.
