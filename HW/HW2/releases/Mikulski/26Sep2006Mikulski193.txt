SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE SELECTION OF SIX MARYLAND SCHOOLS AS BLUE RIBBON SCHOOL AWARD WINNERS FROM DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that six elementary and middle schools across the State of Maryland have been named 2006 Blue Ribbon School Award winners from the United States Department of Education. The six Maryland schools are 6 of only 250 schools nationwide to receive this prestigious school designation for public and private schools. All the schools nominated by the State of Maryland were selected by the Department of Education as Blue Ribbon School Award winners.  
   The six winning schools are: 
   * Bainbridge Elementary School, Port Deposit, Cecil County; 
   * Clarksville Middle School, Clarksville, Howard County; 
   * Glenarden Woods Elementary School, Prince George's County; 
   * Ridgely Middle School, Lutherville, Baltimore County; 
   * Severna Park Middle School, Anne Arundel County; and 
   * Thomas W. Pyle Middle School, Bethesda, Montgomery County 
   Sarbanes, who was calling each of the winning school principals today to tell them the great news, said "this designation is a ringing endorsement of the efforts underway in these schools to provide an opportunity for these students to succeed and achieve. Over the past few years, I have made a commitment to try and visit each of the Blue Ribbon Schools and have always been delighted to see first hand the interaction of parents, teachers, and the community in the success of the school." 
   "Education must focus on the basics - tough academic standards, safe and drug-free schools, and the latest in math and science technology," said Senator Mikulski. "Those are the key ingredients for educational excellence - and the schools in Maryland that have won the Blue Ribbon School Award all have mastered these ingredients. They provide an opportunity structure for all children and equal opportunity for all children." 
   According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have been judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and national goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools which have strong leadership; a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school; high quality teaching; challenging, up-to-date curriculum; policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning; a solid commitment to parental involvement; and evidence that the school helps all students to achieve high standards. 
   After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School nominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel of outstanding educators and other professionals then reviewed the nominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations to the Secretary of Education.
