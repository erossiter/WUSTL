SENATE APPROVES FUNDING FOR KEY ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS IN WESTERN MARYLAND
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) and Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) have announced that the full Senate has unanimously approved the FY 2006 Department of Interior Appropriations bill, allocating $1.65 million for Western Maryland to upgrade its wastewater systems.  
   "Maryland's communities want to do the right thing by the environment, but they can't do it on their own," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I have worked so hard to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs, builds communities and takes care of our environment. Congratulations to Western Maryland for these well-earned federal investments." 
   "This funding will help improve the quality of life for the residents of Western Maryland by providing a safer water supply, as well as aiding the overall Chesapeake Bay water clean-up efforts," said Senator Sarbanes. "I'm proud to join with Senator Mikulski in announcing this federal funding." 
   With the Senate's passage of the 2006 Interior spending bill, Maryland communities will receive $2.65 million in grants for special-needs water and wastewater infrastructure improvements. These grants, known as "State and Tribal Assistance Grants" (STAG), are typically used for wastewater infrastructure improvements that reduce the amount of nutrients entering waterways and the associated health and environmental impacts. The following Western Maryland communities are noted in the spending bill to receive funding:
   * $500,000 for Frostburg to begin construction of combined sewer separation project. 
   * $500,000 for Westernport to begin construction of combined sewer separation project. 
   * $350,000 for Cumberland to begin construction of combined sewer separation project. 
   * $150,000 for Funkstown to construct a wastewater treatment plant. 
   * $150,000 for Emmitsburg to replace the sewer main and prevent contamination of groundwater, rivers, streams and the Chesapeake Bay. 
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee and as the Senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes serves as Ranking Member on the Banking, Housing and Urban Development Committee and serves on the Budget Committee.
