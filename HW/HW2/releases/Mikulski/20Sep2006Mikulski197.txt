SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON FDA COMMISSIONER VOTE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, issued the following statement today as the Committee prepares to vote on the nomination of Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach to head the Food and Drug Administration (FDA):  
   "I am hoping that Dr. von Eschenbach will be the strong leader the FDA needs. We need his leadership to help Congress establish the legislative framework needed to reform FDA, ensure that the best possible science informs the decisions the FDA makes every day, and promote a culture of openness so that management listens to and addresses the concerns of FDA employees. 
   "The FDA, located in my home state of Maryland, has always been the gold standard in maintaining the safety and efficacy of our drugs and medical devices. Yet today, the agency is being politicized and degraded. The current administration has shown a persistent pattern of placing politics before science. Nowhere is this more evident than at the FDA. Dr. von Eschenbach needs to make significant changes to transform the agency to the gold standard it once was. 
   "I strongly believe the FDA needs a strong permanent director as soon as possible. I think this decision should come from the entire Senate, and will vote to move his nomination to the full Senate so we can move this process forward."
