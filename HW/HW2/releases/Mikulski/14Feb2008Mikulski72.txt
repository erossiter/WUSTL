SEN. MIKULSKI AWARDED MEDAL OF FREEDOM FROM POLISH AMERICAN CONGRESS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) was presented with the first annual Medal of Freedom from the Polish American Congress (PAC) today. The Senator was awarded for her extraordinary achievements and dedication to the betterment of the Polish American community in the United States and to the people of Poland.  
   "I am honored to accept an award from the Polish American Congress, who know the true meaning of freedom. The Polish people resisted the yoke of communist oppression for decades after World War II, and their heroic and peaceful resistance hastened the end of the Soviet Union and the emergence of one Europe, whole and free," said Senator Mikulski. "Today, the United States and Poland are close partners and good friends, with Polish troops fighting side-by-side with American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. I am proud to fight in the U.S. Senate for the issues that matter to the people of Poland and Polish Americans." 
   The Senator was presented with the award at her Capitol Hill office by 10 representatives of the PAC, including President Frank J. Spula, National Executive Director Les Kuczynski, President of the Metro Division Dr. Susanne Lotarski, and Director of the Washington Office Dr. Barbara Andersen.
