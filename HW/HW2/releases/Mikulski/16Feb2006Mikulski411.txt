SEN. MIKULSKI PRESENTS AMERICORPS AWARD TO WICOMICO COUNTY VOLUNTEER
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has presented Neale Smith with the AmeriCorps Exemplary Service Award for his dedicated service with Habitat for Humanity in Wicomico County, Md. Sen. Mikulski fought for the creation of AmeriCorps and is a long-time champion of the program.  
   "As a founder of the AmeriCorps program, I am so proud to present this award to Neale Smith. His extraordinary, dedicated and compassionate service to the community and country demonstrates the power of national service to make a difference in times of need," said Senator Mikulski. "Neale's service to Habitat for Humanity is an example of AmeriCorps' ability to help local communities meet local needs." 
   Presented at the annual Voices for AmeriCorps event earlier this month, the Exemplary Service Award is given to the most outstanding and heroic volunteers. Smith began his service with AmeriCorps when he moved back to his hometown of Salisbury to care for his ailing father. Currently a Habitat for Humanity Volunteer Coordinator, his interest in the program was sparked by his father's pending eviction from substandard housing. 
   AmeriCorps is a network of local, state and national service programs that engage volunteers in intensive community service. Founded in 1994, AmeriCorps has supported over 300,000 volunteers and continues to sponsor over 75,000 volunteers yearly. Fulltime volunteers who complete their service earn an AmeriCorps Education Award to pay for college, graduate school or to repay student loans. To date, 7,500 Maryland residents have earned education awards through AmeriCorps. 
   "I know how important AmeriCorps is to communities across the country and to the young people who want to serve," said Senator Mikulski. "AmeriCorps volunteers tackle the toughest problems in our communities. They are unflagging, unflinching, and determined to make a difference." 
   Until 2005, Senator Mikulski was the senior Democrat on the Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which funded AmeriCorps. The Subcommittee was dismantled in 2005 as part of Senate restructuring.
