SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON MARYLAND DROUGHT DESIGNATION
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today after Governor Martin O'Malley's announcement that the U.S. Department of Agriculture will declare a drought disaster for the entire state of Maryland. This comes after Senator Mikulski, as Chair of the Maryland Delegation, led her Team Maryland colleagues in calling on the department to make the declaration so farmers in all counties can receive assistance and financial relief from the summer's excessive heat and severely dry weather.  
   "This extremely dry, hot summer is leaving Maryland farmers stressed and strained. Their lives and livelihoods depend on their crops - and they are turning to us for help. I am pleased to see the federal government is showing concern for the devastating financial impact this drought is having on our farmers across Maryland. I will continue to fight to keep Maryland's agricultural communities and farmers a priority."
