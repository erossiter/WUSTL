SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON GAO REPORT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today on the release of the GAO Plan B Emergency Contraception report (found online at http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d06109.pdf): 
   "The GAO report released today confirmed what I have feared, that the FDA is being politicized. We have seen it in past decisions, and now we see it in the GAO's conclusion that the 2004 decision process for denying approval of the emergency contraceptive drug, Plan B, was 'unusual.' 
   "FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining drug safety and drug efficacy. Yet in recent months, I have seen people who have worked and devoted their lives at FDA - 10, 15 or more years - resigning because they see science being politicized. 
   "Regardless of how you feel about whether Plan B should be available in the community, the fact is, the FDA decision should be based on science, not cultural controversy. 
   "Women deserve better, and the FDA can do better."
