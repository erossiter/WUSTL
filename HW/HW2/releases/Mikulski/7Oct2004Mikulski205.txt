SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS COLLEAGUES TO PROVIDE TAX RELIEF FOR AMERICA'S MILITARY FAMILIES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today joined Arkansas Sens. Lincoln and Pryor to introduce legislation to rectify a glitch in the tax code that would raise taxes on the poorest of American soldiers serving in combat zones. Without this legislation, active duty military, reservists and National Guardsmen who have been deployed in combat would face higher taxes in 2006.  
   "Each and every member of our military is part of the American family," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "Their service is a tremendous sacrifice and great risk. Military families want to know what their government is doing to help them, and they don't deserve to have their hard-earned tax cuts taken away. That's why I'm fighting for much needed tax relief for our service men and women." 
   The Earned Income Tax Credit is designed to reward working families with children. The way the tax code is set up now, soldiers do not pay taxes on their combat pay. However, because their combat pay is not counted as income for tax purposes, many of the lowest paid soldiers do not "earn" enough to qualify for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and will end up paying more in taxes than military personnel serving state-side. The Working Families Tax Relief Act, signed into law by President Bush on October 4, fixed this problem, but only for 2004 and 2005, instead of the five-year extension provided for most other provisions. Without this legislation, this unfair situation will return after 2005. 
   Analysis by the GAO indicates that the amount of the tax benefit loss caused by this glitch varies from a maximum of $4500 for the enlisted and $3200 for officers. This legislation would put this money back in the pockets of our military personnel serving in combat, and extend this tax relief for ten years.
