SEN. SARBANES, SEN. MIKULSKI, REP. CARDIN ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS ON EASTERN SHORE
  At a press conference today at the Chesapeake Ecology Center, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Rep. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) announced that 10 organizations throughout the Eastern Shore were among 28 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants Initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 28 Maryland recipients this year. 
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."  
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own. The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watershed Grants Program is critical to the health of the Bay and its rivers and streams," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why Senator Sarbanes and I work hard to fund effective projects that save the Bay and help the Marylanders who depend on it for jobs and for recreation." 
   "The Chesapeake Watershed Grant program is a critical tool in preserving the Bay for future generations. Congress provides the funding, but it's the individuals and communities closest to the Bay doing the actual work of restoring and protecting the Bay and its many tributaries," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), a strong advocate of the program. 
   Those Eastern Shore projects receiving funding are: 
   * The Chesapeake Bay Environmental Center will use $50,000 to protect critical habitat in the Eastern Bay with the use of innovative techniques for shoreline protection and habitat creation. The project will stabilize 300 to 400 feet of shoreline and create ? to ? acres of low tidal marsh; 
   * The Chesapeake Fields Institute will use a $35,000 grant to continue their education efforts on the economic and environmental importance of agriculture, and also expand their environmental initiatives in the Delmarva farming community through workshops and school outdoor education programs; 
   * The Chesapeake Wildlife Heritage (CWH) will partner with private landowners and use a grant of $50,000 to restore and protect 800 acres of wetlands, woodlands, and grasslands on farms on the Eastern Shore. The CWH will educate landowners about conservation opportunities on their land to improve water quality ad wildlife habitat as well as offer landowners individualized management for their property and assistance in permanently protecting land through conservation easements; 
   * The City of Salisbury will use a $50,000 grant to stabilize and restore 2,100 linear feet of eroding shoreline on Beaver Dam Creek. The project will include grading and stabilization of the existing eroding bank, backfilled and planted with native vegetation. In addition, four fishing access areas will be established; 
   * The Delmarva Poultry Industry, Inc. will use a $49,000 grant to increase the number of vegetative environmental buffers surrounding poultry farms in Delaware, Eastern Shore Maryland, and Accomack County, Virginia. The project will implement an outreach program to promote the use buffers to the approximately 2,100 poultry farmers on the Delmarva Peninsula and will hire a coordinator to work with interested farmers. Once planted, the buffers will slow runoff and absorb nutrients from the farms before they enter the Chesapeake Bay tributaries; 
   * The Eastern Shore Land Conservancy will use a $35,000 grant to educate and engage up to 30 private landowners in permanent protection of up to 300 acres of land in Dorchester county using conservation easements and habitat restoration focusing on areas that threaten wildlife habitat and water quality. A field office will be established in Cambridge, Maryland providing greater awareness about conservation opportunities and strong local partners; 
   * The Maryland Eastern Shore RC & D Council, Inc. will use a grant totaling $50,000 to stabilize 600 linear feet of shoreline on Macum Creek. The project will include back-filling a stone sill with sand and planting; 
   * Environmental Concern, Inc. will use a grant totaling $40,490 to construct 11,200 square feet of new saltwater marsh along the westerly shoreline of San Domingo Creek Public Park. The project will create a 375 by 35 foot sill for protection of the marsh, emplace 1,450 tons of sand to fill the sill and vegetate the project area with 11,400 native plants; 
   * The Maryland Eastern Shore RC & D Council, Inc. will also use a second grant totaling $24,000 to conduct a physical assessment, engineering analysis and a restoration design with permits for Spaniard's Point living shoreline on the Corsica River. Upon implementation of the construction of the living shoreline, it is anticipated that the results will include approximately 600 linear feet of wave attenuating oyster bar, 2 acres of reef balls, 2 acres of tidal marsh and 1,500 linear feet of habitat enhanced shoreline; and 
   * The Center for Chesapeake Communities will use a $10,000 to develop a draft Habitat Conservation Plan allowing continued forest management operations on the Eastern Shore in concert with recovery efforts of the Delmarva Fox Squirrel. 
   In addition, two statewide projects are slated to receive funding: 
   * The Cacapon Institute will use a $35,000 grant to recruit science, social studies, and vocational-agricultural classes from high schools throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed to participate in an internet-based Stream Cleaner Environmental Forum on best management practices to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. The Forum will engage students in a simulated Tributary Team stakeholder process to explore the science and challenges of non-point source pollution reduction. Following the Forum, up to 10 classes will complete water quality restoration projects to serve as visible demonstrations of best management practices as well as living classrooms for future academic study; and 
   * The Izaak Walton League of America will use a $35,000 grant to hold workshops to train 60 certified volunteers to conduct water quality monitoring throughout Maryland. Monitoring will occur at 100 sites throughout Maryland and will be integrated into an annual water quality report. Data gathered during this study will be used to identify and prioritize watershed restoration projects that volunteers with Izaak Walton League can undertake in the future. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Grants Program, which was established by Senator Sarbanes, promotes community-based efforts to develop and implement conservation strategies to protect and restore the diverse natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. The program provides grants to local governments and community organizations working to improve the condition of their local watersheds while building citizen-based resource stewardship. This year more than $2.6 million is being awarded for 68 restoration projects throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed.
