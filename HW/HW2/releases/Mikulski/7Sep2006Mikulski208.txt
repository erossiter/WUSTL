SENATE APPROVES $107 MILLION FOR DC AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced the full Senate has approved the 2007 Department of Defense spending bill, which includes more than $107 million for defense projects in the Washington, D.C., metro area. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $107 million in funding for defense projects in the Washington, D.C., metro area, including: 
   * $85.6 million for the Movement Tracking System (MTS), which provides Army commanders with the capability to communicate with and track the locations of vehicles in the field. 
   * $7 million for the Naval Ship Hydrodynamic Facilities at Carderock to replace and improve ship testing facilities. 
   * $3.5 million for USUHS Graduate School of Nursing to support the newly designed Doctoral and Clinical Nursing Specialist programs. 
   * $3 million to complete the development of a hybrid electric power train, which will allow the Air Force to reduce logistic requirements and mitigate environmental impact. 
   * $2.5 million for the Army Research Laboratory and University of Maryland PEM Fuel Cell Tactical Generators Initiative to develop lighter and more fuel efficient generators. 
   * $2 million to develop the Autonomous Sustainment Cargo Container (ASCC) Delivery System, which allows at-sea off-loading of cargo onto self-propelled containers to get supplies into ports that are over crowded or deemed not secure. 
   * $2 million to integrate Army radio systems and mount communications systems on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to reduce vulnerability in the field and increase the range of radio communications. 
   * $1.5 million for the Fort Detrick Technology Transfer Initiative, an ongoing program that provides grants to small businesses to develop new technologies for military use. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
