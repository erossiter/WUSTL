SEN. MIKULSKI APPLAUDS MARYLAND ANTI-GANG GRANT ANNOUNCEMENTS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) applauded U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein's grant announcements - scheduled for 2 p.m. this afternoon - that are a part of the $2 million she secured for a statewide anti-gang initiative. The grants are being distributed to organizations and programs addressing Maryland's gang issues. Sen. Mikulski, the incoming Chairman of the Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, fought for the funding as part of the 2006 CJS spending bill.  
   "This statewide anti-gang initiative addresses a growing gang crisis in our neighborhoods that is destroying lives and destroying communities," said Senator Mikulski. "We need to take a comprehensive look at the gang problem that focuses on prevention, intervention and enforcement." 
   The federal funding supports the U.S. Attorney's Office in its coordination of local, state and federal law enforcement, and will pay for prosecutorial and anti-gang programs in the Baltimore metro area and throughout Maryland. This initiative will create a more efficient and effective approach to help communities combat gang activity. 
   In addition to coordinating gang intervention and prevention efforts, the funding has also allowed the U.S. Attorney's Office to increase the prosecution of gangs and gang-related crime, support existing programs with proven track records in intervention and prevention efforts, and solicit grant proposals to solve gang-related problems that are not currently being addressed. 
   "No one can do it alone, that's why I fought in the Senate to create a federal partnership," said Senator Mikulski. "We need to continue our work to protect neighborhoods and families - that means safer streets and safer communities. I am proud to have fought for this federal investment and will continue to do all I can to make our communities safer."
