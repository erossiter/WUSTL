SEN. MIKULSKI: FEDERAL BUDGET MUST STAND UP FOR KIDS, NOT MILLIONAIRES
  As the Senate considers the fiscal year 2009 budget resolution, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has joined Senator Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) in introducing an amendment to increase the federal investment in our children by eliminating President Bush's top income tax rate cut for people earning more than $1 million. 
   "President Bush has turned his back on America's children. This amendment helps the federal government fulfill its responsibilities to America's families and America's kids - not America's wealthiest citizens," said Senator Mikulski, a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee. "I will continue to fight for a budget that stands up for our children and the day-to-day needs of our nation's families."
   The amendment would restore the top income tax bracket to its 2000 level, at 39.6 percent for households earning more than $1 million per year. According to the Joint Tax Committee, this will increase revenue by $32.5 billion over the next three years. The amendment directs this revenue to be used to address the most urgent unmet needs of our nation's children, as well as job creation and deficit reduction.
   Instead of giving $32.5 billion in tax breaks to millionaires and billionaires, the amendment would invest the money in the following areas over the next three years:
   * $10 billion for the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) to help 7 million children with disabilities and allow states to reduce property taxes.
   * $5 billion for Head Start programs, which provide child development services to children from low-income families, with a special focus on pre-school reading and math skills.
   * $4 billion for Child Care Development Block Grants. Only about one in seven eligible children receive federal child care due to a lack of funding.
   * $4 billion for the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP), which helps families with children, seniors, and people with disabilities stay warm in the winter, and has been cut by 34.5 percent since 2002.
   * $3 billion for school construction to repair our crumbling schools and create thousands of jobs for painters, carpenters, electricians and construction workers.
   * $3 billion for food stamps to feed hungry children and adults.
   * $3 billion to reduce the deficit.
