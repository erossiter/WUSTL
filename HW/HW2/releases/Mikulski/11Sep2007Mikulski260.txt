SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $13 MILLION FOR SOUTHERN MARYLAND DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate version of the Department of Defense 2008 spending bill includes $61.5 million for defense projects in Maryland, including $13 million for defense projects in Southern Maryland. The legislation, which passed the subcommittee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops with the equipment they need on the battlefield, the benefits and services they deserve when they return home, and support for their families on the home front. We know how critical these funds are for our troops to fulfill their mission and return home safely," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for our troops." 
   The $13 million for Southern Maryland defense projects includes: 
   * $5 million for High Energy Conventional Energetics to target asymmetrical threats, such as hardened Weapons of Mass Destruction sites. This program is managed by the Indian Head Division, Naval Surface Warfare Center in Charles County. 
   * $5 million to complete the fiber optic data link between Patuxent River Naval Air Station and Wallops Flight Facility to support advanced Navy aircraft testing between the Navy and NASA testing ranges and facilities. 
   * $3 million for All Weather Sense and Avoid techonology for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) - radar technology that will allow UAVs to detect and avoid possible collision. 
   A full Appropriations Committee vote is expected tomorrow morning on the spending bill. The bill will then move to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
