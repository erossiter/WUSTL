SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LONDON BOMBINGS
  "Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims and their families today on this day of great tragedy in London.  
 When the United States was attacked on September 11, 2001, the government and people of the United Kingdom were among the first to offer their support. Since that time, we have had no better friend in the war against terrorism. Today we respond not only with shock and grief, but with unity, resolve and commitment. 
   "The people of America stand with the people of Great Britain - on this day of great mourning and on all of the days to come. We join together to condemn these barbaric attacks, to track down the terrorists and to work to prevent future attacks."
