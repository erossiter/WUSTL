SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON GEN. HAYDEN NOMINATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today on the nomination of Air Force Gen. Michael Hayden as CIA director:  
   "The CIA is in need of strong and effective leadership as it works to regain its credibility and reinvigorate its workforce. We have some tough issues to resolve as we reform intelligence. 
   "I have worked closely with Gen. Hayden since he headed the National Security Agency (NSA) in 1999 and have enormous respect for him. Gen. Hayden has held two of the most challenging and sensitive positions in the U.S. Intelligence Community: Director of the NSA and Deputy Director of National Intelligence. He is competent, candid and has a spirit of reform. 
   "Yet I, and several of my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee, have some serious concerns about an active duty military officer leading the CIA. By tradition, the CIA has always been led by a civilian. I believe his status will need to be seriously considered during his confirmation hearings. I am also concerned about the issue of the warrantless surveillance program, which needs to be addressed. I look forward to reviewing these matters during his upcoming confirmation hearings."
