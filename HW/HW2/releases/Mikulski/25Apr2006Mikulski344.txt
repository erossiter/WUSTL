SEN. MIKULSKI WELCOMES NOAA VESSEL TO BALTIMORE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today welcomed the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) vessel Thomas Jefferson, which is expected to dock in Baltimore later this week. The ship comes to port as part of the ongoing festivities surrounding the worldwide 2006 Volvo Ocean Race.  
   "I am so proud to welcome the Thomas Jefferson to the Port of Baltimore," said Senator Mikulski. "This ship represents the best of NOAA's cutting edge abilities to provide navigation services and help vessels travel our oceans." 
   As the senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NOAA, Senator Mikulski has fought for a federal investment in NOAA vessel operations and maintenance, and NOAA Corps to man the vessels. She has also helped secure funding to continue vessel modernization. 
   The NOAA vessel Thomas Jefferson is part of a greater effort to assist Volvo Ocean Race organizers and participants during the American leg of the race. NOAA ships and satellites are providing a variety of safe navigation services, including real-time sea surface current monitoring, nautical charts and wave height, and direction. NOAA will also monitor endangered North Atlantic right whale sightings in an effort to help race participants avoid whale strikes. As part of the race, NOAA will be a prominent exhibitor at waterfront festivals in Baltimore and Annapolis from April 27 to May 7, 2006. 
   The Volvo Ocean Race is an eight-month sailing race. During the course of the race, participants travel across four oceans and cover 32,500 nautical miles with port stops in nine countries.
