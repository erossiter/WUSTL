BIG BROTHERS BIG SISTERS HONOR SEN. MIKULSKI FOR COMMITMENT TO AMERICA'S YOUTH
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has been honored for her strong support of mentoring programs with a 2005 National Leadership Award from the Big Brothers Big Sisters (BBBS) of Central Maryland.  
   "Mentoring programs give our young people positive alternatives to drugs and violence, and are important resources for youth who have nowhere else to turn. They provide excellent social, cultural and educational opportunities to at-risk youth in our communities," said Senator Mikulski. "I am honored and proud to accept this award." 
   The organization recognized Senator Mikulski as one of its 2005 Congressional honorees. As the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations Subcommittee, Senator Mikulski has fought to secure more than $14 million for BBBS mentoring programs. 
   Maryland BBBS Chair Robin Tomechko, National BBBS Director of Public Policy Michael Hackman and Beacon Group Vice President Lisa Steward presented Senator Mikulski with the award. Download a photo at: www.mikulski.senate.gov/bigbrothersbigsistersphoto.htm. 
   "Your commitment to bringing attention and resources to the needs of disadvantaged youth is an inspiration to everyone who works in the field of positive youth development," said the BBBS representatives. 
   There are six BBBS agencies serving children in Maryland. Across the state collectively, the organization serves about 4,000 at-risk youth and their families. BBBS of Central Maryland is the largest program, serving about 2,000 youth, including about 1,000 in Baltimore City. 
   BBBS of America is the oldest and largest youth mentoring program in the country. They serve more than 225,000 children, ages five through 18, in 5,000 communities across all 50 states.
