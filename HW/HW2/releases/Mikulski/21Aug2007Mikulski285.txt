SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RELEASE OF IMPRISONED SCHOLAR IN IRAN
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today released the following statement after news reports that the Iranian government has released Montgomery County resident and American scholar Dr. Haleh Esfandiari on bail:  
   "I join Dr. Esfandiari's friends and family in relief and joy at today's news that, after more than 100 days of unjust imprisonment, she has been released by the Iranian government. This is an important first step, but I will not rest until Dr. Esfandiari is allowed to return to her family in Maryland. 
   "I remain concerned about the other Iranian-Americans who are being detained: Kian Tajbakhsh, Parnaz Azima, and Ali Shakeri. I hope this decision by the Iranian government to release Dr. Esfandiari is a sign of their impending releases as well." 
   Dr. Esfandiari, the Director of Middle East programs at the Woodrow Wilson International Center, has been jailed by the Iranian government since May 8, after more than four months of virtual house arrest following a visit to her ailing 93-year-old mother.
