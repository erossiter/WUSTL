SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON FRUG SAFETY BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today after the release of three articles by the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) that urge lawmakers to take immediate action to improve drug safety standards at the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Sen. Mikulski is a member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, which will consider the Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) next week: "This is our moment. Congress now has a unique opportunity to change the way we monitor the safety of drugs for all Americans with the reauthorization of PDUFA.  
   "This is not about ideology. This is about protecting the American people. We must heed the call of our nation's scientific community - the New England Journal of Medicine, the Institute of Medicine, and the hardworking scientists at the FDA in my home state of Maryland. 
   "FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining drug safety and drug efficacy. I have fought for years for the right facilities and the right resources for FDA. Now, I will continue to fight for the strictest standards to protect our drug supply. I will work closely with Senators Ted Kennedy [D-Mass], Mike Enzi [R-Wyo.] and my colleagues on the HELP Committee to send the strongest bill to the Senate floor."
