SENATE PASSES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES FUNDING FOR BALTIMORE METRO AREA ARMED FORCES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski and Sen. Paul Sarbanes (both D-MD) announced today that the Senate has passed the 2006 Defense Appropriations bill, which includes an additional $125 million for Maryland defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $35 million in additional funding for the Baltimore metro area defense projects, including: 
   * $6.7 million for avionics kits and engines for Pioneer Unmanned Aerial Aircrafts to bring them up to U.S. Marine Corps standards. 
   * $6 million for Project ANCILE, which will research, design, build, demonstrate, test and evaluate a suite of building protection systems that are capable of protecting critical U.S. government buildings against the already existing and evolving threats. 
   * $4.7 million for Alternative Delivery Methods for Recombinant Protein Vaccines, to develop technologies that administer vaccines to the nose and the skin - the areas of the body that play a prominent roll in combating infectious diseases. 
   * $4.5 million to fully realize the potential of Unmanned Sea Surface Vehicles (USSVs) for the U.S. Navy. 
   * $4 million for the Mark 41 Vertical Launch System, which is a critical component of the U.S. Navy's ship-board arsenal. 
   * $3.6 million for a Movement Tracking System for real-time tracking of multiple vehicles. 
   * $3 million for Laser Marksmanship Training Program, which will train Air Force Military Police using the most realistic, cutting-edge technology available. 
   * $2.5 million for Marine Advanced Combat Suit (MACS), an effort to reduce load, manage complexity and increase fighting effectiveness of Marine apparel. 
   * $2 million for the Lightweight Machine Gun and Ammunition program (LMGA), which will work to reduce the weight of the weapon and ammunition. 
   * $1 million for Naval Marine PDI Division's Fuel and Engine Maintenance Savings System (FEMSS), which will help save fuel and increase speed of Navy ships. 
   * The Senators also fought to preserve full funding for vital weapons programs at major Maryland employer Northrop Grumman Corporation. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Defense Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the Subcommittee on Defense. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
