SEN. MIKULSKI'S FREEDOM TO ACHIEVE INITIATIVE IS REALIZED IN SENATE'S HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today urged her Senate colleagues to approve higher education legislation that includes an additional $17.3 billion for financial aid that goes directly to students, and makes significant steps towards improving access to higher education for students nationwide. Senator Mikulski is expected to go to the Senate floor this afternoon to deliver a floor speech on the Higher Education Reconciliation Act, with a vote expected later today.  
   "College is part of the American Dream, it shouldn't be part of the American financial nightmare. Families want help and they want to know what the United States Senate is doing to help them," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I'm proud this legislation offers good news for students who want access to an education and the freedom to achieve the American dream." 
   Senator Mikulski's Freedom to Achieve initiative is aimed at making sure all students have access to higher education so that they can follow the American dream. She has been a consistent fighter in the Senate effort to make college more affordable and providing students with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive. 
   The Higher Education Reconciliation Act addresses several of Senator Mikulski's priorities: 
   * Increases Pell Grants: increases Pell Grants from $4,310 to $5,400 by 2011. It also establishes automatic maximum Pell Grants for students whose family income is $30,000 or less. 
   * Money for students, not banks: increases student aid by $17.3 billion and cuts back on student loan-related government subsidies to banks. 
   * Loan forgiveness: forgives student loans for borrowers who have worked 10 years in public service, and provides income protection for borrowers who make less than $65,000 per year. 
   * Loan deferment for active military: expands loan deferment for active duty military, including the National Guard, while they serve during a war or military operation.
