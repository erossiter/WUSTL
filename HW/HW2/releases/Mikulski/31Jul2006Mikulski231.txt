SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONSE TO FDA DECISION ON PLAN B
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, released the following statement after today's announcement by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that it will "proceed to work" to resolve outstanding issues related to the over-the-counter administration of emergency contraception, known as Plan B:  
   "Today's announcement by the FDA isn't a decision. It is a ploy, timed to affect FDA Acting Commissioner Dr. Andrew von Eschenbach's nomination hearing tomorrow morning before the HELP Committee. 
   "The Bush Administration has shown a pattern of politicizing science. Today is another effort to play politics with our nation's health. The FDA's decision is designed to influence President Bush's nomination, not an important policy issue. 
   "I will expect clarification from Acting Commissioner von Eschenbach on what this decision means for the American public."
