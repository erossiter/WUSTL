SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON MIERS NOMINATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement today following President Bush's nomination of White House Counsel Harriett Miers to the United States Supreme Court:  
   "Today, the President has nominated Harriett Miers to be an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. 
   "The President has the right to make nominations to the Supreme Court. Our Constitution is clear - it demands that the Senate not be a rubber stamp on judicial nominees. I believe that we cannot give our consent without a thorough examination of the nominee. 
   "When I evaluate nominees, I base my consideration on three criteria: judicial competence, personal and professional integrity, and a commitment to core constitutional principles, the Bill of Rights and the implicit right to privacy. 
   "The Senate should be allowed due time to thoroughly examine the qualifications and record of Ms. Miers for this powerful position on the highest court in our land. Justice O'Connor has said that she will stay on the Court until her replacement is confirmed. We owe it to the American people to take our time to be sure the nominee will uphold their most basic and fundamental rights. The public demands this from the process, and deserve no less. 
   "I look forward to thoroughly examining Ms. Miers' qualifications and record by reviewing the background reports, the American Bar Association evaluation, her Judiciary Committee testimony, and her writings before I will make my determination."
