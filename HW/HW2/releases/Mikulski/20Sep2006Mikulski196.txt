SEN. MIKULSKI CONGRATULATES MARYLAND NATIONAL GUARD ON NEW WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION CIVIL SUPPORT TEAM
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today congratulated the Maryland National Guard on the certification of its Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team (WMD-CST), which is stationed at Fort Meade. The team will help keep Marylanders safe in the event of chemical, biological or radiological events.  
   "As a nation fighting a war on terrorism, we need to be safer, stronger and smarter so that we are able to better respond to acts of terrorism," said Senator Mikulski. "As a U.S. Senator and a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I meet with Officers in the Guard and listen to what they need from Congress to do this. I have heard what they said and fought for federal funding for the Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Team." 
   Senator Mikulski secured authorization for the team in the 2004 Department of Defense spending bill. The team is now fully ready to assist civil authorities in responding to a domestic weapon of mass destruction incident, and possesses the skills, training and equipment to be proficient in all mission requirements. 
   "I am so proud of the Maryland National Guard. They are ordinary men and women who are called upon to do extraordinary things - leaving their civilian jobs and lives to help others at home and abroad so that we can live in peace and in freedom," Senator Mikulski continued. "They are 'civilians in peace, Soldiers at war' - and I salute and thank them for all the sacrifices they make to serve our country. I vow to honor all that they do for us by continuing to fight for their needs - not just with words, but with deeds." 
   Congress has authorized a total of 55 WMD-CSTs nationwide - enough to field at least one team in every state, territory and the District of Columbia. Maryland is one of 12 teams that were authorized in fiscal year 2004.
