SEN. MIKULSKI HELPS BRING REVITALIZATION TO NORTHEAST BALTIMORE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski today announced a federal investment of $297,600 for St.  
 Ambrose Housing Aid Center to buy foreclosed houses, renovate and sell them to people who want to live in the Loch Raven Boulevard corridor of Northeast Baltimore. This is a proven way to revitalize communities that have been hurt by foreclosures, while keeping flippers and predatory lenders out of the neighborhoods. 
   "I fought for a federal investment to get houses into the hands of home owners, not flippers or investors, and empower communities hard hit by foreclosures," said Senator Mikulski. "I am so proud to be St. Ambrose's partner in rebuilding neighborhoods, one house and one family at a time." 
   Senator Mikulski has been a champion against the predatory lending and flipping that has ravaged some Baltimore neighborhoods. In 2000, she called for the formation of the Baltimore City Flipping and Predatory Lending Task Force to help find solutions to the flipping problem in the City and urged federal law enforcement agencies to pursue investigations and prosecutions of flippers. Senator Mikulski also worked to help victims of flipping, including securing federal funding to set up a clearinghouse so victims could report the incident and get the state and federal help they needed. 
   Senator Mikulski partnered with St. Ambrose in 2004 to have neighborhoods in Northeast Baltimore designated as an Asset Control Area. This is a HUD program that lets cities and non-profits buy foreclosed properties from the government at a deeply discounted rate. Property can be rehabbed and then sold to people who want to live in the community. 
   Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat on the subcommittee that funds the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
