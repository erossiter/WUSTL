SEN. MIKULSKI FIGHTS FOR RIGHTS OF STUDENT BORROWERS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Sen. Hilary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) to introduce the Student Borrower Bill of Rights Act of 2007 to guarantee student borrowers with basic rights, including the right to timely loan information and the right to make fair and reasonable loan payments. Sen. Mikulski is a senior member of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.  
   "College tuition is on the rise across America. Our students are graduating with so much debt it's like their first mortgage," said Senator Mikulski. "College is part of the American Dream, it shouldn't be part of the American financial nightmare." 
   Two in three students graduating from four-year colleges and universities have student loans. Today, the average borrower graduating from a public four-year institution owes $15,500, and one in ten owes $33,000 or more. 
   This bill provides for greater transparency in student borrowing and helps borrowers meet their obligations by establishing five basic rights: 
   * A right to shop in a free marketplace 
   * A right to timely information about loans
   * A right to make affordable loan payments
   * A right for interest rates and fees to be reasonable, and 
   * A right to not be exploited. 
   Student borrowers must take responsibility for paying back the money they borrowed, but they must also be treated fairly in repayment. Otherwise, the burden of student loan debt can force people to delay the purchase of a home, avoid important but low-paying professions - such as public health workers, social workers and teachers - prevent borrowers from pursuing a higher degree, or even prevent successful high school students from going to college. 
   "American families are stressed and stretched. Students are looking for help," said Senator Mikulski. "We must make access to higher education a priority for everyone."
