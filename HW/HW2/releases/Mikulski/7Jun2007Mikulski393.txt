SEN. MIKULSKI MEETS WITH HUSBAND OF IMPRISONED IRANIAN-AMERICAN SCHOLAR
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today met with Dr. Shaul Bakhash, husband of imprisoned Montgomery County resident and American scholar Dr. Haleh Esfandiari, and Dr. Michael Van Dusen, Deputy Director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center. Dr. Esfandiari, the Director of Middle East programs at the Wilson Center, has been jailed by the Iranian government since May 8 after more than four months of virtual house arrest following a visit to her ailing 93-year-old mother.  
   "I am gravely concerned, as are Dr. Bakhash and his family, over this tragedy. We are all very worried about Dr. Esfandiari's health and well-being - she has been denied legal representation, access to international humanitarian groups, and visits by her sick mother," Senator Mikulski. "I stand in solidarity with Dr. Esfandiari's family, and will do everything in my power to secure her immediate release and safe return home." 
   Senator Mikulski and Senator Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) introduced a resolution last month calling on the Iranian government to drop all charges against Dr. Esfandiari and immediately release her from prison. The resolution was unanimously approved on May 24.
