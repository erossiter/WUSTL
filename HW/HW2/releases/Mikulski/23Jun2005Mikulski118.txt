SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONDS TO BUSH ON SOCIAL SECURITY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) released the following statement in response to President Bush's appearance this morning at Montgomery Blair High School in Silver Spring, MD:  
   "The President came to Maryland today in a last ditch effort to save his misguided plan to privatize Social Security. I have heard from Marylanders - and I know that they see the President's visit for what it is - scare tactics and political rhetoric. 
   "I am listening to Marylanders and Democrats are listening to Americans. Americans are clear: they do not want the guaranteed benefit of Social Security turned into a guaranteed gamble. The President is not listening and that's why he won't take private accounts off the table. Democrats stand united to work for a solvent and strong future for Social Security. 
   "I am committed to working for a guaranteed, lifetime, inflation-proof benefit. The President's proposed "fix" will make things worse for those young people he spoke to this morning. I believe that American's security should never have to depend on the bear of the market or the bull of political promises. I am going to fight to keep the security in Social Security."
