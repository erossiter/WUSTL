SEN. MIKULSKI HOLDS SOCIAL SECURITY DISCUSSION WITH YOUNG PEOPLE AT BALTIMORE NEIGHBORHOOD PIZZA PARLOR
  Sen. Barbara Mikulski (D-MD) today met with a group of young professionals and students at Matthews Pizza in Highlandtown to talk about Social Security and why the Bush Privatization plan is a bad deal for Americans.  
   "I am absolutely, emphatically, irrevocably opposed to privatization of Social Security," said Senator Mikulski. "I am going to fight to keep 'security' in Social Security, because Americans deserve a guaranteed benefit, not a guaranteed gamble. When you get old or when you get sick, when your spouse passes away, when a parent dies, there are not many things you can count on. You should be able to count on Social Security." 
   Participants at Wednesday's event were able to enter their information into a "Social Security Calculator" to see how much money they could lose over their lifetime under the Bush privatization plan. For example, a person born in 1980 with an average lifetime income of $45,000 will lose approximately $8,048 per year under the Bush plan. The calculator can also be found on Senator Mikulski's website: http://www.mikulski.senate.gov 
   Senator Mikulski made clear that Social Security is an issue relevant to young people, and that privatization could have particularly detrimental affects on young professionals. Senator Mikulski outlined the myths and realities of the current Social Security debate, emphasizing that the system is not in crisis. The participants then had the opportunity to ask Senator Mikulski questions. 
   Senator Mikulski has been a leader in the U.S. Senate in the fight against the privatization of Social Security, uniting her Democratic women Senate colleagues to highlight the negative impact President Bush's Social Security privatization plan will have on America - especially women.
