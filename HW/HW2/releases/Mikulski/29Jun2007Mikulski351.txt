SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $1.5 MILLION FOR D.C. AREA, ST. MARY'S COUNTY WATERWAYS IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Energy and Water Development 2008 spending bill, which passed the full committee, provides more than $70 million for U.S. Army Corps of Engineers projects in Maryland and $1.5 million for waterway improvements in the Washington metropolitan area and St. Mary's County.  
   "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and is Maryland's greatest natural resource. This is a federal investment in cleaning up the Bay and the rivers in its watershed," said Senator Mikulski. "I am proud to work to put money in the federal checkbook that helps clean up our rivers and takes care of our environment." 
   The spending bill includes: 
   * $500,000 to develop an Anacostia watershed restoration plan to reduce pollutant loads, increase wetlands, and improve recreational use of urban fisheries. The Anacostia River is one of the most degraded urban rivers in the nation and a major area of concern for toxics in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. 
   * $308,000 for improvements to the River Fringe wetlands and monitoring of completed restoration projects in the Anacostia River watershed. 
   * $300,000 for the Great Seneca Creek and Muddy Branch tributaries in Montgomery County. The funding is for completing an inventory of storm water management and stream restoration projects along these two adjacent tributaries that lead to the Potomac River. 
   * $200,000 for a comprehensive plan for the Middle Potomac River watershed that will assist Maryland, Virginia, Pennsylvania and West Virginia in implementing nutrient reduction tributary strategies. 
   * $175,000 to complete the St. Mary's River Study, which is looking at water resource problems in this sub-watershed in the Lower Potomac River Basin in St. Mary's County and identifying restoration projects. The St. Mary's River is a highly valued ecosystem that is stressed by increasing population and development. This is causing erosion, flooding, loss of fish and wildlife habitat, and degrading the water quality. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
