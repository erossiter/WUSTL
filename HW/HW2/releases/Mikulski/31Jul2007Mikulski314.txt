SENS. MIKULSKI, CLINTON, OTHERS INTRODUCE BIPARTISAN BILL TO EXTEND FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR FAMILIES OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS
  Senators Barbara Mikulski (D-MD), Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-NY), Elizabeth Dole (R-NC), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), Edward Kennedy (D-MA) and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) today introduced legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for up to six months for spouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat. The bipartisan bill enacts a key recommendation of the Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. 
   "It is our responsibility to make sure our wounded soldiers receive the care and support they need. It is also our duty to recognize and help address the extraordinary challenges their loved ones will face as they struggle to serve as their caregivers. This is the right thing to do for our military families," said Senator Clinton.  
   "Our men and women in uniform risk their lives to defend our freedoms and keep our nation safe," said Senator Dole. "When service members are injured while answering the call of duty, they deserve to have their loved ones' comfort and support. This bill will ensure that spouses, parents, sons and daughters of wounded soldiers can take time to care for them without fear of losing their jobs and livelihoods. This is the right thing to do for our military families." 
   "Our military men and women make great sacrifices and honor their country by volunteering to serve. Their families share the burden of this war. We must recognize and honor their service and sacrifice, not just with words, but with deeds," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I'm fighting for the spouses and children of our true American heroes to have extended leave from their jobs when their loved ones are injured fighting a war for America, because service members and their families have enough to worry about." 
   "This bill is an opportunity for us to help the families of our wounded soldiers," said Senator Graham. "Military families are the unsung heroes of this war. It's only fitting we provide them with the help and assistance they need. I'm proud to be part of this effort." 
   "The Military Family and Medical Leave Act will give substantial additional leave for family members to care for wounded servicemen and women. Such leave was one of then Walter Reed Commission's key recommendations, and prompt action is necessary, since more and more of our troops are being wounded every day in Iraq and Afghanistan. So far, over 27,000 have been wounded in Iraq alone. These wounded warriors have made enormous sacrifices for our country. Their family members bring support, comfort, and assistance that no one else can and they deserve additional time off from their jobs in order to provide it. I'd strongly support making this leave paid leave," Senator Kennedy said. 
   "A family should never be forced to choose between caring for a loved one and keeping a job. Many military families are already financially strapped because of this war. This bill would ensure that our soldiers receive the care and support that only a family can provide," said Senator Brown, a member of the Veterans Affairs Committee. 
   In its review, the Commission found that 33 percent of active duty, 22 percent of reserve component, and 37 percent of retired/separated service members report that a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they were in the hospital. In addition, 21 percent of active duty, 15 percent of reserve component, and 24 percent of retired/separated service members say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as their caregiver. To address this situation and help support these caregivers, the Commission recommended strengthening family support programs by extending the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for up to six months for spouses and parents of seriously injured soldiers. 
   The Military Family and Medical Leave Act will enact this recommendation. The bill will amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow up to six months leave within a single year for a family member of a service member who has a combat-related injury and meets the eligibility requirements in the law. 
   The Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors was established in March 2007 with the specific goals of conducting a comprehensive review of services the government currently provides to our wounded warriors and delivering recommendations to the President, Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs.
