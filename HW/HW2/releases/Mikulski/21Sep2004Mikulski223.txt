KEY COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS IN BALTIMORE REGION SLATED TO RECEIVE FUNDING IN VETERANS/HOUSING SPENDING BILL
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) announced that seven Baltimore development projects are one step closer to receiving federal funding with today's Appropriations Committee passage of the FY05 Veterans, Housing and Independent Agencies Appropriations bill. Sen. Mikulski is the Senior Democrat on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee.  
   This year's VA-HUD Appropriations bill also includes an additional $1.2 billion above the President's request for VA medical care in this year's FY05 spending bill. The additional funding will ensure the VA does not charge Priority 7 and Priority 8 veterans an annual $250 enrollment fee. The additional funding will also keep Priority 7 and 8 veterans' prescription drug co-payments to $7, instead of the $15 proposed by the Administration. The Senators also rejected limiting VA nursing homes to Priority 1 veterans. 
   "As Ranking Member on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, I put money in the federal checkbook to create jobs, build communities and protect the environment," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I am so proud that this means $2,650,000 for the Baltimore Region this year to build and enhance community centers, rehabilitate housing and revitalize neighborhoods, and provide job training. I will keep standing up in the U.S. Senate for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation." 
   "Having my colleague, Senator Mikulski, at the helm of this Appropriations Subcommittee is critically important as we work to improve the lives and the day-to-day needs of people all across the State of Maryland," said Sarbanes. "As a result of her diligent efforts, we will see enhanced care for our veterans; water infrastructure upgrades to help clean-up the Chesapeake Bay; and economic development projects throughout the State to improve our local communities and help create jobs." 
   ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVE (EDI) PROGRAM 
   EDI's, funded in the VA-HUD legislation, are granted on a competitive basis and must meet criteria set by Senator Mikulski and the Subcommittee Chairman, Senator Kit Bond (R-MO). Each project must create jobs or meet a compelling human need, benefit low- or moderate-income neighborhoods, eliminate physical or economic distress, and have a funding match from a non-federal source. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes secured federal funding for the following six Baltimore area projects through the EDI program: 
   * $400,000 to build Randallstown Community Center. This community center, to be built adjacent to the Liberty Court and Liberty Plaza shopping centers, will offer recreational activities and personal development opportunities to residents of the Randallstown area. The center will also include employee training programs from Baltimore County's Office of Employment and Training (OET) to enhance the employability of youths and young adults between the ages of 16 and 24. 
   * $400,000 to improve the Dundalk Community Center. These funds will help renovate the existing community center, including the spaces for child and youth activities and a skills development center. The Dundalk Community Center will provide daytime activities for seniors, after-school activities for school-age children, evening activities for adults, and convenient access to computers and the internet for job search and skills training. 
   * $300,000 for the Northeast Asset Control Area Project to create a revolving loan fund to buy and rehabilitate vacant properties in Northeast Baltimore. This project is a coordinated effort between the St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center and the Northeast Community Organization to eliminate vacant, dilapidated, and dangerous houses by converting these unoccupied properties into upgraded houses with live-in homeowners. 
   * $250,000 for Associated Catholic Charities to build a new facility and renovate an existing facility for Our Daily Bread, Christopher Place Employment Academy and My Sister's Place Women's Center. Our Daily Bread serves nearly 250,000 meals annually to the poor and homeless. Christopher Place Employment Academy assists men moving from homelessness, unemployment and addiction to full-time employment, self-sufficiency and recovery. Currently only 32 men may enter the program per six-month session; relocating will increase that number to 90 men per year. My Sister's Place Women's Center supplies safe haven to homeless women and their children. New facilities will significantly increase the program's space, resources and accessibility. 
   * $1,000,000 for East Baltimore Development Inc., to support ongoing revitalization within Middle East Baltimore City. This project will help transform this neighborhood into a thriving mixed-income, mixed-use community that will include a state of the art Life Sciences and Technology Park, new and renovated housing, neighborhood retail, streetscape improvements, and a pre-K to 8th grade school. 
   * $300,000 for the City of Baltimore to relocate the City's central automotive repair facility ("Central Garage.") This relocation will enable the National Aquarium in Baltimore to construct a world class animal care and conservation facility on a 20-acre brownfields site in the Middle Branch of the Patapsco River. 
   The VA-HUD bill also includes federal funding for the "State and Tribal Assistance Grants" (STAG) for special needs water and wastewater infrastructure projects. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes secured federal funding through STAG grants 
  for the following programs in the Baltimore Region: 
   * $500,000 for Elkton wastewater infrastructure improvements to reduce the amount of nutrients entering the Chesapeake Bay. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the floor of the Senate for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled. Following the Senate vote, the House and Senate will meet in conference committee to work out the differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The conference report will then be sent back to the floor of both Chambers of Congress for a vote. Once passed by the House and Senate, the VA-HUD Appropriations bill will be sent to the President for his signature. 
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee and serves as Ranking Member on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. Senator Sarbanes serves as Ranking Member on the Banking, Housing and Urban Development Committee and serves on the Budget Committee.
