SENS. MIKULSKI, CLINTON ANNOUNCE BILL TO EXTEND FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE FOR FAMILIES OF WOUNDED SOLDIERS
  Senators Barbara Mikulski and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that they are introducing legislation to extend the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for up to six months for spouses and parents of soldiers who have been injured in combat. The Clinton-Mikulski bill addresses a key recommendation of the Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors. 
   "The families of our servicemen and women face extraordinary demands as they struggle to care for loved ones injured in service to our nation. It is clear that they are not receiving the support they need and this is a step we can make immediately that will make a real difference. Our men and women in uniform have made tremendous sacrifices on our behalf and we have a responsibility to do everything we can to make sure they have the care and support they need," said Senator Clinton.  
   "Our military men and women make great sacrifices and honor their country by volunteering to serve. Their families share the burden of this war. We must recognize and honor their service and sacrifice, not just with words, but with deeds," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I'm fighting for the spouses and children of our true American heroes to have extended leave from their jobs when their loved ones are injured fighting a war for America, because service members and their families have enough to worry about." 
   "This bill would do a tremendous amount to support the families that are doing so much to support our country," said Debra L. Ness, President of the National Partnership for Women & Families - the organization that drafted and led the fight to pass the Family & Medical Leave Act. "We have long known that workers need and deserve job-protected time off when family members face serious health problems. It is most appropriate to extend that leave for families of service members injured in combat. We urge Congress to move quickly to pass the Clinton-Mikulski bill." 
   In its review, the Commission found that 33 percent of active duty, 22 percent of reserve component, and 37 percent of retired/separated service members report that a family member or close friend relocated for extended periods of time to be with them while they were in the hospital. In addition, 21 percent of active duty, 15 percent of reserve component, and 24 percent of retired/separated service members say friends or family gave up a job to be with them or act as their caregiver. To address this situation and help support these caregivers, the Commission recommended strengthening family support programs by extending the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) for up to six months for spouses and parents of seriously injured soldiers. 
   The Clinton-Mikulski bill will enact this recommendation. Their bill will amend the Family and Medical Leave Act to allow up to six months leave for a family member of a service member who has a combat-related injury and meets the eligibility requirements in the law. 
   The Commission on Care for America's Returning Wounded Warriors was established in March 2007 with the specific goals of conducting a comprehensive review of services the government currently provides to our wounded warriors and delivering recommendations to the President, Secretary of Defense and Secretary of Veterans Affairs. 
   As New York's first Senator to serve on the Senate Armed Services Committee, Senator Clinton has made it one of her top priorities to ensure that our brave men and women in uniform have the healthcare and support they need. She secured a series of measures in the Dignified Treatment of Wounded Warriors Act approved unanimously yesterday by the Senate (see http://www.clinton.senate.gov/news/statements/details.cfm?id=279793&& for details). Senator Clinton has introduced legislation to improve the detection, assessment and treatment of traumatic brain injury and expand support systems for members and former members of the Armed Services with traumatic brain injury and their families. 
   Senator Clinton has also introduced legislation to help ensure wounded soldiers receive the disability benefits they need and deserve and to further protect military family financial benefits. She has pressed for an independent investigation of the conditions at Walter Reed and called for a new GI Bill of Rights to once again honor the service and invest in the future of our men and women in uniform. She authored legislation signed into law last year that required an audit of widespread pay issues wounded soldiers are facing and was recently released by the Army showing continuing problems. 
   Senator Clinton has fought to ensure servicemembers have the body armor they need. She also played a key role in securing into law access to TRICARE military health benefits for all drilling members of the National Guard and Reserves and their families. 
   Senator Clinton has been a champion of the Family and Medical Leave Act, which has helped more than 50 million Americans since President Clinton signed it into law in 1993. Senator Clinton has worked to build on this landmark law, cosponsoring the Family and Medical Leave Expansion Act and the Healthy Families Act, which expand workers' paid sick leave to care for a child or an aging parent.
