SEN. MIKULSKI STATEMENT ON FDA COMMISSIONER CRAWFORD'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement this afternoon following the resignation of Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Commissioner Lester Crawford:  
   "Lester Crawford's leadership at FDA since 2002 has been both tepid and passive. There were so many problems under his watch, that I opposed his nomination as FDA Commissioner. The problems have only continued since his confirmation this summer. Every day, I have grown more concerned about what's going on at FDA. 
   "FDA has always been the gold standard in maintaining drug safety and drug efficacy. Yet, this agency has been politicized and degraded. The current administration has shown a persistent pattern of bringing in incompetent leaders into critical positions. We've seen it at FEMA. We've seen it at other agencies. And now it's been true at FDA. 
   "Today's announcement that Mr. Crawford has resigned is a move towards reforming FDA. I have fought for years for the right facilities and the right resources for FDA, located in my home state of Maryland. Now I'm going to fight for the right leadership. I am anxious for a prompt appointment of a qualified FDA leader."
