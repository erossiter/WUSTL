SEN. MIKULSKI STANDS UP FOR FIRST RESPONDERS' RIGHT TO FAIR WAGES, WORKING CONDITIONS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has joined Senator Judd Gregg (R-N.H.) and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) in co-sponsoring legislation to guarantee collective-bargaining rights for all public safety officers. The Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act provides basic fairness for our first responders, while at the same time promoting public safety.  
   "The federal government has a responsibility to protect our protectors. If you are willing to put your life on the line every day, you should know the government stands behind your rights on the job," said Senator Mikulski. "This bill stands up for our first responders." 
   The Cooperation Act gives first responders and public safety officers the right to bargain over wages, hours and working conditions, and would ensure these rights are can be enforced in state court. It also provides a dispute resolution mechanism for labor-management conflicts to prevent strikes and lockouts. 
   The bill establishes the same rights to collective bargaining already enjoyed by most private sector workers and by public safety officers in 29 states and the District of Columbia. The legislation would only affect the 21 states that don't already provide their public safety officers with the right to bargain collectively. These states can also choose to establish their own collective bargaining systems and may ask for guidance from the Federal Labor Relations Authority. 
   This legislation strengthens public safety by building strong partnerships between first responders and the cities and states they serve - enhancing their ability to respond to crises and protect the homeland.
