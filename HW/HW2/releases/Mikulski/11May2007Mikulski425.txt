SEN. MIKULSKI HONORS NATIONAL AMERICORPS WEEK
  As National AmeriCorps Week kicks off this weekend, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a founder of the community service organization, acknowledged the hard work members are doing around the country. Next week, Sen. Mikulski will introduce a resolution honoring the essential contributions AmeriCorps makes nationwide and encouraging people to consider joining the organization.  
   "AmeriCorps is the embodiment of the spirit of volunteerism and service to our country. They tackle the toughest problems in our communities - tutoring teens, starting neighborhood crime watches, turning vacant lots into neighborhoods, and helping communities clean up and rebuild after natural disasters. AmeriCorps volunteers are unflagging, unflinching and determined to make a difference," said Senator Mikulski. "I know how important AmeriCorps is to communities across the country and to the young people who want to serve. We are so grateful for all the hard work that they do." 
   Senator Mikulski was one of the original founders of AmeriCorps. Since 1989, she has been a leader in its creation, introducing the National and Community Service Act, which created a program that evolved into what is now AmeriCorps. She has also been its chief advocate in the Senate, fighting to strengthen the organization and save key AmeriCorps programs. 
   The AmeriCorps Week Resolution designates May 13-20, 2007, as a time to salute AmeriCorps members for their work, thank community partners who make the program possible, and encourage more people to join. 
   "I want to recognize National AmeriCorps Week by saying thank you to all the volunteers and service workers everywhere. They take time out of their lives to help their fellow Americans in their time of need - and they do it out of the goodness of their hearts," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to strengthen AmeriCorps so it can continue to help local communities meet local needs." 
   Since the organization's start, 500,000 people nationwide have joined the program and taken the AmeriCorps pledge to "get things done for America." AmeriCorps members have served more than 630 million hours nationwide.
