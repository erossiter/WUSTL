SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS FOR FEDERAL SUPPORT IN MONTGOMERY COUNTY ARSON INVESTIGATION
  In response to recent press reports, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today sent a letter to Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) Director Carl J. Truscott asking him to partner with Montgomery County's law enforcement agencies in their investigation into a recent string of possible arson fires.  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   March 22, 2006 
   Carl J. Truscott, Director 
  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and 
  Explosives 650 Massachusetts Avenue, NW 
  Washington, D.C. 20226 
   Dear Director Truscott: 
   I was troubled to learn about a series of fires that recently occurred in Montgomery County, Maryland. Cars and area playground equipment have been the most common targets of the arson. Local authorities suspect that many of these fires were set by the same individual or group. 
   ATF is our national expert on arson, bringing important investigative and forensics expertise in solving crimes of this kind. In the past, ATF has supported the efforts of Maryland's local authorities with great success. I ask that ATF bring its expertise and resources to bear on these crimes by partnering with Montgomery County's law enforcement agencies. I am grateful for your help on this matter. 
   Sincerely, 
   Barbara A. Mikulski United States 
  Senator
