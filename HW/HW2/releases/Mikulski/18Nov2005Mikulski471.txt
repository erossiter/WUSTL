  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) joined her colleague Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) to announce that Congress will give final approval to the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development 2006 spending bill today. The bill includes key community development and transportation projects for Maryland. Following the Senate's passage, the bill will go to the President for his signature.  
   COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT 
   "As a U.S. Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs and build communities. This legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of working with Maryland communities to identify places where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best list of local, state and federal priorities. Maryland can count on me to keep standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation." 
   "This funding will help to improve the lives and the day-to-day needs of people all across the State of Maryland," said Senator Sarbanes. "These economic development funds help our local communities and create jobs."

   TRANSPORTATION 
   "I fight every year for federal investments that help keep Marylanders on the move," said Senator Mikulski. "More money for Maryland public transit systems means safer and faster commutes to work, better air quality, jobs today and jobs tomorrow." 
   "This funding continues our on-going federal investment in our mass transit infrastructure and will aid our commuting public in their day-to-day travels," said Senator Sarbanes. "I am particularly pleased that we are providing the final installment of funds to complete the much needed double-tracking effort for Baltimore's Light Rail system, which has been the source of bottlenecks and delays over the years for Baltimore's commuters." 
   * $12.42 million for the double-tracking of Baltimore's Light Rail Line, which will fulfill the federal commitment to the project. 
   * $5 million to compensate general aviation facilities in the National Capital Region to reimburse fixed based general aviation operators and providers of general aviation ground support services at three facilities that incurred financial losses due to airspace closures following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The three Maryland airports are: College Park Airport, Washington Executive/Hyde Field and Potomac Airpark. 
   * $3 million for the Silver Spring Transit Center to replace a 30-year-old facility that is one of the busiest stations in the system. By the year 2025, the demand for transit services at this center is expected to grow by 70 percent. 
   * $2 million for the Baltimore Red Line and Green Line Transit Project 
   - The Red Line - an east-west transit line that will extend for approximately 11 miles from the Social Security Administration (SSA) Headquarters in Woodlawn to Fells Point. The Red Line will provide service to area currently not served by high quality transit. 
   - The Green Line - an extension of the existing Metro for approximately five miles from its current terminus at the Johns Hopkins Hospital northeast to Morgan State University. The Green Line will provide service to the Broadway Corridor, Coldstream-Homestead-Montebello, Northwood Shopping Center and Morgan State University. 
   * $2 million to continue upgrades to US 113 from Market Street to north of Public Landing Road in Worcester County. This project will improve safety and provide uninterrupted traffic flow along this busy corridor.

To reduce the number of accidents per year, funding will be used to upgrade one mile of the existing highway to a four-lane divided highway from Double Hills Road to Sennett Road, providing safer conditions for people traveling on this section of the highway.
