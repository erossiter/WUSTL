SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER KING
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today on the passing of civil rights leader Coretta Scott King:  
   "I am very sad to hear the news that Coretta Scott King has passed away. She was a true trailblazer for women and for the African American community. She was an inspiration for all Americans. 
   "I feel privileged to have known Mrs. King throughout much of my political career. Although she is gone, she will be remembered throughout American history for her grace, strength and belief that all people should be treated with dignity and equality. 
   "Her courage and faith despite all odds was remarkable. She insisted that she had her own voice in the civil rights movement at a time when women were often not recognized for their own talents and merit. Not only was she resolute but she was feisty - someone after my own heart."
