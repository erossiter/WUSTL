SENATE APPROVES SEN. MIKULSKI PRIORITIES FOR MARYLAND COMMUNITY, HOUSING PROJECTS
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate has passed the 2008 spending bill, which includes $4.2 million for her community development priority projects in Maryland. The bill also protects Baltimore City from being stripped of its status as a "Moving to Work" demonstration program participant, shielding the city and public housing residents from severe implications. 
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook that builds and protects communities. This legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of working to identify places where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best list of local, state and federal priorities. Marylanders can count on me to continue standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents."  
   Senator Mikulski specifically fought to include language in the spending bill that prohibits the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) from a threatened revocation of Baltimore City's designation as a "Moving to Work" city. "Moving to Work" is a demonstration program that offers public housing authorities the opportunity to design and test innovative, locally designed housing and self-sufficiency strategies for low-income families. The program gives the Housing Authority of Baltimore City (HABC) greater flexibility and increased resources to meet the needs of low-income residents who are trying to build better lives for themselves and their families. 
   The spending bill also includes $4.2 million for community development projects in Maryland: 
   * $2 million for the Housing Partnership Network to expand development and ownership of affordable housing and community revitalization initiatives. This is a national network and business cooperative of more than 80 housing nonprofits, including Maryland's St. Ambrose Housing Aid Center, Homes for America Inc., Montgomery Housing Partnership and the Interfaith Housing Alliance. 
   * $700,000 for the City of College Park for blight removal along the Route 1 Corridor. 
   $400,000 for Montgomery County to provide for pedestrian safety in the Long Branch community in Silver Spring through pedestrian safety linkages and way-finding community markers. 
   * $300,000 for the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation's Library Square Revitalization Project in Baltimore to continue the revitalization of an under-used area in the Library Square commercial district. 
   * $200,000 for the Washington County Free Library to facilitate the design and construction of a new library branch in Boonsboro. This small community has raised nearly $1 million to build this new library and computer center. 
   * $200,000 for the East Baltimore Development Project to continue providing for workforce development, clean and safe programs, and infrastructure improvements. The organization is leading the nation's most ambitious community revitalization effort, transforming 80 acres of blighted land around Johns Hopkins Hospital into a mixed-use, mixed-income community. 
   * $200,000 for the Jewish Foundation for Group Homes in Rockville to acquire and renovate a single-family home into an Alternative Living Unit for three adults with developmental disabilities. 
   * $200,000 for the Grassroots Crisis Intervention Center in Columbia to provide the last stage of construction funding for the only emergency services shelter in Howard County. 
   The bill also restores funding for the HOPE VI housing program to $100 million, despite the President's elimination in his budget request for the second year. HOPE VI was created by Senator Mikulski in 1992 with the aim of replacing dilapidated public housing with mixed-income developments connected to schools, retail and community services. Since the program started, over $5 billion has been appropriated for HOPE VI and billions more have been leveraged from the private sector. Senator Mikulski and a bipartisan group of her congressional colleagues introduced the HOPE VI reauthorization bill this spring. 
   "We need to support federal programs that help those who help themselves. HOPE VI has always been about creating new opportunities for residents of public housing and new hope for the communities surrounding public housing," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue my fight to not only reauthorize this vital program, but to make sure the President does not succeed in cutting its federal funding." 
   A long-time advocate for federal funding for lead-based paint hazard control intervention and prevention services, Senator Mikulski fought to include $2 million to continue supporting HUD's "Big Buy" program. This program allows owners of Section 8 (low-income) housing to apply for free lead-based paint inspections. This is a particular issue in Baltimore, where residents are at higher risk. 
   "Children from poor families are disproportionately at risk for lead poisoning in major urban areas," said Senator Mikulski. "This funding is an important step in protecting children from lead exposure and makes a real difference for Baltimore's families." 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the bill will go to the President for his signature.
