SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT IN HONOR OF PRESIDENT FORD
  As the nation honors former President Gerald Ford today with a "National Day of Mourning," Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement:  
   "Gerald Ford led our country through a very challenging period. He was a dedicated patriot, who did the right thing to unite a troubled nation. 
   "One of the things I admired most about President Ford was his dedication to his wife, Betty. President Ford stuck by Betty through cancer and through a hard battle with alcohol abuse. Most importantly, he stuck by his dedicated wife as she spoke out for women's rights at a time when women were fighting for equality throughout the country. Betty could count on her husband, and so could America."
