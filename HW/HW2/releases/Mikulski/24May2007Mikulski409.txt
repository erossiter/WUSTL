SEN. MIKULSKI SUPPORTS EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING DESPITE WHITE HOUSE FAILURE TO PLAN FOR WITHDRAWL
  As she prepares to attend a second departure ceremony in Maryland for the Maryland Army National Guard's 58th Infantry Brigade Combat Team tomorrow, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) voted to approve the emergency supplemental spending bill that passed both the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate this evening. The bill includes more than $446 million in federal funding for Maryland military facilities, as well as $1 billion to address the dramatic funding shortfall for the National Guard and additional funding to support operations at Walter Reed Medical Center in Washington, D.C. Despite her support for the critical funding, Senator Mikulski expressed her disappointment that President Bush has been unwilling to work with congressional leadership on a firm plan for troop withdrawal in Iraq.  
   "I have promised our departing Soldiers that I would do everything I could to support them on the battlefield and when they return. I may not support this war, but I do support our troops," said Senator Mikulski. "While I will continue to fight for the resources they need, I will not give up on my demand that we must change our direction in Iraq and bring our forces home swiftly and safely." 
   Senator Mikulski, a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, is fighting to increase funding for the National Guard, which is funded as a national program with state allocations coming from the Guard Bureau. She recently questioned Defense Secretary Robert Gates on funding gaps for the National Guard and domestic readiness, noting a reported $5.1 billion funding shortfall for this year. 
   The emergency supplemental bill specifically includes $3.1 billion in critical funding for military construction projects required to implement the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) Commission decisions. This funding will ensure that necessary infrastructure is in place to prevent a disruption in the military missions of incoming organizations, including those providing direct support to troops on the battlefield. In Maryland alone, this funding will allow the Department of Defense to move forward on the construction of facilities to directly support our war-fighters, including: 
   * $1.37 million for planning and design for the new Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda. 
   * $389 million for Aberdeen Proving Ground, including funding for Fort Lee, Va., to construct the new Ordnance School. 
   * $13.8 million for Fort Detrick's Armed Forces Reserve Center. 
   The bill also includes $42 million for Fort Meade's Military Intelligence Center in non BRAC-related military construction funding. The bill now heads to the President for his signature.
