SEN. DOLE ACCEPTS SEN. MIKULSKI TERP-TAR HEEL WAGER
  Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) today accepted Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski's (D-Md.) wager on the outcome of Sunday's Women's NCAA Final Four basketball game. The University of Maryland Terrapins will take on the University of North Carolina Tar Heels. In a challenge issued yesterday, Sen. Mikulski bet her Maryland crab cakes against Sen. Dole's Carolina barbeque that the Terps would win Sunday's game.  
   "If your team takes the trophy - you feast Maryland-style, and if the Maryland women win, I get your famous Southern specialty," said Senator Mikulski. "I can smell the barbeque cooking. Let the game begin!" 
   Senator Dole's acceptance letter to Senator Mikulski is below: 
   March 30, 2006 
   Dear Senator Mikulski, 
   I accept your challenge and predict the Lady Tar Heels will be triumphant in what is sure to be another classic ACC contest. 
   I am of course proud that my home state has not just one, but two outstanding programs in this year's Final Four. I look forward to enjoying those famous Maryland crab cakes as the Tar Heels and Duke Blue Devils play for the women's national championship.
