SEN. MIKULSKI RENEWS COMMITMENT TO H2B VISA FIGHT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) met today with members of Maryland's seafood industry during a coordinated National "H-2B Fly-in" Day for supporters of her effort to extend the H2B visa returning worker exemption. The crucial provision from her Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act, which saves small and seasonal businesses from a devastating cut to their workforce, received a last minute one-year extension as part of the 2007 Department of Defense authorization bill, but expires on September 30, 2007.  
   "I have been fighting for years to help good guy businesses and workers wade through the unfair procedures that were part of the H2B visa process. I will not give up until my fix is permanent," said Senator Mikulski. "I told small businesses they could count on me to keep fighting until we had a solution and they had the seasonal workers they needed to stay in business. Without these seasonal workers, many businesses would not survive - forced to limit services, lay off permanent U.S. workers or, worse yet, close their doors." 
   The Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act, signed into law by President Bush in May 2005, made significant changes to the federal H2B (non-skilled seasonal worker) visa program. Among the changes, it exempted returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people, created new anti-fraud provisions, and ensured a fair allocation of H2B visas among spring and summer employees. The cap exemption provides significant relief to Maryland's seafood and cannery industry that often hires the same dependable workers every year. 
   Senator Mikulski's H2B extension: 
   * Protects our borders by rewarding immigrants who play by the rules - returning to their home countries after finishing their jobs. 
   * Protects American workers by requiring employers to recruit American workers before hiring immigrant workers. 
   * Keeps small and seasonal businesses open by guaranteeing the labor supply needed during their peak seasons when they can't find American workers to take the jobs.
