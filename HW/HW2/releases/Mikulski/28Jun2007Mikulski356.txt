SEN. MIKULSKI MAKES COMMUNITY SECURITY A PRIORITY IN SPENDING BILL
  Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee Chairwoman Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced she has made protecting America from terrorism and violent crime a top priority in the 2008 spending bill. This year's bill, which passed the Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, provides $24.3 billion for the Department of Justice (DOJ), a $2.1 billion increase above the President's budget request. 
   "The rise in violent crime and the critical ongoing fight against terrorism have placed new pressure on the law enforcement agencies working hard every day to keep our nation and our neighborhoods safe," said Senator Mikulski. "I am committed to giving law enforcement the tools they need to clean up the streets, protect our families, and fight the crime that is destroying communities." 
   PROTECTING AMERICA FROM TERRORISM  
   The bill provides $6.6 billion for the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI), which is $147 million above the President's budget request. Counterterrorism now accounts for 40 percent of the FBI's budget. Understanding the FBI's leading role in securing domestic national security by safeguarding against weapons of mass destruction, terrorist attacks and internal espionage, the FBI's funding includes a $132 million increase for initiatives to improve intelligence, including additional agents devoted to counterterrorism efforts. 
   Also included in the bill's funding is a $19 million increase to enhance the Weapons of Mass Destruction Directorate, providing the FBI with significant resources to detect, identify and track individuals that post threats. The bill also provides $31 million above the President's budget request to add 100 FBI agents and to establish additional task forces to combat violent crime and gang activity. These additional resources are urgently needed, especially in light of recent reports of rising crime rates in the United States during 2005 and 2006. 
   "The number one job of government is to keep our communities safe from violence. Given all of the stress placed on the FBI with increased roles and responsibilities, we must ensure the agency has the resources it needs," said Senator Mikulski. "The lives of 300 million Americans depend on it." 
   The bill also includes: 
   * $5.6 billion for the Bureau of Prisons, which is $285 million above the President's budget request, and provides the full budget request for salaries and operational expenses. 
   * $1.85 billion for the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), with an additional $52 million above the President's budget request to lift a hiring freeze and to restore a program that provides DEA support to state and local law enforcement officials. 
   * $1 billion for the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), with an additional $35 million above the President's budget request for the National Center for Explosives Training and Research. 
   $905 million for the U.S. Marshals Service, with an additional $5 million above the President's budget request to establish a Regional Fugitive Task Force to address the increased workload associated with implementation of the Adam Walsh Child Protection and Safety Act, which Senator Mikulski co-sponsored. 
  FIGHTING CRIMES AGAINST CHILDREN 
   Within the DOJ budget, Senator Mikulski has included $313 million to protect our nation's children from predators. The funding will support efforts to prevent, investigate and prosecute crimes against children. This includes funding for the Adam Walsh Act (see also U.S. Marshals allocation above), as well as $8 million above the President's budget request for new FBI agents dedicated to fighting Internet crimes against children. 
   "We have made some amazing progress over the years, starting out with billboards and milk cartons. But crimes have gotten more sophisticated, and we've had to become more sophisticated," said Senator Mikulski. "Our bill focuses the resources of the federal government on child predators like a laser. I will keep doing my part in this war against child predators to help keep our children safe." 
   COMMUNITY SECURITY 
   Chairwoman Mikulski has criticized the President's budget request, which reduced federal resources to fight and assist state and local communities in fighting violent crime. Instead, this year's spending bill restores funding for state and local law enforcement to nearly $2.7 billion, filling a major gap after the President cut its budget in half. This includes $1.4 billion for Edward Byrne grants for states and $5.5 million for Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS). 
   The bill also includes a $15.8 million investment in national programs targeted at crime prevention and victim support: 
   * $5 million for Big Brothers and Big Sisters for after-school mentoring programs. 
   * $5 million for the National Crime Victims Law Institute to provide services to victims of crime. 
   * $4.3 million for the National Crime Prevention Campaign for education and prevention programs. 
   * $1.5 million for the Cal Ripken Foundation for mentoring programs. 
  MARYLAND PROGRAMS FOR AT-RISK YOUTH 
   Senator Mikulski secured $5.7 million in this year's spending bill for programs targeting the prevention, intervention and prosecution of gang activity in Maryland. This includes critical funds for programs that target at-risk youth with after-school programs and support services. 
   "We need to continue our work to protect neighborhoods and families - that means safer streets and safer communities. I am proud to have secured funding in this year's bill to support programs with proven track records that are making a difference in Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "We need to take a comprehensive look at gang problems. No one can do it alone. That's why I will continue to work for federal investments to help clean up our streets and fight the crime that is destroying our neighborhoods." 
   * $3 million for the Maryland Statewide Anti-Gang Initiative for the U.S. Attorney to continue to fight gangs through intervention, prevention and prosecution. 
   * $750,000 for the Latin American Youth Center in Prince George's County, to expand job training programs and continue after-school educational programs directed for at-risk youth. 
   * $500,000 for Baltimore's Safe and Sound Campaign to assist at-risk high school youth with job training, support at-risk pregnant women, and provide summer programs for kids. 
   * $400,000 for KidsPeace in Columbia, which provides support services for foster care parents. 
   * $300,000 for the Asian American Leadership Empowerment and Development in Wheaton, to help families support their children's academic and social development, offer academic assistance, mentoring and one-on-one tutoring, and increase opportunities for youth to move out of poverty. 
   * $300,000 for the To Work in Gaining Skills (TWIGS) program at the Baltimore School for the Arts to continue expansion of after-school programs. 
   * $250,000 for the Eastern Shore Dropout Prevention Program in Centreville, for the expansion of a program to utilize a web-based curriculum and delivery system to keep students on track to graduate. 
   * $200,000 for the Rejecting Violence, Building Resilience program at the Patterson Park public charter school in Baltimore for after-school programs for at-risk youth. 
  TOOLS FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT 
   Senator Mikulski also included almost $3.8 million to upgrade equipment and technical capabilities for local law enforcement agencies in Maryland: 
   * $1 million for a new interoperable radio system for Prince George's County. 
   * $1 million for the Capitol Wireless Information Network (CapWIN) to increase operational data sources, enhance technical capabilities, and provide additional tools to first responders in the state. 
   * $750,000 for the State of Maryland's First Responder Interoperability Project to improve operability and communication among all state law enforcement agencies as well as local jurisdictions. 
   * $500,000 to improve and upgrade Baltimore County's Forensics Lab. 
   * $500,000 to improve and upgrade Baltimore City's Forensics Lab. The bill also provides $1.6 million for Baltimore City organizations that provide training, job placement and support for ex-offenders: Baltimore City Felony Diversion Initiative ($500,000), New Song Urban Ministries At-Risk Youth and Ex-Offender Program ($450,000), Goodwill Industries of the Chesapeake Bay ($250,000), the Project Serve Program at the Living Classrooms Foundation ($225,000) and the Johns Hopkins Prisoner Career Re-Entry Program ($200,000). 
   The 2008 CJS spending bill emphasizes congressional oversight, accountability and fiscal stewardship. Insisting on discipline and vigorous oversight, the bill requires agencies to notify the Committee immediately after learning of program cost overruns greater than 10 percent. The Committee will work with the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to begin biannual reports of programs and projects greater than $100 million as an early warning system to identify cost overruns and mismanagement. The bill also requires that Inspectors General conduct audits of grant funding. 
   Chairwoman Mikulski instituted criteria for all congressionally designated projects in this year's spending bill, requiring that they be specifically focused on the mission and mandate of the organization. The CJS bill substantially reduces earmarks, and all projects in the bill comply with the requirements of the Legislative Transparency and Accountability Act (S. 1), as passed by the Senate. 
   The spending bill passed the full Appropriations Committee this afternoon. In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will move to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
