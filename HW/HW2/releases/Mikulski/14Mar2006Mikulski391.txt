SEN. MIKULSKI RECEIVES RECOGNITION FOR HER SUPPORT OF CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED HABITAT RESTORATION
  In recognition of her support for Chesapeake Bay watershed habitat restoration, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today accepted an award for her work on behalf of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association's (NOAA) Community Based Restoration program. NOAA Administrator Vice Admiral Conrad C. Lautenbacher Jr., Restore America's Estuaries President Mark Wolf Armstrong and Chesapeake Bay Foundation Federal Affairs Director Doug Siglin presented Sen. Mikulski with the award.  
   "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and an integral part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why I work hard to fund effective restoration projects that save the Bay and help those who depend on it for jobs and recreation," said Senator Mikulski. "Maryland's communities want to do the right thing by the Bay, but they can't do it on their own." 
   The Community Based Restoration Program (CBRP) is a competitive grant program that supports local habitat restoration projects with hands-on, grassroots citizen participation. The grants are awarded to nonprofits, community organizations, local governments and educational groups. These programs help the nation's fisheries by restoring their habitat and building a local sense of conservation. 
   The CBRP began in 1996 in response to requests from local groups and individuals interested in restoring habitats in their communities. It has grown into a systematic effort to catalyze partnerships at the national, regional and local levels to help citizens carryout meaningful restoration projects. The program provides funds and links to NOAA technical expertise to help complete these projects. 
   The CBRP was funded at $13 million in the FY 2006 NOAA budget. Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations subcommittee, which funds NOAA.
