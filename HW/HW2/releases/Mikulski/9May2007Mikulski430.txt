SEN. MIKULSKI STANDS UP FOR D.C. VOTING RIGHTS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues, led by Sens. Joseph Lieberman (I-Conn.) and Orrin Hatch (R-Utah), in supporting the D.C. Voting Rights Act (S. 1257) to give the District of Columbia a voting seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. 
   "This bill is about basic fairness. Residents of the District should have the right to the same representation as all other Americans," said Senator Mikulski. "I have always been a strong supporter of federal representation for Washington, D.C., and will continue to fight with city leaders to get the District a vote in Congress."
   There are more than half a million people living in Washington, D.C., but for more than 200 years the nation's capital city has never had a voting representative in the U.S. Congress. The District of Columbia is the only jurisdiction in the United States where Americans fulfill all the responsibilities of citizenship, but have no voting representation in either the U.S. Senate or the House of Representatives. Residents pay taxes, but are denied a say in federal laws - including those that regulate the city's schools, health care and economy.
   Under the D.C. Voting Rights Act, the District of Columbia would hold an election for its Representative in 2008, to serve in the 111th Congress. In meetings with D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty, Senator Mikulski pledged to fight for congressional voting rights for the District when legislation came before the Senate.
