SENS. CARDIN, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE $5.8 MILLION IN NEW FUNDING FOR HAGERSTOWN AIRPORT RUNWAY EXTENSION
  U.S. Senators Benjamin L. Cardin and Barbara A. Mikulski (both D-MD) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded Washington County an additional $5.8 million to complete the runway safety extension project at the Hagerstown Regional-Richard A. Henson Airport. 
   The $48.5 million runway safety project was begun in 2004 to comply with the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) safety standards. The project extends the runway from 5,461 feet to 7,000 feet, with an additional 1,000-feet safety area added to each end of the runway.
   "Continued federal investment in this project is a clear recognition of Hagerstown Regional Airport's growing role as an economic engine for the entire Western Maryland Region," said Senator Cardin. "The Airport and the surrounding area have contributed approximately $48 million to the local economy, and completion of this long-term runway project will generate even more business for the region."
   "I know Western Maryland leaders see the Hagerstown Regional Airport as a major priority - it's one of my top priorities too. I want to keep our runways safe and keep our Marylanders on the go," said Senator Mikulski. "This airport is critical to Western Maryland's economy, and to the families and commuters who use it to connect throughout the country. I will keep fighting to do what I can to support your efforts to keep this airport strong."
   The runway safety project also includes the installation of two fully functioning Category-1 landing systems, and acquisition of land for runway protection zones.
   Since the runway project was initiated in 2004, 125,000-square feet of corporate hangar and office space have been added to the airport. In addition, approximately $15 million in private investment has been made in these airport facilities.
