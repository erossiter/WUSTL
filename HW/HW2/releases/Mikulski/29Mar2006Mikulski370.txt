SEN. MIKULSKI CHALLENGES SEN. DOLE TO TERP-TARHEEL WAGER
  In a bet of Maryland crab cakes versus Carolina barbeque, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) challenged Sen. Elizabeth Dole (R-N.C.) to a wager today on the outcome of Sunday's Women's NCAA Final Four basketball game. The University of Maryland Terrapins will take on the University of North Carolina Tarheels.  
   "If your team takes the trophy - you feast Maryland-style, and if the Maryland women win, I get your famous Southern specialty," said Senator Mikulski. "The Terrapins are about to take on the Tarheels - and we'll soon show why you should 'Fear the Turtle!'" 
   The text of the letter is below: 
   March 29, 2006 
   Dear Senator Dole: 
   I am writing to issue you a challenge. 
   The Terrapins are about to take on the Tarheels - and we'll soon show why you should "Fear the Turtle!" 
   The women of the University of Maryland's basketball team - the Terrapins - will face your University of North Carolina Tarheels in the NCAA Final Four tournament this Sunday, April 2. I'm sure you're as proud of your team as I am of mine - so I propose we make it interesting. 
   My challenge to you, should you choose to accept it: my Maryland crab cakes versus a batch of your North Carolina barbeque. If your team takes the trophy - you feast Maryland-style, and if the Maryland women win, I get your famous Southern specialty. 
   Let the game begin!
