SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $9 MILLION FOR HARFORD, CECIL COUNTY DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate version of the Department of Defense 2008 spending bill includes $61.5 million for defense projects in Maryland, including $9 million for defense projects in Harford and Cecil Counties. The legislation, which passed the subcommittee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops with the equipment they need on the battlefield, the benefits and services they deserve when they return home, and support for their families on the home front. We know how critical these funds are for our troops to fulfill their mission and return home safely," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for our troops." 
   The $9 million for Harford and Cecil County defense projects includes: 
   * $4 million for Extended Cold Weather Clothing Systems for the Army National Guard from W.L. Gore in Cecil County to provide extraordinary protection during cold and/or wet weather for troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan. 
   * $3 million for a Perimeter and Maritime Sensor Network at Aberdeen Proving Ground (APG) to improve security surveillance and emergency preparedness for the base. 
   * $2 million to complete the Rotorcraft Survivability Assessment Facility at APG to test and improve force-protection for helicopters to address the immediate need to reduce helicopter vulnerability on the front lines. 
   A full Appropriations Committee vote is expected tomorrow morning on the spending bill. The bill will then move to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
