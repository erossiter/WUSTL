SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES OPENING OF ENERGETICS TECH CENTER IN CHARLES COUNTY
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) at a ribbon cutting for the new Energetics Technology Center (ETC) in Charles County. Sen. Mikulski fought for and secured $5 million to support the ETC in the 2007 Department of Defense spending bill, which the President signed into law on Sept. 29.  
   "Our nation is in an amazing race - the race for discovery and new knowledge, the race to remain competitive and the race to foster an innovation society. The Energetics Technology Center will help keep Charles County and Maryland in the lead - developing the smart new weapons, while creating high-tech jobs in Southern Maryland," said Senator Mikulski. "The ETC will develop technology to give the Navy the edge on the battlefield, to give America the edge in the marketplace, and to make the Naval Surface Warfare Center Indian Head Division the crown jewel in the Navy's transformation." 
   The ETC is a partnership among the U.S. Navy, Charles County, the University of Maryland at College Park and private industry to research and develop cutting-edge Energetics technology for effective, lethal Navy weapons, equipment to keep our Sailors and Marines safe, and science and technology workforce development programs. 
   "I want the best weapons for our war-fighters and the best value for our dollars. The ETC will help make Indian Head and America even stronger," said Senator Mikulski. "A stronger America begins at home." 
   The ETC will be an economic boost to the region as the anchor center in a new Charles County technology park, attracting high-tech companies, with high-tech jobs, who want to work with the Navy.
