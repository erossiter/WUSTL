SEN. MIKULSKI CELEBRATES HISTORICALLY BLACK COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WEEK
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today recognized the rich heritage and prominent role in U.S. history played by Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Senator Mikulski and a bipartisan group of her Senate colleagues introduced a resolution to designate the week of September 9, 2007, as National HBCU Week, and it was approved by the Senate prior to the congressional recess.  
   "Civil rights got us into the stadium, but higher education brings us into the game and HBCUs have always helped make sure African American students don't get left on the bench," said Senator Mikulski. "I want to salute the dedicated faculty and staff at these institutions, not just with words, but with deeds, for their tremendous contributions in shaping America's youth." 
   There are 103 HBCUs nationwide, including four in Maryland: Coppin State University, Morgan State University, University of Maryland Eastern Shore and Bowie State University. HBCUs provide the quality education necessary in today's highly technological society, offer opportunities for many underprivileged students to reach their potential, and deserve national recognition for their various achievements and goals. 
   "Education is the opportunity ladder of this nation and higher education is a critical rung in that ladder. Every child, regardless of race or family income, deserves a chance to go to college," continued Senator Mikulski. "HBCUs play a critical role in making sure all our children have a chance to succeed, and in making sure they have the 21st century skills and ways of thinking for 21st century jobs. 
   "I'm so proud of the great things historically black institutions do for my own home state of Maryland and the nation," continued Senator Mikulski. "Together, we will continue to fight to increase opportunities for all of our students."
