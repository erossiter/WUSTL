SEN. MIKULSKI HONORS HISPANIC COMMUNITY LEADER AT CONGRESSIONAL LEADERSHIP SUMMIT
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) honored Maryland community leader Gustavo Torres, executive director of CASA of Maryland Inc., at the 6th Annual Hispanic Leadership Summit on Capitol Hill today.  
 The Summit provides an important opportunity for Hispanic community leaders from across the country to discuss key issues with their Members of Congress. 
   "America's strength is its diversity," said Senator Mikulski. "Some people say that America is a melting pot - but it's a mosaic. You can maintain your own ethnic or religious identity, and you can celebrate your own culture and history. And that mosaic is held together by the values we share: honor and patriotism, hope and opportunity, family and community." 
   Gustavo Torres, originally from Colombia, moved to the United States in 1991. He is nationally recognized for his advocacy on behalf of the Latino community and immigrant rights. In addition to leading CASA of Maryland, Torres co-founded the Latino Health Initiative in Montgomery County, founded and served as president for the Latino Coalition for Justice and is a member of the Latino Advisory Committee for Montgomery County Executive Doug Duncan. 
   CASA of Maryland Inc. provides programs in leadership, organizing, women's empowerment, tenant support, employment, legal services, health, education, social services and immigration assistance for Central American immigrants. Since Torres has served as its director, the organization has widely expanded its programs. 
   "I am so proud to work with Maryland's Hispanic leaders to improve our nation," continued Senator Mikulski. "Together we are standing up for what America stands for - an agenda of empowerment, inclusion and opportunity."
