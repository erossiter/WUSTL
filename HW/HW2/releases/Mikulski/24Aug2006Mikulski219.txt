SEN. SARBANES, SEN. MIKULSKI, REP. CARDIN ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF SMALL WATERSHED GRANTS IN GREATER BALTIMORE AREA
  At a press conference today at the Chesapeake Ecology Center, Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Rep. Ben Cardin (D-Md.) announced that 2 organizations in the Greater Baltimore Area were among 28 statewide recently chosen to receive funding from federal agencies as part of the Chesapeake Bay Program's Small Watershed Grants Initiative. This program is intended to help local groups preserve and restore stream corridors in the Chesapeake Bay watershed. A grand total of more than $1 million was awarded to the 28 Maryland recipients this year. 
   "These small grants are making a big difference in promoting citizen-based stewardship and helping to repair degraded watersheds throughout the Chesapeake Bay basin," said Senator Sarbanes. "And who better to do this work than local community groups - the river organizations, schools, scouts, home owner associations, land trusts - who have the local knowledge, energy and passion to care for their streams and natural resources - or the local governments which are responsible for local land use and other important decisions."  
   "Maryland communities want to stand up for the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but they can't do it on their own. The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watershed Grants Program is critical to the health of the Bay and its rivers and streams," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why Senator Sarbanes and I work hard to fund effective projects that save the Bay and help the Marylanders who depend on it for jobs and for recreation." 
   "The Chesapeake Watershed Grant program is a critical tool in preserving the Bay for future generations. Congress provides the funding, but it's the individuals and communities closest to the Bay doing the actual work of restoring and protecting the Bay and its many tributaries," said Rep. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.), a strong advocate of the program. 
   Those Baltimore area projects receiving funding are: 
   * The Baltimore County Department of Environmental Protection & Resource Management will use a $50,000 grant to help implement a market-based approach to increase the planting of trees on urban, private properties in Baltimore County, Maryland. Urban tree planting provides significant environmental benefits by reducing the amount of storm water runoff entering the watershed and is a cost-effective alternative to storm water retrofit projects. 10,000 trees will be planted in Baltimore County under this grant; and 
   * The Parks and People Foundation, in partnership with the City of Baltimore, will use a $35,000 grant to develop a model schoolyard habitat and urban neighborhood scale watershed planning process using community schools as the center of activity. Working with project partners, Parks and People Foundation will design habitat restoration plans for 3 urban schools and watershed plans for 3 sub-drainage watersheds Baltimore, Maryland. This project will install 2 model habitat projects at each school site and conduct community outreach about urban storm water issues. 
   In addition, two statewide projects are slated to receive funding: 
   * The Cacapon Institute will use a $35,000 grant to recruit science, social studies, and vocational-agricultural classes from high schools throughout the Chesapeake Bay watershed to participate in an internet-based Stream Cleaner Environmental Forum on best management practices to improve water quality in the Chesapeake Bay. The Forum will engage students in a simulated Tributary Team stakeholder process to explore the science and challenges of non-point source pollution reduction. Following the Forum, up to 10 classes will complete water quality restoration projects to serve as visible demonstrations of best management practices as well as living classrooms for future academic study; and 
   * The Izaak Walton League of America will use a $35,000 grant to hold workshops to train 60 certified volunteers to conduct water quality monitoring throughout Maryland. Monitoring will occur at 100 sites throughout Maryland and will be integrated into an annual water quality report. Data gathered during this study will be used to identify and prioritize watershed restoration projects that volunteers with Izaak Walton League can undertake in the future. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Small Watershed Grants Program, which was established by Senator Sarbanes, promotes community-based efforts to develop and implement conservation strategies to protect and restore the diverse natural resources of the Chesapeake Bay and its watershed. The program provides grants to local governments and community organizations working to improve the condition of their local watersheds while building citizen-based resource stewardship. This year more than $2.6 million is being awarded for 68 restoration projects throughout the entire Chesapeake Bay watershed.
