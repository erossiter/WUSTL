SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS MEDICARE PART D A MESS, SAYS SHE WILL CONTINUE HER FIGHT FOR SENIORS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today continued her fight to repair the flaws in Medicare Part D with her support for a number of amendments offered to the Tax Reconciliation Act (H.R. 4297), currently pending in the U.S. Senate. In particular, the Senator has been a strong advocate for the REPAIR Act, mirrored in Senate Amendment #2698, and expected to be voted on this afternoon. 
   "Medicare Part D is a mess. It's one more give-away to drug and insurance companies that makes it harder for seniors," said Senator Mikulski. "I believe honor thy mother and father is not just a good commandment to live by, it is good public policy to govern by. That's why I feel so strongly about Medicare. We must do everything we can in the Senate to create permanent solutions to help, not harm, America's seniors."
   "Healthcare costs are skyrocketing and seniors are paying a greater share out of their pockets for healthcare each year. Medicare premium increases are outpacing inflation. Prescription drug costs are shooting through the roof," continued Senator Mikulski. "This amendment is not an answer to skyrocketing healthcare costs, but it is a step in the right direction."
   The REPAIR Act would address a number of problems with Medicare Part D, including:
   * Providing Medicaid recipients guaranteed access to prescription drugs
   * Reducing the burden on good guy pharmacies who are actively working with seniors
   * Guaranteeing federal reimbursement to states and beneficiaries
   Senator Mikulski joined 25 of her colleagues as an original co-sponsor of the REPAIR Act. She joins several Democratic Senate colleagues in her support of today's amendment, including: Senators Jeff Bingaman (N.M.), Jay Rockefeller (W. Va.), Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell (both Wash.), Hillary Clinton and Charles Schumer (both N.Y.), Edward Kennedy and John Kerry (both Mass.), Herb Kohl (Wis.), Joseph Lieberman (Conn.), Frank Lautenberg and Robert Menendez (both N.J.), Patrick Leahy (Vt.), Mark Dayton (Minn.), Dianne Feinstein (Calif.), Evan Bayh (Ind.) and Tim Johnson (S.D.)
