SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOSS OF 50TH MARYLAND SOLDIER IN IRAQ
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement today after the Department of Defense announced the death of the 50th service member from Maryland in Iraq:  
   "Every military death is a tragedy and the brave men and women from Maryland who have died in Iraq and Afghanistan have made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. We owe our service members and their families a debt of gratitude for their selfless service and great sacrifice in the Global War on Terror over the last five years. 
   "As we grieve the deaths of our Maryland sons and daughters, we must also celebrate their remarkable lives. Each soldier leaves a legacy of service to the nation and the enduring promise of freedom. Their sacrifice for our nation will never be forgotten. 
   "Every day, we must remember the Soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines who stand in harm's way, many on their second or third deployment. They and their families should know they have our whole-hearted support and gratitude - with deeds, not just with words."
