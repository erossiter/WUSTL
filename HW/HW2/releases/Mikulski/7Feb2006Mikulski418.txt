SEN. MIKULSKI SAYS PRESIDENT'S BUDGET NEGLECTS AMERICA'S SENIORS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today criticized President Bush's FY 2007 budget, which requests only $1.34 billion for Older American's Act (OAA) programs, a decrease of $28 million from FY 2006. The President's cut comes as Congress begins its consideration of the OAA reauthorization, which will get its first Senate hearing of the year on February 14, 2006. 
   Created in 1965, the OAA is essential for the delivery of social and nutritional services for our nation's seniors. The budget completely eliminates two programs - the Alzheimer's Demonstration Grant program and the Preventive Health Services program. The budget also reduces funding for two programs of high priority for Senator Mikulski - nutrition services programs were cut by $3 million and the National Family Caregiver Support Program, which is a resource for thousands of families across the country, was cut by $2 million:
   "I believe that 'Honor Thy Mother and Father' is a good commandment to live by and a good policy to govern by. But the President's budget does not honor America's seniors. They must be supported not just with words, but with deeds. This means putting money in the federal checkbook to support important programs, not cutting funding and touting flawed programs like the new Medicare prescription drug program (Part D).
   "I look forward to reauthorizing the Older Americans Act. It is an important responsibility that we have to our nation's seniors. I will keep fighting to provide the resources necessary to support our seniors. Too many Older Americans Act programs have been flat-funded for too long. We must commit ourselves, our dollars and our programs to meet the needs of our growing and changing senior population."
   Senator Mikulski is the Ranking Member on the Retirement Security and Aging Subcommittee of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee.
