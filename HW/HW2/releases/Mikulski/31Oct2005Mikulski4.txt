SEN. MIKULSKI RELEASES STATEMENT ON ALITO NOMINATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) released the following statement this morning following President Bush's appointment of Judge Samuel Alito to the Supreme Court:  
   "Today, the President has nominated Judge Samuel Alito to be an Associate Justice on the United States Supreme Court. 
   "The President has the right to make nominations to the Supreme Court. Our Constitution is clear - it demands that the Senate not be a rubber stamp on judicial nominees. 
   "When I evaluate nominees, I base my consideration on three criteria: judicial competence, personal and professional integrity, and a commitment to core constitutional principles, the bill of rights and the implicit right to privacy. 
   "The Senate should be allowed due time to thoroughly examine the qualifications and record of Judge Alito for this powerful position on the highest court in our land. We owe it to the American people to take our time to be sure the nominee will uphold their most basic and fundamental rights. The public demands this from the process, and deserves no less. 
   "I look forward to thoroughly examining Judge Alito's qualifications and record by reviewing the background reports, the American Bar Association evaluation, his Judiciary Committee testimony, and his writings before I will make my determination."
