SEN. MIKULSKI CONGRATULATES YESHIVAT RAMBAM
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) met with representatives of Yeshivat Rambam, a Baltimore school that was one of several in Maryland to be honored with the No Child Left Behind Blue Ribbon School Award at a Washington, D.C., ceremony today.  
 The award is distributed by the U.S. Department of Education. 
   "Education must focus on the basics - tough academic standards, safe and drug-free schools, and the latest in math and science technology," said Senator Mikulski. "Those are the key ingredients for educational excellence, and Yeshivat Rambam has mastered these ingredients." 
   According to the Department of Education, Blue Ribbon Schools have been judged to be particularly effective in meeting local, state and national goals. These schools also display the qualities of excellence that are necessary to prepare our young people for the challenges of the next century. Blue Ribbon status is awarded to schools that have: strong leadership, a clear vision and sense of mission that is shared by all connected with the school, high quality teaching, challenging and up-to-date curriculum, policies and practices that ensure a safe environment conducive to learning, a solid commitment to parental involvement, and evidence that the school helps all students to achieve high standards. 
   After a screening process by each State Department of Education, the Department of Defense Dependent Schools, the Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Council for American Private Education, the Blue Ribbon School nominations were forwarded to the U.S. Department of Education. A panel of outstanding educators and other professionals then reviewed the nominations, selected schools for site visits, and made recommendations to the Secretary of Education.
