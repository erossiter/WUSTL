SEN. MIKULSKI HONORS LIFE OF HARRIETT WOODS
  As we celebrate Women's History Month, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has joined a group of her colleagues, led by Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Kit Bond (R-Mo.), to honor the memory of Harriett Woods, who recently died of leukemia at age 79.  
   "Harriet Woods was a trailblazer for women in politics. When I ran for Senate in 1986, Harriett was running for the Missouri seat," said Senator Mikulski. "Her loss was devastating, but her fight was inspirational - for me as a U.S. Senator and for women of all generations, all across America." 
   Woods had a 50-year political career that included inspiring the creation of Emily's List - the organization that has supported Senator Mikulski since her first campaign for Senate. Woods was the first woman to win statewide office in Missouri when she was elected Lieutenant Governor, and served as president of the National Women's Political Caucus. She was also integral in the 1992 "Year of the Woman," when 19 women were elected to the U.S. House of Representatives and three were elected to the U.S. Senate. 
   The Sense of the Senate resolution honoring Woods, which is expected to be unanimously approved today, notes that "Harriet Woods will be remembered as a pioneer in women's politics, whose actions and leadership inspired hundreds of women nationwide to participate in the political process and to break gender barriers at every level of government."
