SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE $7.3 MILLION FOR HAGERSTOWN AIRPORT RUNWAY EXTENSION
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) announced today that the U.S. Department of Transportation has awarded Washington County $7.3 million to complete the runway extension of the Hagerstown Regional-Richard A. Henson Airport.  
   The runway extension project involves extending the runway from 5,461 feet to 7,000 feet, with an additional 1,000 feet of runway overrun added to each end of the runway to comply with the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) safety standards. The project was begun in 2004 and is expected to be completed by Dec. 31, 2007. 
   "The Hagerstown Regional Airport is an economic engine for the entire Western Maryland region," said Senator Cardin. "It contributes approximately $48 million annually to the local economy, and this funding will bring the airport into compliance with FAA safety standards." 
   "Our regional airports play a key role in maintaining Maryland's robust economy. Extending the runway at Hagerstown Regional-Richard A. Henson Airport is critical to keeping this busy airport running efficiently and keeping Marylanders on the go," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to make sure this airport has the resources it needs to serve the people of Western Maryland." 
   The Hagerstown Regional Airport is one of the oldest continually operated airports in the country operating without interruption since 1928.
