SEN. MIKULSKI SAYS FDA COMMISSIONER CANNOT BE TEMP JOB
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) called for a full-time, committed commissioner to lead the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in a letter sent to U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Michael Leavitt today. The letter comes in the wake of former FDA Commissioner Lester Crawford's resignation from a controversial tenure at the FDA.  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   September 29, 2005 
   Secretary Michael O. Leavitt 
  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services 
  Hubert Humphrey Building 200 Independence Avenue, S.W. 
  Washington, D.C. 20201 
   Dear Secretary Leavitt: 
   It is important to have a full time, permanent FDA commissioner who is competent and has no conflict of interest. The FDA Commissioner must stand sentry over the safety of our food supply and safety of our drugs. The Commissioner must also raise the morale of the dedicated and trusted professionals who work at FDA - and who have been battered by several years of weak leadership. 
   Now we learn that the proposed acting commissioner will also maintain his job of running the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. Given the importance of this job, I have significant yellow flashing lights about the appointment of an acting commissioner who would only work part time at the FDA. We can't have a "temp" in this job. We certainly can't have someone who is straddling two jobs - no matter how credentialed. The FDA needs a full-time, competent commissioner. This is essential to insure that the mission of FDA can be accomplished. 
   I would like to speak to you personally about how the acting commissioner is going to do two jobs and deal with the conflict of interest - as well as your timetable for naming a permanent commissioner. 
   Sincerely, 
   Barbara A. Mikulski 
  United States Senator
