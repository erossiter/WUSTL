SEN. MIKULSKI DISAPPOINTED IN LACK OF NIH FUNDING IN PRESIDENT'S BUDGET
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) said today that President Bush's FY 2007 budget means less research, less innovation, and less discovery for the National Institutes of Health (NIH), headquartered in Bethesda, Md.  
 The President has proposed level-funding (same as FY 2006) for the agency at $28.3 billion, which is $62 million less than FY 2005:
   "How can we search for cures for America's illnesses without the proper funding for research? I'm on the side of cures, that's why I have fought for years to increase NIH's budget. NIH improves the health of the nation by conducting and supporting research on the causes, diagnosis, prevention and cure of human diseases. NIH needs adequate resources to meet its mission and that's why I will keep up my fight to make sure they get the federal investment they need."
