SEN. MIKULSKI, COLLEAGUES STAND UP FOR ALZHEIMER'S PATIENTS, SENIORS IN BUDGET
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues led by Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) in urging Subcommittee on Labor, HHS, Education and Related Agencies Chairman Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) and Ranking Member Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa), to restore funding to FY 2006 levels for critical Alzheimer's and seniors programs in the FY 2007 budget. The President's FY 2007 budget either cut or completely eliminated funding for several of these programs. 
   "I believe 'honor thy mother and father' is not just a good commandment to live by, it is good public policy to govern by. We must commit ourselves, our dollars and our programs to those suffering from Alzheimer's and to meet the needs of our growing and changing senior population," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I am fighting to keep programs for seniors and those affected by Alzheimer's a priority in the federal checkbook."  
   The text of the letter is below: 
   Dear Chairman Specter & Ranking Member Harkin: 
   On behalf of older Americans - the fastest growing population in our country today - and the 4.5 million individuals with Alzheimer's disease and their caregivers, we urge you to restore critical funding for Alzheimer's and seniors' programs at the Administration on Aging (AoA), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and National Institutes of Health (NIH) to Fiscal Year 2006 enacted levels. 
   Today, there are over 35 million seniors in our nation, and these numbers are expected to double by 2030. One in 10 individuals over 65 and nearly half of those over 85 suffer from Alzheimer's disease. We appreciate your leadership and commitment to programs for older Americans and ask that you restore funding for the essential services and research that benefit our most vulnerable seniors. 
   AoA pprograms have supported an array of services that ensure the health and well-being of older Americans and provide support to their caregivers. Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants enable states to develop innovative Alzheimer's care programs, and the Alzheimer's 24/7 Contact Center provides patients, families, and professionals with life-saving assistance. Programs like the National Family Caregiver Support Program and Preventative Health Services help seniors remain independent and stay in their homes for as long as possible. This is not only what seniors and their families prefer, but also cost effective. 
   Home-Delivered Meals or Meals on Wheels, Congregate Nutrition Services, and the Nutrition Services Incentive Program help our seniors access nutritious food that decreases the risk of disability and increases their social engagement. In addition, the Long Term Care Ombudsmen Program protects them from harm, monitoring their care and conditions in nursing homes and other facilities. We urge you to fully restore these AoA programs whose services improve the quality of life of so many of our older Americans. Specifically, we ask that you restore funding of these programs as follows: 
   * Alzheimer's Disease Demonstration Grants to $11.7 million; 
   * Alzheimer's 24/7 Contact Center to $1 million; 
   * Preventative Health Services to $21.4 million; 
   * Home-Delivered Nutrition Services to $18.9 million; 
   * Congregate Nutrition Services to $385.3 million; 
   * Nutrition Services Incentive Program to $147.8 million; 
   * National Family Caregiver Support Program to $156.2 million; and 
   Long Term Care Ombudsmen Program to $15 million. 
  We also seek protection for the funding of CDC's Healthy Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Initiative that aggressively educates the public and professional about risks for Alzheimer's. Moreover, continued resources at NIH are needed to carry out research on Alzheimer's to improve diagnosis, prevention, and treatment and to discover a cure. We request that you fully restore funding for the: 
   Health Aging and Alzheimer's Disease Initiative at CDC to $1.6 million; and 
   Alzheimer's research at NIH to $652 million. Without this investment, the number of individuals with Alzheimer's is estimated to increase to 16 million by 2050, devastating more families and burdening our healthcare system. Recently, the Senate adopted an amendment to the Budget Resolution restoring funding to many of these programs. We appreciate your commitment to our older Americans and hope we can count on your continued support for these critical AoA, CDC, and NIH programs and research.
