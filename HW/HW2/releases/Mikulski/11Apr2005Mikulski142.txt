SEN. MIKULSKI VISITS NOAA, ANNOUNCES SHE WILL USE NEW COMMITTEE POSITION TO FIGHT FOR CHESAPEAKE BAY
  At a meeting at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) today, Sen.  
 Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) announced that she will use a new committee leadership position to increase funding for NOAA's work on oyster reseeding and improving crab harvests. While at NOAA, Sen. Mikulski met with Admiral Lautenbacher, NOAA's Administrator, and learned more about NOAA initiatives including weather prediction and fisheries conservation and protection. 
   "NOAA saves lives and livelihoods - in Maryland and around the world," said Senator Mikulski. "That's what I'm fighting to do in the United States Senate. I am proud to be here today to announce my fight to increase the funding for oysters and crabs. More oysters and crabs mean a cleaner Bay and a healthier Bay. It also means saving business and industries, such as watermen, processors and packing houses." 
   Senator Mikulski was just named Ranking Member (senior Democrat) on the newly reorganized Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee, which is responsible for funding NOAA. "As the new Ranking Member on the Science, State, Justice and Commerce subcommittee I will have new opportunities to fight for issues of importance to Marylanders and Americans - job creation, safe communities, science, space exploration and technology," said Senator Mikulski. 
   NOAA employs almost 5000 people in Maryland, and is a major economic engine for the state. Though the President's budget cuts funding for NOAA by 8%, Senator Mikulski is fighting to increase funding by 10%. Senator Mikulski has a long record of putting money in the federal checkbook for NOAA programs.
