SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON RESIGNATION OF ATTORNEY GENERAL GONZALES
  Following today's resignation of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other recent high-level resignations at the Department of Justice, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Justice Department, released the following statement:  
   "President Bush must move quickly to nominate a candidate with competence and experience to replace Attorney General Gonzales. The American people have lost faith in the Justice Department. The next Attorney General must restore its integrity. I urge the President to choose a candidate who is committed to the mission of the Justice Department - to protect the American people, while protecting American values."
