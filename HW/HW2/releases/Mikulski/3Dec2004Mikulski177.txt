SEN. MIKULSKI SECURES ALMOST $5 MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR I-70 UPGRADE
  At a meeting with members of the Frederick Area Committee for Transportation (FACT), Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that she secured almost $5 million for safety improvements to Interstate 70 in Frederick County. Sen. Mikulski, working with Sen. Paul Sarbanes, secured the funding in the $388 billion FY2005 Omnibus appropriations bill. This spending legislation passed the House and Senate on November 20, 2004 and has been sent to the President for his signature.  
   "Every year, I fight for Maryland's fair share of transportation funding," said Senator Mikulski. "Even during a tight budget year, working with Senator Sarbanes I was able to secure $13 million more this year than last year for critical Maryland transportation projects. And one of my top priorities was this federal funding to help upgrade Interstate 70. This money will make a real difference for Frederick County residents and commuters. It will help improve safety and reduce traffic congestion in the County, keeping people on the move and our neighborhoods safe." 
   Federal funding will be used to continue I-70 upgrades from Mt. Phillip Road to MD 144. Specific upgrades include a new I-70 Interchange at MD 85 Extended and MD 475 (East Street Extended), a storm water management facility to provide for proper drainage along the roadway, and construction of a 100-space Park and Ride lot in the northwest quadrant of I-70/MD 355. 
   According to the State Highway Administration, the Frederick area of I-70 carries more than 69,000 vehicles daily. Forecasts indicate that number will increase by as much as 60% by the year 2020. Without these improvements to I-70, traffic will be forced onto local roadways and into neighborhoods. 
   Senator Mikulski has worked hard to improve transportation in Frederick County. Since 2002 she has secured over $17 million in federal funding directly for the I-70 improvement project. More than $74 million in federal funds in the last six years have gone toward the project. Senator Mikulski has also fought for over $44.8 million to complete the MARC Line extension, linking Frederick to Washington, D.C.
