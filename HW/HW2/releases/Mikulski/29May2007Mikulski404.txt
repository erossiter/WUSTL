SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER REP. MITCHELL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) issued the following statement today on the death of former Rep. Parren Mitchell:  
   "Parren Mitchell was a truly great leader from a truly great generation. He turned his deep commitment to social justice into policies that solidified the accomplishments of the civil rights movement and expanded it to include economic empowerment. He was a path breaker, a champion of social justice - and a dear friend, mentor and colleague. 
   "I worked with Congressman Mitchell for over 20 years. When I was a young social worker, he led our city's anti-poverty program. When he was elected to Congress, I was a member of the Baltimore City Council. When I was elected to Congress - we both represented Baltimore. There wasn't a day that went by when we didn't talk about how to help our hometown and the families who live here. Like me, he believed in our city. We worked together to create jobs and strengthen opportunities for all people and all neighborhoods. While his heart was in Baltimore, Parren Mitchell was a national leader. His legacy is a nation with more opportunity and more justice."
