SEN. MIKULSKI ACCEPTS AWARD FROM UNITED JEWISH COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today accepted an award from United Jewish Communities for her advocacy on behalf of Jewish causes. Sen.  
 Mikulski has long been a friend to the Jewish community and an unwavering supporter of the long-term sustainability of the state of Israel. 
   "I am so honored to be recognized by United Jewish Communities - one of the world's most effective social service organizations," said Senator Mikulski. "I work in the United States Senate to help those who practice self-help. This award is a recognition of the values I share with UJC and the Jewish community." 
   In particular this year, United Jewish Communities saluted Senator Mikulski for her work on the following things: 
   * U.S.-Poland- Israel Exchange Program - When Baltimore's Polish and Jewish communities created an exchange program for American and Israeli youth to travel together to Poland and Israel, Senator Mikulski secured a $250,000 federal investment. 
   * Funding for High-Risk Non-Profit Institutions - Senator Mikulski obtained $25 million high-risk non-profit institutions to help protect them from terrorist attacks. These funds can be used by institutions that provide vital health, social, cultural, and educational services to secure their buildings and add safety features like concrete barriers to protect them from terrorist attacks.
