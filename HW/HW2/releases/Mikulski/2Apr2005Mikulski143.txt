SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF POPE JOHN PAUL II
  Statement of Sen. Mikulski on death of Pope John Paul II: 
   "I am saddened at the passing of Pope John Paul II. The Holy Father was an inspiration to me - and to millions of people around the world. His faith, his compassion and his eloquence transcended religion or nationality. He stood with those who suffered, with those who were oppressed. He offered faith and hope. He reached out to young people - to give them the moral compass that we need to guide our lives. 
   "The Pope was the father of the Church. He was also a son of Poland. I remember when I heard the news about our new Polish Pope - the first non-Italian Pope in 455 years. We closed the streets in front of St. Stanislaw's in Fells Point. We felt such pride and joy. 
   "I was so proud to be part of the American delegation to witness his investiture. And twenty five years later, I was honored to present the Pope with the Congressional Gold Medal - the highest honor Congress can bestow. 
   "Pope John Paul knew what it meant to live under occupation and tyranny. During the dark days of Communism, Pope John Paul led the church's support of the Solidarity Movement. His actions helped to tear down the Iron Curtain. 
   "Today, we are grieving the death of our Pope. Yet we also celebrate his remarkable life. His legacy is faith and freedom, and the enduring promise of the Gospels."
