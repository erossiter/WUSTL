SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BUDGET HEARING
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, released the following statement today on the postponement of the CJS hearing on the fiscal year 2008 Department of Justice (DOJ) budget:  
   "Due to scheduling conflicts and an aggressive proposed appropriations markup schedule, the CJS Subcommittee will consider this year's budget priorities in written testimony and correspondence with the Attorney General and DOJ administrators in lieu of a congressional hearing. This is the most effective way to move forward as we consider the agency's very important mission of protecting the nation from terrorism and violent crime."
