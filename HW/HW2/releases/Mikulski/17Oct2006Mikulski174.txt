SEN. MIKULSKI'S H2B SAVE BECOMES LAW
  Small and seasonal businesses breathed a sigh of relief today as President Bush signed the 2007 Department of Defense authorization bill into law. The bill included a provision, authored by Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), that will extend for one year a crucial provision from her Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act that saves small and seasonal businesses from a devastating cut to their workforce.  
   "We won this by working together with small businesses and watermen fighting on the ground, and me fighting on Capitol Hill with my colleague, Senator John Warner (R-Va.)," said Senator Mikulski. "I have been fighting for years to help good guy businesses and workers wade through the unfair procedures that were part of the H2B visa process. This extension protects workers, and gives us another congressional session to keep up the fight until we make this cap exemption permanent!" 
   The Save Our Small and Seasonal Businesses Act, signed into law by President Bush in May 2005, made significant changes to the federal H2B (non-skilled seasonal worker) visa program. Among the changes, it exempted returning seasonal workers from counting against the national cap of 66,000 people, created new anti-fraud provisions, and ensured a fair allocation of H2B visas among spring and summer employees. The cap exemption provides significant relief to Maryland's seafood and cannery industry that often hires the same dependable workers every year. 
   "I told small businesses they could count on me to keep fighting until we had a solution and they had the seasonal workers they needed to stay in business," said Senator Mikulski. "Without these seasonal workers, many businesses would not survive - forced to limit services, lay off permanent U.S. workers or, worse yet, close their doors." 
   The H2B extension: 
   * Protects our borders by rewarding immigrants who play by the rules - returning to their home countries after finishing their jobs. 
   * Protects American workers by requiring employers to recruit American workers before hiring immigrant workers. 
   * Keeps small and seasonal businesses open by guaranteeing the labor supply needed during their peak seasons when they can't find American workers to take the jobs.
