SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES ANNOUNCE FEDERAL FUNDING FOR CECIL COUNTY FIREFIGHTERS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that the Singerly Fire Company in Cecil County is being awarded $183,986 in federal funding through the Department of Homeland Security's Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. Sen. Mikulski is on the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program and fights each year to increase federal money for the program.  
   At the request of the Singerly Fire Company, Senator Mikulski sent a letter to the Office of Domestic Preparedness Director C. Suzanne Mencer to draw her attention to the merits of their application and urge her to give it every appropriate consideration. 
   "I'm so proud of Maryland's firefighters, risking their lives to protect others," said Senator Mikulski. "But we need to protect our protectors with the best equipment training and resources. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in the safety of our first responders and Cecil County. Congratulations to the Singerly Fire Company on being awarded this well-deserved money."
   "As was demonstrated during the 9/11 tragedies and during other emergencies across Maryland and the Nation on an almost daily basis, the heroism and diligence of America's firefighters and first responders is crucial to the health and safety of our communities," said Sarbanes. "These hard-working firefighters deserve the most-up-to-date equipment, and I am pleased that this funding is being awarded to assist them in their efforts to protect their respective communities."
   The Singerly Fire Company, located in Cecil County, will use its federal award of $183,986 to purchase to purchase 60 sets of complete turn out gear and 60 individualized SCBA face masks. The individualized masks will prevent firefighters from using a face mask that does not fit properly and thereby potentially exposes the first responder to deadly carcinogens and cross contamination from other users. 
   The Department will also purchase a thermal imaging camera, to enable firefighters to find people in smoke-filled buildings or other low-visibility situations who may be hurt or otherwise unable to get out of the buildings themselves. Firefighters can use the camera to locate hidden fires and minimize property damage. These federal funds will also be used by the Singerly Fire Company to buy Fire Studio Computer Simulator Software and a life size dummy, to simulate real life rescue situations. 
   For more information on the Singerly Fire Company, please contact Chief Robert Muller at 443-309-0562. 
   Cecil County Fire Departments have received four awards through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program this year, totaling $836,000 in federal funding. 
   So far this year, 53 Maryland Fire Departments have been awarded a total of $6,493,132 in funding through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. Last year, one in three Maryland fire departments that applied for funding received grants, totaling $8,153,505 - a 100 percent increase from the previous year. 
   The Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program is a competitive program that awards one-year grants directly to local fire departments across the country. Fire departments can apply for federal assistance for training and equipment, fire education and awareness programs, or firefighting vehicles. This year, approximately 20,400 departments nationwide applied for funding, totaling more than $2.5 billion in requests. Grants for this funding cycle will be awarded weekly until September 2005. 
   This year, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security has approved a $700 million budget for the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program. This will fund less than one-third of the requests received this year. While this is $200 million over President Bush's budget allocation, it is a cut of $46 million from last year's funding level. This will reduce the number of fire departments who will be awarded funding this year. 
   Senator Mikulski introduced an amendment to the 2005 Homeland Security spending bill that would have increased federal funding for the Fire Grant Program by $200 million, funding it at its authorized level of $900 million. According to the National Fire Protection Association, an estimated 57,000 firefighters lack personal protective gear, one-third of firefighters per shift do not have self-contained breathing equipment, and half of all fire engines are at least 15 years old. 
   Increasing the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program by $200 million, this amendment could have meant protective gear for 200,000 firefighters, more than 650 new fire trucks, 400 new rescue vehicles or more than 33,000 new breathing masks. Senator Mikulski's amendment failed by a vote of 50-45.
