SEN. MIKULSKI PUSHES FOR GREATER FEDERAL INVESTMENT IN RETURNING SOLDIER CARE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) has joined Sens. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) and Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) to introduce an amendment to better fund the systems and programs available to troops returning from Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposal is part of the emergency supplemental bill currently being considered by the Senate.  
   "Our worst fears have come true. It seems our troops are at war in Iraq and Afghanistan, and then at war at home to get the health care they need and deserve," said Senator Mikulski. "We know our military medical doctors and nurses are performing heroically, saving lives on the battlefield and in acute care. But what happens when they come home? We don't need just phrases and yellow ribbons; we need action." 
   This amendment would provide $113 million in Department of Defense Health funding to: 
   * Hire additional caseworkers to facilitate the speedier processing of paperwork submitted by recovering service members at military medical treatment facilities; 
   * Hire additional mental health and crisis counselors to assist recovering service members and their families; 
   * Develop a new secure system to allow recovering service members to submit required paperwork on the internet and to allow the tracking and review of submitted paperwork on the internet; 
   * Develop a women's mental health treatment program to assist female service members who have experienced post-traumatic stress disorder or sexual assault and abuse, including the hiring and training of sexual abuse counselors; and 
   * Require a study by the National Academy of Sciences on the mental health needs of returning service members based on the landmark 1983 National Vietnam Veterans Readjustment Study. 
   The amendment is based on the Dignity for Wounded Warriors Act (S. 713), which Senator Mikulski also co-sponsored with Senators Obama and McCaskill in early March.
