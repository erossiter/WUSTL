SEN. MIKULSKI STANDS UP FOR FEDERAL RETIREES' HEALTH BENEFITS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) stood up for retired federal employees today by joining Sen. John Warner (R-Va.) in supporting a bill that would provide tax relief for retirees' health care (S. 773). The bill would allow civilian and military federal retirees to pay health insurance premiums for the Federal Employee Health Benefits (FEHB) and TRICARE programs on a pre-tax basis.  
   "Federal employees dedicate their lives to serving the public. This bill would offer some relief to our retired postal workers, scientists at the Food and Drug Administration, Census Bureau workers and service members who have worked hard to serve our communities," said Senator Mikulski. AOur federal retirees - from Fort Meade to NIH - deserve to know that they will be able to afford the health care they need." 
   This bill gives federal retirees some financial relief by allowing them to use pre-tax dollars to pay health care premiums. This benefit allows the average federal employee to save $820 per year while they are still working, but is not available after they retire. 
   Without this benefit, the price of federal employees' health insurance will increase the day these public servants retire. And with health care costs rising faster than cost-of-living increases to retirement benefits, this bill is critical to helping federal retirees afford their care. 
   "Federal employees are America's true patriots. These hardworking men and women are on the front lines every day, working hard for America," said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to stand up for the issues that matter to them - while they are employed and after they go into retirement." 
   Similar legislation was introduced in the 109th Congress and was co-sponsored by a bipartisan group of 64 Senators, but it never became law.
