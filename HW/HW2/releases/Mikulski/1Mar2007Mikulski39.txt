SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE OF KIDNAPPED ISRAELI SOLDIERS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) to demand the immediate and unconditional release of three Israeli soldiers who are being held captive by Hamas and Hezbollah terrorists.  
   "I condemn these heinous acts of the Hezbollah and Hamas terrorists. These soldiers must be released immediately and these militants need to be stopped," said Senator Mikulski. "My deepest sympathy goes out to the families of these missing soldiers." 
   On June 25, 2006, Hamas terrorists crossed into Israel to attack a military post - killing two soldiers, and injuring and kidnapping a third, Gilad Shalit. On July 12, 2006, Hezbollah terrorists crossed into Israel to attack troops patrolling the Lebanese border - killing three soldiers, and injuring and kidnapping two others - Ehud Goldwasser and Eldad Regev. 
   Hamas and Hezbollah have withheld all information on the health and welfare of the kidnapped soldiers and prevented access to the Israeli captives by competent medical personnel and representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross. 
   "Terrorists destroy lives. They also destroy hope. They destroy the opportunity for peace," said Senator Mikulski. "I stand proudly with unabashed and unwavering support for Israel, and will continue to call for their soldiers to come home." 
   Senators Mikulski and Clinton introduced a Senate resolution today to demand the soldiers' release. The resolution also expresses "vigorous support and unwavering commitment" to Israel as a secure, democratic state, and strong support of resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict by creating an independent Palestinian state living peacefully alongside Israel.
