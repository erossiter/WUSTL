SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES NEARLY $466 MILLION FOR D.C. METRO AREA FACILITIES IN SPENDING BILL
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, today announced the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs 2008 spending bill provides $984.2 million for projects at Maryland's military facilities, including $719.7 million in Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) projects. The legislation, which passed the full Senate Appropriations Committee this afternoon, contains provisions for military installations nationwide, with federal funding totaling $21.55 billion to support new construction costs.  
   "I told Maryland's military leaders I would fight for this funding. My promises made are promises kept," said Senator Mikulski. "A stronger America begins at home. That's why every year, I fight to make sure our military has the tools they need to keep us safe. I will keep up my work to make sure Maryland communities have what they need in the federal checkbook to implement the BRAC recommendations." 
   THE SPENDING BILL PROVIDES $466 MILLION FOR D.C. METRO AREA MILITARY FACILITIES: 
   * $214.8 million in BRAC funding for the Joint Medical Command headquarters at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda. 
   * $150 million for the U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases at Fort Detrick. 
   * $52.1 million for the National Maritime Intelligence Center in Suitland. 
   * $28 million in BRAC funding for the Air National Guard and Readiness Center headquarters at Andrews Air Force Base. 
   * $21.1 million in BRAC funding for the Center of Excellence for Infectious Disease at the Walter Reed Annex in Forest Glen. 
   The bill also includes $87.5 billion for critical Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) programs, a significant $4 billion more than the President requested and the largest increase for veterans' health care in the 77 years of the department's existence. 
   In the next step of the appropriations process, the bill will go to the Senate floor for a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
