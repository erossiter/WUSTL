SEN. MIKULSKI'S FREEDOM TO ACHIEVE INITIATIVE BECOMES A REALITY
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee, today praised the congressional passage of the College Cost Reduction and Access Act (H.R. 2669), which includes an additional $20 billion in college aid benefits that go directly to students, and makes significant steps toward improving access to higher education for students nationwide. The bill now goes to the President for his signature.  
   "College is part of the American dream, it shouldn't be part of the American financial nightmare. Families want help and they want to know what the United States Congress is doing to help them," said Senator Mikulski. "That's why I'm proud this legislation offers good news for students who want access to an education and the freedom to achieve the American dream." 
   Senator Mikulski's Freedom to Achieve initiative is aimed at making sure all students have access to higher education so that they can follow the American dream. She has been a consistent fighter in the Senate effort to make college more affordable and providing students with the tools and resources they need to stay competitive. 
   The College Cost Reduction and Access Act addresses several of Senator Mikulski's priorities: 
   * Increases Pell Grants: raises grants from $4,310 to $5,400 by 2012. 
   * Money for students, not banks: increases student aid by $20 billion by cutting back on student loan-related government subsidies to banks. 
   * Reduces borrowers' interest rates: cuts student loan interest rates in half from 6.8 percent to 3.4 percent for undergraduate students with subsidized student loans. 
   * Loan forgiveness: forgives direct student loans for borrowers who have worked 10 years in public service, including the military, and caps monthly loan payments at 15 percent of a borrower's discretionary income. 
   * Loan deferment for active military: expands loan deferment for active duty military, including the National Guard, while they serve during a war or military operation. 
   The legislation also creates two new grant programs that focus on Senator Mikulski's mission to empower minority and high-need schools. TEACH [Teacher Education Assistance for College and Higher education] grants will provide $4,000 in aid for undergraduate and graduate students who commit to teach in high-need schools. Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs) and other Minority Serving Institutions will now become eligible for a new $510 million grant program to increase recruitment of minority students into science, technology, engineering, mathematics, high-need languages, nursing and teaching fields.
