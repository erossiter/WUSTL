SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES $17.5 MILLION FOR BALTIMORE AREA DEFENSE PROJECTS IN FEDERAL SPENDING BILL
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today announced the Senate version of the Department of Defense 2008 spending bill includes $61.5 million for defense projects in Maryland, including $17.5 million in the Baltimore area. The legislation, which passed the subcommittee today, funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops with the equipment they need on the battlefield, the benefits and services they deserve when they return home, and support for their families on the home front. We know how critical these funds are for our troops to fulfill their mission and return home safely," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for our troops." 
   The $17.5 million for Baltimore area defense projects includes: 
   * $5.5 million for Advanced Surface Radar Technologies to develop and integrate the next generation of radar technology on Navy ships. This preserves 50 jobs in Baltimore and will create hundreds more in the future. 
   * $5 million for the Laser Marksmanship Training System for cheaper, safer, more realistic weapons training for troops in the field. 
   * $4 million for Combat Desert Jacket procurement. Funding will provide lightweight, durable, comfortable combat wear for deployed Marines. The Marine Corps has confirmed a need for the gear. 
   * $3 million for the Knowledge Integration and Management Center of Excellence (KIMOE) at Morgan State University in Baltimore for tactical intelligence analysis and distribution for Army Brigade Combat Teams, a collaboration between Army Research Lab Adelphi and the Morgan State Engineering Department. 
   A full Appropriations Committee vote is expected tomorrow morning on the spending bill. The bill will then move to the Senate floor for debate and a vote, which has not yet been scheduled.
