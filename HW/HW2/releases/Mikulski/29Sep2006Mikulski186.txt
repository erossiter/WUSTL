CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES MORE THAN $1 BILLION FOR BALTIMORE AREA PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2007 Defense spending bill, which includes an additional $1 billion for Baltimore-area defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much-needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families."  
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $1 billion in funding for Baltimore-area defense projects, including: 
   * $520.7 million for the Navy Littoral Combat Ship Surface Combatant, next generation Navy ships capable of operating in coastal areas and supporting total Maritime Domain Awareness in the Global War on Terror. 
   * $390.9 million for the Air Force E-10A Multi-Sensor Command and Control Aircraft to develop next-generation technology for wide-area surveillance, wideband communications, and near-realtime comprehensive air views and surface battle space. 
   * $186.4 million to develop Space Radar to provide the United States with a persistent, worldwide, near-instantaneous system to detect moving surface targets, including those inside enemy territory. 
   * $135.4 million to replace Cobra Judy, a 50-year-old ship-based radar suite used for data collection against ballistic missiles for treaty monitoring and verification. 
   * $12.6 million for Advanced SEAL Delivery System (ASDS), for system improvements to a manned combat submersible. 
   * $5.55 million for Advanced Surface Radar Technologies to develop and integrate the next generation of radar technology on Navy ships. 
   * $3.9 million for Project Ancile, which will research, design, build, demonstrate, test and evaluate a suite of building protection systems to protect critical U.S. government buildings against existing and evolving threats. 
   * $3.25 million to develop a Heavy Fuel Engine for the Shadow Tactical Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to reduce Army logistics by requiring one type of fuel on the battlefield. 
   * $3 million for the Center for Resuscitation Research, which will use the Maryland State Trauma System as a trauma testbed for the Army. 
   * $2.6 million for Marine Advanced Combat Garments, to procure combat desert jackets to enhance U.S. Marine's survivability in high desert and cold/dry environments similar to those in Northern Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   * $2.6 million for the Laser Marksmanship Training Program (LMTS), which contributes to individual soldier and unit readiness, greatly reduces training costs, and lessens the environmental impact of live fire training. 
   * $1.3 million to develop Affordable Towed Array Construction to allow anti-submarine and at-sea surveillance technology to be towed behind Navy ships. 
   * $1.1 million for the Phraselator Language Translation System, a machine-based translation device that allows Army personnel deployed in the field to immediately translate phrases from English to other languages. 
   * $1 million for Fort Meade Fire Department to purchase new firefighting vehicles. 
   * $1 million for Anthrax Monoclonal Antibody Therapeutic and Prophylaxis Program to continue the development of a human antibody to protect against inhalation anthrax. 
   * $1 million for Lightweight Small Arms Technologies to reduce the weight of both weapons and ammunition so troops in the field have weapons that are easy to operate and maintain, and are reliable under all conditions. 
   * $1 million for the Submarine Low Power Computing C3I, in order to develop a carry-on C3I system to provide the processing and display technologies necessary to address all the critical functions required for safe operation during sea trails.
