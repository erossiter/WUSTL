SEN. MIKULSKI HONORS VOLUNTEERS WITH NATIONAL AND GLOBAL YOUTH SERVICE DAY
  With National and Global Youth Service Day approaching, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) honored the youth who provide community service in our nation and around the world. Sen. Mikulski joined a bipartisan group of her colleagues led by Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) in introducing the 2007 National and Global Youth Service Resolution to designate tomorrow's holiday. The resolution passed the Senate unanimously yesterday evening.  
   "We've seen young Americans step up to the plate time after time in the face of crisis. This National Global Youth Service Day, I especially want to honor the hard work of all the young people who have been helping out with Hurricane Katrina recovery," said Senator Mikulski. "They are taking time out of their lives to help their fellow Americans in their time of need - and they are doing it out of the goodness of their hearts." National and Global Youth Service Day is an annual public awareness and education campaign that highlights the valuable contributions young people make to their communities. It is aimed at mobilizing America's youth to serve their communities, supporting young people who are beginning to dedicate their lives to service, and educating the public about contributions young people make volunteering around the world. 
   "I want to say thank you to all the young people everywhere who volunteer their time and service to help others. America's youth tackle the toughest problems in their communities and around the world. They are unflagging and unflinching," said Senator Mikulski. "Their extraordinary, dedicated and compassionate work demonstrates the power of national service to make a difference."
