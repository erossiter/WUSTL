FEDERAL FUNDING FOR KEY PROJECTS COMING TO EASTERN SHORE
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-MD) today announced that several key projects in the Baltimore region are slated to receive funding in the FY05 Omnibus Appropriations bill. This legislation has passed the House of Representatives and the Senate. It is now sent to the President for his signature. The more than $388 billion omnibus spending bill completes the 9 remaining appropriations bills needed to fund the federal government through fiscal year 2005. To stay within the spending constraints demanded by the White House, all programs in the bill were cut by 0.80 percent.  
   "As a United States Senator, I work to put money in the federal checkbook that creates jobs and builds communities. This final legislation is the culmination of a year's worth of work with Maryland communities to identify where a federal investment would be best used," said Senator Mikulski. "These projects represent the best of local, state and federal priorities. Maryland can count on me to keep standing up for the day-to-day needs of my constituents and the long-range needs of the nation." 
   "We are bringing a bounty of federal funds to the State of Maryland that will aid our communities, our economy, our transportation network, and our environment; and thereby enhancing the quality of life and providing opportunities for people throughout the entire State," added Senator Paul S. Sarbanes. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes worked together to secure funding for the following projects: 
   EDUCATION 
   * $248,000 for Villa Julie College to establish a Nursing Distance Learning program. This money will be spent on distance learning technology to coordinate between Villa Julie College and a group of Maryland community colleges and hospitals. A successful pilot version of this program was just complete with Chesapeake College and Memorial Hospital in Easton. This program is providing leadership to deal with the severe nursing shortage. 
   * $258,000 for Washington College for equipment and infrastructure technology for the college's new arts center. 
   TRANSPORTATION 
  * $2.976 million to continue the dualization project of MD 404 (Shore Highway.) Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes have fought each year to secure federal funding to upgrade 1.8 miles of the existing highway to a four-lane divided highway from Double Hills Road to Sennett Road. They have secured almost $8 million in federal funding since 2001. 
   * $3.472 million for US 113. Funds will be used to upgrade to a four lane divided highway from Woodside Lane to north of Public Landing Road. 
   CHESAPEAKE BAY AND THE ENVIRONMENT 
  * $496,000 for the Atlantic Coast of Maryland Hurricane Protection Project. Funds will be used to continue the periodic nourishment and maintenance of Maryland's Atlantic coastline. 
   In order to help ensure maintenance of existing flood control projects, and to help address the backlog in maintenance dredging of small navigation projects, Eastern Shore communities will receive the following federal grants: 
   * $432,000 for Ocean City Inlet and Sinepuxent Bay 
   * $124,000 for Upper Thorofare 
   * $149,000 for Knapps Narrows 
   * $99,000 for Nanticoke River 
   * $714,000 for Wicomico River 
   * $99,000 for Tilghman Island Harbor 
   The omnibus bill includes federal funding for the "State and Tribal Assistance Grants" (STAG) for special needs water and wastewater infrastructure projects. These grants are typically used for wastewater infrastructure improvements that reduce the amount of nutrients entering waterways, and the associated health and environmental impacts. Maryland communities have received $2.8 million this year in STAG grants, including the following federal grants for Eastern Shore communities: 
   * $248,000 for Hurlock 
   * $744,000 for Kent Island 
   * $248,000 for Easton 
   * $248,000 for Salisbury 
   * $248,000 for Cambridge 
   AGRICULTURE 
   * $22.8 million for the Animal, Plant, Health Inspection Service (APHIS) to ensure that this division of the USDA has the resources it needs to lower the risk of Low Pathogen Avian Influenza and protect Maryland poultry interests. 
   Senator Mikulski serves on the Appropriations Committee and is the Senior Democrat on the Appropriations Subcommittee on Veterans Affairs, Housing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies. Senator Sarbanes serves on the Budget Committee.
