SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NOMINATIN OF JUDGE ALBERTO GONZALES
  Statement of Sen. Barbara Mikulski:
  "Today, President Bush announced his nomination of Alberto Gonzales to replace John Ashcroft as Attorney General. I have three criteria I use to examine all Executive Branch nominees: competence, integrity and commitment to the core mission of the Department. 
   "As the Senate considers this nomination, we must thoroughly review Judge Gonzales' experience and record both in his service in the White House and as a Judge on the Texas Supreme Court. The Attorney General must enforce federal law while protecting our civil rights and our civil liberties."
