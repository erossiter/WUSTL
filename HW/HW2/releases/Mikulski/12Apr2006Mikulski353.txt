SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR GARRETT COUNTY
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has approved a $500,000 grant for Garrett County. The federal funds, along with $3.5 million from state sources, will be used to construct infrastructure improvements at Broadford Business Park near the town of Oakland.  
   Specifically, the ARC funds will be used for the design and construction of public water and sewer lines, a natural gas line, and conduits for electrical, fiber optic and broadband cables. 
   "This grant will help in the completion of a new comprehensive business park, which will serve as an incubator for job creation," said Sarbanes. "I'm glad to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support job growth in our State's rural areas, as is evident in the Broadford Business Park project." 
   "This funding is a federal investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Garrett County will be able to use these funds to continue to develop and grow. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
