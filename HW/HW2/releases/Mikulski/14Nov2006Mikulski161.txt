SENATE WOMEN GATHER FOR TRADITIONAL POWER WORKSHOP
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), Dean of the Senate Women, today gathered the women Senators for her traditional, bipartisan Senate Women Power Workshop. Sen. Mikulski created the bipartisan workshop in 1992 as an opportunity for newly elected women Senators to learn how to get started in the Senate.  
   "I started my power workshops to make sure that new female Senators have the tools they need to succeed in the U.S. Senate," said Senator Mikulski. "The women Senators are not a caucus, we're a force. We hold powerful leadership and committee positions, and work in coalition to get things done with civility and respect. We believe that every issue is a woman's issue." 
   There are now a record 16 women serving in the U.S. Senate. Before Senator Mikulski's election in 1986, only 15 women had ever served in the Senate. The first woman Senator was Rebecca Latimer Felton in 1922, who was appointed to fill a two-day vacancy in the seat. Prior to 1992, there were never more than two women serving in the Senate at the same time.
