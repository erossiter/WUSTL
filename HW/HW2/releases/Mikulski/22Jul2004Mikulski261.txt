SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORT BY 9-11 COMMISSION
  "I thank the ten members of the bipartisan 9/11 Commission for their service to our nation and service to the 9/11 families.  
 I appreciate the Commission's integrity, independence and intellectual rigor. The Commission followed all the leads, built on the classified work of the Intelligence Committee, and did their work out in the sunshine. This unanimous report gives us a vivid look at what happened leading up to September 11 and a direction for reform.
   "We owe it to the 9/11 families and the nation to reform our intelligence community and provide resources for homeland security. This must be a unified effort. We must stand together as the red, white and blue party.
   "Reform of our intelligence agencies must be broad, deep, authentic and undertaken with a sense of urgency. This will send a message that America will not be intimidated; that we stand ready to protect and defend our homeland. Our national security, our national honor and our standing in the world depend on it.
   "We must be unified in providing resources for homeland security. We need a robust effort to protect our protectors, protect the American people and protect critical infrastructure."
