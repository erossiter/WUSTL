SEN. MIKULSKI RESPONDS TO FEMA DIRECTOR'S RESIGNATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) issued the following statement today following Michael Brown's resignation as Director of FEMA:  
   "Only a new FEMA director will begin to restore the American people's faith in FEMA. President Bush must promptly appoint a new director who is an emergency management professional. 
   "The focus now must be on recovery and the future. We need to reform FEMA. FEMA must become FEMA again. FEMA must regain its focus on the 3 "R"s: Readiness, Response and Recovery. It should return to its risk-based mission, and stand prepared to respond to all hazards, from tornadoes to terrorists. 
   "This was its original purpose when I led the effort to reform FEMA in the 1990s. It's what made the agency so effective. That's what will save lives and communities and ensure that failures like this will never happen again."
