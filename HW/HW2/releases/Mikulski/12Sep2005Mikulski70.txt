SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON BUSH'S FEMA PICK
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) issued the following statement this afternoon after the White House announced President Bush's intention to designate R. David Paulison to be Acting Under Secretary for Emergency Preparedness and Response at FEMA:  
   "The appointment of R. David Paulison to replace Michael Brown is great news for America and the victims of Hurricane Katrina. President Bush is to be applauded for selecting a highly qualified and experienced emergency management official, as I have called for. 
   "With new capable leadership, FEMA can again lead the way in saving lives and saving communities. We must vigorously continue the recovery effort throughout the devastated Gulf Coast. But, Mr. Paulison must also quickly surround himself with similarly experienced professionals to get this most important job done. 
   "He must then turn his attention to what went wrong in the federal response to this tragedy and make sure it can never happen again. The American people must know that FEMA, our front line at home in emergencies, is ready for all hazards, from tornadoes to terrorist attacks. 
   "Regaining the confidence of the American people through actions, not press releases, will be job one for David Paulison. I'm anxious to work on a bipartisan basis with Mr. Paulison, all the professionals of FEMA and the administration to rebuild FEMA."
