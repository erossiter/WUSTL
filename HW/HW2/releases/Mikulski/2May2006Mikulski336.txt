SEN. MIKULSKI HONORED BY AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION FOR SUPPORT OF LOW-INCOME LEGAL AID
  In recognition of her continued support of access to legal aid for low-income Americans, Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) will be honored tomorrow with an award from the American Bar Association (ABA) for her work on behalf of the Legal Services Corporation (LSC). ABA President Michael Greco will present the award.  
   "Legal Services Corporation is a critical source of legal aid for low-income Americans. Without legal services, there would be no legal help for millions of Americans," said Senator Mikulski. "I know there is concern about funding for this program to reach those most in need and to have enough lawyers to work on these cases. I will continue to do everything I can to fight for funding for legal services." 
   Created in 1974, LSC is a private, non-profit corporation established by Congress to ensure that low-income Americans have access to civil legal aid. Instead of directly providing legal services, LSC provides competitive grants to independent, local legal service providers. In 2005, 138 local programs were the recipients of LSC grants, including Maryland's Legal Aid Bureau, which has 13 offices throughout the state. 
   Despite the increasing number of Americans eligible for LSC legal aid, funding for the program has decreased by $13 million in the past three years. Last year, Senator Mikulski offered an amendment to add $14 million to LSC budget. The amendment was defeated by the House in conference. 
   LSC was funded at $327 million in the FY 2006 budget. Senator Mikulski is the senior Democrat on the Senate Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations subcommittee, which funds LSC.
