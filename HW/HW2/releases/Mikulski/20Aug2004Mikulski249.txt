SEN. MIKULSKI VISITS NASA'S WALLOPS FLIGHT FACILITY, ANNOUNCES NEW LAUNCH PROJECT THAT WILL GENERATE MORE BUSINESS, MORE JOBS
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today toured NASA's Wallops Flight Facility and announced that NASA will release $10 million to develop a new, low-cost rocket called the Falcon that will be used to place small payloads into orbit around the earth.  
 The Falcon - a joint NASA/Department of Defense project - would lower costs for small payload launches, making it possible to increase the number of launches at the Wallops Flight Facility. 
   "The employees at Wallops are the best and the brightest, working hard every day to make our country safer with the best aerospace technology, stronger with the new ideas that create jobs here at home, and smarter with scientific and technological breakthroughs," said Senator Mikulski. "I'm proud to work with Wallops Flight Facility so they can continue to grow, attract new business and create new jobs." 
   Senator Mikulski has been a strong advocate for the Wallops Flight Facility. In 2000, she directed NASA to update the Wallops Strategic Plan to help strengthen their core competencies, develop new business, and create more jobs. In 2002, Senator Mikulski added $10 million to Wallops budget to implement this new Strategic Plan, which focuses on small government launches and scientific payloads. They also used the funding to upgrade their infrastructure. 
   More specifically, with the $10 million secured by Senator Mikulski, Wallops was able to build a new payload processing facility, a new liquid fueling facility and a new launch simulator. They were also able to upgrade launch control equipment and improve range safety. These improvements have enabled Wallops to improve efficiency, lower costs and attract new launch business - including the Falcon project.
