SEN. MIKULSKI STANDS UP FOR EMPLOYEES' SICK LEAVE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined a group of her colleagues led by Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) to introduce the Healthy Families Act (HFA), which would guarantee working Americans up to seven paid sick days to care for themselves and their families.  
   "American families are feeling stressed and strained, and we know that health care coverage is one of the most important issues facing Americans. But, what good is health care coverage if employees can't get the time off work, or lose a day's pay, to use it?" said Senator Mikulski. "I will continue to fight to make sure working families will not be left behind when it comes to their health." 
   Currently, almost one half of private sector workers have no paid sick days. Two-thirds cannot take paid time off to go to the doctor or to care for a sick child or family member. 
   The HFA would apply to employers with 15 or more employees. In addition to guaranteeing sick days for employees' and their families' medical conditions and doctor's appointments, the bill would provide pro-rated leave for part-time employees who work 20-30 hours a week or 1,000-1,500 hours a year. The Secretary of Labor would be allowed to enforce these rights in a federal or state court, and employers would be required to notify their employees of paid leave and how to report violations. 
   Under the HFA, employers would be allowed to maintain existing policies that meet these standards and would be encouraged to provide greater benefits. If employees request three or more days off of work, employers would be allowed to request certification for the leave. 
   This legislation also calls for a Government Accountability Office (GAO) study of how its policies are implemented and the negative and positive effects on employers. 
   Senator Mikulski is a senior member of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee.
