CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES MORE THAN $13 MILLION FOR SOUTHERN MARYLAND PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2007 Defense spending bill, which includes $13.85 million for defense projects in Southern Maryland. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces.  
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families." 
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $13.85 million in funding for defense projects in Southern Maryland, including: 
   * $5 million for the Energetics Technology Center/S&T Workforce Revitalization, which is a joint effort with the University of Maryland and Charles County to develop an innovation workforce in Southern Maryland. 
   * $3.25 million for the Patuxent River Naval Air Station Atlantic Test Range to upgrade communications technology. 
   * $2.6 million for the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division at Pax River to upgrade and support network centric operations.

   * $1 million for Sure-Trak: Chesapeake Bay Observation System/Capital Area Defense for a data-sharing infrastructure and inter-facility communications protocol to enhance core military mission capabilities within the Chesapeake Bay and National Capital Region.
