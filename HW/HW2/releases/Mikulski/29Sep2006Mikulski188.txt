CONGRESS APPROVES DEFENSE SPENDING BILL, INCLUDES MORE THAN $100 MILLION FOR DC METRO AREA PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) announced today that both the U.S. House and Senate have given final approval and sent to President Bush for his signature the 2007 Defense spending bill, which includes an additional $100 million for DC area defense projects. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much-needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families."  
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $100 million in funding for defense projects in the Washington, D.C., metro area, including: 
   * $85.6 million for the Movement Tracking System (MTS), to allow Army commanders to communicate with and track the locations of vehicles in the field. 
   * $4.55 million for the Naval Ship Hydrodynamic Facilities at Carderock to replace and improve ship-testing facilities. 
   * $3 million to complete the development of a Hybrid Electric Powertrain, which will allow the Air Force to reduce logistic requirements and mitigate environmental impact. 
   * $2.5 million for the Army Research Laboratory and University of Maryland PEM Fuel Cell Tactical Generators Initiative to develop lighter and more fuel efficient generators. 
   * $2 million to develop the Autonomous Sustainment Cargo Container (ASCC) Delivery System, which allows at-sea off-loading of cargo onto self-propelled containers to get supplies into ports that are overcrowded or deemed not secure. 
   * $1.8 million for Fibrinogen Bandages for Military Use to protect against blood loss and stop severe arterial bleeding. 
   * $1.5 million for the Fort Detrick Technology Transfer Initiative, which is an ongoing program that provides grants to small businesses to develop new technologies for military use. 
   * $1.3 million to integrate Army radio systems and mount communications systems on Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to reduce vulnerability in the field and increase the range of radio communications. 
   * $1.1 million for Battlefield Extraction and Retrieval (BEAR) Robot, to develop a field-ready robot to extend the capabilities of military medical personnel by retrieving casualties from unsafe, rough or uneven terrain, or from buildings and other structures. 
   * $1.1 million for the Multi-Purpose Biodefense Immunoarray Program to develop additional immunoarrays for pathogens, and to develop multi-agent arrays for other types of bio-threats, including encephalitis viruses, hemorrhagic fever viruses, and multiple toxins. 
   * $1 million for the Asymmetrical Protocols for Biodefense Enhancement, a program that researches effective means to increase the survival rate during a biological weapons attack. 
   * $1 million for Broad Spectrum Anti-viral Host Oriented Therapeutics, a project that develops therapeutics to fight against multiple strains of influenza and have the potential to combat biological warfare threats and emerging diseases. 
   * $1 million for Anthrax Skin Patch Technology to develop and test a skin patch that would offer a more effective, faster and needle-free delivery of the anthrax vaccine to troops in the field.
