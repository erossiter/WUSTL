SENATE APPROVES $65.5 MILLION FOR HARFORD, CECIL COUNTY DEFENSE PROJECTS
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced the full Senate has approved the 2007 Department of Defense spending bill, which includes $65.5 million for defense projects in Harford and Cecil Counties. The legislation funds the Department of Defense and will go toward critical research, development, test and evaluation programs, as well as weapons and equipment required for the U.S. Armed Forces. 
   "We need to do everything we can to support our troops - not just with words, but with deeds. Together, we can do better. These much needed funds will help our troops fulfill their mission both at home and abroad," said Senator Mikulski. "I will keep fighting to put money in the federal checkbook for U.S. troops and their families."  
   "We continue to work hard to ensure that Maryland's military installations and their personnel have the resources and capabilities necessary to carry out their critical missions and this funding helps in these endeavors," said Senator Sarbanes. "This bill also provides needed funding to enable our troops to have the most up to date equipment and research resources for them to successfully carry our their missions." 
   The spending bill includes more than $65.5 million in funding for defense projects in Harford and Cecil Counties, including: 
   ABERDEEN PROVING GROUND 
   * $5 million for Rotorcraft Survivability Assessment Facility to develop, design, and field test systems and equipment in combat realistic conditions. 
   * $5 million for a Laser Based Detector for Explosive, Chemical and Biological weapons. 
   * $5 million for the Spinel Tactical Armor Manufacturing Production Technology to create lighter, stronger and cheaper armor for ground vehicles and aircraft. 
   The bill also includes: 
   * $12 million for the M22 Automatic Chemical Agent Alarm (ACADA), a man-portable chemical agent point detector that detects nerve and blister agents. This is primarily used before an attack to provide early warning of chemical agents. 
   * $10 million for Improved Chemical Agent Monitor, a hand-held soldier-operated post-attack device that provides a means of quickly locating the presence or absence of nerve and blister agent contamination on personnel and equipment in both combat and homeland defense missions. 
   * $10 million for Profiler, a state-of-the-art meteorological measuring system that provides critical meteorological information required for accurate artillery fire. Profiler will optimize the performance of both current and future artillery weapons systems. 
   * $7.5 million for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System for the Army National Guard, including a set of Gore-Tex outerwear (parka, liner and trousers) designed to provide extraordinary protection during cold and/or wet weather for Guard troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan in support of the Global War on Terror. 
   * $7 million for Extended Cold Weather Clothing System for Army Reserve troops deployed to Iraq or Afghanistan in support of the Global War on Terror. 
   * $3 million for Next Generation Non-Tactical Vehicle Propulsion to bring the Army one step closer to deploying hydrogen fuel technology in the field. 
   * $1 million for the development of Florescence Activated Sensing Technology (FAST) Integrated Threat Management System, which will provide rapid, simultaneous detection and identification of biological agents, chemicals and toxins. 
   In the next step of the legislative process, the House and Senate will meet in Conference Committee to work out the differences between the two versions of the bill. The Conference report will then be voted on by both Houses of Congress. Once passed by the House and Senate, the Appropriations bill will go to the President for his signature.
