SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $400,000 IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING FOR MARYLAND'S SCENIC BY-WAYS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-MD) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-MD) today announced that the Federal Department of Transportation has awarded the State of Maryland grant monies totaling $464,880 to fund six separate scenic byway projects. 
   The six projects receiving funding are:  
   * The Historic National Road (HNR) project has been awarded two grants totaling $85,000. A $60,000 grant will be used to develop Historic National Road Community Guidelines for the Maryland National Road Association. The guidelines will identify ways to guide growth, change, and roadside development along the HNR. The second grant of $25,000 will go towards the continued implementation of the Corridor Partnership Plan (CPP), which is the central tool used by byway leaders to organize activities, investments and planning goals. The HNR, which is designated with several route numbers including Route 40, parallels Interstates 70 and 68 and is a Main Street to many urban areas and small towns from Baltimore to Grantsville, Allegany County; 
   * The "15 on 15" Marketing Program for the Catoctin Mountain Scenic Byway has been awarded a $44,480 grant to create a four-color map and guide showcasing the corridor's recreational, natural, and historic qualities, coupled with a display, website, and advertisements to generate demand for the piece. The Tourism Council of Frederick County, Inc. will coordinate the project which runs from the Potomac to the Mason Dixon Line; 
   * The Religious Freedom Tour Corridor Plan will use a $150,400 grant to fund a Corridor Management Plan for the entire Religious Freedom Tour in Southern Maryland, which stretches 139 miles from Northern Charles County to St. Mary's County. The plan will develop effective strategies to tell some of the most powerful stories of southern Maryland's four centuries including Maryland's beginnings and religious toleration, tobacco culture and it's shaping of the rural landscape, war and conflict during the American Revolution, War of 1812, the Civil War, and the maritime traditions along the Potomac River; 
   * Michener's Chesapeake Scenic Byway Project will receive $160,000 to create a Corridor Management Plan for approximately 220 miles of roadways winding through Talbot, Caroline and Dorchester Counties and penetrating the region described in James Michener's famous novel "Chesapeake" under the name "Michener's Chesapeake Scenic Byway;" and 
   * The Chesapeake Country Scenic Byway, located primarily on Route 213 and Route 18 in Cecil, Kent and Queen Anne's Counties, will receive $25,000 to develop and retain established partnerships along the Chesapeake Country National Scenic Byway. A part-time coordinator will continue to develop a sustainable byway organization, hold public meetings to publicize goals and achievements, administer existing grants and seek partnering opportunities to continue implementing the corridor management plan. 
   "Maryland has a rich cultural, historical, and environmental heritage," said Sarbanes. "Our scenic byways are one of the true treasures of our state and these funds will help see to it that all who live in and visit Maryland will have an opportunity to enjoy their rich beauty and heritage." 
   "I'm proud of this federal-state partnership to protect Maryland's heritage and promote our tourist economy. These grants will help commuters and visitors enjoy the state's terrific combination of natural beauty and American history," said Senator Mikulski. "Marylanders can count on me to continue to work in the Senate to keep our roadways and culture a priority in the federal checkbook."
