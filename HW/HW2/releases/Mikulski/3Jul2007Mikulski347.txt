SENS. MIKULSKI, CARDIN ANNOUNCE $688,000 FOR SOMERSET COUNTY WASTE MANAGEMENT PROJECT
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today announced the Fairmount Landfill in Westover, Md., will receive $688,000 from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development to help meet its state environmental requirements. The money was administered through a Water and Waste Disposal Direct Loan to the Somerset County Commissioners.  
   "Somerset County wants to do right by the environment, but they can't do it on their own. That's why I'm proud to have fought for this federal funding to bring the landfill up to code and to help keep our Eastern Shore communities clean," said Senator Mikulski, a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee. "I will continue to fight to keep Somerset County and the environment a priority in the federal checkbook." 
   "These Rural Development funds will be a great assistance in helping the community protect the environment," said Senator Cardin, a member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee. "Solid waste is a leading cause of pollution and these funds will help Somerset County improve its Fairmont Landfill to meet Maryland Department of Environment standards." 
   The funding will be used to complete construction of cell three of four on the Fairmount Landfill solid waste project in Somerset County. This will help the landfill meet the Maryland Department of Environment's requirement concerning water table changes. In addition to today's funds, the project has received nearly $1.3 million in loans since fiscal year 2005. 
   Today's funding comes as Senator Mikulski prepares to meet with Somerset County Commissioners on Friday, July 6, in Berlin, Md., as part of her "Jobs Today, Jobs Tomorrow" tour to discuss county priorities, and how Maryland's federal delegation can help provide necessary resources to the region.
