  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Benjamin L. Cardin (both D-Md.) today introduced a resolution congratulating the Johns Hopkins University Blue Jays on winning the 2007 NCAA Division I Men's Lacrosse Championships.  
   "I am incredibly proud of the Johns Hopkins Men's Lacrosse team," said Senator Cardin. "They played a close, intense game and fought until the very last second to secure their victory. From its origins as a Native American sport to professional lacrosse today, lacrosse is an integral part of Maryland's culture and history. I join with my fellow Marylanders in congratulating the Blue Jays on their impressive victory." 
   "I am so proud of the young men of this lacrosse team, who showed Duke and the country why the Black and Blue now hold nine national championships. The Blue Jays' great victory shows the hard work, spirit and heart of an amazing team and the support of an outstanding University," said Senator Mikulski. "Congratulations to every member of the men's lacrosse team. I thank the players and coaches for the excitement of such a wonderful season and I am looking forward to next year when you fight for a tenth championship title!" 
   This is the Blue Jays' second NCAA Men's Lacrosse Championship victory in three years and ninth victory since 1974.
