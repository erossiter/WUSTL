SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $2.3 MILLION IN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT FUNDING FOR MARYLAND'S EASTERN SHORE
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes and Barbara A. Mikulski (both D-Md.) today announced that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) has approved more than $2.3 million in low interest loans for two Lower Shore development projects.  
 The funding comes from the USDA's Rural Development Program in the form of a Community Facility Direct Loan and a Business and Industry Guaranteed Loan. 
   The first loan, totaling $1,718,895, will be used to fund the construction of the water and sewer infrastructure for the new Dorchester Technology Park in Cambridge which hopes to attract additional small businesses and jobs to the area. 
   The second loan, totaling $653,037, will fund the purchase and installation of internet broadband equipment throughout Worcester County. The project will provide Worchester residents, farmers, businesses and public services access to high-speed internet service. 
   "Small businesses are a crucial part of Eastern Shore's economy," said Sarbanes. "It is critical that developing businesses have the resources and technology they need, and this funding will provide them with a significant foundation on which they can build and prosper." 
   "This funding is a federal investment in Eastern Shore communities today and tomorrow," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Dorchester and Worcester Counties will be able to use these funds to continue to develop and grow." 
   The USDA's Rural Development Program's aim is to help the people of rural America develop sustainable communities and improve their quality of life through guaranteed loans, grants, technical assistance, research and educational materials.
