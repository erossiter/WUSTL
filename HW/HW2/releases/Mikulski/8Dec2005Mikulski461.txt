SENS. MIKULSKI, SARBANES ANNOUNCE FINAL STEP IN FUNDING METRORAIL BLUE LINE IN PRINCE GEORGE'S COUNTY
  Sens. Barbara A. Mikulski and Paul S. Sarbanes (both D-Md.) today announced the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) has received a $25.4 million grant in the final step to fund the extension of a key Maryland commuter section of the city's Metrorail system.  
 The grant will help complete a three-mile addition to the Blue Line Metrorail from the existing Addison Road Station to the Largo Town Center in Prince George's County. 
   "This is great news for commuters and visitors to the Washington metropolitan area. We must expand public transportation and provide an easy, safe and efficient way for workers and tourists to move throughout the region," said Senator Mikulski. "By extending the Blue Line from Addison Road to Largo, we can help to reduce congestion on roads and offer a more convenient way to travel." 
   "This funding will enable WMATA to complete the first major expansion of the area's Metrorail system beyond the original 103 mile system and help to alleviate traffic congestion in the area," added Senator Sarbanes. 
   The Metorail has been under development since the 1960s. After completion, the extension will include two new stations: Morgan Boulevard, which will be located at the mid-point of the new section, and the final terminal at the Largo Town Center. 
   Senators Mikulski and Sarbanes previously fought to include more than $76.15 million in the FY 2005 Omnibus Appropriations Bill for the final design and construction of the extension. 
   Senator Mikulski is a member of the Appropriations Committee and the senior Democrat on the Commerce, Justice, Science Subcommittee. Senator Sarbanes is the senior Democrat on the Banking Committee.
