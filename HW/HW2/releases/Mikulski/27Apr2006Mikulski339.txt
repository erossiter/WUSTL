SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE RECIPIENTS OF CHESAPEAKE BAY WATERSHED GRANTS
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) announced today that 5 projects throughout Maryland were recently chosen to receive funding, totaling over $3 million, from the Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watersheds Grant Program. This program provides financial and technical support to projects that expand the most innovative, sustainable and cost-effective strategies for reducing excess nutrients within specific tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay.  
   "Nitrogen pollution is one of the major factors slowing Bay restoration efforts," said Sarbanes. "Significant efforts must be made to restore the living resources and buffer zones needed to protect rivers and streams and this funding will directly aid those efforts." 
   "The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watershed Grants Program is critical to the health of the Bay and its rivers and streams. Investing in our waterways helps clean up the Bay and shores up the local economy," said Senator Mikulski. "The Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure and an integral part of our identity as Marylanders. That's why Senator Sarbanes and I work hard to fund effective restoration projects that save the Bay and help the Marylanders who depend on it for jobs and for recreation." 
   The projects receiving funding are: 
   * Environmental Defense will use a $582,500 grant to work directly with 350 farmers in the Lower Susquehanna River Basin, including Cecil County, MD, to improve on-farm nutrient use efficiency. The Initiative expects to reduce annual nitrogen loads to the Susquehanna River by over 2 million pounds from over 42,000 acres of farmland; 
   * The Maryland Department of Agriculture, in collaboration with the Agricultural Research Service Beltsville, the Caroline Soil Conservation District, the Natural Resource Conservation Service, the University of Maryland Extension Service, and Public Drainage Associations, will use its $596,600 grant to work with farmers in the Choptank River watershed to reduce nutrient and sediment loads. The project expects to reduce annual nitrogen pollution to the Tuckahoe sub-basin by over 31,000 pounds; 
   * A $798,300 grant will be used by the University of Maryland to reduce nutrient losses from dairy farms in the Monocacy watershed, including parts of Fredrick, Montgomery and Carroll Counties, by as much as 30-40%. The project expects to reduce annual nitrogen pollution to the Monocacy River by close to 250,000 pounds; 
   * The Corsica River Watershed project, which is a partnership among the Chesapeake Bay Recovery Partnership, the Alliance for the Chesapeake Bay and the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, will use a $600,000 grant to address urban and suburban stormwater runoff in the Corsica River watershed. The project will result in the treatment of 50 acres of urban/suburban lands, as well as restoring 10 acres of wetlands and creating of 50 acres of riparian buffers; and 
   * Virginia Tech is partnering with Virginia Commonwealth University and two oyster producers to assess the potential for commercial oyster production. Four demonstration sites will be installed and monitored, two of which will be located in Maryland - St. Jerome Creek and St. Thomas Creek in St. Mary's County. 
   The Chesapeake Bay Targeted Watersheds Grant Program is a partnership among the Chesapeake Bay Program, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, the Chesapeake Bay Trust and the Environmental Protection Agency.
