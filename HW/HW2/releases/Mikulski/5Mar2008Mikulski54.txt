SEN. MIKULSKI CONTINUES FIGHT TO INCREASE NURSE FACULTY TO COMBAT SHORTAGE
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) in introducing the Troops to Nurse Teacher bill to address the insufficient number of nurse faculty that lies at the heart of America's ongoing nursing shortage. The bill establishes the Troops-to-Nurse-Teachers (TNT) program and encourages nurses transitioning from the military to become full-time faculty at nursing schools. The bill was previously included as an amendment to the fiscal year 2008 Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1585), but it never became law. 
   "Our nation is facing an ongoing shortage of nurses, and it is only getting worse. The shortage affects every state, every city, every town - and it affects our troops in Afghanistan and Iraq," said Senator Mikulski. "The Troops-to-Nurse-Teachers program takes real steps to address this crisis. I will continue to fight for nurses, who are so critical to our health care system."
   In order to address the current shortage, all branches of the military are offering incentives to encourage nurses to join the Armed Services. However, nursing schools are forced to turn away thousands of qualified applicants each year - largely because of faculty shortages. Without sufficient faculty to increase student capacities at nursing schools, the shortage will continue. The TNT program is aimed at increasing the number of nurse faculty members to expand enrollment and alleviate the ongoing shortage. It establishes incentives for nurses transitioning from the military to become full-time nurse faculty, including:
   * Fellowship Programs: Provides nurse officers who have a graduate degree in nursing an opportunity to serve a two-year tour of duty as educators at nursing schools. In return, these nursing schools would provide scholarships to nursing students who would serve in the military after graduation.
   * Scholarship Programs: Offers scholarships for military personnel who are retiring and seeking education to become nurse educators.
   * Transitional Assistance Programs: Offers help for military nurses who are already qualified to teach in securing placement in nurse educator roles and obtaining additional education as needed for new position.
   The shortage of nurses nationwide and in all health care settings was first noted in 1998. In response, Senator Mikulski introduced the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002, which expanded existing programs and created new ones in Title VIII of the Public Health Service Act that offer financial assistance for nursing education and training in order to encourage men and women to enter the nursing field. Senator Mikulski has been a consistent advocate for nursing throughout her 30 years in Congress, and has worked to increase scholarships and access to programs to address the nation's growing shortage.
