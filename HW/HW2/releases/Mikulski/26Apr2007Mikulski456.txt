SEN. MIKULSKI HONORS 59TH ANNIVERSARY OF ISRAELI'S INDEPENDENCE
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today joined Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kansas) in introducing a resolution to commemorate the 59th anniversary of the independence of Israel. The resolution is expected to pass the Senate unanimously this evening.  
   "I am honored today to congratulate the Israeli people on their celebration of the 59th anniversary of their country's independence," said Senator Mikulski. "Israel is a steadfast strategic ally of the United States. I stand proudly with unabashed and unwavering support for Israel. I will always fight for its survival and viability." 
   On May 14, 1948, Israel became a sovereign and independent country and the United States was one of the first countries to recognize it - 11 minutes after its creation. 
   The resolution introduced today recognizes Israel's independence as significant to providing a "national homeland for the Jewish people" and expresses strong support for Middle East peace efforts. It commends the support the United States has provided to Israel, across party lines, since its independence 59 years ago, and congratulates the two countries for working together last year to strengthen their bilateral relations in defense, diplomacy and homeland security.
