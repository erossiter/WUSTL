SENS. SARBANES, MIKULSKI ANNOUNCE OVER $800,000 IN FEDERAL FUNDING FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN WESTERN MARYLAND
  Sens. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) and Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced that the Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) has approved a grant totaling $820,679 for Western Maryland. These funds will be directed towards the improvement and development of local access roads into the new Rolling Mill site.  
   Specifically, the grant will be used to construct and improve approximately 0.47 miles of local access roads leading to the Rolling Mill commercial and industrial development site in the City of Cumberland. The project will enhance economic development and job creation in the area with potentially 200 new jobs created upon development of the Rolling Mill commercial site. The Federal Highway Administration will be serving as the federal agency for this project, and the Maryland State Highway Administration will administer the project. In addition, the City of Cumberland will provide $832,026 to the project. The total estimated project cost is $1,652,705. 
   "This grant will play a crucial role in the continuing success of economic development and job creation in Western Maryland," said Sarbanes. "I'm glad to see that the Appalachian Regional Commission has continued to support economic growth in our State's rural areas, as is evident with grant." 
   "This federal funding is an investment in jobs today and jobs tomorrow in Western Maryland," said Senator Barbara A. Mikulski. "I'm so proud that Western Maryland has received these grants to develop and grow by attracting new businesses and economic development. I will keep fighting for a federal investment in Maryland communities." 
   The Appalachian Regional Commission is a federal-state partnership that works with the people of Appalachia to create opportunities for self-sustaining economic development and improved quality of life.
