SEN. MIKULSKI CALLS ON PRESIDENT BUSH TO ADDRESS DAY-TO-DAY NEEDS OF STRUGGLING AMERICANS
  As President Bush prepares to deliver his annual State of the Union address tonight, Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) called for him to reach across the aisle to work with Congress for an immediate fix to the looming economic crisis. With American families struggling with unstable job and housing markets and the high costs of gas, energy and health care, Senator Mikulski urged President Bush to work on a bipartisan basis to get things done. While the President continues to spend billions of dollars every week on the War in Iraq, Senator Mikulski also highlighted the need to bring American troops home safely and swiftly.  
   "What we need to hear from George Bush is this - the economy is facing very serious challenges and we need to act," said Senator Mikulski. "Mr. President, give us a plan. Please put politics aside; be more conciliatory. I'm willing to put politics aside, get down to work and focus on a stimulus package that helps our economy and helps our families."
