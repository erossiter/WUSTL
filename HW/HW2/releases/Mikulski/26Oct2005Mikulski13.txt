SEN. MIKULSKI JOINS COLLEAGUES IN URGING BUSH TO BE FAIR TO WORKERS IN GULF COAST RECONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) will join a group of her Senate colleagues led by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) today to introduce legislation addressing the Bush administration's misplaced priorities in the effort to rebuild the Gulf Coast. The Rebuild with Respect Act seeks to provide resources to residents coping with the administration's unfair employment practices, and would provide for fair wages, local jobs and employee benefits.  
   "The response of the federal government to this natural disaster has itself been a complete disaster. We must do everything we can to make sure the people of the Gulf Coast are not further victimized by the failed policies of the federal government," said Senator Mikulski. "We need to make sure that the victims of Hurricane Katrina have the assistance they need to rebuild their lives and take care of their families. Words and thanks and prayers are not enough. That's why I am proud to stand with my Senate colleagues to introduce this important legislation." 
   The Rebuild with Respect Act would: 
   * Allow Gulf Coast families to rebuild their own communities by requiring all recipients of federal disaster relief funds to employ individuals displaced from jobs or residences by Katrina and Rita and ensuring that federal contracts go to local businesses in the Gulf Coast region. 
   * Ensure that workers who have lost everything do not lose fair wages, too, by reinstating the protections of the Davis-Bacon Act for workers in the construction industry. 
   * Recognize and address the racial inequalities that have sparked national outcry by requiring contractors receiving federal disaster relief funds to fully comply with all affirmative action requirements applicable under law. 
   * Ensure that the federal contracting process is fair to small and disadvantaged businesses. 
   * Protect the health and safety of recovery and reconstruction workers and volunteers in the Gulf Coast region by requiring federal agencies to develop a coordinated health and safety plan that includes safety training, needed equipment and monitoring of safety conditions. 
   * Provide economic security for those who have difficulty finding jobs by providing an emergency extension of unemployment insurance benefits and expanding eligibility for the Disaster Unemployment Assistance program.
