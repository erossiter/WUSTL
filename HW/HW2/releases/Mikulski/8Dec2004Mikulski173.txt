SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON HUBBLE REPORT ISSUED BY NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES
  "I commend the National Academy of Sciences on this outstanding report. I fought to add $300 million to NASA's budget for a Hubble servicing mission and I will continue to advocate for a mission to take place. NASA has the experience, the technology and now it has the money. It's time to fix Hubble - Congress and the American people expect nothing less. 
   "That is why Senator Bond and I will hold an oversight hearing in February on the future of Hubble where we will hear from the National Academy and from NASA."
