SEN. MIKULSKI ISSUES STATEMENT ON WHITE HOUSE RESPONSE TO SPACE SUMMIT INVITATION
  Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today expressed disappointment at the tepid response she has received from the White House on her request that President Bush convene a bipartisan, bicameral space summit with the White House to address the future of America's space program and the challenges it faces. Sen. Mikulski is Chairman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee that funds NASA.  
   "While I appreciate the response from departing OMB [Office of Management and Budget] Director Rob Portman and White House Science advisor John Marburger, I regret the President did not address this invitation himself," said Senator Mikulski. "As always, I will continue my ongoing dialogue with NASA Administrator Griffin and welcome discussions with White House officials. However, I will continue to seek a new dialogue with the President. Only through the active cooperation of the White House and the Congress, can we have a healthy, robust and balanced space program."
   Seventeen years ago, then-President George H. W. Bush and Vice President Dan Quayle held a similar meeting, which paved the way for the creation of the Mission to Planet Earth.
