SEN. MIKULSKI ANNOUNCES MORE THAN $1 MILLION IN GRANTS TO FIGHT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN IN MARYLAND
  Senator Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.) today announced three Maryland organizations have received more than $1 million in grants from the Department of Justice's Office of Violence Against Women for projects around the state. Senator Mikulski, Chairwoman of the Commerce, Justice, Science (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee, secured money for the grants in the fiscal year 2007 CJS spending bill.  
   "I have absolutely no tolerance for domestic violence. That's why I strongly support legislation and grant programs that help protect women and their families from continued violence and abuse," said Senator Mikulski, an original champion of the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA). "I will continue my fight to put funds in the federal checkbook to fund these important programs." 
   The following grants will be used in violence against women efforts around the state: 
   * $550,000 for the Sexual Assault Legal Institute (SALI) at the Maryland Coalition Against Sexual Assault (MCASA) in Arnold. The funding will be used for SALI to continue providing legal representation, supportive services and outreach to sexual assault victims around the state. SALI will also work closely with MCASA's non-legal staff, Maryland's 18 rape crisis and recovery centers, MCASA's statewide Sexual Assault Forensic trainings, College Project and Sexual Assault Response Teams. 
   * $300,000 for the Sexual Assault/Spouse Abuse Resource Center Inc. in Bel Air through the Legal Assistance for Victims Grant Program. The funds will go toward legal representation, supportive services and outreach to victims of domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking in Harford County and surrounding communities. 
   * $232,900 for the Family Crisis Resource Center Inc. in Cumberland through the Transitional Housing Grant Program. Funding will go toward providing short-term housing assistance and related expenses - including transportation, utilities payments, counseling, child care and case management - for victims fleeing domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault or stalking in search of permanent housing. 
   Earlier this year, Senator Mikulski fought to restore President Bush's proposed $20 million cut to the Office of Violence Against Women, and secured $390 million for the office in the 2008 CJS spending bill, which passed the full Appropriations Committee in June. 
   Domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault and stalking are crimes of epidemic proportions, exacting terrible costs on individual lives and our communities. Nearly 25 percent of U.S. women report that they have been physically assaulted by an intimate partner during their lifetimes, 1 in 6 have been the victims of attempted or completed rape, and the cost of intimate partner violence exceeds $5.8 billion each year.
