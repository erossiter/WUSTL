DEMING SCHOOLS GET TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE FUNDING, AID FOR ALTERNATIVE H.S.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded funds awarded to Deming Public School District that will support local alternative school education and allow 10 schools to expand computer labs.  
   The award of $675,988 was secured by Domenici last year as part of the FY2004 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill (Labor-HHS). Domenici is a senior member of the Senate appropriations committee that sets funding levels for the U.S. Department of Education. 
   "This is a big award for Deming that will benefit all public schools in the area. With these funds, schools can add equipment to their computer labs and combine traditional lessons in core subjects with the newest advancements in technology," Domenici said. 
   "Good planning on behalf of the Deming school district has made room for these funds to also support local alternative high schools that are specifically designed toward at-risk students and the district's comprehensive improvement plan," he said. "Deming is to be commended for their hard work and dedication in providing their students with the best resources and education possible." 
   The Education Department issued the award through the Fund for the Improvement of Education (FIE) for technology improvements, alternative school enhancements, and support of the District Improvement Plan. 
   The district plans to provide credit recovery classes at Hofacket Mid High, the alternative school, for students at risk of dropping out of school. The Deming school district contains seven elementary schools, one middle school, one mid-high, and one high school. 
   The aims set down by Deming Public Schools comply with standards mandated by the President's No Child Left Behind initiative that direct schools to make modifications to ensure all students elevate academic achievements, especially in the core subjects.
