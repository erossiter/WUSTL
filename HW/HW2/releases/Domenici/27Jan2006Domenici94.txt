SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE HEAD START CONSTRUCTION FUNDS RELEASED
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has released funding he secured to help build a new Head Start education center in Santa Fe.  
   HUD is releasing $1.16 million as part of the Economic Development Initiative (EDI) grant to Presbyterian Medical Service in order to begin the construction of the new center in southern Santa Fe. 
   Domenici successfully secured the earmarks as part of the 2005 VA-HUD Appropriations Act. He is the only member of the New Mexico congressional delegation to serve on the congressional appropriations committee. 
   "I am very pleased to know that the construction of this facility will begin," Domenici said. "Funding early childhood education will ensure students a better opportunity for a successful academic career. I am confident that these types of programs will be beneficial to our communities in the future." 
   The funds will be released to Presbyterian Medical Services who is the sole provider of Head Start services in Santa Fe. Domenici secured another $1.13 million in FY2006 for the construction project. 
   In August, Domenici toured the existing Manderfield Head Start Center in Santa Fe where he met with children and staff. He pledged his continued support to help funding increased for Head Start programs on the Senate floor.
