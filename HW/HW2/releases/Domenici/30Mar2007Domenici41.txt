SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS NATIONAL LITERACY BILL THAT WOULD DIRECT MORE FUNDING TO N.M.
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced his support today for legislation that will increase federal funds and attention on adolescent literacy education nationwide and in New Mexico.  
   Domenici joined a bipartisan group of senators to cosponsor the Striving Readers Act (S. 958). The legislation, introduced by Senators Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) and Patti Murray (D-Wash.), authorizes federal funds for grants to states and districts to improve literacy programs among middle and high school students. New Mexico is expected to receive about $11.8 million annually once the legislation is fully implemented. 
   "Reading is a skill that is most often built early on, but there are still those who lag behind and need help during later grades," said Domenici. "This legislation authorizes the funds needed to help states and districts further develop adolescent literacy programs. I hope that in doing so, we can improve the overall quality and effectiveness of the education these students receive." 
   The current Striving Readers program, which impacts literacy among children in later grades, received only $29.7 million during FY2006, which is enough for only eight grants nationwide. This legislation would authorize federal funds, beginning with $200 million in FY2008 and increasing funding through 2012, to improve the existing program which would make funds for adolescent literacy programs available to every state. 
   The Striving Readers Act would: 
   * Help states create statewide literacy initiatives for students in grades 4 through 12, share data on student progress with parents and the public, and improve teacher training and professional development in literacy. 
   * Help districts and schools create plans to improve literacy for adolescents, develop assessments, train teachers in every subject area in literacy strategies and use regular data to improve teaching and learning. 
   * Allow districts and schools to hire and place literacy coaches, train parents to support the literacy development of their children, and connect learning inside the classroom with learning outside the classroom. 
   * Require the federal government to complete an overall evaluation of the program to determine its impact on the nation's middle and high schools. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federal programs. He is also a staunch advocate for educational measures to improve America's competitive edge. He was an original author of the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, which was integrated into the National Competitiveness Investment (NCIA) Act in October. Earlier this month, he joined with a bipartisan group of senators in introducing the America COMPETES Act, which contains many provisions of NCIA and aims to improve America's involvement in scientific and technological education and career fields.
