SENATE APPROVES SEN. DOMENICI BILL TO IMPROVE N.M. STATE ENGINEER'S WATER ASSESSMENT RESOURCES
  The Senate has approved a bill authored by Sen.  
 Pete Domenici to give the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer (OSE) federal help to carry out its work to assess New Mexico's water inventory and its future use. 
   The Senate passed the New Mexico Water Planning Assistance Act (S.2460) by unanimous consent. The bill is cosponsored by U.S. Senator Jeff Bingaman. 
   The bill authorizes the state of New Mexico to receive technical assistance from the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS). It authorizes a total of $12.5 million ($2.5 million per year for 2005-2009) for the OSE to perform hydrologic models of New Mexico's most important water systems, basins and tributaries. 
   "There is no more important issue for the state of New Mexico than water. The unfortunate fact is that our State Engineer does not have the resources it requires to carry out all the assessments and investigations we need to face our water problems," Domenici said. "My legislation will alleviate some of this strain." 
   "Managing water, particularly in these times of drought, requires the best tools and data available. This bill will provide assistance that will ensure that New Mexico is in the best position possible to effectively manage its scarce water resources," Bingaman said. 
   The federal agencies aiding the OSE will provide technical assistance, such as acquiring hydrologic data, assessing existing water resources, coordinating efforts with federal water management initiatives, and assisting with numerical analysis and modeling to provide an integrated understanding of water management options. 
   The bill will now be referred to the House of Representatives.
