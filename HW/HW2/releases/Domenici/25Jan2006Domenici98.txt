SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN, PARTNERS UNVEIL 'PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE' LEGISLATION
  Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Jeff Bingaman (D-N.M.) today formally launched their bid to ensure American's competitive edge in the world, particularly by encouraging more youth to study math, science and high technology. 
   The New Mexico Senators banded with Senators Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) and Barbara Mikulski (D-M.D.) to introduce the Protecting America's Competitive Edge Act (PACE Act), a comprehensive package of legislation focused on maintaining the United States scientific and technological edge.  
   The PACE Act, incorporated in three bills, would greatly increase federal investment in math and science education, basic science and energy research, and research and development tax incentives. The bipartisan effort was crafted to implement 20 recommendations outlined in "Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter Economic Future," a National Academies of Science report issued last October. 
   "It is clear to us that energizing American brainpower must be a priority. Every facet of our lives, from national security to modern medicine to the everyday household goods, relies on technology. There are troubling signs we are not keeping pace with other advancing nations. We must change, and that change is reflected in the PACE Act," Domenici said. 
   "The PACE Act doubles research and development funding, and makes a tremendous investment in education to ensure our country is producing the mathematicians, scientists and engineers who can fill the high-wage jobs of the future. The passage of this farsighted public investment initiative will ensure that the United States is stronger, smarter, and leads the world in scientific and technological innovation well into the future," Bingaman said. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, and Bingaman is the senior ranking member of the panel. Both lawmakers have long records of working to promote science, technology and education in the Senate. 
   Domenici, Bingaman and Alexander met with President Bush and White House officials to discuss the competitiveness issue on Dec. 15. Since then, White House Chief of Staff Andy Card and Education Secretary Margaret Spellings have both highlighted the need to improve interest in science and technology. 
   Through the Energy Committee, Bingaman and Alexander last May asked the National Academies of Sciences and Engineering and the Institute of Medicine the question: "What are the ten top actions, in priority order, that federal policy makers could take to enhance the science and technology enterprise so the United States can successfully compete, prosper and be secure in the global community of the 21st century?" 
   The National Academies responded by assembling a distinguished panel of business, government, and university leaders headed by Norm Augustine, former CEO of Lockheed Martin. As part of its deliberations, the panel reviewed over 150 proposals and made 20 recommendations in four broad categories: K-12 education, research, higher education, and incentives for innovation. 
   The following is a summary of the goals and key provisions of the PACE Act: 
   PROTECTING AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE Act 
   Domenici ? Bingaman ? Alexander ? Mikulski 
   * Focuses on keeping America's science and technology edge - as much as 85 percent of our per capita growth in incomes since World War II has come from science and technology. 
   * Helps America continue to set the PACE in the competitive world marketplace. 
   * Keeps our brainpower edge by strengthening K-12 math and science education, attracting bright college students to the sciences and investing in basic research. 
   In a package of three bills, the PACE Act implements 20 recommendations contained in an October report by the National Academy of Science titled "Rising Above the Gathering Storm." 
    Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Energy Act (PACE-Energy): 
   Increasing our investment in energy research and in educating future American scientists. 
    Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Education and Research (PACE-Education): Investing in current and future math and science teachers and K-12 students, attracting bright international students, and investing in non-energy related basic research. 
    Protecting America's Competitive Edge through Tax Incentives (PACE-Finance): Doubling the research & development tax credit and allowing a credit for employee education. 
   *** KEY PROVISIONS of the PACE Act *** 
   * Strengthening the nation's traditional commitment to research: 
   ** More research opportunities for scientists and engineers: 
   Increases basic research spending by up to 10 percent per year for seven years at several federal agencies, including the national laboratories. This investment would generate hundreds, maybe thousands, of new inventions and high-tech companies. 
   ** Targeted research grants for early career scientists and engineers: 
   Creates a special research fund for 200 outstanding young researchers across the nation each year. 
   ** New federal funds to buy equipment and upgrade research laboratories: 
   Provides a special pool of funds for the nation's research infrastructure to purchase updated research equipment and upgrade lab capabilities. 
   ** A New Agency for Transformational Energy Research: 
   Establishes a new research agency within the Department of Energy tasked with developing transformational energy technologies that bridge the gap between scientific discovery and new energy innovations. This agency would be patterned on the management practices of a Pentagon research agency (DARPA) that contributed to innovations like the Internet, stealth technology and global positioning systems. 
   ** High-Risk, High-Payoff Research: 
   Directs federal research agencies to develop guidelines that allow eight percent of R&D budgets to be devoted to high-risk, high-payoff research which falls outside the peer review and budget allocation process. 
   * Improving K-12 Science/Math Education: 
   ** Scholarships for Future Teachers of Math & Science: 
   Each year, up to 10,000 bright students would receive a 4-year scholarship to earn a bachelor's degree in science, engineering or math, while concurrently earning teacher certification. In exchange for these scholarships, they would be expected to serve for at least four years as a math or science teacher. 
   ** Math & Science Teacher Training Programs: 
   Funds part of the costs for new math and science teacher training programs based in math and science departments at universities across the country. These programs will stress a solid content knowledge of their subject while also providing the training necessary for teacher certification. ** Summer Academies for Teachers: 
   National laboratories and universities across the country would host 1-2 week academies each summer for up to 50,000 math and science teachers so they can get some hands-on experience and take back new, improved ideas for energizing their students. 
   ** Advanced Placement Courses in Math & Science: 
   The federal government would provide funding to help establish non-profit organizations to promote Advanced Placement (AP) classes in math and science - tripling the number of students who could join these college-preparatory programs that consistently produce the highest achievers. 
   ** Specialty Math & Science High Schools: 
   States would be eligible to apply for a grant from the federal government to establish a new high school specializing in math and science that students from across each state could attend. 
   ** Internships and Summer Programs for Middle and High School Students: 
   Provides unique internship and program opportunities for middle and high school students at national labs and other technology and scientific research facilities. 
   * Increasing the Talent Pool by Improving Higher Education: 
   ** Scholarships and Fellowships for Future Scientists: 
   Each year, up to 25,000 bright young Americans would receive a 4-year competitive scholarship to earn a bachelor's degree in science, engineering or math, so that our brightest students pursue studies in these fields which are so critical to our economic growth. Up to 5,000 students who have already earned their bachelor's degree, would compete to receive graduate research fellowships to cover education costs and provide a stipend. 
   ** Attracting the Brightest Foreign Students to our Universities: 
   Provides an efficient student visa process for bright foreign students to come here to study math, technology, engineering and science and then to stay here - contributing to our economic growth rather than being forced by an outdated immigration system to go home and produce the best new technology in India or China. 
   * Growing our Economy by Providing Incentives for Innovation: 
   ** Doubling the Research & Development Tax Credit to Encourage Innovation: 
   Doubles the current R&D tax credit and makes it permanent - so companies conduct ground-breaking, job-producing research here, rather than building new facilities overseas. 
   ** Creating a Tax Credit to Encourage Employers to Invest in Employees' Education: 
   Establishes a new tax credit to cover costs from providing continuing education to employees - so employees can learn cutting-edge skills. 
   ** Development of Science Parks: 
   Supports the development of science parks through infrastructure planning grants and loan guarantees so that U.S. science parks are competitive with those throughout Asia.
