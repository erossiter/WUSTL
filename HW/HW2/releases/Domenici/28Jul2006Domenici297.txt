SEN. DOMENICI: LAS CRUCES LANDS FEDERAL 'PARATRANSIT' FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded $990,000 to the city of Las Cruces to purchase replacement buses that are accessible to those with disabilities. 
   The DOT funds, approved during the FY2004 appropriations process, will be used to purchase five buses to replace four buses that were built before 1990 and are not handicap accessible. The new buses will be compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).
   "I am pleased to see the last of the funds from this FY2004 transportation appropriation is being awarded to Las Cruces. The city has needed to replace very old buses that did not accommodate the entire community for a long time," Domenici said.
   In 2003, Domenici served on the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee which drafted the FY2004 Appropriations Bill that provided these federal transit funds.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that last week approved $140,000 for Las Cruces to purchase paratransit vans for its fleet as part of the FY2007 Transportation, Treasury, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill.
   The funds were awarded through the Federal Transit Administration.
