SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES EPA GRANT TO PROTECT N.M. WATER
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the New Mexico Environment Department has received $1.75 million from the Environmental Protection Agency to improve the quality of the state's water supply.  
   The funding is administered under the EPA's Region 6 grant program. It will be used to implement projects from New Mexico's Nonpoint Source Management Program in order to reduce water pollution caused by runoff from rain or snow and restore those already affected. 
   "In a state that is as arid as New Mexico, it is especially important that we take steps to preserve our existing water supply," said Domenici. "While New Mexico has already taken steps to protect our water, these funds from the EPA will help us go a step further in implementing part of our chosen courses of action." 
   The EPA Region 6 grant program administers funds to the south central United States, including Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, Oklahoma, and Texas. Indian tribes also fall under its jurisdiction.

   Domenici is a long time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which oversees funding for federal programs, including those under EPA jurisdiction. 
   On Monday, the president's FY2008 budget proposal for the EPA recommended $21 million for environmental protection in New Mexico, included the following for water quality programs: 
   * Clean Water Act Section 319 funding: $2.3 million to control non-Point Source pollution, $200,000 decrease from FY2006 enacted levels. 
   * Public Water Systems Supervision funding: $1.0 million to help monitor drinking water quality and enforce health standards, $600,000 dollar decrease from FY2006 enacted levels. 
   * Clean Water State Revolving Fund: $3.4 million to improve the quality of the rivers, lakes, and streams, a $2 million decrease from FY2006 enacted levels. 
   * Drinking Water State Revolving Fund: $8.3 million to provide low interest loans to municipalities to build, improve, and prevent pollution in drinking water systems. This is a $1.1 million decrease from FY2006 enacted levels.
