CARLSBAD FIRM GAINS $1.16 MILLION WIPP CONSTRUCTION CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that a Carlsbad company has been awarded a contract worth over $1.16 million from the Department of Energy (DOE) for services at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant.  
   Domenici, who serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the DOE and WIPP, said the new contract would be awarded to Constructors Inc. of Carlsbad. 
   "I am very pleased to see WIPP continue to create job opportunities for the area and that a local company secured a significant work contract for this federal facility. The federal funds will support the company's task to restore some of the WIPP facilities to keep the plant operational," Domenici said. 
   Constructors, Inc. will provide minor construction services in support of the facility's restoration requirements. 
   The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, or WIPP, is the world's first underground repository licensed to safely and permanently dispose of transuranic radioactive waste left from the research and production of nuclear weapons. 
   Located in the remote Chihuahuan Desert of southeastern New Mexico, WIPP began operations on March 26, 1999 and includes disposal rooms mined 2,150 feet underground in a 2,000-foot thick salt formation that has been stable for more than 200 million years. Transuranic waste is currently stored at sites nationwide. 
   The President's budget for FY2006 includes $225.5 million for the DOE Carlsbad Area Office and WIPP. This amount includes $24.5 million in transportation funding to be provided directly to the State.
