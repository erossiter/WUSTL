SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES LOAN FOR NORTHERN RIO ARRIBA ELECTRIC COOPERATIVE
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that Northern Rio Arriba Electric Cooperative, Inc. has been approved for a $3.1 million loan.  
   The loan funds will be used to build 24 miles of new distribution lines and to make other system improvements throughout Rio Arriba County. The term of the loan is 35 years at the U.S. Treasury rate. 
   "Improving the electric service in these rural areas is important," Domenici said. "Enhancing these services are also important for the development of these rural communities. I am very happy to see that these funds have been extended to the Rio Arriba County co-op." 
   The loan was approved through the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development program. The Rural Development program plays an important role in providing better community facilities to rural communities.
