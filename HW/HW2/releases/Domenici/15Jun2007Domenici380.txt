SEN. DOMENICI: EDUCATION DEPARTMENT AWARDS FUNDS TO ABQ GROUP TO AID CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES IN FOUR CORNERS REGION
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Education (DoED) will award $99,000 to the Abrazos Family Support Services in Bernalillo to improve services to families dealing with disabilities in the Four Corners region.  
   Abrazos Family Support Services will use the funds to provide training, information, and support services that will help parents with disabilities and parents of children with disabilities. The program expects to primarily assist parents living on reservations in the Four Corners region and ensure maximum benefit to their children during their school years. 
   "It is beneficial to provide parents with resources to help them make the most of education and opportunities available to both themselves and their children," said Domenici. "I am happy to see this funding made available to non-profit organizations that can help fill in where government falls short." 
   The grant will be awarded under the Community Parent Resources Center Program which helps provide training and information to parents of children with disabilities under the Individuals with Disabilities Act (IDEA). 
   Domenici is a long time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federally funded programs, including those administered by the Department of Education.
