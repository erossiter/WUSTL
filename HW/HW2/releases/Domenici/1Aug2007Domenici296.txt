SEN. DOMENICI: NEW ENERGY TECHNOLOGY IS KEY TO U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL, ECONOMIC, ENERGY SECURITY POLICIES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today reiterated his belief that developing new energy technology is key to our nation's environmental, economic, and energy security policies.  
   At an Energy Committee hearing to discuss recent advancements in clean coal technology, Domenici said that he believes government must invest in technological advancements that foster alternative uses of coal that contribute to the mitigation of greenhouse gas emissions. 
   "Over the past several years, we have devoted significant resources to finding new ways to make coal clean. We now find ourselves focused primarily on carbon dioxide and its impact on global climate change. In that context, we can, and should, continue to make coal cleaner," Domenici said. 
   Domenici noted that Americans use 1.2 billion tons of coal per year, accounting for roughly half of the current electricity generated and nearly one third of carbon dioxide emissions. Unless new technology is developed, this number will continue to rise as the demand for electricity grows. 
   "The challenges posed by environmental improvements are significant, but I am confident that we are capable of doing the job. In the past several years emissions from coal have been significantly reduced and the task before us is to continue-and expedite-this historical trend of environmental achievement so that our country will maintain its energy security in an environmentally responsible manner," Domenici said. 
   The Senator also emphasized the importance of minimizing any financial burden that may be passed along to consumers as a result of the new technology. Today's hearing is the third full Committee hearing on coal this year.
