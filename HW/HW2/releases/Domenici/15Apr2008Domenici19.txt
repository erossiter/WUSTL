IN PRELUDE TO PAPAL VISIT, SEN. DOMENICI CONFERES WITH NEW MEXICO CATHOLIC CHARITIES REPRESENTATIVES
  In a prelude to events marking Pope Benedict XVI's visit to the United States, U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today met with two representatives from Catholic Charities of the Diocese of Las Cruces, who are in Washington to be part of the Pope's first pastoral visit here. 
   Las Cruces Catholic Charities director Tom Chagolla and Deacon Brian Guerrini of the Our Lady of Grace Catholic Church in Artesia met with Domenici to discuss the needs of the poor throughout southern New Mexico, and federal legislation and programs that could aid them. These included programs that affect food banks, affordable housing and immigration.
   Like Domenici, Chagolla and Guerrini, along with Bishop Ricardo Ramirez, will attend a White House welcoming ceremony for the Pope Wednesday, as well as Thursday's Mass to be celebrated by the Pope.
   "I think it is wonderful that there are New Mexicans who can be in Washington to be part of celebrating Pope Benedict's visit. I can also appreciate that Catholic Charities is using the visit to bring attention to the universal call to do what we can for the poor among us," Domenici said.
   Domenici today also cosponsored a bipartisan Senate resolution formally welcoming Pope Benedict to the United States. The resolution notes that the Pope has "spoken approvingly of the vibrancy of the religious faith in the United States" and as being "a clear and courageous voice for the voiceless, working tirelessly for the recognition of human dignity and religious freedom across the globe."
