SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES AWARDS FOR FOUR WATER PROJECTS IN GRANT COUNTY
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded over $6.8 million to water projects in Grant County.  
   Funds were awarded through loans and grants as part of Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program. 
   "Communities in Grant County are well acquainted with the challenges of providing water to area residents," said Domenici. "Rural Development funds will help each as they make improvements to their current water system in order to accommodate their community needs." 
   The city of Bayard received a $2.0 million grant and a $203,000 loan to upgrade its water distribution system to address potential health risks and improve the water supply. 
   The town of Hurley received a $2.0 million grant and a $142,000 loan to construct a wet sump lift station to capture the outfall from current wastewater and pump it to the new Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant in Bayard. 
   The village of Santa Clara received a $411,494 grant and a $99,000 loan, both of which will work in conjunction with previous Colonias grant funds, to construct a new well, realign portions of the community sewer lines, and improve the overall water system. 
   The Hachita Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association received a $1.9 million grant to install a new community water system, which will address the safety issues surrounding the current privately-owned water system. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA.
