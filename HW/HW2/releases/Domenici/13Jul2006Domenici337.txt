DOE GIVES SANTA FE FIRM $1.5 MILLION IN BUSINESS INNOVATION GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) has awarded two grants totaling $1.5 million to Vista Photonics, Inc. in Santa Fe to fund research initiatives. 
   The DOE has awarded $750,000 to assist in one project to study long-term environmental risk-assessment of waste storage tanks. The second grant worth $750,000 will measure carbon dioxide isotopes in understanding global warming.
   "Vista Photonics seems to be a terrific asset to the research community. These grants are based on scientific and technical merit and it is impressive to see that this small business continues to receive these awards," Domenici said.
   The grant is phase II of the DOE's Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Program, which is meant to increase commercialization of federally funded research and development by small innovative businesses. Each of the projects previously received $100,000 under phase I of this program.
   Domenici is chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which sets funding levels for DOE grant programs.
