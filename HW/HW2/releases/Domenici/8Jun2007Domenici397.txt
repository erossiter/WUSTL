SEN. DOMENICI JOINS SENS. DODD-KENNEDY TO INTRODUCE BILL TO PROMOTE CHILDREN'S MENTAL HEALTH
  Sen. Chris Dodd (D-CT), along with Sens. Pete Domenici (R-NM) and Edward Kennedy (D-MA) this week introduced The Child and Adolescent Mental Health Resiliency Act of 2007, a bill that promotes children's mental health and seeks to increase both the quality of and access to services for those affected. Sens. Dodd, Domenici, and Kennedy have a long history of support for mental health initiatives.  
   Earlier this year the Senators introduced the Mental Health in Schools Act, legislation that would provide additional and improved opportunities for public school children to get the mental health services they may need. 
   "Regrettably, children's mental health disorders continue to carry an unfortunate stigma - a stigma that all too often keeps children and adolescents from getting the help they need," said Dodd. "We have an obligation to break through this stigma, to better understand this pressing health issue and to help our young people get the care they need just as we would for those with physical ailments. This legislation represents a strong first step toward addressing our children's mental health so they can focus on succeeding in school and achieving their goals." 
   "The mental health of our children is as important as their overall physical health. Recent studies indicate approximately 1 in 5 children have a diagnosable mental disorder and one in ten children have a serious emotional or behavioral disorder that is severe enough to cause substantial impairment in functioning at home, at school, or in the community. Children and adolescents with mental health issues need to get help as soon as possible. Investing in effective mental health treatment can mean the difference between a child's success and failure in school and in society," said Domenici. 
   "The heath and wellness of the nation's children is an investment in the future," said Kennedy. "Mental health very well may be one of the most important of a child's overall growth and development. I strongly support the great outcomes this bill will provide." 
   According to the Surgeon General, one in ten children and adolescents suffer from mental illness severe enough to cause some level of impairment. Only one quarter of the children with mental health needs have those needs met, according to a 2001 RAND Corporation study. 
   Dodd's legislation authorizes $205 million for new grants and research initiatives to: 
   * Enhance access to children's mental health services; 
   * Improve the quality of mental health services; 
   * Improve the regional and local coordination of children's mental health services; * Improve collaboration between federal agencies with respect to promoting children's mental health policy; and 
   * Increase federal research into children's mental health. 
   The American Association of Adolescent and Child Psychiatry, the American Psychiatric Association, the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill, the National Association for Children's Behavioral Health, the National Association of State Mental Health Plan Directors and the School Social Work Association of America have all pledged their support for this legislation.
