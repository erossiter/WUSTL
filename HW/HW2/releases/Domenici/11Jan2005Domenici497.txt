32 GROUPS TO PRESENT NATURAL GAS PROPOSALS AT SENATE ENERGY COMMITTEE'S BIPARTISAN CONFERENCE
  The Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee staff has invited 32 groups to present and discuss their proposed solutions to the predicted U.S. shortage of natural gas at a half-day bipartisan conference scheduled for Monday, January 24, at 1 p.m. in Hart 216.  
   The committee announced the conference last month and invited the public to submit written proposals that address various aspects of what is expected to be a significant gap between natural gas supply and demand in coming years. The committee received more than 120 proposals from the public, gas producers, utilities, environmentalists, universities, think tanks and state and federal agencies. 
   Republican and Democrat policy staff reviewed the proposals and selected 32 groups to present 38 proposals for discussion at the conference. (Five of the groups will present more than one proposal.) The committee initially asked the public to address eight topics. The eight topics have since been condensed into six. Similarly, the conference has been divided into six sessions. 
   The participants will each have two minutes to introduce their proposals and make their main points. The remaining time will be used to debate proposals and field questions. The public and media are invited to attend. 
   The participants and the topics they will address are listed below. The list is subject to change in the event of cancellation. Representatives from some federal agencies not included as participants may be on hand to provide technical support and answer background questions. 
   This list of participants, conference guidelines and the text of the proposals to be discussed at the conference can be found on the committee website at: www.energy.senate.gov.
