OIL PRICES HIT RECORD HIGH, DOW DROPS
  The price of crude oil and gasoline both climbed to new records today, meanwhile the Dow dropped 1 percent, partially in reaction to rising oil prices.  
   Crude prices for April delivery broke above $57 for the first time, reaching $57.50 on the New York Mercantile Exchange overnight. Gasoline prices also reached a new high today, rising 1/5 of a penny to $2.055 a gallon for regular unleaded fuel. 
   Chairman Domenici's statement: 
   "Today's record oil and gasoline prices again affirm America's need for greater energy self-reliance. Yesterday's landmark vote on ANWR was a critical step in our pursuit for independence while preserving our cherished environment. 
   "However, there is much left to be done. Oil and gasoline prices will rise and fall in the short-term, but long-term, I expect rising global demand to keep supplies tight and prices high. Producing more of our own energy helps; conserving more is essential and moving toward hydrogen-based fuels is the ideal scenario. 
   "I consider yesterday's vote the beginning of our work. I will include provisions for conservation, stream-lined production and funding for hydrogen research in my energy bill."
