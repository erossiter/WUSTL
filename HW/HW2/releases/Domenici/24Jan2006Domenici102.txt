SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $18,920 IN HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT AID FOR LORDSBURG VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete V. Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, announced that the City of Lordsburg Volunteer Fire Department has been awarded a $18,920 federal grant.  
   The grant was awarded through the Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which is administered by the Homeland Security Department's Office of Domestic Preparedness. These grants are derived from the $650 million approved by Congress for 2005 grant awards. 
   "These funds are essential in helping local fire departments prepare for any emergencies that may arise in their community," Domenici said. "The funds will be utilized for operations and safety procedures which are vital aspects of any public safety department." 
   Lordsburg Mayor Clark Smith, who also serves as the assistant fire chief, said the funds will be specifically used to purchase communicative equipment such as walkie-talkies, pagers and a main console for the community's public safety building.
