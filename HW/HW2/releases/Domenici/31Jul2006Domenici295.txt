SEN. DOMENICI BACK BILL TO STUDY POSSIBILITY OF NATIONAL HISPANIC MUSEUM IN D.C.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that has joined a bipartisan effort that could eventually lead to a museum in the nation's capitol dedicated to the accomplishments of Hispanics. 
   Domenici is a cosponsor of legislation (S.2475) that will create a commission to study the possibility of establishing a "National Museum of the American Latino Community" in Washington. The bill, which was introduced by Senators Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) and has been referred to the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, which Domenici chairs.
   "Last year, our nation honored Native Americans with the opening of the new National Museum of the American Indian here in Washington. I think that a similar effort should be launched so that we can recognize the numerous accomplishments and continuing influence of Hispanics in our country. As chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, I will do what I can to support this effort and move it through my committee," Domenici said.
   The bill will result in a bipartisan 23-member commission to be appointed by the President and congressional leaders. The commission would establish a plan of action for the establishment of a Latino museum, including a fundraising plan and possible sites it could be located.
   The legislation authorizes a total of $3.3 million for commission activities over the next two years.
