SEN. DOMENICI BACKS EXTENSION OF MENTAL HEALTH COURTS PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he is once again backing an extension of the Mental Health Courts system, which was created in 2000 as part of a pilot program by the U.S. Department of Justice.  
   Domenici is cosponsoring legislation introduced by Senator Mike DeWine (R-Ohio) to extend authorization for the program. The DeWine-Domenici extension, S.239, calls for an annual appropriation of $10 million through 2011. Domenici and DeWine also teamed up to pass the original law creating the program, which is being used by the Albuquerque and Bernalillo County District Court systems. Last year, the bill passed the Senate Judiciary Committee but did not see action in the full Senate. 
   "I'm pleased to once again join Senator DeWine to work for an extension of this highly effective program," Domenici said. "I was particularly gratified that Albuquerque housed the very first mental health court in 2003, and since then the program has expanded across the country. Having mental health courts assures us that mentally-ill detainees who have been charged with nonviolent crimes and misdemeanors have their illnesses taken into account." 
   "With this program, law enforcement are more likely to recognize mental illnesses, and the detainees are receiving the treatment they need. I believe it should continue," he said. 
   Under the existing program, 100 pilot Mental Health Courts (MHCs), including one in Albuquerque, were created to deal with mentally ill detainees. The MHCs are operated in a similar fashion to the Drug Court system. 
   Like drug courts, MHCs maintain separate dockets, handling cases involving only nonviolent mentally-ill defenders. Each court provides: 
   * Specialized training of law enforcement and MHC judicial personnel to handle the needs and challenges of nonviolent mentally ill offenders; 
   * Centralized case management of all nonviolent offense cases involving qualified mentally ill or retarded offenders; 
   * Voluntary assignment of qualified offenders to outpatient or inpatient mental health treatments as an alternative sentence, or an alternative to incarceration; 
   * Life skills training, job placement, and education for mentally ill participants; and, 
   * Continued judicial monitoring of offenders participating in a treatment plan. 
   The American Jail Association has estimated that as many as 700,000 persons suffering from mental illness are jailed each year. The Justice Department reported that 16 percent of all inmates in local jails and state prisons are mentally ill. 
   Since FY2002, Domenici has secured $7.4 million in Department of Justice funds for the mental health court program.
