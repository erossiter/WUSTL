SEN. DOMENICI: BUSH'S FY2007 BUDGET PLAN HAS POSITIVES, CHALLENGES FOR NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today offered his initial assessment of President Bush's $2.7 trillion federal budget plan and how it might affect New Mexico. 
   Domenici said the budget has many good recommendations that will benefit the state, but indicated that some proposals could be problematic.  
   "We have to recognize that this is a very tight budget, and that the administration faced a daunting problem of trying to control spending, setting priorities and advancing major initiatives. Putting together a budget without significant reforms to mandatory spending on entitlements makes the job all the harder," Domenici said. "Congress will look at these recommendations, weigh them and then decide whether or not to accept them. Our work is cut out for us." 
   "I am pleased with the funding requests that will back up the major competitiveness and energy initiatives. There are some downsides for New Mexico, such as environmental clean up at Los Alamos and the Pentagon's F-117 retirement plans. We'll want to make sure Holloman has a new mission before we go too far down that line. For Sandia and Los Alamos, overall, they'll have tight budgets but I don't foresee significant personnel changes. On the positive side, the President is requesting new money for FLETC in Artesia," he said. 
   The Bush Administration's FY2007 budget submission to Congress will serve as the basis for the development of a FY2007 Budget Resolution and subsequent appropriations bills to fund federal agencies and programs. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Budget Committee, as well as the Senate Appropriations Committee. Domenici also chairs the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the Army Corps of Engineers, Bureau of Reclamation, and Department of Energy--including the national laboratory system. 
   The Department of Energy (DOE) budget proposes spending $4.176 billion in New Mexico in FY2007, for activities including the operation of Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) funding for the Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories will rise slightly from $3.47 billion to $3.5 billion. 
   Domenici said he is concerned with a Environmental Management recommendation to only provide $90.6 million for environmental clean up at LANL, which is a $50 million reduction. Such a funding reduction could compromise a Consent Order between DOE and the state of New Mexico. 
   "Obviously, this is one budget request that we will have to work through. The DOE will have to explain its rationale behind an idea that will only allow LANL to meet about half of its obligations," Domenici said. 
   While Defense Department specific details are still unavailable, Domenici said he will work with the congressional delegation to address the Pentagon's proposed timetable for retiring the F-117 stealth fighters now stationed at Holloman Air Force Base. (See separate Domenici-Bingaman statement.) 
   Domenici, who serves on the authorizing and appropriating committees for the Department of Homeland Security, welcomed news to provide $18.6 million to equip the Border Patrol Academy at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center in Artesia. The budget also recommends $8.9 million for construction of a new language arts facility. 
   The following is a review of highlights of some New Mexico impacts included in the President's FY2007 budget submission to Congress: 
   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY/New Mexico 
   The Department of Energy (DOE) proposes to spend $4.176 billion in New Mexico in FY2007, $30 million below FY2006, for activities including the operation of Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant. 
   The DOE National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) funding for the New Mexico laboratories will rise slightly from $3.47 billion to $3.5 billion, a $30 million increase. 
   Proposed DOE funding for Energy, Science and Environment in New Mexico falls from $619 million to $558 million, a $61 million decrease. 
   DOE Environmental Management/New Mexico: The budget recommends a $74 million decrease, including: 
   * LANL - $90.6 million, which is a $50 million reduction that will violate the Consent Order signed between the DOE and the state of New Mexico. This funding level would permit LANL to meet roughly half of the obligations under the consent decree. The consent degree funding target is $126 million. 
   * WIPP - $213 million, down $15 million, which reflects cuts to economic development and central characterization programs that Domenici has funding in previous Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bills. 
   * SNL - No funding requested, down from $9 million funded in FY2006 to complete cleanup activities. 
   Los Alamos National Laboratory: $1.844 billion in FY2007, a decrease of $10 million below FY2006. 
   * Weapons Activities - $1.47 billion, up $80 million 
   * Nonproliferation - $165 million, down $49 million from FY2006 largely as a result of cuts to the nonproliferation and detection R&D accounts 
   * Plutonium Pit Production - $196 million for plutonium pit production and certification activities based at LANL, an increase of $14 million 
   * Advance Simulation and Computing - $227 million, up from $180 million 
   * Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility Replacement (CMRR) - $112 million to continue work on CMRR, up $57 million from FY2006 
   * Environmental Management - $90 million for cleanup at LANL, a $50 million decrease, which will compromise the Consent Order between DOE and the state of New Mexico 
   * Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility - $20 M to initiate construction, engineering and design work 
   Sandia National Laboratories: $1.353 billion in FY2007, a decrease of $46 million below the FY2006 level. 
   * Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications (MESA) Complex - $11 million to complete construction

   * Advanced Simulation and Computing - $153 million, up $16 million from FY2006 levels. 
   Waste Isolation Pilot Plant: $213.3 million for the DOE Carlsbad Area Office and WIPP, a cut of $15 million. Although DOE proposes an additional $15 million for increased waste shipments and WIPP operations, it is offset by the following $30 million in reductions related to earmarks gained by Domenici in recent years: 
   * Economic Development, -$11 million 
   * Central Characterization Project, -$15 million 
   * Transportation, -$4 million 
   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY/National Overview
