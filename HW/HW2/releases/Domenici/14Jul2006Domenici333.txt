SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE FIRM GETS MAJOR HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRACT TO IMPROVE PORT SECURITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded Thermo Electron Corp. of Santa Fe with a $14 million contract as part of the Advanced Spectroscopic Portal (ASP) Program. 
   The ASP device is designed to enhance the detection of small or shielded radiological materials. The devices are used by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) at the U.S. Points of Entry (POE), the Department of Energy for overseas venues through the Megaports Initiative, and by state and local governments for DHS grants and training initiatives.
   "Bioterrorism is a serious threat that our country faces and our ports are vulnerable targets. The work conducted on the ASP systems is exactly the type of technology needed to fill security gaps. I am pleased that this Santa Fe company will play a role in protecting our nation from radiological hazards that some might try to smuggle across our borders," Domenici said.
   Thermo Electron Corp. was one of the three award recipients chosen on the basis of technical merit, management approach, past performance, and cost.
   The contract recipients were announced through DHS's Domestic Nuclear Detection Office (DNDO) and is awarded on a one year basis with four one-year options to renew. The total contract could potentially be worth $467 million if DHS chooses to renew the contract based on the four year option.
   On Thursday, Domenici as a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee passed the FY2007 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, which provides $32.9 billion in funding for border security and homeland security initiatives. The Senate bill provides $139.3 million to the CPB for container security initiatives in FY2007.
   It also provides close to $442.5 million to the DNDO to support initiatives in domestic nuclear detection, research and development, operations and system acquisition.
