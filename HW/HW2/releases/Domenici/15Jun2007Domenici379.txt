SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR RIO GRANDE WATER RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the University of New Mexico (UNM) has been awarded $358,000 by the Army Corps of Engineers Engineering Research Development Center (ERDC) for research related to sediment transport and river flood issues.  
   UNM's research will focus on water issues along the middle Rio Grande and will include sediment movement, deposition, and surface water interaction between Paseo del Norte and Alameda Bridges; Bosque restoration; the state of flood-related modeling along the middle Rio Grande; and bank erosion. The award is a continuation of funds initially secured by Domenici for the same amount in FY2006. 
   "We must take steps now to research ways to address water, flood and sediment issues along the middle Rio Grande in order to improve the river system. We currently spend tens of millions of dollars annually to manage the impact of sediment in these arid western rivers. We must decrease these costs through a better understanding of the natural processes and the impact on our engineering," said Domenici. "These Army Corps funds will be beneficial as UNM seeks ways to monitor conditions, mitigate problems, and create a better river environment." 
   Last month, UNM and the Corps of Engineers signed a cooperative research agreement regarding sediment and river flood issues. 
   Also in May, the Senate approved the Water Resources Development Act (WRDA). Included in the legislation were measures, authored by Domenici, which authorized $25 million in funding for Army Corps of Engineers participation in Middle Rio Grande bosque restoration, South Valley flood control, and overall environmental restoration work. 
   Domenici is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, which helps determine federal funding priorities for water and flood research.
