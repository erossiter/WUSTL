SEN. DOMENICI'S E-NEWSLETTER CELEBRATES FIRST ANNIVERSARY
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today marked the first anniversary of his monthly electronic newsletter, an on-line publication that offers New Mexicans information on a variety of topics and activities.  
   Since its September 2006 launch, over 164,000 New Mexicans have subscribed to "The Domenici Report." The online publication, emailed to subscribers each month, includes federal information and legislative updates, as well as local features of interest to New Mexicans. 
   "From the beginning, the Domenici Report has been a great success and has allowed me to reach scores of New Mexicans with regular updates and information that is important to them," said Domenici. 
   "The e-newsletter has also provided a new avenue for New Mexicans to communicate with me. I hope to build on the success of the past year and continue to deliver pertinent and interesting information to constituents in the way many prefer to receive it - online," he said. "I encourage all New Mexicans to keep informed and sign up to receive the newsletter." 
   September's one-year anniversary issue includes a nod to the Air Force in recognition of its 60th Anniversary, an update on important legislation to fund veterans programs and military construction projects in New Mexico like stand-up of the Special Operations Command at Cannon, a report from Domenici's visit to Abo Arroyo to review watershed restoration efforts in Torrance County, and more. 
   Among the regular features of the newsletter are upcoming local events across the state, Character Counts profiles, New Mexico travel ideas, and spotlights on local businesses.
