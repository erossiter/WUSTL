SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES 'TAX DAY' STATEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement as New Mexicans join taxpayers across the nation in filing their 2006 federal income tax returns:  
   "Today thousands of families and small businesses across New Mexico will file their 2006 tax returns. It is an annual rite of spring that all too often comes with frustration and some measure of relief once a return is finally filed. I know the feeling. 
   "As we look forward, we in Congress face decisions on whether to make permanent the tax credits and cuts we initially offered in 2001 to aid families and small businesses. The Senate's FY2008 Budget Resolution makes some effort to permanently extend the 10 percent tax bracket, child tax credit, adoption credit, dependent care credit, and marriage penalty relief. This is a good step in the right direction. 
   "However, the plan fails to adequately address the middle class, which faces a tax increase and the loss of deductions like the education tuition deduction. More than 90,000 New Mexicans with investments will pay higher taxes in the near future if we do not also extend capital gains and dividend tax credits. And finally, the budget plan does nothing to tackle the Alternative Minimum Tax that is hitting more and more middle income households. 
   "I discuss these issues on Tax Day because I believe that the ability of American families and businesses to keep more of what they earn has helped propel our growing economy. To allow many of these credits to expire will risk the continued growth of the economy in our state and nation. I hope we adequately address these issues this year and truly begin looking at comprehensive tax reform that might make future Tax Days a little less frustrating and confusing to all taxpayers."
