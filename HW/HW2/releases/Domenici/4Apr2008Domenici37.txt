USDA WILL BACK VILLANUEVA WATER UPGRADES WITH $1.5 MILLION GRANT-LOAN PACKAGE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that the U.S. Department of Agriculture is making $1.5 million available in a grant and low-interest loan package to upgrade and expand the water system for one rural San Miguel County community. 
   Domenici announced that the USDA Rural Development has approved a $539,000 grant and a 40-year $961,000 loan for the Villanueva Mutual Domestic Water Consumers' Association to rehabilitate and expand the water system that serves more than 100 families.
   "I am pleased the USDA is investing in the future of Villanueva with this financial support. The improvements planned for the water system will mean that families should be assured of water deliveries. The new system should help the community conserve water and ensure that water is not affected by septic systems," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that funds USDA and other federal water programs.
   The Villanueva project will entail replacing leaky tanks and expanding capacity by replacing 12,000 linear feet of distribution lines, including water meters and fire hydrant hookups. The upgrades will also include the drilling of a new well with pump and well house, away from areas affected by existing septic and cesspool systems.
