SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS FOR 11 NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that nearly $1.75 million will be used to support affordable housing projects in 11 New Mexico communities, including resources to provide 165 housing units in Albuquerque, Los Lunas, Belen, and Bernalillo. 
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee that funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), said the grant funding is being provided through the Federal Home Loan Bank in Dallas as leverage to support local affordable housing initiatives. In all, the funding will be used to support 367 housing units in New Mexico. 
   The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) grants are used by local organizations to purchase, construct, or rehabilitate single-family, transitional and multifamily projects for very low- to moderate-income families. The grants will be issued through financial institutions in New Mexico that are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank. 
   "These grants represent the recycling of profits as investments in communities. In New Mexico, they will be put to use to give low-income families a chance to have a home," Domenici said. "I'm pleased with these awards, and commend the Federal Home Loan Bank for continuing to direct these resources to our state." 
   In Albuquerque, a $252,000 AHP grant will be issued through Charter Bank to support a $1.62 million Sunport Plaza Apartments project to provide 84 housing units. (For FY2005, Domenici has requested $750,000 in HUD Economic Development Initiative to funding to support renovation of the Sunport Plaza Apartments in Albuquerque to provide housing for persons with mental illness. The request was made on behalf of the Albuquerque Mental Health Housing Coalition. The Senate has yet to take up the FY2005 VA-HUD Appropriations Bill.)
