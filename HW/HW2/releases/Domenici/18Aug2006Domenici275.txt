TIERRA DEL SOL HOUSING CORP. IN DO?A ANA COUNTY GETS USDA RURAL DEVELOPMENT FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded $47,360 to Tierra del Sol Housing Corp. in San Miguel to support the Do?a Ana Village Revitalization and Planning proposal. 
   The USDA grant will support the proposal which includes a feasibility study and economic development plan for the village center with a walking-oriented marketplace, a heritage and visitor's center, and guided tours.
   "Supporting this revitalization project is essential in preserving the history of the village of Do?a Ana. It is also a great development opportunity plan by creating an interesting attraction that sparks more economic and county interest," Domenici said.
   The funds were awarded through the Rural Business Opportunity Grant program. Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee which sets funding for all federal government departments, including the USDA and its grant programs.
