SEN. DOMENICI REQUESTS LABOR DEPT. AID FOR INTEL WORKERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today asked the U.S. Department of Labor to act as soon as possible to help ease the hardships for the more than 1,000 workers expected to be displaced as the Intel Corp. shuts its Fab 11 fabrication facility in Rio Rancho.  
   Domenici has asked Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to assign specific staff from her agency's Dallas regional office to help coordinate Labor Department programs to help workers transition from their jobs with Intel. Considering the number of expected layoffs, Domenici suggested that a specific regional staffer assigned to New Mexico could be useful to help centralize and coordinate resources. 
   "Obviously the size and scope of this reduction in force is of great concern to me. Many of the workers who may be affected by this decision are highly-skilled engineers and technicians. Intel has been a good corporate citizen and known to provide excellent pay and benefits to its workers. I am concerned that it may be very difficult for many of these workers to find new jobs that will utilize their skills and compensate them accordingly," Domenici said. 
   Domenici explained that the loss of the facility is linked to the Intel decision to end the production of a specific silicon wafer that has become obsolete. 
   "Although I understand this reduction in force is still a few months off, at this time I am requesting that the United States Department of Labor provide all available and appropriate resources to assist Rio Rancho to help ease the burden on these workers and their families," Domenici wrote Chao. 
   Domenici also asked Chao to pay close attention to any application from the state of New Mexico for additional federal grant funding to supplement its dislocated worker programs. The state, which receives annual formula grant funding, could apply for a National Emergency Grant to help meet the needs of the displaced workers this year.
