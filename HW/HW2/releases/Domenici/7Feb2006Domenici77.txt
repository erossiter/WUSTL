SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES AFFORDABLE HOUSING FUNDS FOR FOUR NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that New Mexico has been awarded grants totaling over $1.2 million that will go to four community sponsors to increase support for affordable housing in Truth or Consequences, Tohatchi, Espa?ola and Socorro.  
   The funds will be used to purchase, construct or rehabilitate single-family, transitional and multi-family housing facilities for low income seniors and families who have disabled members. 
   "It is good to see these grants go to areas of our state that need them. Providing affordable housing to low-income residents of New Mexico is a very high priority of mine. Having these renovated units available as affordable housing will be good for seniors and those with disabilities," Domenici said. 
   Awards were given to: 
   * Casa del Rio, Truth or Consequences - $350,000 toward the rehabilitation of an 84-unit multi-family housing facility. 
   * Home Renovations, Tohatchi - $210,00 toward the rehabilitation of 30 single family homes. 
   * Villa del Norte, Espa?ola - $350,000 toward the rehabilitation of a 56-unit multi-family housing facility. 
   * Vista Monta?o, Socorro - $350,000 toward the rehabilitation of a 56-unit multi-family housing facility. 
   The grants were awarded through the Affordable Housing Program (AHP) from the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas. The FHL Bank of Dallas is part of the Federal Home Loan Bank System established by Congress in 1932 to provide help to banks throughout the country to provide these types of funds needed.
