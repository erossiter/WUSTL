UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO RECEIVES $1.8 MILLION TO ADVANCE BIOWEAPONS RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $1.8 million grant to the University of New Mexico to research contagious and deadly bio-agents.  
   A total award of $1,872,186 will be made available to UNM through the Allergy, Immunology, and Transplantation Research division of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), which focuses on the immune system and malfunctions during the production of disease. 
   "This is an opportunity for UNM to demonstrate New Mexico's ability to contribute to national security," Domenici said. "I applaud UNM for its initiative and determination to remain on the forefront of biochemical research." 
   The grant project will focus on pulmonary responses to bio-weapon category A pathogens. Diseases such as anthrax, small pox, and ebola are considered category A pathogens by the NIAID. Category A pathogens are rare in the U.S., yet pose a risk to national security because they are easily transmitted and result in high mortality rates. 
   While this action will support the project for one year, the actual research program is expected to continue until 2010. These funds will support testing the efficiency of interventions which promote health and prevent disease in defined populations. 
   UNM was also awarded $266,625 from the National Cancer Institute to support the Protection of Genomic Integrity by BCCIP project that investigates cancer causes and preventative research. BCCIP is a gene found in the human genome, which in certain circumstances may inhibit the growth of tumors.
