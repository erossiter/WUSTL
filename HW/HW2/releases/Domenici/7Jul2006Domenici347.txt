SANTA ANA GETS DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE GRANT AIMED TO STOP VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded $69,000 to Santa Ana Pueblo to help its local government stop violence against American Indian women. 
   The DOJ grant provided through the STOP Violence Against Indian Women Discretionary Grant program, helps develop and strengthen tribal justice systems' responses to violence crimes committed against Indian women. The STOP program supports strategies and innovative approaches to provide services to these victims.
   "Violence against women is an aspect of crime that is completely unacceptable. I have worked in the past and will continue to support programs aimed at helping victims of domestic violence. I have continually support the Violence Against Women Act and I am pleased to see that these initiatives are extending to our pueblo justice systems," Domenici said.
   The grant was awarded through the Office on Violence Against Women. Domenici serves on the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding limits for the DOJ and its grant programs.
   Domenici cosponsored legislation that reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act through 2010.
