SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON SPECULATION OVER FUTURE NATIONAL GUARD & RESERVE CALL UPS
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Committee, today issued the following statement in response to remarks by Senator John Kerry in Albuquerque that asserted that congressional leaders believe the Bush administration plans a substantial call up of reservists and Guard units.  
   "Despite what Senator Kerry may have said on the campaign trail, to my knowledge there are no plans for substantial call ups of the Guard and Reserves. Neither the Defense Appropriations Committee, on which I serve, nor the Armed Services Subcommittee have been notified of such an action. Desperate candidates are generally not the most accurate sources of information on these issues. 
   "New Mexico Guard and Reservists are making tremendous contributions to the war on terrorism. I do not think these brave men and women or their families are well-served by this kind of speculation."
