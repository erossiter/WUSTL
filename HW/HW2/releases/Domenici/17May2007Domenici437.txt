SEN. DOMENICI SLAMS FY2008 CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PLAN, VOTES AGAINST PASSAGE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today expressed sharp criticism of the $2.96 trillion budget plan cobbled together by the new Democratic Congress, saying plan could lead to tax increases for thousands of New Mexican families at a time when the federal government is already collecting record levels of tax revenue.
   Domenici, a former chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, today expressed his concern with the FY2008 Budget Resolution (S.Con.Res.21) in a speech just prior to the Senate's final vote on the budget blueprint. While outlining increased spending and higher taxes, Domenici also said he is disappointed the plan "does not offer any meaningful solution for entitlement spending." 
   Domenici pointed out that in April alone the U.S. government collected $70 billion more in tax receipts than in April 2006, and that overall tax receipts for FY2007 are up $153 billion (11.3 percent) from last year.
   "I believe our current budget policy is paying off and in the next 18 to 24 months the deficit could completely disappear, if we do not veer off course. This is one point in time where the status quo may just be the best alternative," Domenici said.
   "However, under the budget we are considering, if budget surpluses do not materialize, the so-called trigger will stop the extension of any tax relief and we will see firsthand the largest tax hike in American history. If the trigger kicks in, this budget will cut the child tax credit in half and reinstitute the marriage penalty. We are not doing enough to ensure economic stability to the bulk of the nation," he said.
   Domenici noted that reviews of the Budget Resolution show that the budget before us would increase taxes by at least $736 billion, including hikes in all marginal rates except the 10 percent bracket, capital gains rates, dividends taxes, the alternative minimum tax, and education tax relief.
   "Under this plan, about 93,000 New Mexico investors, including seniors, would pay more because of an increase in the tax rates on capital gains and dividends," Domenici said. "I would submit that it is extremely easy to balance the budget and show a surplus when you utilize one of the largest tax increases in our history."
   Finally, Domenici criticized the Democratic budget plan because it "fails to address the 800 pound gorilla in the room, otherwise known as entitlement spending."
   After 2010, spending related to the aging of the baby-boom generation will begin to raise the growth rate of total outlays. The annual growth rate of Social Security spending is expected to increase from about 4.5 percent in 2008 to 6.5 percent by 2017.
   In addition, total outlays for Medicare and Medicaid are projected to more than double by 2017, increasing by 124 percent, while nominal Gross Domestic Product is projected to grow only 63 percent.
   "The budget currently under consideration does not offer solutions, much less even address, entitlement spending or reform," said Domenici, who has authored entitlement reform legislation with Senator Diane Feinstein (D-Calif.).
   Domenici voted against the Senate-approved measure, which passed 52-40. The resolution is supposed to serve as a budgetary blueprint for federal appropriations and tax measures to be crafted by the Congress year.
   These are highlights of S.Con.Res.21, which sets total spending in fiscal year 2008 at $2.960 trillion and total revenues at $2.678 trillion:
   * Tax Increases: S.Con.Res.21 assumes $736 billion more in taxes over five years compared to the extension of current tax law. Presumably, a significant portion of this revenue will come from allowing most of the 2001 and 2003 tax relief provisions to expire.
   * Reconciliation: S.Con.Res.21 includes a reconciliation instruction to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee to reduce the deficit by $750 million over five years.
   * Budget Enforcement: S.Con.Res.21 includes budget points of order that are designed to reduce the deficit through tax increases rather than spending restraint. Three are new points of order that would require 60 votes to extend or make permanent the 2001 and 2003 tax relief because each point of order would need to be waived. Only a simple majority is needed to raise taxes.
   * Discretionary Spending: S. Con. Res. 21 provides $954 billion (after cap adjustments) in discretionary budget authority for FY 2008, which is $21 billion above the President's request. S. Con. Res. 21 also provides for $2 billion more in advance appropriations than the President's budget. Over the 2008-12 period, discretionary spending increases by $205 billion above the President's request. Within this allocation, many domestic spending programs are increased. The budget fully funds the President's defense request and the FY08 and FY09 emergency supplemental bills.
   * Mandatory Spending: S.Con.Res.21 does not propose any mandatory savings. Rather, S.Con.Res.21 includes $389.6 billion for Medicare in 2008, an increase of $24 billion (+6.6 percent) over 2007.
   * Reserve Funds: S. Con. Res.21 creates 23 deficit-neutral reserve funds. The Budget Committee Chairman may adjust committee allocations if legislation meets the requirements of the reserve fund and is deficit-neutral. These reserve funds allow for tax increases to offset spending increases.
