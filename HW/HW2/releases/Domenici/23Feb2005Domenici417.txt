SEN. DOMENICI: FEMA PROVIDES FUNDS FOR SANTA FE FIREFIGHTER SAFETY TRAINING
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the city of Santa Fe Fire Department will receive $283,119 in federal funds from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to provide safety training classes for firefighters at additional stations in the area.  
   The New Mexico lawmaker indicated the funding was made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and will help improve operations and firefighter safety in the Santa Fe area. 
   "It's always good news when New Mexico's fire stations receive funds to improve facilities, buy new equipment, or provide more training for firefighters. With this new FEMA investment, Santa Fe can update training methods and expand classes throughout the other fire stations in the area," Domenici said. "I'm pleased these funds are committed to ensuring that Santa Fe fire stations are well-prepared to properly and carefully deliver protective services to New Mexicans." 
   Domenici, who serves on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for FEMA and other independent federal agencies, noted that the Santa Fe Fire Department will use the $283,119 provided by FEMA to provide remote firefighter safety training for five manned fire stations and one training center. The funds were awarded through the Operations and Firefighter Safety Program, which can also help procure equipment, wellness, and fitness equipment, and modifications to stations and facilities. 
   The one-year funding award was made through FEMA's 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which was allotted $750 million by President Bush for the 2004 program to enhance basic fire service delivery across the country.
