NEW MEXICO MILITARY, DOE PROJECTS IN NEW FY 2005 DEFENSE POLICY LAW; SEN. DOMENICI'S NONPROLIFERATION EXPANSION EFFORT ALSO ENACTED
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reviewed aspects of a recently enacted national defense policy law that includes a variety of provisions he sponsored that will have an impact on New Mexico as well as the nation's international nonproliferation activities. 
   The Domenici-supported initiatives are included in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Bill, which President Bush signed into law on Oct. 28 (Public Law No. 108-375). (This authorization measure is different from the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Act, which became law in August with more than $416 billion in actual funding for national security activities next year. Domenici serves on the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee and gained more than $80 million in additional funding work in New Mexico.)  
   The new law includes a Senate-passed Domenici amendment that authorizes an extensive array of programs - all with a global reach - to accelerate the removal or improve the security of fissile materials, radiological materials, and equipment. 
   "We now have in place an avenue for a broader global approach to address the threat posed by weapons of mass destruction and the proliferation of the knowledge and materials needed to create them. My initiative forces us to recognize that the problem is far more extensive than our previous focus," Domenici said. 
   "With this law, we will give the Department of Energy the resources and tools it needs to monitor and minimize the proliferation of dangerous materials around the world," he said. 
   The Domenici initiative accelerates efforts to secure, remove or eliminate proliferation attractive fissile or radiological materials anywhere in the world. It authorizes arrangements to provide secure shipment and storage of such materials either in the United States or abroad. It will lead to improved security at sites, whether by upgrading protections at functional sites or improving security at vulnerable or decommissioned sites. Other aspects of the amendment authorize programs to assist displaced employees and convert sties to new activities. 
   The new law also includes another significant Domenici provision allowing DOE to accept international payments and apply them directly toward U.S.-led effort to shutdown Russia's plutonium reactors in Seversk and Zheleznogorsk. These activities were proposed and initiated through President Bush's Global Threat Reduction Initiative. Without the Domenici plan, international payments would go into a general fund without assurances they would be put toward decommissioning costs, which have escalated from $460 million to $1.1 billion. 
   "This is a common-sense initiative to increase our ability to contain the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction without the burden falling solely on the American taxpayers. This is a global problem and this plan is intended to foster greater international cooperation to stop spread of nuclear materials around the world," Domenici said. 
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds DOE, indicated some optimism that necessary funding for DOE-related provisions in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Act can be provided within the FY2005 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill that Congress will address in an upcoming lame duck session of Congress. The House and Senate are schedule reconvene Nov. 16. 
   The following are other significant New Mexico-related items included in the FY2005 Defense Authorization Act: 
   * Hispanic Homesteaders: Domenici-Bingaman amendment authorizing a $10 million Pajarito Plateau Homesteaders Compensation Fund to settle outstanding claims by Hispanic homesteaders in the Los Alamos areas whose lands were acquired during World War II for the Manhattan Project. (Domenici, as Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, remains hopeful that actual funding for the Pajarito fund can be provided within the FY2005 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill.) 
   * Waste Isolation Pilot Plant Environmental Oversight: Domenici amendment directing the Secretary of Energy to use a competitive procedure to enter into a contract to conduct independent reviews and evaluations on the design, construction and operations of WIPP. It also sets a one-year period for the competitive contract, with a renewal option for four additional years. 
   * Medium-Range Missile Defense, White Sands Missile Range: Domenici-authored amendment requires the Defense Department to assess the availability of potential missile defense test ranges for overland intercept flight tests of defenses against ballistic missile systems with a range of 750 to 1,500 kilometers. Domenici believes the Pentagon report will ultimately show that WSMR is the most acceptable site in the United States currently suited for this type of training. The U.S.-led Theater High-Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) and the Israeli Arrow system are being developed as defenses against medium-range NoDong (North Korea) and Shahab-3 (Iran) type missiles. 
   * Los Alamos Schools: Domenici authored language, cosponsored by Bingaman, directing the Secretary of Energy to modify the management and operating contract for Los Alamos National Laboratory to provide $8.0 million annually to the Los Alamos Public School District. The language is intended to ensure continued federal funding to support public education associated with LANL. 
   * Los Alamos Land Transfer: Domenici authored language allowing DOE to transfer two parcels to the Los Alamos schools for development. The amendment would give the Los Alamos schools parcel A-8 (25 acres) and A-15-1 (7.5 acres) within TA-21. 
   * Los Alamos National Laboratory: The bill authorizes $30 million requested by President Bush for "new plant projects" for LANL. These include $20 million for security perimeter improvements and $10 million for power grid infrastructure upgrades. 
   * Consolidated Airmen's Center, Cannon Air Force Base: At Domenici's request, the bill authorizes $9.5 million in military construction to build a consolidated airmen's center for the 1,500 enlisted personnel at Holloman. The center will offer a "campus style" arrangement, with closure of through streets to accommodate pedestrians, improved parking, and new landscaping. (Domenici gained actual funding for this project in the FY2005 Military Construction Bill.) 
   * Navy Expeditionary Warfare Water Purification Program, Otero County: At Domenici's request, the bill authorizes $8 million to support the Navy's involvement in a water desalination project in Otero County. (Within the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Bill, Domenici gained $15 million in third-year funding to advance this DoD water desalination program in Otero County. Domenici gained $5.6 million in FY2004 and $6 million in FY2003 for this project.) 
   * Electromagnetic Vulnerability Facility, White Sands Missile Range: At Domenici's request, the bill authorizes $33 million in military construction for an Electromagnetic Vulnerability Facility. (Domenici gained actual funding for this project in the FY2005 Military Construction Bill.) 
   * Military Housing, White Sands Missile Range: Following the budget request, the bill authorizes $31 million in military construction for 156 family housing units at WSMR. (Actual funding for this project is in the FY2005 Military Construction Bill.) 
   * Highway 54 Tank Bypass Road, MacGregor Training Range: At Domenici's request, $2 million in military construction is authorized to complete the detailed design and costing to create the underpasses or overpasses related to the MacGregor Training Range and Highway 54 between Holloman AFB and Fort Bliss. Fort Bliss, Holloman AFB, WSMR and MacGregor together make up the largest training area in the country. (Domenici gained $1.6 million in actual funding for this project in the FY2005 Military Construction Bill.) 
   * Energy Employees Occupational Illness Compensation Program Act (EEOICPA): Senators Bunning, Bingaman, Domenici and others sponsored a bipartisan amendment to shift processing of EEOICPA compensation claims from DOE to the Department of Labor. In addition to authorizing lump-sum payments to eligible workers, the amendment also authorizes the government to begin compensating workers exposed to toxic substances beyond beryllium disease and radiation-induced cancers. The amendment also links compensation amounts to state compensation laws. 
   * Radiation Exposure Compensation Act (RECA): Aspects of the RECA program has been moved under the umbrella of EEOICPA, which guarantees it will automatically have enough funding to cover all compensation checks millers, miners and transporters. These constitute most New Mexico cases. The chance was made to avoid the issuance of IOUs to beneficiaries. 
   * F-117 Nighthawks, Holloman Air Force Base: Domenici and Bingaman sponsored language to prohibit the Pentagon from carrying out plans to retire 10 of the 52 F-117A Nighthawk Stealth Fighter aircraft currently stationed at Holloman AFB. The FY2005 budget request to retire the aircraft would reportedly have saved the Air Force about $15 million a year, and eliminate 38 enlisted and nine officer positions at Holloman. (Domenici added a similar provision to the FY2005 Defense Appropriations Bill, which became law in August.)
