SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES MILITARY SERVICE NOMINATIONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that he has nominated 40 students from across the state for admission to one of the nation's four military service academies.  
   Domenici selected the students from recommendations made by his Academy Review Board. Criteria used to select students include academic achievement, extra-curricular or athletic activities and leadership capabilities. 
   "Over the past few years, we have witnessed the outstanding character and courage of our Armed Services as they fight for freedom overseas. Many of the most distinguished soldiers attended one of our nation's rigorous service academies. These institutions not only provide an outstanding education in the classroom, they teach invaluable life lessons," Domenici said. 
   "Gaining admission is extremely difficult, but I wish these well-qualified New Mexicans all the best. I believe they are very strong candidates. I am proud of their achievements so far, but I nominated them because they have tremendous potential to serve our nation in the future," he continued. 
   If accepted, the students will be part of the Class of 2009. The following students (listed with their high schools and hometowns), were nominated by Domenici:
