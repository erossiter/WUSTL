SEN. DOMENICI: BANDELIER SELECTED FOR INAUGURAL ROUND OF CENTENNIAL INITIATIVE FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today said visitors to New Mexico's Bandelier National Monument will benefit from improvements to the park's visitor and environmental programs as part of a new cooperative program launched by the National Park Service (NPS) to begin a buildup to its centennial anniversary in 2016. 
   "Bandelier is a prized region of New Mexico. But like so much of National Park Service holdings, there is a true need to improve visitor programs in an environmentally sustainable way. I am pleased the Park Service has joined with the Friends of Bandelier to launch this important effort in New Mexico," said Domenici who is ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and serves on the Senate Subcommittee that funds the NPS.
   The Centennial Initiative involves the use of matching federal and nonfederal funding to achieve priorities throughout the National Park System. Bandelier joins 75 other park units to receive funding under the first round of the Centennial Initiative, which will be backed with more than $24 million in federal funds and almost $27 million in nonfederal matching donations this year alone.
   NPS and the Los Alamos-based Friends of Bandelier are each providing half of the $55,000 being spent for an environmental sustainability project at the park, including the analysis of its carbon footprint, improvements to water and electrical systems, and the purchase of a hybrid vehicle. Each is also ponying up another $12,500 to identify and reach out to non-traditional park visitors from rural and urban areas of northern New Mexico.
   "These funds will help Bandelier as it reaches out to a wider array of visitors looking to experience the monument in its most natural state. I am proud of this cooperative local effort and commend the staff at Bandelier, and all the Friends of Bandelier for their diligence," said Domenici.
   Like the NPS, the Bandelier National Monument was created in 1916 through federal legislation signed into law by President Woodrow Wilson. For more information about Bandelier and the Centennial Initiative, please visit:
