SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS DISABLED VETERANS COIN LEGISLATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he is cosponsoring legislation to authorize the minting of a commemorative coin honoring disabled American veterans.  
   The legislation, S.633, directs the Treasury Secretary to mint 500,000 silver coins in commemoration of disabled American veterans. The proceeds from these coins would be directed toward the Disabled Veterans LIFE Memorial Foundation, which has been authorized by Congress to establish a memorial in Washington to honor disabled veterans. 
   "This measure can be a good means of honoring veterans and also generating the resources needed to erect a long-lasting memorial in the nation's capital for these men and women who served in the Armed Forces," Domenici said. "New Mexicans are part of a proud heritage of men and women who have served bravely in the defense of our nation. This memorial will honor those among the nearly 190,000 veterans in New Mexico who were disabled during their service." 
   S.633, which has broad bipartisan support, would require that all sales of the commemorative coin include a $10 surcharge to be put toward the construction of an American Veterans Disabled for Life Memorial. (http://www.avdlm.com/) 
   The bill has been referred to the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee. 
   Congress in 2004 authorized the memorial, which will be located near the U.S. Capitol and is expected to cost an estimated $65 million from private resources. By federal law, the entire cost of the construction, in addition to 10 percent of the memorial's perpetual maintenance, must be raised before construction may begin.
