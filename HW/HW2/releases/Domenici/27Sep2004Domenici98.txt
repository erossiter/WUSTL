SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $8.84 MILLION FOR STATE'S HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that New Mexico universities and colleges will receive more than $8.84 million in federal education funding to improve higher education opportunities for Hispanic and low-income students.  
   Domenici said the funding is being awarded through the U.S. Department of Education's Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSI) program. 
   "New Mexico is receiving a sizeable HSI award this year, which is only fitting as more and more Hispanic students strive for post-secondary degrees. This is a very good program for ensuring that our colleges, universities and community colleges have added resources for tailoring their programs to ensure that Hispanic and low-income students stay in school until they have received a degree and join the workforce," Domenici said. 
   A colleges or university may tap into HSI grant funding if it has at least 25 percent full-time, Hispanic undergraduate student enrollment, and not less than 50 percent of its Hispanic student population is considered low income. HSI grants can be used by higher education institutions to strengthen academic quality, institutional management, and financial stability.

   Within the Senate's pending FY2005 Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations Bill, a $100 million appropriation has been approved for the HSI program next year-a $4.0 million increase over current funding. In addition, the U.S. Department of Agriculture has an HSI program, which the Senate has proposed funding at $4.645 million in FY2005.
