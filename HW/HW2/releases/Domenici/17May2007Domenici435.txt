ABQ ORGANIZATION GAINS GRANT TO AID PARENTS OF CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Education (DoED) has awarded a $277,918 grant to a non-profit Albuquerque organization to assist parents of children with disabilities. 
   The grant was awarded to "Parents Reaching Out to Help," which is located in Albuquerque. Funds will be used to provide parents and families of children with disabilities with tools to help their children achieve developmental, functional, and academic goals.
   "Families of children with disabilities face unique challenges in helping their children navigate the path to adulthood," said Domenici. "This federal grant program is intended to assist parents as they nurture and provide for their children. I am happy that Parents Reaching Out to Help will receive this federal money and hope it will go a long way in improving the resources available to these families."
   Funds will be administered through DoED's Parent Training and Information Center Program. The program is a primary vehicle of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and provides federal funds for information and training for parents of children with disabilities.
   The organization plans to conduct statewide workshops; provide products, resources, and publications; and improve channels of communication with parents and families.
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining appropriations for federally funded projects and programs.
