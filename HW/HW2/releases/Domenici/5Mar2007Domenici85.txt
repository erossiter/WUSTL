SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DOD FUNDS FOR NEW MEXICO TECH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that Department of Defense has awarded research funds to the New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology (New Mexico Tech) to enhance its available research equipment.  
   The award was made specifically by the Army Research Office (ARO) as part of DOD's Defense University Research Instrumentation Program (DURIP) and will purchase scintillometer transects for remote sensing algorithms. According to DOD, the award is expected to be between $50,000 and $950,000. 
   "New Mexico Tech consistently proves that it is an exceptional educational institution," said Domenici. "This award is one more example of that. I am happy that DOD has assessed New Mexico Tech's qualifications and decided that it is worth the financial investment. I am confident that these funds will only further the educational experience that students receive at New Mexico Tech as well as benefit Army operations." 
   The Department of Defense operates DURIP to provide funding for research equipment at educational institutions in order buoy DOD capabilities. New Mexico Tech is one of 112 academic institutions that will receive a total of $41.2 million in this year's awards made by the Army Research Office, Office of Naval Research, and Air Force Office of Scientific Research. 
   DOD does not specify the amount of each individual award, but says they are expected to average $207,000. 
   Domenici is a staunch advocate of education in the areas of science and technology. He was an original author of the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, which was integrated into the National Competitiveness Investment (NCIA) Act in October. Earlier today, he joined with a bipartisan group of senators in introducing the America COMPETES Act, which contains many provisions of NCIA and aims to improve America's involvement in scientific and technological education and career fields.
