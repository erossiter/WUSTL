SEN. ALBUQUERQUE SNAGS $4.9 MILLION IN CDBG FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised the award of more than $7.7 million in federal housing funds to promote economic development and affordable housing in Albuquerque, with the city receiving over $4.9 million in Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) funding.  
   Domenici said the benefits of the U.S. Housing and Urban Development Department funding will address several primary housing problems in Albuquerque. Domenici serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that provides annual funding for HUD and its initiatives like the CDBG and HOME program. 
   "These programs target the most prevalent housing obstacles for low-income and minority families in Albuquerque. They have been helpful in finding affordable and sufficient housing for New Mexico's families and I am pleased to see additional grants put to good use at the local level," Domenici said. 
   The city of Albuquerque is receiving a package award of $7.75 million that includes funding for CDBG ($4.98 million), and several other programs: 
   * The HOME Investment Partnership Program ($2.48 million) helps expand the supply of decent, affordable housing to low and very low-income families by providing grants to fund housing programs that meet local needs and priorities. 
   * The American Dream Downpayment Initiative ($100,658) promotes homeownership opportunities by providing necessary resources for downpayment and closing cost assistance to low-income and minority households. 
   * Emergency Shelter Grant Program ($191,984) provides annual grants to improve the quality and number of emergency homeless shelters. 
   President Bush's budget for FY2006 would consolidate the CDBG program into a new Strengthening America's Communities Grant program within the Department of Commerce. The CDBG program received $4.7 billion in 2005.
