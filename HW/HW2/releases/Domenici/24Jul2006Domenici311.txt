SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS LAS VEGAS EDUCATION COOP; GAINS $500,000 CHARACTER EDUCATION GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the Department of Education (DoEd) has awarded close to $500,000 to the Northeast Regional Education Cooperative in Las Vegas to implement character education programs. 
   The grant was awarded through the Partnerships in Character Education Program and was designed to help students develop good character by teaching certain elements such as caring, civic virtue, citizenship, justice and fairness, respect, responsibility and trustworthiness.
   "I began the Character Counts initiative in New Mexico because I truly believe that teaching good character skills at an influential age produces caring and productive adults. I am very proud of the Northeast Regional Education Cooperative and I know that it will use these funds to promote the character development programs throughout their school district," Domenici said.
   The Northeast Regional Education Cooperative is one of 10 regional education cooperatives in New Mexico and provides services to public school districts, including charter and private schools, in Pecos, Mora, Santa Rosa, Wagon Mound, Jemez Valley, West Las Vegas and Las Vegas.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that last week approved $24.25 million for the federal character education program as part of the FY2007 Labor, Health & Human Services and Education Appropriations Bill. Domenici has supported Character Counts in New Mexico since 1994.
