SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER STATE LEGISLATOR MORA OF RATON
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the passing of former State Representative E. Kelly Mora of Raton, who died Wednesday.  
   "Kelly Mora was a wonderful man and long-time friend, and I am proud to have known him for so long. He was a terrific family man who with his lovely wife Livia raised a great family. At the same time he was taking care of his family and his work, he was also contributing his time to making Raton and Colfax County a better place. Kelly lived a remarkable life. 
   "My wife Nancy and I offer our sincerest sympathies to the entire Mora family, and pray they cherish everything Kelly was to so many people during his life." 
   Mora, a decorated World War II veteran and a coal miner by profession, was a Colfax County commissioner before being elected to the New Mexico legislature from 1958 to 1986.
