'IN GOD WE TRUST' RESOLUTION PASSED BY SENATE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Senate has passed a resolution he cosponsored that commemorates the 50th anniversary of the national motto: "In God We Trust." 
   S.Con.Res.96, introduced by Senators Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) and Robert C. Byrd (D-W.V.), has been approved by unanimous consent by the Senate. The measure calls on Americans to commemorate the anniversary of the motto. The measure also discusses the deep-seeded belief of God's hand in sustaining the United States.
   "The July 30th anniversary of the adoption of our national motto is nearing and this resolution is a good way to remind everyone why it is important to all of us as Americans," Domenici said. "I believe we are truly a nation blessed by God."
   "In God We Trust" became the official motto on July 30, 1956, when President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed a congressional resolution. The phrase began appearing on U.S. currency in 1864.
   The S.Con.Res.96 states:
   Now, therefore, be it
   Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives concurring), That Congress-
   (1) commemorates the 50th anniversary of the national motto of the United States, `In God We Trust';
   (2) celebrates the national motto as-
   (A) a fundamental aspect of the national life of the citizens of the United States; and
   (B) a phrase that is central to the hopes and vision of the Founding Fathers for the perpetuity of the United States;
   (3) reaffirms today that the substance of the national motto is no less vital to the future success of the Nation; and
   (4) encourages the citizens of the United States to reflect on-
   (A) the national motto of the United States; and
   (B) the integral part that the national motto of the United States has played in the life of the Nation, before and after its official adoption.
