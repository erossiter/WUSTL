SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS EARLY READING PROGRAM USED IN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today endorsed a bipartisan effort to ensure stable funding for an innovative reading program for infants and youth that is being used in communities across New Mexico.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Budget Committee, has signed letters encouraging the Bush administration and Senate appropriators to support $10 million for the national Reach Out and Read program (http://www.reachoutandread.org/). 
   The entreaty has been issued as the FY2007 budget for the U.S. Department of Education is finalized for its roll out on Feb. 6. 
   The Reach Out and Read program is aimed at exposing more underprivileged infants and children to early reading and language development through greater parental involvement. Since its start in FY2003 using federal, state and local funding, the program has seen progress in making more children better prepared to enter child care, kindergarten, Head Start and elementary education. 
   "We're heading into what looks like another difficult budget year, but we should do everything to support programs like Reach Out and Read. With coordination and support at all levels, thousands of children are being exposed to the reading and language skills they need to ensure more academic achievement in their lives," Domenici said. 
   "I applaud the health care clinics, hospitals and other groups around New Mexico that are actively involved in the program. They are reaching out to a segment of the youth population that too often is just not ready to learn when they get to a formal classroom," he said. 
   Domenici, a Senate Appropriations Committee member, said Congress provided $10 million in FY2006 for the Reach Out and Reach project, which is currently under a two-year effort to expand by more than 50 percent. U.S. Education Department funding was initiated with $2 million in FY2003.
