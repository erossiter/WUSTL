NEW TO'HAJIILEE HEALTH CENTER SUPPORTED WITH USDA LOAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that a $1.5 million low-interest loan has been issued to allow the Ca?oncito Band of Navajos construct a new health center to serve more than 2,800 people.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Community Facility Direct Loan is over 40 years at 5 percent interest. 
   "USDA Rural Development approves such loans to allow rural tribes and communities obtain the civic facilities they need to best serve their people. This low-interest loan will permit the To'Hajiilee band to replace an outdated health center and build a new facility. I'm pleased the USDA has decided to make this investment." 
   The USDA loan will allow the Ca?onicito Band of Navajos to construct a 9,400-square-foot health center, replacing an existing center.
