SEN. DOMENICI CONGRATULATES KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE SIMULATION TEAM FOR EARNING DEFENSE DEPT. AWARD
  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated Kirtland Air Force Base's Air Force Nuclear Weapons and Counterproliferation Agency on being recognized by the Department of Defense (DoD) for its contributions to modeling and simulations. 
   The Operational Reachback Team of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Division at Kirtland received the team award in the "Analysis Community" category for developing an "end-to-end" modeling and simulation toolkit.
   "I am happy with this award for Kirtland. The excellent minds at the base are once again proving that they are at the forefront of our nation's defense," said Domenici. "This only reinforces what I have known and seen for years. I hope that the base and its team will keep up their outstanding work."
   The Kirtland project is designed to provide warfighters with advanced counter-chemical biological, radiological nuclear technologies and systems; consolidate the latest Air Force capabilities for the collateral effects and target defeat; provide a test bed for fielding future agent defeat weapon concepts; and give an operational capability to joint commanders to minimize collateral hazards.
   Kirtland's team was one of seven receiving an award out of 99 nominations nationally. Awards will be presented May 8 at a DoD Modeling and Simulation Conference in Hampton Roads, Va.
   DoD Modeling and Simulation Awards are administered annually by the Defense Modeling and Simulation Office (DMSO) to recognize outstanding DoD teams in the development and application of models and simulations. For more information, visit: https://www.dmso.mil/public/community/awards/.
