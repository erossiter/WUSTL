SEN. DOMENICI: ARMY CONTRACT INCLUDES WORK AT WHITE SANDS MISSILE RANGE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Defense (DOD) has awarded a contract worth over $1.1 million to Northrop Grumman for work to be performed at multiple locations, including White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  
   According to the contract, which will be awarded through the Department of the Army, White Sands Missile Range will conduct 35 percent of the overall project. Additional work will be carried out in Herndon, Va. (45 percent) and Kekaha, Hawaii (20 percent). 
   "White Sands has demonstrated itself to be at the cutting edge of defense technology. This DOD contract is another example of WSMR's stellar capabilities, and I look forward to witnessing success as it makes progress on this project," said Domenici. 
   Once completed, the contract is expected to provide Aegis Readiness Assessment vehicles and vehicle configurations to support the Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense and Missile Defense Agency, which are required as part of the ongoing Naval Surface Warfare Center Port Hueneme Division Detachment. 
   If all options are exercised, the cumulative contract would be worth over $5.8 million. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, as well as its Subcommittee on Defense, that in June approved the FY2008 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill and included $71 million to facilitate the relocation of an Army engineering battalion to WSMR in 2008.
