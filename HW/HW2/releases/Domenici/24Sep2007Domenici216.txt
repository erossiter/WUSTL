   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says he will work with Senator Jeff Bingaman to see whether the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and the full Senate can soon debate legislation authorizing the Navajo water settlement and associated plan for water pipelines for the Navajo Nation and city of Gallup. 
   02:14 - Domenici says his funding request to help the village of Ruidoso modernize its wastewater treatment facilities has been caught up in the congressional debate over the earmarks. He says the House and Senate have yet to determine how Congress should deal with funding for specific projects added to appropriations bills. 
   04:53 - Domenici says the outcome of negotiations this week on a short-term "continuing resolution" to fund the government after Oct. 1 is important. He says it will provide an indication of how Congress might settle FY2008 funding levels for the DOE national laboratories, including Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories in New Mexico. 
   07:28 - Domenici says he expects that the No Child Left Behind Act will be changed as Congress reauthorizes the education reform law. He notes that some New Mexico schools and educators are concerned about testing requirements and how limited-English-speaking students affect overall school performance evaluations. 
   10:41 - Domenici says he believes Columbia University made a mistake in asking Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to speak on its campus. He notes the problems the United States has with Ahmadinejad, who has advocated the destruction of the Israeli state. He questions whether the university's action will help U.S. efforts to deal with Iran. 
   13:32 - Domenici says it is unlikely that new Democratic efforts to stop funding for the war in Iraq will succeed, whether such proposals are offered to the FY2008 Defense Authorization Bill or FY2008 Defense Appropriations Bill. He also notes that President Bush must work with Congress on future support for the war effort, and suggests the bipartisan Iraq Study Group recommendations should be carefully considered. 
   16:22 - Domenici predicts that Congress will override a threatened presidential veto of a new Water Resources Development Act. He notes the New Mexico projects he added to the bill, including a $25 million Rio Grande bosque restoration effort and flood control work for Albuquerque's North and South Valley.
