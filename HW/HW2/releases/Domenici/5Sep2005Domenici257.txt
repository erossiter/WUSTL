SEN. DOMENICI VOWS FAST RESPONSE FOR KATRINA AFTERMATH FUNDING
  Sen. Pete Domenici said Monday that he has contacted his Senate colleagues from the Gulf Coast region, pledging quick action for emergency funding for the Corps of Engineers in response to the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina.  
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that funds federal water projects carried out by the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   "I have talked to the Senators from Mississippi and Louisiana, as well as the director of the Office of Management and Budget, and pledged quick action on any Corps of Engineers emergency funding that will be required," Domenici said. 
   "I understand that rough estimates put the immediate need at more than $1 billion with additional funding later. I hope that I can work with my counterpart on the House side to move the necessary funding very quickly and at the same time make sure that the FY2006 Energy and Water Bill reflects the new reality of Corps funding levels," he said. 
   Domenici spoke earlier Monday to Albuquerque Mayor Martin Chavez and thanked him for all the city is doing to help the victims of the worst natural disaster in U.S. history. 
   In addition, Domenici said that a hearing scheduled for Tuesday in Washington on the energy situation following the hurricane will also address the issue of possible price gouging, as well as weaknesses in the energy production and transmission system that the aftermath of the hurricane revealed. 
   The hearing Tuesday will be held in Room 106 of the Dirksen Senate Office Building at 2:30 p.m.
