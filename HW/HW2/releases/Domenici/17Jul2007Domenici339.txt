SEN. DOMENICI SEEKS WATER AID FOR NEW MEXICO COMMUNITIES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today sketched out a lengthy list of New Mexico communities, water cooperatives and pueblos that could benefit from federal funding now available for emergency water supply projects.
   Domenici reviewed the ongoing need for emergency water service in a letter to Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne, who will determine how to distribute $10 million in available funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to carry out such projects in the West. 
   Domenici identified five New Mexico municipalities, one county, a dozen mutual water users associations, and 11 pueblos that could immediately benefit from this assistance.
   "Drought conditions continue to exacerbate water service to many communities, pueblos and water cooperatives throughout New Mexico. I want Secretary Kempthorne to carefully consider the emergency situations in our state as the Bureau of Reclamation decides how to use the drought relief funding I helped secure," Domenici said.
   "The work we've already undertaken for Ruidoso Downs, Las Vegas and others is already ensuring that municipal water service will be able to meet demands as we deal with the ramifications of a long-term drought," he said.
   Domenici secured the funding earlier this year as part of the FY2007 emergency appropriations bill to carrying out the Reclamation States Emergency Drought Relief Act. Similar funding was used last year to support emergency water well drilling for Ruidoso Downs, Las Vegas, Ruidoso, Cloudcroft and Capitan.
   The $10 million in FY2007 funding will support the Bureau of Reclamation (BOR) Drought Emergency Assistance Program, which provides assistance to states, tribes, and some nonprofit organizations hard-hit by drought conditions. Through this program, the BOR may assist in minimizing losses and damages associated with severe drought situations. This work includes on-the-ground relief for states, including well drilling, temporary water distribution, contingency planning, and water banking, and conservation.
   Domenici is ranking member of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee which has funding jurisdiction over the Bureau of Reclamation. Domenici is working with community leaders and the New Mexico Office of the State Engineer to identify ongoing needs for this aid.
   "Simply put, many New Mexico communities are running out of water. As you can appreciate, any disruption to water supplies has disastrous implications for affected communities. Absent some immediate help from the federal government, it is unclear where these communities will get water for municipal purposes," Domenici wrote Kempthorne.
   In his letter, Domenici also cited recent congressional testimony wherein commitments were made to consider the needs in New Mexico for emergency drought aid.
   "In prior hearings before the Energy and Natural Resources Committee, Assistant Secretary Mark Limbaugh made a commitment that the Department of the Interior would use the authority provided by the Act to help New Mexico through this tough time," Domenici wrote Kempthorne. "Consistent with that commitment, I respectfully request that you use every necessary tool contained in the Act to provide relief to our struggling communities. As you are aware, Reclamation Law requires compliance with applicable state law. I have requested that the New Mexico State Engineer expedite any permits you may need to implement emergency drought relief measures."
   Overall, Domenici pointed out that the following entities "face varying problems with their water supply," and asked that they be considered for help under the BOR Drought Emergency Assistance Program: * Valencia County * Bosque Farms (Valencia)
