SEN. DOMENICI LANDS $1.25 MILLION FOR VALLES CALDERA ROAD IMPROVEMENTS, OTHER FUNDS FOR NORTHERN NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the 108th Congress will prepare for a possible vote Saturday on the ommibus appropriations bill that includes $1.25 for the Valles Caldera National Preserve and other funding for northern New Mexico projects the lawmaker secured.  
   Domenici, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the funding in March as part of the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations Bill. House and Senate appropriators have completed negotiations on transportation funding for FY2005. These projects will be part of a massive omnibus appropriations package that will include nine separate appropriations bills. 
   The lawmaker secured $1.25 million in transportation funding for infrastructure improvements funds in the Valles Caldera National Preserve to allow better access to the wilderness area. (Domenici also secured $3.65 million through the Forest Service for administration, research, and inventory activities at the Preserve in the Interior appropriation bill. This is $2.7 million above the President's request, and $540,000 above the current level.) 
   "Valles Caldera is one of New Mexico's most pristine wilderness areas that should be enjoyed by New Mexico's visitors and natives. The best way to open this part of the Baca Ranch to the public while still maintaining the integrity of the land is to improve the infrastructure of the preserve. I am very pleased these funds are secured and now wait on passage of the omnibus bill," Domenici said. 
   The Congress is expected to give final passage to the omnibus bill on Saturday. All items in the $388 billion measure will be subject to a 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction. 
   Domenici also gained a total of $1.5 million for the Santa Fe Bus Transit program and $400,000 for the city's Jobs Access and Reverse Commute program.
