SEN. DOMENICI SELECTED TO RETAIN ENERGY COMMITTEE CHAIRMANSHIP
  Republican members of the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee today formally selected Sen.  
 Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico to chair the committee for the 109th Congress. 
   Chairman Domenici's statement: 
   "This year will be a dynamic year for the energy committee. We are going to make a push to develop our vast oil resources in the Arctic Refuge in a way that leaves the environment pristine while stabilizing oil prices and enhancing our energy independence. I expect to receive instructions in the Budget Resolution to report ANWR language to the Budget Committee by early May. I will fight on the Senate floor to keep those instructions in the resolution and will fight again to defend our legislation in the budget reconciliation vote later this year. 
   "I am pleased by the strong support for an energy bill expressed by the White House and the House of Representatives. I was pleased to see Speaker Dennis Hastert earlier today reaffirm the House's commitment to delivering an energy bill to the President this year. Energy will clearly be a priority and we have already begun serious discussions about how we will proceed. 
   "Water legislation continues to be one of my top priorities. I am delighted by the passage last year of CalFed, my dam safety bill and the Arizona Water Settlement Act. However, there is much more work to be done. I will continue working to resolve outstanding Indian water rights claims. I am also considering legislation that will create and fund a rural water program within the Bureau of Reclamation. I will work with committee senators to find out comprehensive approaches to solving our western water challenges."
