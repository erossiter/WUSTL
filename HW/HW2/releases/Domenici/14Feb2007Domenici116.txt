SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO END DISMAL FY07 APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined the Senate to give final passage (81-15) to a spending plan to complete the FY2007 appropriations exercise, a process that deeply disappointed the veteran lawmaker.  
   The Senate today passed H.J.Res.20, the year-long Continuing Resolution (CR) that will fund most government agencies through FY2007. Tuesday's final action clears the bill for President Bush's signature and ensures continued government operations as the current short-term CR expires Thursday. For FY2007, Congress only managed to enact two (defense and homeland security) of 13 appropriations bills. 
   "I have continuously stated my displeasure with Congress' inability to do its work and finish these appropriations bills. This CR is far from ideal, but I have determined that it is the only way to ensure the federal government continues to operate," Domenici said. 
   "My staff and I will now closely monitor how federal agencies decide how to distribute the funding they gain in the continuing resolution. I want to make sure that, where possible, that additional funding is directed to the New Mexico programs and projects that stand to lose out with Congress' failure to complete the 2007 appropriations bills," he said. 
   Under the Continuing Resolution, all earmarks secured by members of Congress are eliminated. This action gives federal agencies broader power and discretion over the distribution of federal funding this year. 
   Among the lost earmarks is more than $75 million secured by Domenici in the FY2007 appropriations process for New Mexico projects. Projects whose funding was eliminated through the CR including a dialysis center expansion in Gallup, transit and roadway funding in Do?a Ana County, the emergency room expansion at Saint Vincent Medical Center in Santa Fe, the Valles Caldera National Preserve, and many others.
