SEN. DOMENICI: DOE AWARDS CLEAN COAL AWARD TO CIBOLA COUNTY OPERATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised the Department of Energy (DOE) for a $19 million federal grant to Peabody Energy that will explore clean coal technology at the Mustang power plant outside Grants. 
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, extolled the Bush Administration for providing the funds that will help bring Mustang closer to its "near-zero emissions" goal. Energy Secretary Spencer Abraham made the announcement today in New Mexico.
   "This is a huge win for Mustang who beat out several other contenders in this competitive selection process. Mustang will remove nearly 100 percent of pollutants in its emissions while also producing a high quality fertilizer," Domenici said. "The Bush Administration deserves the real credit for recognizing the positive benefits that will come from lowering emissions at Mustang."
   The $19 million from the Department of Energy finances 25 percent of the overall project cost. Peabody Energy's Mustang Energy Project is a 300 megawatt coal-fired plant just north of Grants in Milan.
   With these funds, Mustang will develop clean coal technology that will remove 99.5 percent of sulfur dioxide, 98 percent of nitrogen oxides, and 90 percent of mercury from plant emissions while using the byproducts to develop a high-quality fertilizer.
   "Such a substantial award shows that this plant can contribute to energy production while still minimizing risks to the environment. Expanding Mustang's goals and mission will also result in the creation of new jobs for the area," he said.
   The funds were awarded by the DOE through the President Bush's innovative Clean Coal Power Initiative (CCPI) program that promotes more efficient clean coal technologies. The project's goals also coincide with the Clear Skies Initiative (CSI) introduced by the President to reduce power plant emissions by about 70 percent by 2018.
