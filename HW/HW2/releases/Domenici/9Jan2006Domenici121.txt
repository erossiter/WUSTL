SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO FIRE DEPARTMENTS ELIGIBLE FOR FEMA REIMBURSEMENTS RELATED TO LEA COUNTY WILDFIRES
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today indicated that firefighting entities may access federal fire management funds to recoup costs associated with battling disastrous wildfires in southeast New Mexico earlier this month.  
   Domenici indicated that the reimbursement grant funds will be provided through the Federal Emergency Management Agency's "Fire Management Assistance Grant Program" (FMAGP). 
   The state of New Mexico must apply for the reimbursements based on receipts received from participating fire agencies for eligible costs. FEMA is an agency of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. 
   "The dry, dry conditions in New Mexico coupled with high winds put the entire state at risk, and the Lea County fires showed everyone just how high the danger is. Everyone must be diligent about fire safety throughout the state," Domenici said. 
   "I am pleased that FEMA has approved the ability for fire departments that fought the New Year's Day fires in Lea County to be reimbursed for some of the funds expended to bring those fires under control," he said. 
   FMAGP funding is intended for the "mitigation, management, and control" of fires on publicly or privately-owned forest or grasslands which threaten such destruction as to constitute a major disaster. 
   The Lea County fires charred more than 35,000 acres around Tatum and Hobbs. The state immediately requested access to FMAGP assistance, and FEMA granted eligibility after determining the fires constituted a major disaster. Grant funding may cover, among other things, equipment and supplies, emergency operations, mobilization costs, and associated activities.
