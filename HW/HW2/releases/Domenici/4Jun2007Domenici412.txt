SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR NEW MEXICO SAFETY PROGRAMS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Justice (DOJ) intends to award a $2.75 million grant to the New Mexico Department of Public Safety to reduce the incidence of violent crime.  
   Funds will be dispersed under the DOJ's FY2007 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. The New Mexico Department of Public Safety will direct the funds toward drug, violent, and serious crime prevention programs across the state. 
   "DOJ provides federal funds to help states implement effective crime prevention programs. I am pleased that New Mexico will receive this grant and hope that it will help reduce the incidence of crime in New Mexico," said Domenici. "These grant monies will support more task force operations that involve local, state, and federal cooperation in order to control violent crimes." 
   The New Mexico Department of Public Safety will develop a comprehensive strategy for combating crime that will include a report on regional drug and gang trends, as well as the collection, maintenance, and reporting of crime data. 
   The JAG Program provides funds to states, tribes, and local programs to prevent and control crime based on their unique needs. Funds can be used for a wide variety of purposes, including state and local initiatives, technical assistance, training, personnel, equipment, supplies, contractual support, and information systems in the realm of law enforcement, prosecution and court programs, prevention and education, corrections and community corrections programs, and drug treatment programs. 
   Domenici is a long time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the Commerce, Justice, Science and Related Agencies Subcommittee which plays a large role in determining funding for programs within the Department of Justice.
