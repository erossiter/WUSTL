   REVIEW:
   00:00 Domenici reluctantly suspects that politics played a role in requests for supplemental funding to add Air Force Special Operations Command aircraft for Cannon Air Force Base. He says the delegation continues to press for funding to support the AFSOC mission at Cannon, and funding sought in the FY2009 budget for AFSOC aircraft procurement.
   02:28 Domenici expresses dismay at Democratic presidential candidates criticism of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), and discusses growing trade between the United States, Mexico and Canada. He discusses the benefits of international trade, and criticizes efforts to scuttle a pending free trade pact with Columbia.
   06:33 Domenici relays information on the Department of Homeland Security effort to erect border fences and vehicle barriers on the border in New Mexico. He discusses the authority given to DHS to make progress on the congressional mandate to erect 370 miles of fences and barriers along the Southwest Border.
   09:56 Domenici discusses why he cosponsored the America's Wounded Warriors Act, which would simplify the disability compensation system used by the Department of Defense and Veterans' Affairs Department. He says the treatment of disabled servicemen and women from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan has exposed problems with the existing system.
