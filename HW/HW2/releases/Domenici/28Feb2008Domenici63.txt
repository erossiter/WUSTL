FT. SILL BINGO PARLOR CHAFES SEN. DOMENICI, WHO RAISES PROSPECT OF LEGISLATIVE REMEDY IF NEEDED
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee, today expressed his opposition to a plan by the Fort Sill Apache Tribe in Oklahoma to open a bingo gaming operation in Luna County, and pledged to continue his push to have the federal government intervene.  
   Domenici has discussed his opposition to the opening of the gaming facility with New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne and officials at the National Indian Gaming Commission. 
   "I am ready if necessary to propose federal legislation to remedy this situation. It is just not right for the Fort Sill Apache to open a gaming operation on lands in New Mexico that were never intended for such use. The Indian Gaming Commission should expedite its review of this case and affirm that there never was any intent for this trust property to be used as a gaming site. I think Governor Richardson has every right to take action to stop this activity."
