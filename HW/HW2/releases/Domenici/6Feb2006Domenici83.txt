   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says he hopes an agreement can be reached to allow progress on the proposed Gallup-Navajo water supply pipeline. He says it will be very difficult to fund, but says he is working with the federal government to define payment responsibilities. He says a lot of problems will arise the longer it takes to reach a consensus on the project. 
   02:47 - Domenici says the Bush administration's FY2007 budget is very lean, but that it will not make significant headway in reducing the federal budget even though it recommends eliminating 140 federal programs. He says the deficit will continue to grow because of mandatory entitlement programs -Medicare, Medicaid and pensions--as well as ongoing costs associated with the war on terrorism. 
   04:23 - Domenici discusses the proposed Do?a Ana County Lands Conservation and Development Act, and counters claims that the plan would quickly unleash the widespread sale of surplus federal property in the area. He notes that the proposal would also designate wilderness and conservation areas, and cites the need to discuss the proposal more fully with the people in the area. 
   08:53 - Domenici says he and Senator Bingaman will work with the U.S. Air Force to identify a follow-on mission for Holloman AFB if all its F-117 stealth fighters are retired in FY2008. He says a possible new weapons system for Holloman is the F-22, and says the USAF wants to work in good faith to find a follow-on mission for the base. He notes that the timing of putting a new mission at the Otero County base is critical. 
   11:03 - Domenici says the President's energy and competitiveness issues are exciting and that New Mexico will have a role to play in reducing dependence on foreign oil. He says solar and wind energy research is done in the State. He says finding new materials to create ethanol is exciting, as are advances on nuclear power. He says Bush's FY2007 budget increases research and development funding for this work. 
   14:11 - Domenici offers his condolences to the family of Army Specialist Jesse M. Zamora of Las Cruces, who was killed in Iraq. He says he hopes and prays that there is pride in Zamora's service. 
   15:15 - Domenici says it is not important that Attorney General Alberto Gonzales be under oath when he testifies before Congress because it is unlawful to lie to Congress. He decries the angst and hatred against the President and his administration. 
   16:21 - Domenici says the domestic surveillance program is an important issue and that a case can be made for and against the program. He commends the explanation of the program offered by the head of the National Security Agency, and believes a majority of Americans will see the need for the program to improve national and homeland security. 
   18:28 - Domenici says the $2.77 trillion federal budget, like previous budgets, does not include funding for war efforts or Hurricane Katrina recovery costs in its base. He says Congress will provide funding for these works and that they will be accounted for and will add to the deficit. He says it is up to Congress to fix the federal deficit and that will require taking action to control the growth of entitlement programs like Medicare and Medicaid.
