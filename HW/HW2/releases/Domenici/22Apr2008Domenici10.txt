USDA PROVIDES FUNDS TO NORTHEAST NEW MEXICO ELECTRIC SERVICE
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that residents in rural northeast New Mexico will benefit from a $5.8 million loan made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to the Mora-San Miguel Electric Cooperative Inc. 
   The loan will affect electric service in Guadalupe, Mora, San Miguel and Santa Fe counties, enabling the cooperative to serve 1,068 new consumers, build 123 miles of new distribution line and make improvements in other areas, including 45 miles of already existing power lines.
   "I'm pleased consumers in northeast New Mexico will have better electric service as the result of these USDA funds," said Domenici. "I look forward to ongoing improvements to the northeast New Mexico electric grid."
   The loan, provided through USDA's Rural Development program is provided at a hardship rate for a 35 year period.
