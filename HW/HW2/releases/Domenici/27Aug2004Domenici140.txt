SEN. DOMENICI: UNION COUNTY SMALL BUSINESSES ELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has designated businesses in Union County eligible for SBA's low interest Economic Injury Disaster Loans due to losses caused by drought and insect infestation that began January 31, 2003.  
   The Department of Commerce has established several basic loan programs though the U.S. Small Business Administration. Economic Injury Disaster Loans are designed to help businesses meet normal operating expenses that cannot be met due to the effects of a disaster. 
   "These funds make sure our small business owners know they can recover from the losses caused by the devastating drought that occurred earlier this year," Domenici said. "I encourage businesses in Union County to apply for these funds to keep the economy moving and their businesses from suffering needlessly." 
   The loan can assist a business in meeting installments on a long term debt, accounts payable and overhead expenses that would have been met had the disaster not occurred. 
   Loans may be approved for up to $1.5 million and terms may extend to 30 years depending upon the repayment ability of the individual applicant. 
   Domenici is the chief Senate sponsor to the National Drought Preparedness Act (S. 1454), which will create a National Drought Council within the Department of Agriculture to improve drought preparedness, mitigation and response efforts. The Council will formulate strategies to alleviate the effects of drought by fostering a greater understanding of what triggers wide spread drought conditions.
