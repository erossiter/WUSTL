SEN. DOMENICI PRAISES WIPP CONTRACT EXTENSION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised the Department of Energy decision to allow Washington TRU Solutions LLC to continue to operate and manage the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) for another five years.  
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds WIPP and has been supportive of DOE exercising the five-year option in its contract with Washington TRU Solutions. The contract will allow the firm to operate WIPP through 2010. The value of the contract extension is set at about $704 million from FY2006-2010. 
   "DOE made the right decision to extend this contract. Washington TRU Solutions has exhibited that it can effectively and efficiently manage WIPP, and it has built a very good relationship with the community in Carlsbad and southeast New Mexico," Domenici said. "This extension will mean that WIPP operations can continue smoothly. This, in turn, is important as we try to make significant headway in dealing with transuranic wastes around the country." 
   In announcing the contract extension Tuesday, DOE also outlined new performance goals for Washington TRU Solutions, including: 
   * Disposing of 20,000 additional cubic meters of transuranic (TRU) waste at WIPP; 
   * Completing the TRU waste cleanup at some storage sites five to 10 years early; and, 
   * Cleaning up 70 percent of all legacy TRU waste by the end of 2010, compared with 53 percent during prior planning. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that funds DOE and WIPP. For FY2005, Congress provided $204.1 million for WIPP Operations and the DOE's Carlsbad office in FY2005, an increase of $21.1 million over last year. (Subject to a 0.8 percent across the board reduction.) 
   Within this funding level, Domenici provided $12 million in additional funding for work associated with WIPP. Domenici included $3.5 million for the city of Carlsbad for educational support, infrastructure improvements, and related initiatives to address the impacts of accelerated operations.
