   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici says he will use his ranking member status on the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee to try to gain more funding for environmental cleanup at Los Alamos National Laboratory. He says the administration's budget has not provided enough money in recent years, which puts LANL at odds with a consent agreement with the state of New Mexico. He says the issue is likely to be covered at a subcommittee hearing on Wednesday.
   02:28 Domenici says he will again support any legislative effort to stop planned Medicaid cuts to Sole Community Provider payments to hospitals like the one in Gallup or Albuquerque. He says the program is important to the delivery of health care in New Mexico. He explains the non-defense cuts recommended by the Bush administration, reductions that make funding these programs more difficult.
   05:07 Domenici rebuts the notion that McKinley County is a "victim" of the costs for fighting the war in Iraq. He says there is budgetary pressure on all nondefense programs, which will continue because the United States "can't just jump out [of Iraq] like playing hopscotch."
   06:42 Domenici discusses the difficulties arising from the contested Republican primary race for his U.S. Senate seat. However, he says both Representatives Heather Wilson and Steve Pearce knew of the risks when they entered the race. He questions whether their dueling campaigns will serve either well during the fall general election.
   09:02 Domenici says he launched the so-called "Rural Payday" initiative more than 10 years ago after getting a sense of animosity from rural communities toward their belief that jobs and other resources were too heavily invested in the Albuquerque metropolitan area. He says Rural Payday was intended to promote rural New Mexico for jobs. He says New Mexico has changed dramatically since the program started, and that there is less disparity now in rural areas, with good growth in southeast and northwest New Mexico in a variety of industry and government activities.
   15:21 Domenici says he will listen carefully to the testimony to be offered by General David Petraeus to Congress this week about the situation and outlook in Iraq. He expresses confidence in Petraeus, and suspects that there probably will not be any recommendations for a major shift in U.S. military policy in Iraq until September.
   18:41 Domenici says he is unsure whether the Iraqi military offenses ordered by Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al-Maliki against the Shiite forces of Muqtada al-Sadr will help the American position in Iraq. He says it seems the Iraqi army has only had mixed success against al-Sadr militiamen.
   20:17 Domenici discusses the effort to reform the 1872 Mining Law, as well as oil and gas exploration. He says in terms of mining, the now stalemated reform should apply royalties on mineral production. He stresses that oil and gas firms already pay royalties for production on federal lands, much of which is returned to the state of New Mexico. While he says he lacks information as to the validity of oil and gas reserves in Santa Fe or Rio Arriba counties, he explains why a rush to impose exploration and production moratoriums could be ill-advised for a number of reasons.
