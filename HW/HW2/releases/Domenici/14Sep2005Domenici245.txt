SEN. DOMENICI: UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO RECEIVES OVER $400,000 TO PURCHASE EDUCATIONAL EQUIPMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the University of New Mexico has been awarded several grants to purchase equipment to supplement math and science programs.  
   The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) issued three new grants to UNM for a total of $410,000 in federal funds. The awards represent the first allotments of a total $708,000 to be issued to UNM for specialized equipment. 
   "DOE grants like this will provide greater educational opportunities for students at the University of New Mexico," said Domenici. "UNM already has very strong math and science departments and I am pleased that these awards will allow them to continue educating students and preparing them for careers in these fields." 
   The grants received will be used to purchase the following equipment: 
   * $125,000 to purchase localized scale coupling and new educational paradigms in multi-scale mathematics and science; 
   * $42,000 to implement fabrication and testing of 3D active-edge silicon sensors that are high speed and high yield for the Alternative Dispute Resolution Externship program; and, 
   * $243,000 to purchase nanostructured catalysts for hydrogen generation from renewable feedstocks. 
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, as well as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for the DOE and its programs.
