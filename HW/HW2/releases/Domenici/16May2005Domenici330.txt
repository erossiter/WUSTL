IN ADVANCE OF PEAK DRIVING SEASON, SEN. DOMENICI MEETS WITH SAUDI ENERGY MINISTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, issued the following statement following his lunch meeting today with Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman, Saudi Arabian Energy Minister Ali bin Ibrahim Al-Naimi, and House Energy and Commerce Chairman Joe Barton:  
   "I was very pleased to hear from Minister Al-Naimi that it is the policy of Saudi Arabia to try to increase crude oil production in order to keep petroleum prices as stable as possible. This is especially important as Americans enter the peak summer driving season. 
   "The meeting today confirmed that such issues as refining capacity and increasing demand from Asian nations have tremendous impact on crude oil and gasoline prices. The meeting reinforces, in my view, the absolute need for a comprehensive energy bill as soon as possible. 
   "I am glad that Secretary Bodman hosted the meeting. I believe the fact that he is keeping such a close personal focus on energy demand and an active relationship with representatives of producing nations holds promise for keeping energy prices as low as possible." 
   The Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee will formally begin crafting a comprehensive energy policy bill tomorrow. The Committee is expected to spend the entire week working on the bill. Over the past few months, Chairman Domenici and Ranking Member Jeff Bingaman have had extensive discussions to lay the groundwork for an energy bill.
