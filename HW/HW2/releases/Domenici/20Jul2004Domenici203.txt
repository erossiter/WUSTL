COMMUNITY HEALTH CARE CENTER EXPANDS MEDICAL SERVICES FOR EL RITO RESIDENTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that residents in El Rito will now receive a wider array of medical services because of funds awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  
   Domenici said the $388,670 awarded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) was issued through its Bureau of Primary Health Care to allow Las Clinicas Del Norte to bolster health care services offered to the underserved and uninsured. 
   "The funds from HHS will help Las Clinicas to expand their services to the El Rito area, where there is significant need for health care," Domenici said. "This center has offered medical support for people who would not normally be able to afford medical care, dental care, counseling, and pre-natal and post-natal care." 
   Las Clinicas has facilities in three rural communities in Rio Arriba and Taos counties, Abiquiu, El Rito, and Ojo Caliente. Each offers a broad range of primary medical, dental, and mental health services, including medical outreach and preventive, urgent, and emergency care. 
   Medical services include both well-child and adult assessment. New patients are given a complete health screening, including a health history and diagnostic testing. This serves as the basis for a mutually developed, individualized treatment plan. 
   Las Clinicas also provides pre- and post-natal care, diabetes management program, child and adult vaccinations and inoculations, comprehensive cancer screening, HIV/AIDS testing, physical exams and sports physicals, ophthalmology, and pedodontics. 
   The medical team consists of a medical director, one physician, three mid-level family nurse practitioners, a registered nurse, two licensed practical nurses and two medical assistants. Three lay health workers assist with diabetes-specific support services.
