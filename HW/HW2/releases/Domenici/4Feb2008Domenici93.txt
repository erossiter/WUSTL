SEN. DOMENICI SAYS FY09 BUDGET 'GOOD OVERALL' FOR LABS, BUT PROBLEMATIC FOR WIPP & N.M. WATER PROJECTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today said the FY2009 federal budget rolled out by the Bush administration is good for the national laboratories in New Mexico, but also includes areas of concern for other federal projects and programs in the state. 
   Domenici offered an initial assessment of the $3 trillion federal budget plan, which will serve as the starting point for Congress to develop a FY2009 Budget Resolution and subsequent appropriations measures to fund the government next year. The administration has proposed spending increases for defense and homeland security activities and a virtual spending freeze for the rest of the federal government. 
   "This budget will come under close scrutiny and substantial change before it's all over with. I'll take the positive and work to change what is not good for New Mexico," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Budget Committee, as well as a number of Senate appropriations subcommittees.  
   "This will be a difficult budget and appropriations season. The President has basically recommended a spending freeze, which means it will take a lot of work to make sure our needs in New Mexico are met within the confines of a tight budget," he said. 
   After a contentious FY2008 budget process that threatened to slash almost $600 million from the DOE nuclear weapons laboratories, the Bush FY2009 budget is recommending stable funding overall for Los Alamos National Laboratory and Sandia National Laboratories. 
   "This budget is good overall for the labs, and should work to put them on stable footing. We will have to be vigilant of proposals that could again throw the labs' work into crisis," Domenici said. "The administration is recommending necessary investments in lab facilities, but I see room for improvement on such projects as the LANSCE facility at Los Alamos." 
   An initial review of the FY2009 budget plan outlines $162 million for environmental cleanup at LANL, $100 million to continue work on the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Facility, and $1.37 million for its weapons program. 
   Under this budget, overall spending at Sandia would be $1.42 billion overall, an increase of $25.3 million. Domenici welcomed the overall DOE budget for its proposed investments in nonproliferation and the Office of Science, which would support the Advanced Simulation and Computing initiative that would be led by Sandia and Oak Ridge national laboratories. 
   Domenici was critical of an estimated $23 million cut recommended for operating the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) near Carlsbad. The budget requests $211.5 million for WIPP, which is less than the $236.7 million provided by Congress in the FY2008 omnibus appropriations bill. 
   "This budget for WIPP is unacceptable and will compromise the transportation and disposal of defense wastes from around the DOE nuclear weapons complex," Domenici said. 
   Domenici reported that the Department of Defense budget recommends a total of $57.5 million for military construction projects at the three Air Force bases in New Mexico--Holloman, Cannon and Kirtland. 
   The bill requests $25 million for five separate military construction projects at Holloman Air Force Base, which is being prepared to become home to two 18-aircraft squadrons of F-22A Raptor fighter jets. The initial F-22A aircraft are scheduled to arrive at Holloman in the first quarter of 2009, replacing the retired F-117 stealth fighter jets that had been based there. 
   The plan also recommends $18.1 million for an Air Force Special Operations Command maintenance hangar at Cannon Air Force Base at Clovis and $14.1 million for a fuel storage replacement project at Kirtland Air Force Base in Albuquerque. No projects were included for White Sands Missile Range. 
   "This is a positive start to the budget process, and very good news for Holloman. It signals that the Air Force is looking at needs at the base as it ramps up to deploy the F-22s in southern New Mexico," Domenici said. "I am also pleased to see that the Special Operations command wants to continue making improvements at Cannon as the base's new mission ramps up." 
   "I will work with Cannon, Kirtland, WSMR and Holloman to identify and then pursue what they need," he said. 
   The budget anticipates about $54 million for operation and maintenance needs at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center at Artesia, but does not include any construction project requests for the campus. The budget also seeks $442.4 million to hire, train and equip 2,200 new Border Patrol agents, which will bring the total number of agents to 20,000 by the end of September 2009. All of these agents will be trained at FLETC-Artesia. 
   "Despite the budget recommendation, I suspect that we may need to push for additional construction improvements at FLETC-Artesia. We are still placing a lot of demands on this campus and it should have the facilities it needs to meet those demands," Domenici said. 
   The budget offers $22.7 million in Bureau of Reclamation funding for the Middle Rio Grande Project, a $16 million decrease, for water infrastructure and Endangered Species Act compliance. 
   The Army Corps of Engineers budget recommends $4.2 million for ongoing flood protection in Alamogordo, but eliminates funding for such projects as the northern New Mexico acequias irrigation system, and flood protection work in Albuquerque's South Valley. 
   Finally, Domenici said he will challenge the U.S. Forest Service budget recommendation to eliminate all funding for the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Trust, which Congress funded at $3.69 million in FY2008. The National Park Service budget does, however, recommend $3.17 million to rehabilitate the visitor center at the Bandelier National Monument. 
   The following are highlights of FY2009 budget requests by the Bush administration that will affect New Mexico: 
   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY 
   Total New Mexico Spending: $4.22 billion in New Mexico in FY2009 for activities including the operation of Los Alamos and Sandia National Laboratories and WIPP, $309 million below the FY2008 level.

New Mexico is slated to receive approximately $2.4 million in FY2008, serving airports in Alamogordo, Carlsbad, Clovis, Hobbs and Silver City. 
   Amtrak - $800 million for Amtrak, which represents a significant cut to the railroad's Federal subsidy. The budget would require Amtrak to control its operating losses and focus on services that offer the most promise. Reserves the bulk of funds for capital investment so improvements may continue along the heavily trafficked Northeast Corridor. Amtrak runs two routes through New Mexico. 
   Intercity Passenger Rail Capital State Matching Grants - $100 million for a matching grant program for intercity passenger rail capital projects to empower states, not Amtrak, to address their transportation goals and priorities. 
   DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION
