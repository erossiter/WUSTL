SEN. DOMENICI REFLECTS ON 5TH ANNIVERSARY OF OPERATION IRAQI FREEDOM
  Marking the fifth anniversary of Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reiterated his support for U.S. troops in their ongoing efforts to improve Iraq's safety and security.  
   Domenici recalled the New Mexico-related casualties in the War on Terror and offered the following remarks:
   "The Iraqi government has recently made progress in achieving the benchmarks laid out by the President and Congress last year, and I am encouraged by their growth in cultivating a peaceful and safe Iraq. I expect further progress as the Iraqi government works together in the best interest of its people.
   "These advances would have been impossible without the help of American troops. Over the past several years they and their families, many from New Mexico, have made great sacrifices. They deserve our profound thanks and support for their efforts in Iraq and the overall War on Terror.
   "The costs associated with the war are large, yet I believe circumstances dictate that we support funding and a congressional role to allow our troops to defend the United States to the fullest extent. To do otherwise will strengthen our enemies and undermine our national security."
