SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES HUD GRANT TO UPDATE ASSISTED LIVING APARTMENTS IN ROSWELL
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded a $97,763 grant to provide elderly assistance services at the Roswell Summit Apartments.  
   Funds were provided as part of HUD's Service Coordinator Program, and will be used to employ a service coordinator at the Summit Apartments, which provide housing for elderly and disabled persons. 
   "I am always pleased to see residential areas that help elderly and disabled individuals live as independently as possible," said Domenici. "These HUD funds will help the Roswell Summit Apartments as they look to provide residents with a full range of services." 
   Service coordinators provide social support services to ensure that residents are linked to services that help them continue living independently. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee and serves on the subcommittee that funds HUD.
