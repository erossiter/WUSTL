SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS CONTINUED EFFORTS TO STRENGTHEN TAOS FIRE DEPARTMENT
  In the wake of several fires blazing across New Mexico, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today commended the Taos fire department for successfully completing another round of FEMA grant funding that will finance the purchase of personal protective gear to be shared with other small fire departments in the area. 
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for FEMA, announced that the Taos Ski Valley Fire Department was selected to receive $52,830 in funding to purchase additional breathing apparatus compressors (CBA) and bunker gear. 
   "Within the past two months, New Mexico has been afflicted with several dangerous and damaging fires that have consumed homes, land and wildlife. As we brace ourselves for another dry summer, I am pleased to see local fire departments making the extra effort to be prepared," Domenici said. "The funds will help Taos buy equipment that can be shared with the other fire departments around Enchanted Circle." 
   Enchanted Circle forms a loop that encompasses Taos, Angel Fire, and Red River in addition to passing through Carson National Forest, the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, and Wheeler Peak, New Mexico's highest point. Nineteen small fire departments serve the communities that make up this circle.
