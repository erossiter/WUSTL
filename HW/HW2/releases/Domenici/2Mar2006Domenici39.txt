SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $20 MILLION HONEYWELL CONTRACT EXTENSION FOR DEFENSE WORK
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that Honeywell Inc. in Albuquerque has been awarded over $20.7 million in two separate contract modifications to equip F/A-18C/D Hornet and AV-8B Harrier II aircraft with sophisticated display equipment.  
   Honeywell Inc. in Albuquerque will continue to furnish the aircraft with advanced multi-purpose color displays (AMPDs) that are designed to increase visibility, efficiency and precision. The company has received $12.7 million contract extension for work on F/A-18C/D and AV-8B aircraft. The extension is through March 2008. 
   "The defensive work conducted at Honeywell is invaluable to our defense missions at home and overseas. I am very pleased that the Navy and other branches of our military know they can rely on New Mexico-based companies to advance the protection of the United States," said Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   First introduced in 1987, the F/A-18C/D Hornet is a one or two-man all-weather strike fighter with two weapon stations to accomplish both air-to-air and air-to-ground combat missions. The Hornet has ground mapping, precision strike, and night attack capabilities. 
   The AV-8B Harrier is a one-man night attack conducting air-to-ground combat with laser guided bombs, Maverick missiles, sidewinders, and munitions. The Harrier also serves as helicopter escorts, armed reconnaissance, and close and long air support. 
   The Albuquerque firm also gained a $7.93 million extension through February 2008 for AMPD equipment for F/A-18 E/F and EA-18G aircraft. 
   Honeywell Inc. is a leading provider of integrated avionics, engines, systems and service solutions for aircraft manufacturers, airlines, business and general aviation, military, space and airport operations.
