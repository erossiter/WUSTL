U.S. CAPITOL CHRISTMAS TREE ARRIVES IN D.C., NEW MEXICO'S GIFT TO NATION REACHES END OF THE ROAD
  Sen. Pete Domenici today helped welcome the U.S. Capitol Christmas Tree-plucked from the Santa Fe National Forest-calling it New Mexico's gift to the nation for the holiday season.  
   The tree arrived at the U.S. Capitol following an extensive tour of New Mexico and a cross-country trek to Washington. The Architect of the Capitol (AOC) accepted the tree from the New Mexico and U.S. Forest Service team that shepherded the 80-foot Engelmann spruce to Washington. 
   "The tree is here and ready to brighten the holidays. When you consider what it took to get this beautiful tree off the mountain, the children who made thousands of ornaments for it, and thousands of people who showed up to see it throughout New Mexico, you have to consider this a special day and a very special tree," Domenici said before a crane hoisted the tree off an extended trailer. 
   "The tree truly is a gift to the nation from the people of New Mexico. When the tree is lighted, thousands of people will get to see a special piece of New Mexico," said Domenici, who also thanked the U.S. Forest Service and New Mexico sponsors for their work on the tree. 
   The AOC will now undertake the process of lighting and festooning the tree with decorations made by New Mexicans, including hundreds of school children. The tree will be formally lit on Thursday, Dec. 8. The tree will be officially lighted by House Speaker Dennis Hastert at a public ceremony scheduled for 5 p.m., Thursday, Dec. 8. The tree will remain lit through Jan. 1.
