LAS CRUCES SCHOOL DISTRICT AWARDED $1.6 MILLION HEAD START GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded a $1,629,558 grant to the Las Cruces School District #2 for the continued support of its Head Start program.  
   The Las Cruces Public Schools Head Start program, working alongside Hatch Valley Municipal Schools, operates home- and center-based sessions for 3 and 4 year old students. This federal grant will support that work through June 2006. 
   "Head Start strives to increase the school readiness of low-income children in New Mexico by supplying meals, instruction, school health services, and a variety of other aids," said Domenici. "I am pleased to announce the allocation of this funding to a program that serves more than 400 children in Do?a Ana County." 
   Head Start provides developmental support to low-income children, ages 3 to 5, along with social services for participating families. Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding for HHS, which administers the federal Head Start Program.
