HHS PRESENTS OVER $2.0 MILLION FOR HOUSING AT THREE NEW MEXICO PUEBLOS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has allocated over $2 million to Acoma, Cochiti, and Isleta Pueblos for housing construction.  
   The HUD Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) is awarded for various housing activities in Indian reservations and Indian areas. IHBG provides funding for the development of affordable housing, assistance and housing services to eligible groups, as well as crime prevention and safety. 
   "The diversity and flexibility of these HUD grants allow each of the pueblos to improve their communities as they see fit," Domenici said. "These funds provide great assistance to New Mexico and will allow families and individuals in these three communities to have desirable housing." 
   IHBG funding totaling $2,015,169 was distributed as follows: 
   * Pueblo of Acoma Housing Authority - $1,058,389 
   * Pueblo de Cochiti Housing Authority - $164,468 
   * Isleta Pueblo Housing Authority - $802,312 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee that sets funding levels for HUD and its programs.
