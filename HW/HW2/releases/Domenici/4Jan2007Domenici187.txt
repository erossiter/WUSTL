SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEPARTURE OF NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION ADMINISTRATOR LINTON BROOKS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today released the following statement regarding the departure of Under Secretary of Energy for Nuclear Security/Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Ambassador Linton Brooks:  
   "I'd like to thank Ambassador Brooks for his years of dedicated service to our nation. Ambassador Brooks has worked on our national security in a variety of capacities, including as an arms control negotiator during President George H.W. Bush's Administration and as a Naval officer. I wish him well. 
   "I have expressed concern about the effectiveness and future of NNSA for some time. In seeking the resignation of Ambassador Brooks, Secretary Bodman has sent a clear message that he believes it is time to improve NNSA and the safety and security of our national labs along with it. I welcome that sentiment. 
   "I hope the transition to a new Administrator goes smoothly and quickly, and I look forward to working with the new NNSA leadership when it is in place." 
   Domenici was one of the primary authors of the legislation creating the NNSA in 2000 to provide a streamlined management regiment for the DOE nuclear weapons laboratories and related facilities, naval reactors, nonproliferation and materials disposition, DOE counter-intelligence and security measures. Domenici has indicated that he believes the potential of NNSA has yet to be fulfilled.
