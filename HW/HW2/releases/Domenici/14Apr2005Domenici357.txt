SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDING DIVERSION TO SUPPORT RIO PUERCO FLOOD CONTROL PROJECT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised the diversion of $1.1 million in federal funds to the Little Puerco River project in the Gallup area that will allow additional progress to be made to keep potential flood waters at bay.  
   At Domenici's request, the Army Corps of Engineers has agreed to transfer the funding to the Little Puerco River project. 
   "This downtown area of Gallup is prone to flooding, which costs businesses, damages infrastructure and puts a halt on daily business," Domenici said. "The goal of this project is to put measures in place that prevent future floods from running rampant into downtown structures." 
   This project would protect downtown Gallup from future flooding, an area that has been flooded twice in the last 15 years. Funding in FY2004 allowed for culverts to be replaced at Roundhouse Road to protect the area north of the railroad tracks and prevent water from backing into an area of the channel that is covered by roads and structures. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee that will draft the FY2006 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill this spring and summer which includes projects for the Bureau of Reclamation and the Army Corps of Engineers. 
   The $1.1 million transferred to the project, authorized through the 1948 Flood Control Act, will help the construction contract get awarded. The total project cost is estimated at $6.5 million.
