FORMER SEN. DOMENICI AIDE NAMED ACTING BUREAU OF LAND MANAGEMENT DIRECTOR
  Sen. Pete Domenici today expressed confidence that his former legislative aide Jim Hughes will serve well as acting director of the Bureau of Land Management, an appointment announced Wednesday by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne.  
   Hughes, the BLM Deputy Director for Programs and Policy, will fill the post vacated by Kathleen Clarke until President Bush nominates and the Senate confirms a new BLM director. Hughes worked as a legislative aide to Domenici in the early 1980s, and also worked for the late Congressman Joe Skeen before launching a career within the BLM. 
   "I am very pleased that Jim has been given this opportunity and believe he will serve well. He is the latest in a long line of New Mexicans who have led the BLM and Interior Department, and I believe he clearly understands the complex land management issues facing the BLM, including how those policies affect New Mexico," Domenici said. "I wish Jim the best success as he fills this role." 
   The BLM oversees the management of more than 13.4 million surface acres in New Mexico, and nationally administers 258 million acres in 12 Western states, and more than 700 million acres of subsurface mineral estate around the country. The agency has about 10,000 employees and an annual budget of about $1.8 billion. 
   Hughes has held a variety of positions within the Department of Interior since 1986, including BLM Deputy Director for External Affairs; director of Congressional Affairs for Interior Secretaries Donald Hodel and Manuel Luj?n, Jr.; and Deputy Assistant Secretary for Lands and Minerals Management, also under Luj?n. He worked for Skeen from 1997 to 2002. 
   Hughes, an Army Veteran, has an undergraduate degree from New Mexico State University and did graduate work at the University of Minnesota.
