GRANT AWARDED TO IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEMS IN NEW MEXICO
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has allocated $8.2 million in grant funding that can be used by New Mexico public safety agencies to acquire or improve interoperable communications systems.  
   The Department of Commerce's National Telecommunications and Information Administration (NTIA), in consultation with DHS, has made grant funding available to states under the Public Safety Interoperable Communications (PSIC) Grant Program. 
   "New Mexico public safety agencies may receive PSIC grants to acquire, deploy, or train staff for the use of interoperable communications," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   "I am pleased grant funding is available to improve communication capabilities within state and local public safety agencies in New Mexico. Acquiring and improving upon existing communication technology will help these agencies better serve and protect their communities, particularly in emergency situations," said Domenici, who is also a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
   Each public safety agency that is awarded PSIC funding must meet and document a 20 percent statutory match requirement for each project during the period of performance of the grant. Up to 5 percent of the $8.2 million allocated for New Mexico may be used to ensure that the PSIC criteria are incorporated into statewide plans. 
   PSIC Grant Program updates are available on the NTIA website: http://www.ntia.doc.gov/psic.
