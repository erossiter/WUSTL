LEA, ROOSEVELT COUNTIES INCLUDED IN SBA NATURAL DISASTER DESIGNATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) has approved a natural disaster designation to Lea and Roosevelt counties as part of a broader disaster designation covering a number of West Texas counties.  
   The designation was granted for the two New Mexico counties as well as six counties in Texas. Businesses that cannot meet normal operating expenses because of excessive rain, hail, and high winds that battered the southeast New Mexico counties last August are eligible to apply for SBA loans. 
   "Although New Mexico has had its share of drought problems, the repercussions from severe rain storms have also done damage to crops. Businesses that rely on farmers and producers were walloped from ruined crops," Domenici said. "Fortunately, the SBA is offering some relief from lost sales and I encourage eligible small businesses to consider applying for these loans." 
   The designation will allow businesses dependent upon producers who lost their crop may be approved for up to $1.5 million for actual disaster-related financial needs of the business. The loan can help a business meet installments of long-term debt, accounts payable and overhead expenses that would have been met had the disaster not occurred.
