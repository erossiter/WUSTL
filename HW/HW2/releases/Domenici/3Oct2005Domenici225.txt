SEN. DOMENICI ENCOURAGES BUSH TO SUSPEND U.S. TARIFF ON MEXICAN CEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today encouraged President Bush to suspend the American tariff imposed on Mexican cement imports in order to overcome a growing shortage that could hinder public works and commercial activities around the country.  
   Domenici, who today embarked on an official Senate trip that will include a review of hurricane-damaged levee systems in the Gulf Coast area, issued his request in a letter to the President and Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez. 
   "Because of the imminent surge in demand for cement for hurricane-related reconstruction projects and to continue satisfying demand for pre-existing domestic construction projects, the tariff on Mexican-imported cement must be reevaluated," Domenici wrote. 
   "The United States is dependent on foreign sources for a quarter of its cement supply. As such, it is necessary to relax the barriers that prevent cement imports from reaching American developers. To that end, I ask you to consider suspending the tariffs on cement imports from Mexico," he said. 
   The United States currently imposes a tariff of $57-per-ton on imported Mexican cement. 
   New Mexico is among 20 states that now have a cement shortage or have started to ration cement. Shortages are linked to rising global demand as well as a variety of macro economic factors including low-interest rates that have fueled a surge in private residential construction, and rising fuel costs that are having a direct impact on costs of shipping cement. 
   Domenici also noted that devastation to the Gulf Coast caused by Hurricanes Katrina and Rita will increase the demand for cement in America. 
   Domenici noted in his letter to Bush that his staff has been in discussions on the cement supply situation with officials at the Department of Commerce, and that he is heartened by a willingness to consider reducing the tariffs imposed on Cemex, a Mexican cement company.
