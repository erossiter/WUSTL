SEN. DOMENICI STEPS UP EFFORT TO GAIN SUPPORT FOR BUDGET REFORM
  Sens. Pete Domenici (R-N.M.) and Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) today stepped up their efforts to gain more Senate support for implementing a two-year federal budget cycle that would allow Congress to avoid rushing omnibus funding packages and have more time to carry out oversight of government action.  
   Domenici issued a "Dear Colleague" letter to gain more support for the Biennial Budget and Appropriations Act (S. 877). This bill will convert the appropriations and budget process to a two-year cycle and enhance oversight of federal programs. 
   "We believe that the process we are proposing would provide the tools necessary to make better spending decisions," Domenici wrote. "By moving to a biennial budget cycle, we can plan, budget, and appropriate more effectively, strengthen oversight and watchdog functions, and improve the efficiency of government agencies." 
   Domenici noted that virtually every year, lawmakers struggle to finish the budget well into December. Since 1950, Congress has only twice met the October 1 fiscal year deadline for completion of all appropriation bills that fund the government. 
   Domenici said support is growing for his biennial budget legislation, which he first introduced in the late 1990s. Among the Senators cosponsoring S. 877 are Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-Tenn.) and Budget Committee members Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), Russ Feingold (D-Wis.), Wayne Allard (R-Col.), Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), Mike Crapo (R-Idaho), Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), and Jim Bunning (R-Ky.). 
   Senators Richard Lugar (R-Ind.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb), and Jon Corzine (D-NJ) are also cosponsors. 
   The Domenici-Lieberman bill has been referred to the Senate Budget Committee, on which Domenici serves.
