SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES BUS TRANSIT FUNDS FOR LAS CRUCES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation has released $364,077 he secured in 2004 for the city of Las Cruces to build up its transit system. 
   The city of Las Cruces will utilize the DOT grant to purchase a replacement bus for the city's transit department. The funds will also be used to purchase an automated bus wash system.
   "I am pleased to see the funds that I requested for FY2005 have been released to Las Cruces. With the cost of gas is not decreasing, public transportation is becoming a necessity for some Las Cruceans," Domenici said.
   Domenici serves on the Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding for transportation projects. Domenici is the only member of the New Mexico congressional delegation to serve on the full Senate Appropriations Committee, which designates all funding to government agencies.
   Today, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the TTHUD FY2007 Appropriations Bill which contains over $8.8 million for national transit projects, including $1.64 million for busses and bus facilities for the City of Las Cruces and another $1.5 million for bus and bus facilities throughout New Mexico.
