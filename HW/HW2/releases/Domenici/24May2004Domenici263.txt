SEN. DOMENICI: BUSH 'ON RIGHT TRACK' WITH FIVE-POINT IRAQ PLAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement after President George W. Bush's speech on United States strategy in Iraq and specific steps toward achieving a free representative government in that nation:  
   "President Bush gave the American people a much better picture of what's going on in Iraq than we had before. He laid out what is going on there and what will come in the future. The President's five-point plan is a good one. Obviously, its success will depend on the Iraqis being trained and willing to protect and build their own country. I believe the Iraqis will choose to build a better nation for themselves. I believe President Bush is on the right track. He reminded us why it is important that we do our duty and keep our focus to secure a free Iraq and fight terrorism."
