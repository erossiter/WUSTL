SEN. DOMENICI: SAN JUAN COLLEGE GAINS $214,000 TO HELP MINORITY STUDENTS GET BIOMEDICAL RESEARCH DEGREES
  Minority students enrolled at San Juan College in Farmington are the focus of a new federal grant award that will help them advance to four-year institutions for degrees in biomedical research, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today announced. 
   Domenici said San Juan College has been awarded a $214,000 grant from the National Institute of General Medical Sciences (NIGMS) to support at "Bridges to Baccalaureate" program at the two-year school in Farmington. The Bridges program is intended to help put Hispanic, American Indian and other minority students on a path toward earning a full degree in pharmacology, physiology and biological chemistry research. 
   "The Bridges program is very good in terms of enlightening and encouraging more minority students to see the opportunities available in technical health care disciplines," Domenici said. 
   "The great advances made by Americans in health care research are important to the well-being of millions of people. For the United States to keep that edge, more of our youth must enter these fields. This grant to San Juan College is intended to bring more Hispanics and American Indians into that fold," he said. 
   The NIGMS, an arm of the National Institutes of Health, launched the Bridges program in 1992 as a means of helping students make the transition from two-year junior or community colleges to full four-year baccalaureate programs. The Bridges program specifically targets African American, Hispanic, and Native American students who are underrepresented in the field of biomedical sciences. 
   The grants can be used for, among other things, tuition remission, supplies, equipment, expenses, salary, wages, and fringe benefits for students and faculty.
