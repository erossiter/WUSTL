SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON NSA DOMESTIC SURVEILLANCE PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici, who serves on Senate committees overseeing homeland security policy and funding, today released the following statement related to media reports that the National Security Agency has since 9/11 been analyzing telephone numbers dialed in the United States as part of a domestic terrorism surveillance program: 
   "My understanding from my colleagues on the Senate Intelligence Committee is that all aspects of the Terrorist Surveillance Program are lawful and necessary to the ongoing work to protect the American people. Congress will, of course, continue its oversight on this program, with an eye toward balancing a right to privacy and our need to pursue terrorists who do us harm. Finally, I think it is important to note that according to the USA Today story, this NSA practice does not involve listening in on domestic calls."
