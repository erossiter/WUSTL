SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN ANNOUNCE $37 MILLION IN AID TO ADDRESS BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS IN NEW MEXICO
  U.S. Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today reported that the White House Office of Management and Budget will agree to the U.S. Department of Agriculture request to make $37 million available to address problems arising for reported bovine tuberculosis (TB) infections in eastern New Mexico.  
   The Senators learned of the decision Tuesday evening. The funding will be provided through the Commodity Credit Corporation and would allow the USDA to pay for the depopulation of infected dairy herds in New Mexico and carryout other activities to contain the TB situation in the state. 
   "This is great news and should give USDA the resources it needs to control the TB problem in New Mexico. Containing this disease before it becomes widespread is in everyone's best interests," Domenici said. "I expect these resources will work to satisfy the affected dairy farmers and maintain New Mexico's TB-free status." 
   "Destroying the infected herd is essential to stopping the spread of bovine TB in our state. I'm very appreciative that this funding is being made available to assist with that very expensive task, and to help the state tackle this serious problem," Bingaman said. 
   Both Domenici and Bingaman have been working with Agriculture Secretary Michael Johanns and the Bush administration to address the problematic TB situation in Curry and Roosevelt counties, particularly in how the outbreak could affect New Mexico's status as a "TB Free" state. Downgrading the state's status could require livestock producers-both dairy farmers and ranchers-statewide to carry out expensive tests on cattle.
