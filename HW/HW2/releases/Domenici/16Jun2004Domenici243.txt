DEFENSE CONTRACT AWARDED TO UNM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the University of New Mexico has been selected by the Department of Defense to conduct scientific research on memory devices.  
   The University of New Mexico will receive between $300,000 and $500,000 to conduct a research project titled Coupled Ferromagnetic and Quantum Dots for Spin-Based Memory Devices to benefit DoD and national security interests. The specific amount will be negotiated in the coming months. 
   "UNM has been a constant leader in research through cooperation with the government," Domenici said. "I believe UNM can contribute significantly through this research to national security concerns that could arise in the future." 
   The grants are being awarded through the FY04 Department of Defense Infrastructure Support Program for Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Minority Institutions. The DoD aims to enhance programs and capabilities at these institutions in scientific disciplines critical to national security and the DoD. 
   Overall, the Army Research Office awarded 12 equipment grants and 13 research grants with performance periods of 12 and 15 months on. 
   Although the DoD will award 25 grants to 21 minority institutions for a total of $6.5 million, this particular grant is for infrastructure support funding conducted for the Office of Defense Research and Engineering by the Army Research Office and the Air Force Office of Scientific Research.
