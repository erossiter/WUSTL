TWO NEW MEXICO AGENCIES GET HUD HOMELESSNESS, AFFORDABLE HOUSING GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development has awarded a total of $105,000 in Community Development Technical Assistance grants to the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness and the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority.  
   HUD awarded $24,999 to the New Mexico Coalition to End Homelessness, which will utilize the funding to provide technical assistance to New Mexico groups involved in providing permanent housing solutions for the homeless population. 
   The second grant for $80,000 was awarded to the New Mexico Mortgage Finance Authority to assist in developing strategies to make owning a home more affordable for low income families. The NMFA will hire consultants to provide technical and hands-on training for non-profit housing development organizations. 
   "Homelessness is a problem in New Mexico," Domenici said. "These types of grants are very important because they provide the actual training and education to help housing development organizations. These organizations are essential in developing solutions to this problem." 
   The Community Development programs were instituted through HUD by the current Bush Administration in an attempt to end long-term or chronic homelessness by 2012.
