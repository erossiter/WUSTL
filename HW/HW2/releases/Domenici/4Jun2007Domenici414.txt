SEN. DOMENICI BACK BILL TO REPAY LAW SCHOOL LOANS FOR PUBLIC DEFENDERS, CRIMINAL PROSECUTORS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cosponsored legislation that creates a student loan repayment program for law school graduates who commit to serve as criminal prosecutors or public defenders.  
   The John R. Justice Prosecutors and Defenders Incentive Act of 2007, introduced by Senator Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), would allow eligible attorneys to receive loan debt repayments of up to $10,000 a year, with a maximum reimbursement amount of $60,000. 
   "This program provides a great incentive for attorneys to fill important and often badly-needed positions as prosecutors or public defenders in our criminal justice system," said Domenici. 
   "It's important that bright attorneys who are carrying law school debt not be discouraged from taking these jobs that incidentally often pay less than positions with private law firms. It is my hope that this program will help close the staffing gaps in our public justice system, while easing the burden of debt on new lawyers," he said. 
   Program participants would be required to remain employed for at least three years as a state or local criminal prosecutor or as a state, local, or federal public defender in criminal cases. Loan repayment benefits would be available to eligible graduates on a first come first served basis, but would give priority to borrowers least able to repay their loans. 
   The legislation is supported by the National District Attorneys Association, the National Association of Prosecutor Coordinators, the National Legal Aid and Defender Association, the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, and the American Bar Association.
