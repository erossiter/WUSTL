THREE ALBUQUERQUE FIRMS AWARDED MILLIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded three Albuquerque companies chosen to conduct important and challenging technology research that will greatly enhance aspects of everyday life.  
   The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), an agency of the Department of Commerce's Technology Administration, selected three organizations to receive approximately $3 million each through the Advanced Technology Program (ATP) to accelerate the development of emerging technologies. 
   "These three organizations deserve a pat on the back for accepting projects that present challenging dilemmas but will ultimately have phenomenal influences on our future lives," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Commerce Department. "Benefits stretch from helping the environment by eliminating pollutant fuel sources to improving America's position in the global market." 
   * Cabot Superior MicroPowders will head Enhancing the Performance of Polymer Electrolyte Membrane Fuel Cells, which works to provide clean power for cars. 
   * Kiara Network, Inc. will use the funds for the Ultracompact Low-cost Tunable Components for Reconfigurable Optical Networks and Spectroscopic Sensors project that will improve telecom services including broadband internet access. 
   * MesoFuel, Inc. will conduct research on Compact Pure Hydrogen Generation Systems for PEM Fuel Cell Applications, which will increase American influence in the fuel cell market and reduce the need for batteries which create disposal hazards. 
   ATP bridges the gap between the laboratory and the market place through research partnerships with the government and private sector. 
   ATP provides cost-shared funding to industry to accelerate the development and broad dissemination of challenging, high-risk technologies that promise significant commercial payoffs and widespread benefits for the nation.
