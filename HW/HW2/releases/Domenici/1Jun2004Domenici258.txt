SMOKEY BEAR PARK GETS FUNDS TO UPGRADE FACILITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded the decision to award over $34,000 to the New Mexico State Highway and Transportation Department to upgrade Smokey Bear Historical Park in Lincoln County.  
   The U.S. Department of Transportation authorized $34,400 to improve visitor facilities in the Park located in Capitan. 
   "These funds will help the Park accommodate visitors wanting to see the birthplace of Smokey Bear, our national fire prevention icon. Smokey Bear has long taught Americans the consequences of outdoor fire safety and I believe it's important that people continue to visit the park to learn a valuable message and enjoy the beauty of Capitan," Domenici said. 
   "Enhancing facilities on this land can help ensure that more visitors will enjoy the historic and educational value of Smokey Bear Historical Park and the Capitan community," Domenici said. 
   The Federal Highway Administration (FHA) administered the FY04 National Scenic Byway Discretionary funds to install restrooms and signs in the Park along Highway 380 in Lincoln County. 
   Domenici brought attention to the 60th birthday anniversary of the bear in a Congressional Record Statement in May, highlighting a three-day festival in Capitan. In his statement, the chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee recounted how a burned bear cub from southern New Mexico became the living symbol of Smokey Bear, who was created in 1944 as part of a public service campaign to save American forests from wildfires.
