SEN. DOMENICI: COMMERCE DEPT. PROVIDES ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT FUNDS FOR SOUTHWEST N.M.
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the U.S. Department of Commerce has awarded a $150,000 grant to the Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments to support regional development and implementation of a comprehensive economic development (CED) strategy.  
   Funds were awarded through the Economic Development Administration (EDA). The Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments is involved in areas including Luna, Hidalgo, Grant, and Catron counties. It will use the funds to continue its efforts to diversify and strengthen the regional economy through the development of a CED. 
   "Economic development funds will help the Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments improve economic resources and services in southwest New Mexico," said Domenici. "I expect these funds to help the council as it works with communities to as they pursue resources and plans that best suit their needs." 
   Officials expect the CED to establish an economic development planning framework, process, and strategy that will support private capital investment and job creation in the region's counties. 
   The Southwest New Mexico Council of Governments is a voluntary association of governments in Southeast New Mexico counties. Formed in 1969, it coordinates transportation, economic development, infrastructure services and assistance in association areas. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, and serves on the Commerce, Justice and Science Subcommittee that sets funding levels for programs administered through the Department of Commerce.
