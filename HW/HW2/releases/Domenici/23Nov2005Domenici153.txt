SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDS FOR CAPITAN FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici, a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, today detailed a grant for Capitan Volunteer Fire Department to improve safety precautions and equipment for its firefighters.  
   The grant was awarded through the federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, which is administered by the Homeland Security Department's Office of Domestic Preparedness. These grants are derived from the $650 million approved by Congress for 2005 grant awards. 
   "This program continues to provide necessary funding so that fire stations throughout New Mexico can provide swift service to residents. These firefighters voluntarily choose to be on call to respond to a variety of emergencies, and they should have the tools necessary to be prepared and protected at all times," Domenici said. 
   The Capitan Volunteer Fire Department in Lincoln County was awarded $38,475 to improve operations and firefighter safety. Funds may be used for training, equipment, personal protective equipment, wellness and fitness, and modifications to the fire station and its facilities.
