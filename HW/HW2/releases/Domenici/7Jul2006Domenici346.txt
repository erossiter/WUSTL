SEN. DOMENICI BREAKS GROUND ON ESPA?OLA WATER PROJECT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today participated in a groundbreaking ceremony for a much-needed expansion of Espa?ola's Wastewater Treatment Plant that is being called one of the largest public works project in the history of the city. 
   The upgrade will expand the plant's capacity to process wastewater by 1.37 million gallons a day, following more stringent standards enacted by the EPA and the Santa Clara Pueblo. These new standards resulted in a decrease of the Espa?ola plant's treatment capability to 670,000 gallons per day, down from 1.6 million.
   "For a number of reasons, it became necessary for Espa?ola to upgrade its wastewater treatment plant. I'm pleased that the city has worked out an agreement with the San Juan Pueblo which will benefit both parties and allow for construction on Pueblo property. I have worked to gain funding for this project and others like it so that communities will have a better standard of living and better protect water resources from contamination," Domenici said.
   Domenici obtained a $1.1 million EPA State and Tribal Assistance Grant which will be put toward the $13 million expansion. The project is expected to be completed in October 2007.
   As a result of the agreement between the San Juan Pueblo and Espa?ola, the Pueblo will grant access to construct a diversion across the Rio Grande on Pueblo property. In exchange Espa?ola has agreed to expand its wastewater lines to the Pueblo.
   Domenici has emphasized the need for rural communities to consolidate and use modern wastewater systems to improve efficiency.
   "Funding is a major challenge, but it makes sense for communities and pueblos to pair up as much as possible to create modern, efficient water systems that will provide real benefits to users. I will continue to work to help provide federal assistance for rural water systems," Domenici said.
