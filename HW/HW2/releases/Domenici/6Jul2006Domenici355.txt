SEN. DOMENICI SAYS KIRTLAND AIR FORCE BASE POSSIBLE HOME FOR CSAR-X AIRCRAFT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he is optimistic that the Air Force will find Kirtland Air Force Base to be a suitable home for its CSAR-X aircraft, the next generation combat search and rescue helicopter. 
   The Air Force recently indicated that Kirtland, already home to the CV-22 Osprey as part of the 71st Special Operations Squadron, is among eight domestic bases being reviewed for hosting the CSAR-X. The Air Force is beginning to initiate environmental analyses at these sites.
   "I believe the Air Force will find Kirtland and New Mexico's overall defense assets to be amenable to missions planned for the CSAR-X," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee.
   According to the Air Force, it is planning to create a "Total Force" mix of active Guard and Reserve units operating the CSAR-X. The Air Force expects to begin accepting CSAR-X aircraft in 2010 and wants to deploy them in combination with other assets to maximize use options.
   Besides Kirtland, the Air Force is also reviewing locations at: David-Monthan AFB, Arizona; Kulis Air National Guard Base or Eldmendorf AFB, Alaska; Gabreski Airport, N.Y.; Moffett Federal Airfield, California; Moody AFB, Georgia; Nellis AFB, Nevada; and Patrick AFB, Florida. Sites in Europe and the Pacific region are also pending. These environmental reviews are required under the National Environmental Policy Act.
   The CV-22s that arrived at Kirtland earlier this year are being used to train airmen, who will then be able to contribute to Special Operations missions around the world. The Osprey is particularly valuable for Special Ops missions because it has the ability to deploy quickly and quietly.
   Air Force Special Operations has a growing presence in New Mexico, lately highlighted by being designated as the new mission for Cannon Air Force Base at Clovis.
