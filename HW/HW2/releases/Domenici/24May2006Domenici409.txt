SEN. DOMENICI PLEASED WITH ARMY CORPS - UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO PACT TO RESEARCH RIO GRANDE SEDIMENT FLOWS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today lauded the signing of a joint agreement to more closely study sediment flows in the Rio Grande to hone riparian habitat restoration and improve the state's ability to meet its water compact obligations. 
   Domenici said the University of New Mexico Civil Engineering Department and the Army Corps of Engineers have signed a Research Cooperative Agreement to carry out a sediment transport study on the Rio Grande. The project will also be supported by Sandia National Laboratories.
   The New Mexico study, supported by funding provided by Domenici through the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill, will build on a river sediment research program being carried out by the Army Corps Research and Development group in Vicksburg, Miss., and the Desert Research Institute in Reno.
   "This study builds on the collaborative effort we have on the middle Rio Grande to improve the river and meet the demands placed on it," Domenici said.
   "I am very pleased that UNM and the Corps have worked out the guidelines that will help us better understand the river and improve its management. This study will help collect better field data and establish models for the river that can be used to support management decisions," he said.
   The Rio Grande study will be used to:
   * Assess the viability of Corps and Bureau of Reclamation habitat rehabilitation of in-river islands in flood and drought cycles;
   *Determine how to avoid sediment plugs in the river just north of Elephant Butte which inhibit the BOR and Interstate Stream Commission's ability to meet water compact requirements. (Last year, the Office of the State Engineer spent $6 million to dig out a two-mile stretch of the Rio Grande due to high flows.)
   * Find better levee management techniques for areas south of Albuquerque, where levees have failed during past floods.
   *Resolve how much sediment should be moved through Jemez Canyon and Cochiti dams to meet Endangered Species Act requirements.
   The Corps-UNM study will be supported through the appropriations provided by Domenici in FY2006 through the Corps' Research and Development Program, including $375,000 for the Southwest Urban Flood Damage Program and $1.75 million for innovative technology demonstrations for urban flooding and channel restoration in New Mexico and Nevada.
