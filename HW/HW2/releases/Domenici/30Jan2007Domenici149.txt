SEN. DOMENICI RIDES NEW FORD HYDROGEN 'PLUG-IN' VEHICLE, COMMITTEE CONSIDERS FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today gave the new PHEV Ford Edge a thorough review and rode to a vote in the U.S. Capitol in the first drivable hydrogen cell vehicle with plug-in capabilities.  
   Domenici's review of the hybrid vehicle came the day that the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee received testimony on transportation fuel efficiency, including the prospect of oil savings through technological innovations like plug-in hybrid vehicles. 
   "Ford has come up with one smart car," Domenici said. "I support research on a broad range of vehicle technologies, including plug-in hybrids, fuel cell vehicles, and alternative fuel vehicles. But we have a lot of work ahead of us to get where we want to be. It's going to take partnerships between the government, the automakers, and energy companies, and many other stakeholders. And it is going to take a lot of hard work." 
   Domenici, the ranking Republican on the Energy Committee, noted that rapid advances in such technology is needed if the nation is going meet President Bush's challenge to reduce U.S. gasoline consumption by 20 percent in 10 years. 
   Finally, Domenici said he is hopeful that a bipartisan agreement can be reached to change the CAFE standards ruling automobile fuel efficiency, which as remained at an average of 27.5 miles per gallon since 1985. 
   The Ford HySeries Drive Edge can go 225 miles on full range battery and hydrogen, with the first 25 miles available on battery alone. According to Ford, the hybrid vehicle combines an onboard hydrogen fuel cell generator with lithium-ion batteries to deliver more than 41 mpg with zero emissions. 
   Domenici was a primary author of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 that included significant incentives to advance hydrogen as a vehicle fuel source.
