DESPITE SETBACK, SEN. DOMENICI HOPES FOR FALL APPROVAL TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE, REFORM DEATH TAX
  The morning after the Senate fell four votes short to overcome a Senate Democratic roadblock, Sen. Pete Domenici said Friday he hopes enough support can be garnered this fall to pass a legislative package to raise hourly wages to $7.25. 
   Domenici was among 56 Senators who voted to allow the Senate to move to final passage of HR.5970, a House-passed bill that would raise the minimum wage, reform the death tax and extend a number of important tax credits. Sixty votes were needed to allow a final vote on the bill. The Senate leadership has indicated that the package will be reconsidered after the Senate reconvenes in September.
   "The votes to stop this bill were a disservice to citizens of all incomes. They blocked us from increasing the minimum wage. They denied the extension of some expiring tax credits for education and research and development, and they stopped a rational compromise on reforming the death tax," Domenici said.
   "Each of these items is supported by a bipartisan majority in the Senate, but enough of a minority chose to play politics with this package. It is my sincere hope that when we revisit this debate later this year, more civic-minded Senators will see the value in this economic package and allow it to become law," he said.
   The package would have increased the federal minimum wage by $2.10 over three years-from $5.15 an hour today to $5.85 an hour on Jan. 1, 2007, to $6.55 on hour in 2008 and $7.25 an hour in 2009.
   "We need to increase the minimum wage. It's too low now, and an increase is long overdue," said Domenici, who engineered the last minimum wage increase in 1996 as then chairman of the Senate Budget Committee.
   The blocked package would have also extended several expiring federal tax credits, including: the $4,000 deduction for education expenses; the research and development credit; and the welfare-to-work credit.
   HR.5970 is a permanent reduction, not a permanent repeal, of the death tax. Exemptions would be indexed for inflation. Starting Dec. 31, 2009, it would begin exempting estates worth $5 million per individual or $10 million per couple. Estates under $25 million would have a maximum tax rate of 15 percent. Estates over $25 million would be taxed at 30 percent. The new exemptions and rates would be fully phased in by Jan. 1, 2015.
   In 2004, about 220 estate tax returns were filed from New Mexico, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Of those New Mexico returns, about 100 were taxable and heirs paid $57.5 million to the federal government.
   Overall in the United States in 2004, 62,718 estate tax returns were filed on which $21.5 billion was collected from 30,276 of those returns. Of those taxable returns, a large majority-26,782-were from estates worth $5.0 million or less.
   Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with a complete phase-out of the federal death tax by 2010, but the repeal sunsets after one year. So without Congressional action, the death tax will be fully reinstated in 2011.
