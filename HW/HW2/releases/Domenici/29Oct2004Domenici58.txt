SEN. DOMENICI LAUDS ENMU'S DR. DALE DAVIS - 2004 NEW MEXICO PROFESSOR OF YEAR
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that Dr.  
 Dale Davis will receive the 2004 Professor of the Year award for excellence in undergraduate teaching and mentoring. 
   Dr. Davis has taught at Eastern New Mexico University since 1982, after receiving a D.B.A. and M.B.A. from Georgia State University as well as teaching stints at Kennesaw College and Berry College. He is being honored for his dedication to teaching, commitment to students, and his innovative instructional methods. 
   "Often the teaching accomplishments of professors are overshadowed by their research," Domenici said. "However, teaching and mentoring the next generation is just as important. I am pleased that Dr. Davis is being honored for his impact on our college students." 
   The U.S. "Professors of the Year" program started in 1981 and is the only national award program to recognize college and university professors for their teaching accomplishments. The program is sponsored by Council for Advancement and Support of Education and The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, which hosts the final round of judging and sponsors the cash award given to winners. 
   Dr. Dale Davis, along with the rest of the 2004 U.S. Professors of the Year, will be honored in Washington, D.C. on Thursday, Nov. 18th.
