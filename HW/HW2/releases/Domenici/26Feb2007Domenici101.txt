SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES FUNDING FOR PHYSICS RESEARCH AT UNIVERSITY OF NEW MEXICO
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the National Science Foundation (NSF) has awarded $175,000 to the University of New Mexico (UNM) to further research and education in the area of quantum physics.  
   The award is part of continued funding under NSF's CAREER program and will be applied to the "CAREER: Quantum State Preparation via Continuous Measurement and Feedback" research program at UNM. The research will study quantum measurement theory and systems in an educational environment that is accessible to a wider variety of the UNM student body. 
   The program will also heighten involvement in the Science Education Institute of the Southwest (SEIS) to improve science education in Albuquerque-area schools. 
   "I enjoy hearing about research that is used for both educational and practical purposes," said Domenici. "I am pleased to announce this funding by the NSF because I know it will help accomplish this. I hope that these resources will help deepen the research and understanding surrounding quantum science at UNM." 
   NSF's Faculty Early Career Program (CAREER) serves as a resource for junior faculty at qualified institutions. By providing funding for research, it aims to support the scientific research activities of science faculty members early on in their careers. 
   Domenici is a staunch advocate of education in the areas of science and technology. He was an original author of the Protecting America's Competitive Edge (PACE) Act, which was integrated into the National Competitiveness Investment (NCIA) Act in October and aims to improve America's involvement in scientific and technological education and career fields.
