DREAM TREE PROJECT RECEIVES AID TO FIGHT YOUTH HOMELESSNESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Dream Tree Project has been selected to receive a $100,000 federal grant to assist runaway and troubled youth in the Taos area.  
   The grant was awarded through the Region VI Office for Children and Families, a division of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The funds are intended to enhance the Transitional Living Program for Runaway and Homeless Youth, or TLP, which prepares adolescents for independent living by teaching a variety of job and life skills. 
   "Dream Tree reaches out to youth troubled by poverty, poor housing and abusive relationships who need to be on their own but don't yet have the skills to be self-sufficient. This program prepares young people for the working world and teaches them responsibility so they can be independent," Domenici said. 
   TLP is offered to individuals ranging between 16 and 24 years old. Services to transition youth smoothly into independent living situations include: intake and assessment; referral to community resources and mentorships; life skills classes; educational support services; job coaching and career development; peer support groups; and after care follow up and evaluation. 
   The DreamTree Project is a non-profit, community-based organization that began helping homeless, abused, and neglected youth in November 2000 with the Transitional Living Program. Dream Tree also offers Wilderness Therapy to youth and families in the community to promote healthy family and interpersonal dynamics.
