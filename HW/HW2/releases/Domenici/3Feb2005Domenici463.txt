SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LES-AREVA AGREEMENT ON DECONVERSION FACILITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding a memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed Thursday regarding the construction of a deconversion facility to handle wastes associated with a proposed uranium enrichment plant near Eunice, N.M.:  
   "I am tremendously impressed by the LES effort to be a good neighbor in New Mexico. It is clearly bending over backward to respond the concerns raised by the state, and should be commended for its efforts. I hoped this MOU will allay some of those concerns and further clear the path for progress on the uranium enrichment plant in Lea County. 
   "I have visited one of AREVA's deconversion facilities in France, and I can tell you that LES has picked an excellent partner." 
   On Wednesday, Louisiana Energy Services (LES) and AREVA Inc., a nuclear energy services company, signed a MOU regarding the construction of a private uranium hexafluoride deconversion plant to support the proposed National Enrichment Facility (NEF) outside Eunice. 
   Domenici has been a strong advocate for the NEF, which will create more than 200 permanent jobs that will bring an estimated $13 million in pay and benefits. It will also create over 400 construction jobs while the $170 million facility is completed. 
   As chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici has worked on legislative language that will ensure that the depleted uranium tailings will not be stored in New Mexico for any length of time. 
   The new NEF will use the world's most advanced, energy-efficient and cost effective uranium enrichment technology. The facility will allow the U.S. to have a domestic source of enriched uranium for the country's commercial nuclear power plants. Construction is expected to be completed in 2013.
