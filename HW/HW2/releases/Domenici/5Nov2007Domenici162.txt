   REVIEW: 
   00:00 Domenici says he wants more details on proposed energy exploration in the Galisteo Basin of New Mexico. He says the plan poses difficult questions, and notes that it could be that energy production in the region could not be compatible with existing land or resource uses in the area. 
   02:12 Domenici says any energy production in the Galisteo Basin would have to comply with all pertinent regulations, and that there is no "free ride from the environment" for oil and gas companies. 
   03:25 Domenici says the Navajo Nation and city of Gallup memorandum of understanding on water is useful to move the issue forward in Congress. He reiterates that he and Senator Bingaman are working to try to move legislation forward to authorize the Navajo water settlement and fund the federal portion of that pact. 
   05:33 Domenici says the time may be ripe in Congress to finally update the Mining Law of 1872, but notes that the Senate is likely to produce its own "realistic" reform rather than follow a bill passed by the House of Representatives. 
   09:47 Domenici says he believes Majority Leader Harry Reid is interested in the Senate moving forward with mining law reform legislation. 
   10:24 Domenici says it will take a lot of work to make the Milk Income Loss Contract program (MILC) in the 2007 Farm Bill less onerous to the larger, more efficient dairy operations in New Mexico. He notes that the Senate's Farm Bill does take care of the peanut program and specialty crop provisions that are important to New Mexico. 
   12:21 Domenici says he is likely to offer an advanced biofuels amendment to the Farm Bill during Senate debate this week. He says the amendment could cause a "ruckus" but says such an amendment could be an alternative to having it passed as part of a new energy policy bill, which is currently awaiting conference negotiations with the House. 
   14:27 Domenici says he has not seen a new Government Accountability Office report on Energy Department plans to handle nuclear weapons waste from DOE sites, including Sandia and Los Alamos national laboratories. He says the United States must make a decision on how to handle waste produced by nuclear power plants. He says he will review the report, but says DOE waste handling plans have not been presented to him as a "showstopper." 
   18:22 Domenici says he believes the military surge in Iraq is working, and that military and civilian casualties are declining. He says this could lead to a broader movement of U.S. military personnel from Iraq. He notes that Iraqi civilian rejection of al Qaeda and insurgents has helped improve the situation in Iraq. 
   21:27 Domenici says the prospect of $100 a barrel for crude oil means the United States must actively pursue alternative energy sources like cellulosic ethanol and advanced biofuels that do not have the problems associated with conventional ethanol.
