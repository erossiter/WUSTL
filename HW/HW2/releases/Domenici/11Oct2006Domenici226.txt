SEN. DOMENICI PRAISES BUSH ECONOMIC POLICIES FOR SLASHING BUDGET DEFICIT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised President Bush's and Republican economic policies as instrumental in the continued reduction of the federal deficit. 
   The U.S. Department of Treasury today announced that the federal budget deficit has decreased dramatically, from $318 billion last year to $248 billion this year, the second straight year of major reductions and significantly ahead of budget projections.
   "Nobody is happy about having a deficit at all, but in a time of war, it happens. The President took office in a time of economic slowdown. Fortunately, the President and Congress took proactive steps to grow the economy through tax cuts and reduced non-defense spending which have led to more jobs, and as a result, more revenue. We have now cut the deficit in half over three years ahead of schedule," Domenici said.
   "Policies enacted by the President and Congress have led to 18 consecutive quarters of economic expansion, 6.6 million new jobs created since August 2003, and now, a rapid increase in tax revenues. More people own their homes. Inflation is in check. We have more work to do, but news continues to be good, both in New Mexico and across the country," he continued.
   Last week, Domenici helped open the new Southwest Cheese Plant in Clovis, which will employ over 200 people in eastern New Mexico. That opening came as the government announced that the national unemployment rate has dropped to 4.6 percent.
   In order to spur economic development, President Bush and Congress doubled the child tax credit, reduced the marriage penalty tax, cut taxes on capital gains and dividends, and reduced taxes for every American.
   Domenici also noted that in FY2006, the federal budget increased spending by less than the rate of inflation.
