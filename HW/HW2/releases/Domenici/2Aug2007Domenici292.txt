SEN. DOMENICI AGAIN VOTES FOR LOBBYING REFORM BILL
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today voted to send President Bush legislation aimed at imposing tighter restrictions on lobbyists and enhancing disclosure related to earmarked funding.  
   As he has in the past, Domenici supported the reform measure--the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (S.1). The bill was passed on an 83-14 vote, clearing the way for the measure to be sent to the White House. It was passed earlier this week by the House of Representatives, 411-8. Domenici supported passage of the Senate bill in January, as well as similar legislation approved by the Senate in March 2006. 
   "Reforming the earmark process and strengthening the disclosure requirements on lobbyists will bring greater openness and transparency to our work in Congress. This bill is intended to help improve the public's confidence in the legislative process by reducing the potential for abuse and misunderstanding." 
   S.1 will modify existing statutes related to the disclosure of lobbying activities. It will impose new limits on travel and meals provided by lobbyists. The bill would require lobbyists to file more frequent disclosure reports, which would then be made available to the public. Under the provisions of the bill, lobbyists would have to increase the disclosure of their political and travel contributions. 
   The measure would enact stronger post-government employment restrictions on Senators, senior Senate staff, and senior executive branch officials. These post-employment restrictions are not applied to House members or senior House staff. 
   The bill also reforms the ability to add earmarks to appropriations, authorization or tax bills. It expands the definition of an earmark, and stipulates that a lawmaker must certify that earmarks do not benefit them personally.
