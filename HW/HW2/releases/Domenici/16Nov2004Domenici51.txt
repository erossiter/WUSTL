DREAM TREE PROJECT RECIEVES AID TO FIGHT YOUTH HOMELESS IN TAOS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Dream Tree Project has been selected to receive a $357,876 federal grant to assist runaway and troubled youth in the Taos area.  
   As a member of the Senate Veteran's Affairs and Housing and Urban Development (VA-HUD) appropriations subcommittee, Domenici indicated the funds will enhance the Transitional Living Program, or TLP, which helps runaways and homeless youth prepare for independent living by teaching a variety of job and life skills. 
   "Homelessness is a sad reality that can keep our youth from recognizing their full potential. Organizations such as Dream Tree in Taos have creative and effective programs to help youth achieve personal independence. I support Dream Tree's important mission to get kids off our streets, out of abusive homes and on their own," Domenici said. 
   TLP is offered to individuals ranging between 16 and 24 years old. Services that help transition youth smoothly into independent living situations include: referral to community resources and mentorships; life skills classes; educational support services; job coaching and career development; peer support groups; and after care follow up and evaluation. The Dream Tree Project is a non-profit, community-based organization that began helping homeless, abused, and neglected youth in November 2000 with the Transitional Living Program. Dream Tree also offers Wilderness Therapy to youth and families in the community to promote healthy family and interpersonal dynamics.
