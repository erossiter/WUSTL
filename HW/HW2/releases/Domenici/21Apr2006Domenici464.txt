SEN. DOMENICI: DOE GRANT WILL SUPPORT NEW MEXICO ENERGY SAVING PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the New Mexico Energy, Minerals and Natural Resources Department has been awarded a grant worth $314,000 from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to support the State Energy Program (SEP). 
   The SEP provides grants throughout New Mexico to design and implement renewable energy and energy efficiency programs in an attempt to reduce the growth of energy demand in New Mexico.
   "Programs under the SEP are very critical in reducing energy consumption and thereby decreasing energy costs for New Mexicans. Developing new energy reduction programs and renewable energy technologies will keep New Mexico on the right track to responsible energy conservation," Domenici said.
   SEP has funded numerous energy projects around New Mexico including Rebuild New Mexico which improves energy and water efficiency in existing state agency buildings and schools. SEP has also provided funds for wind energy farm research initiatives.
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which sets DOE funding levels.
