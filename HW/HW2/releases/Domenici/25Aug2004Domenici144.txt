SEN. DOMENICI: USDA GRANT SUPPORTS GALLUP SMALL BUSINESS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that Gallup has received a $300,000 grant from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) for a project that will house several small businesses under one roof.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee, said the Rural Business Enterprise Grant (RBEG) funding has been approved by the USDA. 
   "The USDA uses the RBEG program to help communities support fledgling businesses in the area and give them a better chance at success," Domenici said. "I am pleased with this initiative in Gallup to help a handful of small businesses get off their feet." 
   The funds provided will be used to buy land and an existing building to house up to eight emerging businesses. Three of those will be a native tea processing start-up, metal artwork, and a monthly news publication operation. This project will also create eight new jobs for the area.
