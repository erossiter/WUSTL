   REVIEW:
   01:27 - Domenici discusses the promised veto of the FY2007 Emergency Supplemental Appropriations Bill, the political showboating on the bill and likely failure of a congressional vote to override the veto.
   04:23 - Domenici confirms that a minimum wage increase is included in the Supplemental Appropriations Bill, along with funding for a variety of other projects that will have to be rehashed in new talks to find White House and congressional consensus on the bill.
   04:44 - Domenici looks at the wide differences of opinion between the Democratic leadership in Congress and what General David Petraeus, the American commander in Iraq, believes he needs to try to bring stability to Baghdad. He says the American military has the resources it needs for now, but says the bickering on Capitol Hill must be hurtful to U.S. forces on the battlefield.
   06:40 - Domenici reviews U.S. foreign aid being provided to assist Iraqis displaced by the war, noting that almost $200 million has been spent by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to help Iraqi refugees. He says he expects more to be provided in FY2007 and FY2008 funding.
   09:08 - Domenici reports his request for $1.0 million in FY2008 Environmental Protection Agency funding to support the village of Ruidoso's need to upgrade its wastewater treatment plant.
   11:58 - Domenici predicts that it will be "very, very hard" for the White House and congressional Democrats to reach a compromise on the FY2007 Supplemental Appropriations Bill. He says it could take weeks to find a compromise between the Democratic push to withdraw from Iraq and the President and General Petreaus' contention that leaving Iraq would make the entire situation there much worse.
