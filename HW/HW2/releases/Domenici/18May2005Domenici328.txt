NEW MEXICO SENATORS JOIN EFFORT TO SHUT DOWN BRAC PROCESS
  Sens. Jeff Bingaman and Pete Domenici today joined a Congressional effort to halt the process to close military installations.  
   The Senators are cosponsors of the "Postponement of 2005 Round of Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act," a bill that would prevent any military base from being closed before: 
   * The completion in 2006 of the Pentagon's Quadrennial Defense Review; 
   * The completion of the Commission on Review of Overseas Military Facility Structure of the United States; 
   * The return of deployment in the Iraq theater of substantially all major combat units; 
   * The complete development and implementation of the National Maritime Security Strategy; and, 
   * The complete development and implementation of the Homeland Defense and Civil Support directive. 
   "As it stands right now, we are putting the cart before the horse. The Pentagon is in the midst of assessing its needs for the future, but its report won't be complete until after the BRAC Commission is forced to close military bases. That defies logic," said Bingaman, who voted repeatedly against this round of BRAC. "This bill brings some sense to the BRAC process by allowing us to take this very important forthcoming Pentagon report, and other key factors, into account." 
   "The U.S. military today is actively involved in a number of missions around the world, and I think it is prudent to step back and reconsider whether a base closure exercise is the wisest move at this point. I've consistently opposed this BRAC round. The issues addressed in this bill are the same concerns the BRAC commission is rightfully raising in its initial hearings this week," Domenici said. 
   The bill was sponsored by Senator John Thune (R-SD). It has several cosponsors, including senators, Johnson (D-SD), Lott (R-MS), Gregg (R-NH), Sununu (R-NH), Snowe (ME), Collins (ME), Stevens (R-AK), Murkowski (R-AK).
