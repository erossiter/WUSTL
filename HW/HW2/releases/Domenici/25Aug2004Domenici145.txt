SEN. DOMENICI: FUNDING FOR 19 COMMUNITIES HELPS LOW-INCOME WORKERS GET TO THEIR JOBS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) has awarded funds to nineteen communities throughout New Mexico to provide transit service for low-income workers who need help getting to their jobs.  
   A total of $594,756 was awarded for nineteen Job Access and Reverse Commute (JARC) projects throughout the state. JARC is administered by the DOT's Federal Transit Administration. 
   Domenici, the only member of the New Mexico delegation to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee, requested that $2 million be included for JARC in the FY2005 Transportation Appropriations Bill. In FY2004, the lawmaker secured $1 million for this program. 
   "It can sometimes be difficult for workers who have restricted resources to find a steady means of getting to work. This JARC funding gives New Mexicans greater job security by providing reliable transportation so they can get to their jobs," Domenici said. "I am pleased to have worked for these funds and I will continue to lend my support to this program in the future." 
   Job Access Projects involve new or expanded transportation services such as shuttles, vanpools, new bus routes, connector services to mass transit, and guaranteed ride home programs for welfare recipients and low income persons. Reverse Commute projects provide transportation services to suburban employment centers from urban, rural and other suburban locations for all populations. 
   The following communities have received funding from the FTA. For additional information about JARC please visit http://www.fta.dot.gov/wtw.
