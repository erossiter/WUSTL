SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES LABOR DEPARTMENT DECISION TO WIPE OUT NEW MEXICO Y2K DEBT OFF THE BOOKS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced the resolution of long-standing millennium rollover dispute between New Mexico and the U.S. Department of Labor over nearly $900,000 spent to get the state's computer network set for the year 2000.  
   Domenici was today informed by the U.S. Department of Labor that it is dropping its demand that the New Mexico Department of Labor repay $892,245 in disputed charges associated with a Y2K computer compliance effort. 
   "I am very pleased that this demand for payment has finally been wiped off the books. Other states were not made to remit payments for certain Y2K costs. I am glad that New Mexico is now receiving likewise consideration. It amounts to a nice gift for the state, which can use every dollar to promote jobs and employment," said Domenici, who last year asked Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to act on New Mexico's behalf. 
   The federal government in 1998 and 1999 awarded grants totaling $6.5 million to New Mexico, which was one of a dozen states whose computers were deemed to be at high risk of failing. The state Labor Department's Y2K preparations eventually cost more than $7.0 million, but an audit of some state Y2K expenditures prompted the federal quest for repayment of about $900,000. 
   Domenici in May 2004 asked Labor Secretary Elaine Chao to personally review the New Mexico case, particularly because her agency had already issued waivers to the states of California, New York and Montana for disallowed costs associated with Y2K conversion work.
