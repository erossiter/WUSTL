SEN. DOMENICI: JUSTICE DEPARTMENT GIVES NEW MEXICO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FUNDS TO REPLACE BULLET-PROOF VESTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that New Mexico law enforcement jurisdictions have been awarded a total of $66,522.68 in grants to help replace Zylon-based body armor vests.  
   The grants have been awarded through the Bulletproof Vest Partnership of the Department of Justice (DOJ) and will be used to help cover the cost of vests replaced by each law enforcement grant recipient. 
   "I feel it is of the utmost importance for our law enforcement agencies throughout the state to operate with the equipment necessary to safely do their jobs and protect our communities. This grant will allow law enforcement to protect themselves with bullet proof vests that will be effective when they are in harm's way," Domenici said. 
   The DOJ grants were awarded to: 
   * Aztec - $2,240.00 
   * Bernalillo - $387.50 
   * Bloomfield - $1,320.00 
   * Catron County - $1,225.00 
   * Do?a Ana County - $15,729.05 
   * Hobbs - $12,900.00 
   * Hurley - $1,059.98 
   * Los Lunas - $3,660.00 
   * Roswell - $6,300.00 
   * San Miguel County - $3,249.96 
   * Santa Fe - $14,040.00 
   * Santa Fe County - $4,411.19 
   New requirements issued for body armor vests became effective Sept. 26, 2005. Jurisdictions with 100,000 residents or less are eligible for 50 percent of their vest costs, while jurisdictions with over 100,000 residents (Do?a Ana and Santa Fe counties) are eligible for 16.8 percent. 
   In 2003, the Body Armor Safety Initiative was created in response to failures of Zylon-based bullet-resistant vests. Ballistic and mechanical properties testing determined that Zylon material was not providing the protection intended for ballistic resistance.
