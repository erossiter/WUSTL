SEN. DOMENICI STRESSES NEED FOR ACCURATE REPROTS ON PROGRESS IN IRAQ UNDER NEW PLAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said the Bush administration must provide clear and accurate reports on whether the Iraqi government is meeting benchmarks in its efforts to assume greater responsibility for security and stability in Iraq.  
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that Tuesday afternoon began its review of President Bush's request for nearly $100 billion in FY2007 supplemental appropriations to support the Global War on Terror including the war in Iraq. Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice testified at the hearing. 
   "Administration leaders must see to it that clear and accurate information gets reported so that we, the Congress and the American people, can discern that things are happening as prompted by this new plan for Iraq," Domenici said. "We have to know, for instance, whether the Iraqis are actually moving to spend the $10 billion of their own money they committed to improve their country. We require regular progress reports, even if things are not going well." 
   Domenici has stated that he supports giving the new military and civilian plan for Iraq a chance to work, particularly since the Senate unanimously confirmed Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, commander for American and allied forces in Iraq, to carry out such a plan. He has also repeatedly said support for the President's new military plan in Iraq should be strongly contingent on the Iraqi government meeting major benchmarks in the near future, including: 
   * The timely formation and active participation of new Iraqi army brigades within Baghdad; 
   * Fulfillment of the Iraqi government's commitment to provide $10 billion for its reconstruction and stabilization effort; and, 
   * An aggressive effort to stop all Sunni and Shia insurgents, including, if necessary, military action in Sadr City. 
   "We are all concerned about deteriorating conditions in Iraq, and we all agree that our strategy there must improve," Domenici said. "I believe we must give General Petraeus a chance to implement a new strategy for success in Iraq, and we must give him the tools and funding he needs to implement that strategy." 
   The FY2007 supplemental funding request would fund, among other things, deployment of additional American troops, accelerated training for Iraqi and Afghani security forces, equipment replacement, and American force protection. The Senate Appropriations Committee is expected to mark up the bill on March 20.
