ENERGY COMMITTEE MOVES GOV. KEMPTHORNE NOMINATION TOWARD SENATE CONFIRMATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today led the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in delivering a positive recommendation for confirmation of Idaho Gov. Dirk Kempthorne to be the next Secretary of the Department of the Interior. 
   Domenici, who chairs the committee, indicated that he hopes the Senate will confirm Kempthorne, a former Senator, before the end of the month. The committee conducted a virtually unanimous voice vote in favor of the Kempthorne nomination with only Louisiana Senator Mary Landrieu voting "present."
   Domenici reiterated this belief that the myriad of issues facing the Interior Department and its agencies demand that the Senate act sooner rather than later to confirm a successor to Secretary Gale Norton.
   "The Interior Department is involved in so many issues that are important to much of the country, particularly the West. The department needs a leader and soon. I believe Dirk Kempthorne is very well suited for this position and I will work with the leadership to try to schedule a vote on his nomination as soon as possible," Domenici said.
   During his confirmation hearing last week, Domenici asked for commitments from Kempthorne on a variety of issues related to energy policy, water management, and American Indian programs-including the disposition of the pending Aamodt, Abeyta and Navajo water settlements in New Mexico.
   Forty sitting governors from both parties have issued a letter endorsing the Kempthorne nomination.
