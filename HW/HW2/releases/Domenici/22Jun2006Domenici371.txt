SEN. DOMENICI VOTES AGAINST PROPOSAL FOR FORCE U.S. WITHDRAWAL FROM IRAQ
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he voted against amendments stipulating terms for withdrawing American forces from Iraq, saying such an action would prove hazardous to U.S. military personnel and the fledgling Iraqi government. 
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, today voted against two amendments to the FY2007 Defense Authorization Bill dealing with American military involvement in Iraq.
   Domenici opposed an amendment, offered by Senator John Kerry (D-Mass.) and Russell Feingold (D-Wis.), requiring a redeployment of American troops from Iraq by July 1, 2007. He also voted against a nonbinding "Sense of the Senate" resolution amendment by Senator Carl Levin (D-Mich.) that called for troops to begin a withdrawal by the end of 2006, but did not set a firm withdrawal deadline.
   "We are right to be concerned about the situation in Iraq, but I reject any notion that setting a definite timetable for withdrawal would be a good idea. I believe it would merely encourage the terrorists within Iraq, hamstring the Iraqi civil authorities, and draw more foreign terrorists to Iraq," Domenici said.
   "I believe it is in the best interest of U.S. national security and the future of Iraq that we continue toward with our strategy to stabilize the situation so that the Iraqi people can truly govern and secure their own nation," he said.
   "Our American effort is not without limitations, however. My support is predicated on this work being completed within a reasonable time. I am proud of the courage and commitment of our troops who are helping the Iraqi people," he said.
   The Kerry amendment failed on an 86-13 vote, while the Levin amendment was dropped on a 60-39 vote against.
