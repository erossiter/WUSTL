SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON SOCIAL SECURITY REFORM
  Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement on President Bush's proposal for a debate on social security reform in light of a state legislative resolution on the matter:  
   "Social Security is a valuable linchpin of our society. It must be protected. However, it is clear that if Congress does not act, the program will be in jeopardy for future generations. In 2018, the system will begin taking in less money than it will be paying out. By 2042, Social Security will be able to pay no more than 70 percent for every dollar paid in. 
   "I agree with the President that individuals at or nearing retirement age will not see any change to their Social Security benefits. Their checks will be delivered on time and in full. 
   "President Bush has asked for a national dialogue between Democrats, Republicans, and Independents so that we can determine the best way to make Social Security solvent in the long term. I appreciate the fact that he is welcoming all ideas from all sides. One of those ideas is voluntary personal retirement accounts for younger workers, which would give individuals some control over their own money. I hope that tired scare tactics will not prevent us from having an open and honest debate about how to protect Social Security. 
   "At this stage, I think it's a mistake to reject out of hand proposals to fix Social Security before we've even had a nationwide discussion. What the Democrats and their allies are doing today is objecting to plans that have not even been formulated. Unfortunately, their reactions have become more and more familiar-object and obstruct without offering any constructive plan of their own."
