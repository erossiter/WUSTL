SEN. DOMENICI: UNIVERSITY OF MEXICO AWARDED HHS GRANTS FOR HEALTH RESEARCH INITIATIVES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the U.S. Health and Human Services Department (HHS) has awarded grants worth over $500,000 to the University of New Mexico to conduct two health research initiatives. 
   "Research grants are so important to our universities. The findings that may come out of these grants have the potential to affect previous health theory. I am pleased that UNM has the opportunity to participate in these research opportunities," Domenici said.
   UNM will utilize $281,667 awarded through the National Institute of General Medical Sciences to understand the different muscles in fruit flies that are utilized for different functions such as walking and flying. The findings will help UNM researchers understand the basic principles of the genes in relation to muscle formation which may be similar to human muscles. This grant is part of a continuing research project funded through the National Institute of Health.
   A second grant worth $224,731 awarded through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism will allow UNM researchers to study the affects of moderate prenatal alcohol exposure on the ability to handle social situations. The research will focus on the frontal cortex which has been singled out as an important part of the brain responsible for social interaction.
