SENATE PASSES SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORED BLACK HISTORY MONTH RESOLUTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today noted Senate passage of a resolution he cosponsored commemorating February as Black History Month.  
   S.Res.380, which passed unanimously late Thursday, calls for Americans to observe the accomplishments and struggles of the African American community through appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities. 
   "I am honored to have the opportunity to again cosponsor this resolution," Domenici said. "It is important to take time and recognize the contributions by African Americans throughout our history, including New Mexico's rich past. I hope everyone participates and enjoys the activities throughout this month." 
   The celebration began in 1926 as "Negro History Week," and was designed to raise public awareness of African American achievements throughout history. February was originally chosen because it was the birthday of Abraham Lincoln and Frederick Douglas. 
   The resolution, sponsored by Senator Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.), acknowledges the injustices endured by African Americans and commits the Senate "to addressing those situations in which the African American community struggles with disparities in education, health care, and other areas where the Federal Government can help improve conditions for all citizens of the United States."
