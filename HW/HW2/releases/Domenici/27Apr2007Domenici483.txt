SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS MEASURE TO IMPROVE MEDICAL IMAGING SERVICES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he is cosponsoring a measure to improve the quality and cost of imaging and radiation medical care, which should result in savings to the Medicare program. 
   Domenici cosponsored S.1042, the Consistency, Accuracy, Responsibility, and Excellence (CARE) in Medical Imaging and Radiation Therapy Act of 2007. The legislation, introduced by Senator Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) would require all persons performing, planning, delivering, and inspecting medical imaging and radiation therapy to meet uniform standards.
   "This measure should improve the quality of medical care by encouraging a more uniform system for delivering radiological services," said Domenici. "Imaging and radiation therapy are both parts of medical care that impact most of us at some point and I believe it is important to require that they operate under strict quality and safety standards that are still cost effective for the patient."
   According to the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, Medicare spent approximately $9.3 billion on medical imaging in 2003. The repeat rate for imaging examination is between 4 and 7 percent. S.1042 is expected to save Medicare up to $92 million per year by improving the safety and quality of such medical care.
   The legislation is supported by a group of bipartisan senators. It contains the same provisions as legislation introduced in the 109th Congress which passed by unanimous consent.
   Related to future sustainability of the Medicare program, Domenici and Senator Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) earlier this year introduced the Social Security and Medicare Solvency Act (S.355) to try to force Congress to act on requests to ensure the long-term solvency of entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
