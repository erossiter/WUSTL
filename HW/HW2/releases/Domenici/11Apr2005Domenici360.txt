SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON SANDIA LABS DIRECTOR ROBINSON'S MOVE, LOCKHEED MARTIN BID FOR LANL CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the decision of Sandia National Laboratories director, Dr. C. Paul Robinson, to leave his post to head up the Lockheed Martin Corp. bid for the management and operations contract at Los Alamos National Laboratory:  
   "I believe Paul Robinson's decision is significant because of the expertise he will bring to the Lockheed Martin bid. Paul has worked at Los Alamos, and he has been a terrific director at Sandia. I'm sad he's leaving Sandia, but his departure and new role certainly tells me that Lockheed Martin is intent on putting together a competitive bid. I think he will play a formidable role, and I think he helps Lockheed Martin proposal immensely. 
   "The bidding for the Los Alamos contract will be competitive. My ultimate interest is in having the new contract end up being the best for the lab workers, pensioners and, of course, the lab in its totality. I think the University of California and Lockheed Martin, and possibly other interested parties, are working toward this goal. 
   "I look forward to working with Tom Hunter as the new director at Sandia. This is a superb choice, and I think his experience in heading the weapons program at Sandia puts him in a good position do well as director."
