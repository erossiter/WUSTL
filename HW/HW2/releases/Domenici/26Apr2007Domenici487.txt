DOMENICI ANNOUNCES USDA LOAN FOR KIT CARSON ELECTRIC COOP UPGRADES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) has awarded a $39 million loan to Kit Carson Electric Cooperative to upgrade its services in northern New Mexico. 
   The award was administered by USDA Rural Development and will impact service in Colfax, Rio Arriba, and Taos Counties. Funds will be used to serve 3,289 new consumers, build 307 miles of new distribution line, and make other system improvements.
   "I have seen the work Kit Carson has done in the past and I know that the cooperative strives to bring reliable electric service to its customers," said Domenici. "I am pleased to see that its services will now be available to even more New Mexicans due to this USDA award."
   The award will be administered at a U.S. Treasury loan rate for 35 years.
   In February, Domenici visited with representatives from Kit Carson Electric Coop who visited Washington to discuss plans for a new 1.2 megawatt solar project utilizing funds from a credit bond program authorized under the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (EPAct 2005).
   Domenici is ranking member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is also a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee which has legislative authority over projects funded by the federal government.
