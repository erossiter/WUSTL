HUD RELEASES SEN. DOMENICI-SECURED FUNDS FOR SANTA FE BOYS, GIRLS CLUB CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that $497,050 he secured in 2004 for the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Fe to construct a new facility has been released by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
   As a member of the Veterans Affairs-Housing and Urban Development and Independent Agencies (VA-HUD) Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici originally requested and secured the funding as part of the FY2004 Omnibus Appropriations Bill. 
   "I'm a strong believer in Boys & Girls Clubs because they build confidence and friendships and give young people opportunities to succeed. The Boys & Girls Club of Santa Fe has provided a safe haven for thousands of young men and women over the years and makes a tremendously positive impact on the community," Domenici said. "I am very pleased these funds have been released so that the club can continue its important work." 
   The funds have been awarded through HUD's Economic Development Initiative (EDI) as a special project grant to construct an additional facility for the Boys & Girls Club of Santa Fe. 
   Domenici has been a major advocate for Boys & Girls Club funding. The lawmaker worked to ensure that the FY2004 Commerce, Justice and State Department funding bill contained $80 million for Boys & Girls Clubs nationwide, which has benefited the Santa Fe club and others around New Mexico.
