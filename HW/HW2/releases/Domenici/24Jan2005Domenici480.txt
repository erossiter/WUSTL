SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS CONFIRMATION OF CARLOS GUTIERREZ TO BE COMMERCE SECRETARY
  Sen. Pete Domenici applauded the unanimous confirmation of Carlos Gutierrez to be the nation's next Secretary of Commerce.  
   At the time of his nomination by President Bush, Gutierrez was serving as CEO of the Kellogg Company. 
   Gutierrez will take the reigns of the Department of Commerce from Don Evans, who served since 2001. The Commerce Department is responsible for trade, job promotion and other economic aspects of the government. For New Mexico, the Small Business Administration and the Economic Development Agency are of particular importance. 
   "Carlos Gutierrez's story is truly inspiring and sets a wonderful example for all Americans. At the age of 20, he took a job driving a truck delivering cereal for Kellogg's. Within ten years, he was running the company's Mexican operation, and fifteen years after that the entire company. The American dream is exemplified in Carlos Gutierrez," said Domenici. 
   "I'm also pleased by this nomination because of the diversity it adds to President Bush's Cabinet. This President has demonstrated a commitment to selecting Americans from all walks of life and ethnic backgrounds to serve him, and I believe that the selection of Carlos Gutierrez is a clear sign of the contributions that Hispanic-Americans are making to our nation. 
   "I have no doubt that Mr. Gutierrez's remarkable business skills and outstanding leadership will make him an excellent Secretary of Commerce, and I'm pleased the Senate confirmed him so quickly," Domenici continued. 
   Gutierrez was born in Cuba, and fled to the United States with his family in 1960 to escape the dictatorship of Fidel Castro. As CEO of the Kellogg Company, he oversaw 25,000 employees and was considered a highly effective CEO.
