SEN. DOMENICI TO ATTEND SIGNING CEREMONY ON U.S.-MEXICO CEMENT AGREEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici is scheduled to attend the signing ceremony Monday, March 6, for an agreement between the United States and Mexico that will allow more cement exports from Mexico.  
   The bilateral trade agreement, announced in January, will end a 160-year dispute over U.S. tariffs on Mexican gray Portland cement imports. Domenici was among the congressional leaders who advocated an agreement to allow more Mexican imports in order to ease a shortage of the building material in New Mexico and other states. 
   Monday's event will include U.S. Commerce Secretary Carlos M. Gutierrez, U.S. Trade Representative Rob Portman and Mexican Secretary of Economy Sergio Garcia de Alba. 
   Last October, Domenici wrote President Bush and Gutierrez urging them to suspend or reduce the American tariff imposed on Mexican cement. 
   Since 2004, New Mexico is among at least 30 states that have reported cement shortages. Cement prices have escalated with increased global demand and macro economic factors including surges in residential construction and higher fuel costs that affected the cost of shipping cement. In addition, Domenici said recovery construction related to hurricane damage in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast will further increase the cement demand over the next few years. 
   In return for lowering the American tariff, the Mexican government has agreed to begin opening its markets to cement produced in the United States and other nations.
