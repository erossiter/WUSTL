SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $743,000 IN HUD FUNDS FOR HOUSING BENEFITS IN N.M.
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that several New Mexico housing programs will benefit from over $743,000 in grant funds from the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).  
   HUD awarded $268,422 through the FY2007 Resident Opportunities for Self Sufficiency (ROSS) funding, while supplying $474,904 in FY2007 Housing Choice Voucher - Family Self Sufficiency (FSS8) funds. 
   "Residents across the state should benefit from improved housing opportunities as a result of these HUD funds," said Domenici. "I am pleased at the families, seniors and individuals who will have access to services as they seek economic self-sufficiency." 
   The following New Mexico programs received FY2007 HUD funds: 
   * City of Albuquerque Housing Services ($65,500) 
   * Clovis Housing & Redevelopment Agency, Inc. ($81,600) 
   * Santa Fe Civic Housing Authority ($117,699) 
   * Santa Fe County Housing Authority ($160,565) 
   * Taos County Housing Authority ($93,840) 
   * Truth or Consequences Housing Authority ($54,604) 
   * Bernalillo County Housing Department ($114,888) 
   * Region VI Housing Authority in southeast New Mexico ($54,630) 
   HUD's ROSS program provides grants to public housing agencies, tribes/tribally designated housing entities, resident associations, and non-profit organizations to deliver and coordinate services aimed at helping residents attain economic self-suffiency, and assisting senior residents with services to help them continue their independence. 
   FSS8 funds improve local coordination efforts to provide public and private assistance to help participating families achieve economic independence. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining federal funding priorities, including programs administered through the Department of Commerce.
