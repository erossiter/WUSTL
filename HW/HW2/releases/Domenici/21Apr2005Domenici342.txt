SEN. DOMENICI: $1.98 MILLION TO JUMP START LAS CRUCES INTERMODAL FACILITY CONSTRUCTION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the city of Las Cruces will receive federal funding from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for preliminary steps of an intermodal facility construction project.  
   As a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Domenici worked in FY2002 to have $1.98 million included for the project. This award will give Las Cruces Road Runner Transit $112,008 from DOT's Federal Transit Administration (FTA) to proceed with the initial phase of a construction project that will allow greater transit delivery for the city. 
   "These funds will help Las Cruces begin improvements in its public transportation system. Because people rely on city buses to get to work and serve as a primary means of mobility, the system needs to be as dependable and efficient as possible," Domenici said. 
   "Las Cruces is one of the fasting growing regions and needs a transportation system that can accommodate this. I hope the city will use this award to build a new center that will facilitate the growing demands on public transportation," he said. 
   This grant funding will support project site analysis, site selection, an environmental impact site assessment, and preliminary engineering as the first phase of planning and project development to construct an intermodal facility. 
   Domenici also intervened last year on behalf of Las Cruces to ensure that the almost $2 million appropriation be extended to fend off expiration of the funds before the city could apply for FTA grants.
