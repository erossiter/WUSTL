SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN MEET WITH AAMODT WATER SETTLEMENT PARTIES
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today met with the non-federal parties to the Aamodt settlement today to discuss implementation of the proposal. 
   The Aamodt settlement was signed on May 3, but has not been agreed to by the federal government. Congressional legislation is needed in order for the settlement to proceed.
   Domenici and Bingaman indicated that while they were pleased the parties had made progress after years of negotiating, they believe additional analysis is needed before Congress can consider legislation.
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, while Bingaman is the ranking member.
   "I think all would agree there are numerous vagaries in the Aamodt settlement presented to me. I praise the commitment of the parties on the progress they have made so far to resolve this longstanding suit. At this point, the settlement is not ready for congressional action since certain key components have not yet been resolved. When resolutions to these items become more clear, we will consider hold a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources Committee on settlement legislation," Domenici said.
   "I'd like to congratulate the parties who have persevered in this effort to try to accomplish what 40 years of litigation has not been able to achieve. There is still some work to be done to get this settlement across the finish line, and I'm committed to staying very involved in the effort," Bingaman said.
