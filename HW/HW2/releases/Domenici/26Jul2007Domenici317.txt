SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON EL PASO NATURAL GAS SETTLEMENT
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici issued the following statement on the El Paso Natural Gas settlement, which will require the company to invest $86 million in safety upgrades.  
   "I am pleased that a settlement has been reached. From what I understand, it is a fair compromise and the investments that El Paso Natural Gas has been called upon to make could help prevent disasters in the future. We must vigorously monitor the integrity of these pipeline systems, so that the natural gas industry can continue to provide energy to New Mexicans in a safe and efficient manner," said Domenici, who is the ranking member on the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. 
   The investment is part of a settlement handed down by the Departments of Justice and Transportation to El Paso Natural Gas in response to a fatal explosion of one of its pipelines in 2000. The disaster caused 12 deaths in Carlsbad. In addition to the $86 million to monitor and repair the pipelines, the settlement requires El Paso Natural Gas to pay a $15.5 million fine. 
   Following the pipeline explosion in 2000, Domenici played a key role in brokering a compromise agreement to reauthorize the Pipeline Safety Act in 2002.
