   Domenici saluted the New Mexico communities that are expected to be among the 10,000 from across the nation that are expected to take part in the 24th Annual National Night Out, Tuesday, Aug. 7. The Senator noted the state's participation in the Congressional Record. 
   "When communities come together, they can do great things, even fight crime," Domenici said. "Crime is not limited to urban areas. It affects every person in every town, big and small. Communities need to be proactive in fighting it. National Night Out is a great step locals can take to curb violence and crime in their areas." 
   Some of the New Mexico communities participating in National Night Out on Tuesday include: Albuquerque, Belen, Bernalillo, Bosque Farms, Carlsbad, Gallup, Holloman Air Force Base, Isleta Pueblo, Jal, Las Cruces, Los Lunas, all of Sandoval County, Santa Fe, and Truth or Consequences. 
   "Each town will celebrate with its own flair, and each night out will succeed in bringing awareness to crime in their area," Domenici said. "I applaud these neighborhoods for being proactive in their local fight on crime." 
   National Night Out was founded to promote police-community partnerships, build community cohesiveness, and has traditionally been marked with light and "front-porch" vigils. Communities today mark National Night Out with block parties, visits to law enforcement offices, flashlight walks, youth-oriented programs and other activities.
