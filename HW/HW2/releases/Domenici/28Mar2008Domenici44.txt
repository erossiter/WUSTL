SEN. DOMENICI REPORTS NEARLY $1.5 MILLION FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS IN N.M.
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today reported that almost $1.5 million has been made available to support the construction or rehabilitation of low-income affordable housing to help families in Valencia County, Albuquerque, Socorro, Hatch and other areas in New Mexico. 
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), said the grant funding is being provided through the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas as leverage to support local affordable housing initiatives. In all, the funding will be used to support 164 housing units in New Mexico.
   "These awards will be used to help ensure that more low-income families have homes. I'm pleased that these investments are also going toward housing for homeless or disabled individuals who face added challenges when it comes to securing housing," Domenici said.
   The Affordable Housing Program (AHP) grant funding will be used by local organizations to purchase, construct, or rehabilitate single-family, transitional and multifamily projects for very low- to moderate-income families. The grants will be issued through financial institutions in New Mexico that are members of the Federal Home Loan Bank.
   AHP funding, backed by New Mexico banks, has been provided for the following projects:
   * Habitat for Humanity of Valencia County - $180,062, backed by MyBank of Belen, to support the construction of 18 single-family homes.
   * Habitat for Humanity of New Mexico - $328,000, backed by Bank of Albuquerque, to support principal reduction on home purchases for 41 low-income families.
   * New Mexico Housing and Community Development - $500,000, backed by State National Bank, to support the rehabilitation and preservation of the 40-unit, multi-family Socorro Village Apartments in Socorro to house very low-income elderly and disabled residents. 
   * Tierra del Sol Housing Corp. of Las Cruces - $294,000, backed by Pioneer Bank of Las Cruces, to support the construction or rehabilitation of 42 homes in the southern New Mexico region served by this non-profit organization. 
   * Tierra del Sol Housing Corp. of Las Cruces - $56,000, backed by Pioneer Bank, to support the rehabilitation of 8 single-family homes damaged by flooding in Hatch, N.M.
   * Supportive Housing Coalition of New Mexico - $135,00, backed by First National Bank of Las Vegas, to support development of a 15-unit apartment complex for low-income residents with mental health or physical disabilities, with special consideration being given to people who are homeless or at risk for homelessness.
   Established in 1932, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Dallas is a wholesale bank, made up of commercial banks, savings institutions, credit unions and insurance companies in New Mexico, Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Mississippi.
   Domenici serves on the Transportation, Treasury, and HUD Appropriation Subcommittee. He also authored the legislation that created the highly successful Projects for Assistance in Transition from Homelessness (PATH) Program. The PATH program provides community support services to persons with severe mental illnesses who also are homeless or at risk of homelessness.
