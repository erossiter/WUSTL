SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS HOUSE PACKAGE TO RAISE MINIMUM WAGE, REFORM FEDERAL DEATH TAX
  Sen. Pete Domenici today indicated his support for a House-passed package that would raise the minimum wage by $2.10 an hour-to $7.25-by January 2009, saying the current $5.15 hourly rate is "too low." 
   Domenici said Monday he hopes the Senate will seriously consider passage of the House package (HR.5970), which includes a minimum wage increase, death tax reduction and reform, and tax credit extensions.
   "Increasing the minimum wage is long overdue. The wage is too low and we should increase it," said Domenici, who as Budget Committee chairman engineered the 1996 compromise that led to the last minimum wage increase.
   The House-passed package also outlines a $2.10 increase of the minimum wage over three years-from $5.15 an hour today to $5.85 an hour on Jan. 1, 2007, to $6.55 on hour in 2008 and $7.25 an hour in 2009.
   "This may represent our best chance to increase the minimum wage and do so without forcing an undue burden on small businesses," Domenici said. "I will voice my support for this package to the Senate leadership in hopes that it can be brought up and passed this week. The death tax reform and minimum wage hike are long overdue and we should act. I fear partisan gamesmanship may stop progress, but I hope not."
   The wage hike, in addition to being packaged with death tax reform, is also linked to the extension of several tax credits, including: the $4,000 deduction for education expenses; the research and development credit; and the welfare-to-work credit.
   "The death tax is a confiscatory tax that too often decimates the life's work of too may farm, ranch and small business enterprises. I think the House plan is good. It doesn't get rid of the death tax altogether, but it does save estates that are right in the range of so many family-owned businesses," Domenici said.
   HR.5970 is a permanent reduction, not a permanent repeal, of the death tax. Exemptions would be indexed for inflation. Starting Dec. 31, 2009, it would begin exempting estates worth $5 million per individual or $10 million per couple. Estates under $25 million would have a maximum tax rate of 15 percent. Estates over $25 million would be taxed at 30 percent. The new exemptions and rates would be fully phased in by Jan. 1, 2015.
   In 2004, about 220 estate tax returns were filed from New Mexico, according to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). Of those New Mexico returns, about 100 were taxable and heirs paid $57.5 million to the federal government.
   Overall in the United States in 2004, 62,718 estate tax returns were filed on which $21.5 billion was collected from 30,276 of those returns. Of those taxable returns, a large majority-26,782-were from estates worth $5.0 million or less.
   Congress passed the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 with a complete phase-out of the federal death tax by 2010, but the repeal sunsets after one year. So without Congressional action, the death tax will be fully reinstated in 2011.
