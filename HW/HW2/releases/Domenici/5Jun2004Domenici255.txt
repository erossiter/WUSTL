SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON PASSING OF FORMER PRESIDENT REAGAN
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement on the death of former President Ronald Reagan: 
   "I join the nation in mourning the death of man who changed our country and the world. Ronald Reagan was a great man and leader who will, I am sure, go down in history as one of our greatest presidents. He came into office at a difficult time, but his optimism helped restore the American people's belief in their nation and their potential. President Reagan helped us believe that there is a greater day ahead for this great nation.
   "Beyond our shores, President Reagan's legacy is still felt today. His unwavering love of freedom was a driving force in ridding so much of the world of communism and allowing millions of oppressed people to live free.
   "My wife Nancy and I will always remember President Reagan fondly and now offer our condolences to Nancy Reagan and her family. Nancy Reagan has handled the very difficult job of caring for a loved one suffering with Alzheimer's with strength and grace. Our hearts go out to her and the family."
