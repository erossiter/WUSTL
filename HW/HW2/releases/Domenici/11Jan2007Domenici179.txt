SEN. DOMENICI, GEN. PETRAEUS DISCUSS NEW IRAQ STRATEGY
  Sen. Pete Domenici met privately with Lt. Gen. David H. Petraeus, newly selected commander for American and allied forces in Iraq, to discuss the new military and political strategy outlined by President Bush Wednesday night.  
   The following is a statement by Sen. Domenici based upon his meeting with Petraeus Thursday: 
   "Based upon my meeting today, I will strongly support the choice of General Petraeus to be commander of the Multinational Force-Iraq. Clearly, based upon his experience and intellect, General Petraeus is the best man for this difficult job at a most challenging time for our forces and for the Iraqi government. 
   "I cautioned General Petraeus that this would be our last chance to achieve a stable and secure, self-governing Iraq, and he said that he agreed with that assessment. 
   "I have confidence in his pledge to me that he will openly and honestly tell me and the rest of the Congress the situation on the ground as it unfolds. I fully believe the General understands that I, as one United States Senator, am willing to support the President's new strategy only as long as we can see measurable progress toward security, but that my support is not open-ended nor is it indefinite." 
   During the meeting, Domenici outlined for Petraeus three major benchmarks he will be monitoring as this new initiative goes forward, namely: 
   * The timely formation and active participation of new Iraqi army brigades within Baghdad; 
   * Fulfillment of the Iraqi government's commitment to provide $10 billion for its reconstruction and stabilization effort; and, 
   * An aggressive effort to stop all Sunni and Shia insurgents, including, if necessary, military action in Sadr City. 
   Domenici also expressed his hope that the Anbar province, a seat of Sunni unrest, could be stabilized as soon as possible.
