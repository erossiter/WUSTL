SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY TEAMS UP TO DEVELOP CHEMICAL DETECTORS FOR HOMELAND SECURITY DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that New Mexico State University will join with two other corporations to develop innovative detection systems for the use against biological and chemical agents.  
   NMSU in Las Cruces has been awarded $539,577 from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and will partner with Hamilton Sundstrand Corp in California and Sionex Corp in Massachusetts. 
   "I applaud NMSU for being selected to conduct this important research. Detecting contaminants, both biological and chemical, signals our continued vigilance against new threats. With advanced detection systems, emergency responders can respond faster with more accurate information. I am pleased another New Mexico institution is committed to this kind of research," said Domenici, a member of the newly reconstructed Committee on Homeland Security and Government Affairs. 
   The funds will allow NMSU and its partners to develop prototypes of a Lightweight Autonomous Chemical Identification System. This system will be a fully autonomous, hand portable detection system for chemical warfare agents and high priority toxic industrial compounds. 
   The detector system's higher sensitivity and faster response time will help emergency responders determine which areas have dangerous concentration levels of chemicals and if protective garments must be worn. 
   DHS awarded the funds through the Homeland Security Advanced Research Projects Agency, or HSARPA. Domenici also serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee.
