NEW MEXICO CRIME VICTIMS GROUP GETS FEDERAL AID
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission has been awarded a $769,000 grant to support programs that aid victims of crime and their families. 
   The grant was awarded through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) which provides financial reimbursement to victims for costs that have been accrued due to a violent crime including medical, dental, hospital, funeral, counseling, loss of wages, vision or other medically necessary devices.
   "With the budget constraints facing us this year, I am pleased to see that a program such as this is funded. The funds from this grant can relieve one of the many burdens placed on individuals who survive violent acts," Domenici said.
   The victim of the crime must meet eligibility requirements including having a police report filed within 30 days of the incident. The victim must cooperate will law enforcement agencies including a willingness to prosecute the offender. The maximum amount of compensation for any one application is $20,000.
   VOCA is administered through the U.S. Department of Justice.
