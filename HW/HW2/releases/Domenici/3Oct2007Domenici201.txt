SENATE PASSES AMENDMENT TO RESTORE HELSTF FUNDING
  U.S. Senators Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman reported Senate approval of their amendments to increase funding for very high power research programs at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR).  
   The Senate on Wednesday night approved provisions to the FY2008 Defense Appropriations Bill to increase funding for the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) at WSMR. The Senators' amendments will increase FY2008 HELSTF funding by $7.5 million to $10.3million--well above the $2.8 million sought in the budget request. 
   "Proposed funding cuts to the HELSTF program is bad for the entire military," Domenici said. "Both the Air Force and Navy stand to benefit from HELSTF technology. I am pleased the Senate approved the increase of funds for this vital program. I will continue to work to see that funding is increased as we complete this year's appropriations process." 
   "I'm glad we've gotten Senate support for our amendments. We will need to tap into HELSTF for years to come, and we must take action to now to keep this unique resource open," Bingaman said. 
   Last year, the Army requested and Congress provided $16.4 million for HELSTF, but the Army only sought $2.8 million for FY2008 - a $13.6 million cut. That level of funding would maintain some HELSTF capabilities and government staff, but would result in the "mothballing" of certain key very high power test capabilities. 
   HELSTF is located at White Sands Missile Range (WSMR) and hosts developmental and operational laser tests. Domenici and Bingaman reported that the facility, which is a Department of Defense Major Range and Test Base Facility, is used by all branches of the armed services, including the Air Force and Navy.
