SEN. DOMENICI: LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY SCIENTISTS WIN NASA RESEARCH FUNDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that scientists at the Los Alamos National Laboratory have been selected to receive a combined total of $90,071 in grants from NASA for scientific research on the early universe.  
   The Swift Guest Investigator Program, a division of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) responsible for allocating the funding, selected two of LANL proposals related to gamma-ray burst research. This mission of the NASA Swift program is to determine the origin of gamma- ray bursts and the use of such bursts to yield to information about the early universe. 
   "I was proud to announce that once again, Los Alamos scientists have been selected to play a role in this cutting-edge NASA research. These grants are not huge, but they give these researchers some resources to advance our understanding of the world," Domenici said. 
   The proposal titles of the two LANL selections that were approved by the NASA Research Opportunities in Space and Earth grants: 
   * "Gamma-Ray Burst Progenitors" (Chris Fryer) - $40,000 
   * "Unique Observations of Prompt Optical Emission by the RAPTOR Telescopes" (W. Thomas Vestrand) - $50,071. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate appropriations subcommittee that funds NASA and its program. In all, NASA selected 33 research projects from among 67 submitted for the Swift program.
