SEN. DOMENICI: USDA PROVIDES FUNDS TO EXTEND TIJERAS WATER RIGHTS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded a $1.5 million loan to the Entranosa Water & Wastewater Association in Tijeras.  
   Funds were awarded through Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program. The association expects to use funds to purchase the remaining 285 acre feet of water rights which it agreed to do under a settlement agreement. The existing 1,250 acre feet of water rights was purchased by Rural Development in 2004. 
   "The East Mountain area has experienced a high rate of growth over the past several years, which obviously creates a greater water demand," said Domenici. "These USDA funds will help the community as it looks to expand to accommodate the water needs of its residents." 
   The loan was awarded at a rate of 4.25 percent for 40 years. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA.
