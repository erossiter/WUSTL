SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE, RIO RANCHO GAIN JUVENILE JUSTICE GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded the cities of Santa Fe and Rio Rancho with grants totaling $411,890 to fund local law enforcement initiatives. 
   The DOJ has awarded Santa Fe with a Juvenile Accountability Block Grant (JABG) worth $398,164. This grant will allow local law enforcement officers to initiate accountability-based programs in an attempt to reduce juvenile offenders. The JABG is authorized under the Ominbus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 2002.
   "This grant will help keep Santa Fe safe by focusing on juvenile offenders. If we can prevent our young people from entering a life of crime, the entire community will benefit. The programs that these funds will facilitate will allow local law enforcement agencies to protect our communities more effectively," Domenici said.
   The city of Rio Rancho also has been awarded $13,726 under the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant Program (JAG). The city of Rio Rancho Department of Public Safety will use the funds to purchase 10 short-barreled rifles along with accessories.
   "The firearms that will be purchased with this grant will allow Rio Rancho to diminish the current weapons shortfall that exists. It is essential for a law enforcement agency to have the sufficient equipment to keep their community safe," Domenici said.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding for DOJ grant programs.
