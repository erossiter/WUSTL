SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON WITHDRAWAL OF MIERS NOMINATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the withdrawal of the nomination of Harriet Miers to an associate justice on the U.S. Supreme Court: 
   "This must have been a difficult and painful decision for Ms. Miers and the President. I look forward to his naming a new nominee, who I hope will not face the problems that troubled this nominee. I believe it is in the best interest of the country that we confirm Justice O'Connor's replacement as soon as possible."
