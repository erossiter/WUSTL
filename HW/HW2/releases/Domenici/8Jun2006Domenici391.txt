SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF TERRORIST AL-ZARQAWI IN IRAQ
  In response to the news that noted Al Qaeda terrorist Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was killed in a U.S. air strike last night in Iraq, Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement: 
   "Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi was the man responsible for terrorist activities in Iraq, and I hope his death will be a major blow to the insurgency and will bring a measure of justice to all his victims. Moreover, I hope Al-Zarqawi's demise will help the Iraqi people understand that they do not have to put up with the random and senseless deaths and mayhem caused by this man and his henchmen.
   "I commend the efforts of the brave men and women of the U.S. military, who have been working tirelessly under difficult conditions to pursue terrorists and make Iraq and the world safer. I'm also pleased intelligence developed by Iraqi security forces helped play a role in locating Al-Zarqawi.
   "Today is an important day for Iraq, not only because Al-Zarqawi was killed, but also because Prime Minister Maliki has completed his work to form a unified government in Iraq. Over time, the Iraqi government, military and people must step up to take control of their country. Until then, our American military forces will continue to fight the war on terror overseas so we don't have to fight it here on our shores."
