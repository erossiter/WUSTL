SUNLAND PARK, LA LUZ FIRE DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE FEMA AWARDS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Sunland Park Fire Department and the La Luz Volunteer Fire Department will both receive federal funds to bolster their local fire stations.  
   The New Mexico lawmaker indicated the funding was made available through the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) and will help improve operations and firefighter safety in the areas. 
   "This FEMA investment represents the federal government's commitment to ensuring our communities are kept safe and secure, and that our entities, like Sunland and La Luz fire departments, are equipped with the tools and skills necessary to properly deliver their protective services," said Domenici, who serves on the VA-HUD Appropriations Subcommittee that sets funding levels for FEMA and other independent federal agencies. 
   Sunland Park Fire Department will receive $166,500 through the Firefighting Vehicles Acquisition Program which can purchase brush trucks, tankers, rescue vehicles, ambulances, foam units, or other vehicles needed by the station. 
   La Luz Volunteer Fire Department will receive grant funding through the Operations and Firefighter Safety Program which helps procure equipment, training, wellness and fitness equipment, and modifications to stations and facilities. La Luz will use the $71,138 provided by FEMA to replace out-dated personal protective gear. 
   The funding award was made through FEMA's 2004 Assistance to Firefighters Grant Program, created by the U.S. Congress to enhance basic fire service delivery across the country. 
   Volunteer and combination departments must receive a proportion of the total grant funding that is at least equal to the proportion of the population those firefighting departments protect. According to the statistics provided by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), volunteer and combination departments protect 55 percent of the population.
