SEN. DOMENICI: SMALL RATON BUSINESS GETS IMPROVISED EXPLOSIVE DEVICES MITIGATION DEFENSE CONTRACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said technology developed by a Raton small business may be retrofitted to help the Defense Department protect service personnel from improvised explosive devices (IEDs).  
   Domenici said Stolar Research Corp. of Raton and the MIT Lincoln Laboratory have been awarded a $500,000 contract from the Pentagon's Joint Improvised Explosive Devise Defeat Organization to see if Stolar's electromagnetic gradiometer can be engineered to withstand military use. 
   "IEDs have been a consistent threat to our military personnel in Iraq and Afghanistan. Because the state of modern warfare shows that IEDs will continue to be a threat, it is imperative that we find the means to nullify them," Domenici said. "I am very pleased that Stolar technology is now to a point where the Defense Department believes it could help them quash the IED threat." 
   Domenici, as a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, has consistently provided federal support for development of electromagnetic wave gradiometer instruments by Stolar. Mostly recently, he secured $2.1 million in FY2006 for this work. 
   The JIEDDO contract is intended to develop a hardened prototype of Stolar's Electromagnetic Gradiometer that can withstand military use. The electromagnetic gradiometer works to detect and confirm the presence of subsurface structures. 
   The JIEDDO was established in 2004 to serve as the single focal point for all Defense Department IED defeat activities. Its mission is to find solutions to mitigate the effect of IEDs on service members in Iraq. IEDs are one of the biggest threats to American servicemen and women in Afghanistan and Iraq.
