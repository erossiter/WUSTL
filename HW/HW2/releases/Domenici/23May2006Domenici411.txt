SEN. DOMENICI: ROSWELL, CHAVES COUNTY GAIN DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE BRYNE GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Justice (DOJ) has awarded a $37,444 grant to assist local law enforcement crime prevention initiatives in Roswell and Chaves County. 
   The grants were awarded through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program which creates a partnership among federal, state and local government to create safer communities. The grants may be used to provide personnel, equipment, training, technical assistance, upgrade information systems and provide assistance to victims of crimes.
   "The continued success of the Byrne grant program is extremely important to our local law enforcement entities. These grants allow better training and up-to-date equipment to be purchased to ensure that officers have everything they need to do their jobs effectively," Domenici said.
   The city of Roswell will utilize its portion to purchase in-car video systems for new patrol units. The new video systems will allow officers to better document criminal activity and preserve evidence. The Chaves County Sheriff's Department will utilize its portion of the grant to train field officers and purchase new firearms.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding for DOJ grant programs. The Senate recently accepted an amendment to the FY2007 Budget Resolution to increase Byrne grant funding from $634 appropriated in FY2006 to $900 million in FY2007. Domenici has indicated that he does not support the Bush administration plan to eliminate Byrne grant funding.
