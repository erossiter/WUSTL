SEN. DOMENICI: FUNDS HELP PROVIDE RELIABLE JOB ACCESS BY IMPROVING SANTA FE TRANSIT SYSTEM
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the city of Santa Fe will receive over $1.25 million from the Department of Transportation (DOT) for two projects that will improve the region's transit system and facilitate job commutes for low-income workers.  
   Domenici said Santa Fe will receive $950,903 to purchase new city buses and $305,348 to provide transit services for disadvantaged individuals and families in the Santa Fe region. The region includes New Mexicans in Espa?ola, Pojoaque, Pecos and the Turquoise Trail. 
   "New Mexicans transitioning off of welfare often rely on public transportation to get to their workplace. To give individuals a fair opportunity to hold steady employment, the transit system must be reliable and efficient. I hope these funds will help support projects that easily facilitate commutes around the city as well as to those in smaller neighboring communities," Domenici said. 
   Santa Fe will use $950,903 to purchase five replacement buses and two expansion buses to be fueled with compressed natural gas. The city's fleet currently consists of 20 buses and five spares all of which operate on compressed natural gas. 
   An additional award of $305,348 for the Job Access and Reverse Commute program (JARC) will support operational costs to provide transportation to and from work for Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) and welfare-to-work clients and other citizens who need transit services to access jobs, education and training opportunities. 
   As a senior member of the Senate Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary, and HUD Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici worked in FY2005 to have $396,473 included for the JARC program and over $1.4 million for bus related allocations.
