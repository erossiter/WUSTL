SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES $42 MILLION LASER CONTRACT FOR WORK AT AFRL AT KIRTLAND AFB
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today announced that the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland Air Force Base will be the site for laser weapons research, which will be carried out through a $42 million contract.  
   Domenici, who serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, said the Air Force has awarded a $42 million contract to Ball Aerospace and Technologies Corp., a Boulder-based firm with a branch in Albuquerque, for a "Laser Effects Vulnerability Research" project. 
   The Air Force has initially obligated $640,521 of the contract. An estimated 80 percent of the contract will be executed in New Mexico, mostly in Albuquerque and at the High Energy Laser Systems Test Facility (HELSTF) at White Sands Missile Range. 
   "The Air Force Research Lab is a premier facility and this contract is intended to advance our understanding of lasers as a weapon," Domenici said. "This is also one dynamic of the ongoing push by the Air Force to develop more high-tech weapons systems that can be used to defend this nation and its interests." 
   The research is intended to enhance the capabilities of the AFRL Missile Assessment Center Codes and databases by assessing the effects of lasers on various threat targets, including assessment on space, ground, and missile targets.
