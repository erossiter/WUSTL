SEN. DOMENICI: ELECTRIC LOAN TO BENEFIT GRANT & HIDALGO COUNTIES
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that residents in Grant and Hidalgo counties can expect to keep their lights on thanks to a $38.1 million loan made by the U.S. Department of Agriculture to Arizona Electric Power Cooperative Inc (AEPCO). 
   The cooperative provides power to counties in Arizona, California and New Mexico, including Grant and Hidalgo counties in southwest New Mexico. Funds were provided in the form of a Rural Development loan and are expected to fund improvements at AEPCO's Apache Station in Cochise, Ariz.
   "Electric power is necessary for many homes and businesses in Grant and Hidalgo counties," said Domenici. "I'm pleased these USDA funds will help this continue."
   The loan is guaranteed on a Federal Financing Bank loan for a 28 year period.
