SEN. DOMENICI, INTERIOR SEC. NORTON ANNOUNCE MAJOR GRANT FOR MIDDLE RIO GRANDE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined Interior Secretary Gale Norton and Rep.  
 Heather Wilson to announce a major grant for the Middle Rio Grande Conservancy District (MRGCD).
   The $1.3 million will be provided by the Bureau of Reclamation through the Water 2025 Challenge Grants Program, which provides local irrigation districts throughout the West with matching funds for more efficient use of existing water supplies.
   The funds will be used to improve and modernize irrigation surface water conveyance facilities for the MRGCD to increase water conveyance efficiency, reduce system losses due to seepage and evaporation, and improve water management in the Middle Rio Grande valley.
   "I'm quite pleased that these funds have been delivered to help us more efficiently use the water available through the Middle Rio Grande. I have long believed that investing in technology is the best long term solution to the ongoing water crisis in New Mexico. It is not enough to keep putting band-aids on water problems. Programs like the Water 2025 Challenge Grants Program that enable the use of upgraded systems to better manage our resources are essential," said Domenici, who chairs the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that has jurisdiction over federal water projects.
   Among the other improvements that the MRGCD will be able to institute are the automation of river diversions, canal flow controls and wasteways, line delivery canals and the installation of new gauges.
   Domenici included $34.48 million in the FY2004 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill for the Middle Rio Grande projects. Domenici has also been a strong supporter of the Middle Rio Grande Collaborative Program Workgroup, which promotes short and long term activities such as river habitat modifications, minnow population management, and fish/stream monitoring.
