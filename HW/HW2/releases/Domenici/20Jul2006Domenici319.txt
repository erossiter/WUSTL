LAS CRUCES GETS $1.5 MILLION IN HUD HOUSING GRANTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) has awarded two grants totaling over $1.5 million to the city of Las Cruces for housing programs available to low-income families. 
   HUD awarded over $1 million as part of the Community Development Block Grant (CDBG) which is designed to provide housing assistance, suitable living environments, and increased economic development to low and moderate-income. A second HUD grant worth over $500,000 was awarded through the HOME program. HOME was created to assist low and very low income families with affordable housing.
   "These grants are useful for maintaining affordable housing for people and families who need a little help. As a member of the appropriations committee, I will continue to work tirelessly to fund HUD grant programs including CDBG and HOME grant programs," Domenici said.
   Today, the Senate Appropriations Committee approved the FY2007 Transportation, Treasury, the Judiciary and Housing and Urban Development Appropriations Bill which contained over $36.6 billion for HUD and its programs, including CDBG and HOME grant programs.
