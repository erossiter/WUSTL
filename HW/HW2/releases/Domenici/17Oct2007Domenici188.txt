SEN. DOMENICI: ACOMA PUEBLO RECEIVES HOUSING FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Housing and Urban Development (THUD) has awarded $1.0 million to the Pueblo of Acoma Housing Authority for affordable housing operations.  
   Funds were awarded as part of the Indian Housing Block Grant (IHBG) Program and are expected to fund affordable housing at the pueblo, including construction, acquisition, modernization, or rehabilitation of rental or owner-occupied housing, as well as crime prevention safety. 
   "In the past, I have supported measures to improve housing opportunities in tribal areas," said Domenici. "I am pleased to see that the Acoma Pueblo will receive these funds to provide affordable housing options for its residents." 
   The Acoma Pueblo was approved for the grant under the Native American Housing Assistance and Self-Determination Act (NAHASDA) of 1996 and can be used for a variety of eligible affordable housing activities. Domenici is an original cosponsor of legislation that would reauthorize NAHASDA, which was approved by the Senate Indian Affairs Committee in September and now awaits approval by the full Senate. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the subcommittee which helps determine annual funding for federal programs and projects administered through the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
