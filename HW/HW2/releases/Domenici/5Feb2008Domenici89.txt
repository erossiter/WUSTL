SEN. DOMENICI DISAPPOINTED WITH FY09 BUDGET CUTS FOR VALLES CALDERA & ACEQUIAS SYSTEMS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today expressed disappointment with the FY2009 federal budget rolled out by the Bush administration which recommends eliminating funding for the Valles Caldera National Preserve and the northern New Mexico acequias irrigation systems.  
   Domenici offered an initial assessment of the $3 trillion federal budget plan, which will serve as the starting point for Congress to develop a FY2009 Budget Resolution and subsequent appropriations measures to fund the government next year. The administration has proposed spending increases for defense and homeland security activities and a virtual spending freeze for the rest of the federal government. 
   The budget would eliminate all U.S. Forest Service funding for the Valles Caldera National Preserve and Trust, which Congress funded at $3.69 million in FY2008. Under the Bureau of Reclamation, funding would be zeroed out for the acequias management and restoration program, as well as a Santa Fe water supply project. 
   "I am used to the administration seeking very little funding for the Valles Caldera, but cutting all resources is a disappointment. An investment in the Valles Caldera is needed to advance its management and make it more accessible to the public. This is one recommendation I will work to reverse as this budget moves forward," Domenici said. 
   "The lack of funding for the acequias program is also wrong. Congress has acknowledged the historic and cultural value of these irrigation ditches and they should be funded," said Domenici, who has championed the restoration and maintenance of the acequias throughout his Senate career. 
   Domenici noted that the National Park Service budget does, however, recommend $3.17 million to rehabilitate the visitor center at the Bandelier National Monument.
