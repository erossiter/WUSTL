SEN. DOMENICI COMMENTS ON NOMINATION OF JUDGE ROBERTS TO U.S. SUPREME COURT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement on President George W. Bush's intent to nominate Judge John G. Roberts of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.  
   "I think President Bush's choice is excellent, and I believe Judge Roberts will clear the Judiciary Committee and be confirmed by the Senate without excessive delay. It should be a fair and timely process. During the confirmation process, the public, like the Senate, will be able to look at his record, what he's done in life and what he's achieved. In the end, I believe it will be a lively and all-encompassing debate. It is clear that Judge Roberts is eminently qualified. For some, he may seem too conservative, but everyone knows this President was expected to nominate a conservative jurist."
