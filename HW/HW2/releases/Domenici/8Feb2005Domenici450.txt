BUSH TO NOMINATE FORMER SEN. DOMENICI'S AIDE TO BE DEPUTY SECRETARY OF ENERGY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today praised President Bush's decision to nominate his former aide Clay Sell to be Deputy Secretary of Energy.  
   The White House today announced the President's intention to nominate Sell, who currently serves as Special Assistant to the President for Legislative Affairs. Prior to joining the President's staff, Sell worked as Domenici's staff director and Republican clerk on the Senate Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee. 
   "The President could not have picked a better person to be Deputy Secretary. Clay is one of the hardest working people I have met here in Washington and will be an exceptional Deputy. The President is clearly putting a strong team in place at the DOE," Domenici said. 
   "I consider Clay to be extremely bright and well aware of the needs and challenges within DOE," he said. 
   Domenici is chairman of the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Subcommittee, which funds DOE, its national laboratories, the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant near Carlsbad, as well as federal water projects administered by the Bureau of Reclamation and Army Corps of Engineers. 
   Prior to joining Domenici staff in 2000, he has served as administrative assistant to Congressman Mac Thornberry, R-Texas. With Thornberry, Sell was also legislative director, overseeing legislative staff and the congressman=s service on the House Armed Services Committee, with particular emphasis in DOE Defense Programs and nonproliferation issues. 
   Before joining the Thornberry staff in January 1995, Sell practiced law with the firm Underwood, Wilson, Berry, Stein & Johnson, P.C. in Amarillo, Texas. Sell graduated from Texas Tech University in 1989 and obtained a law degree from the University of Texas in 1992.
