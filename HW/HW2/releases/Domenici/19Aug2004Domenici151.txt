SEN. DOMENICI INSTRUMENTAL IN RENOVATING DOWNTOWN SANTA FE TRANSIT CENTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that the city of Santa Fe has been awarded $196,736 in federal funding he secured to support the renovation of the transit center in downtown Santa Fe.  
   Domenici, who formerly served as a member of the Senate Transportation Appropriations Subcommittee, secured the funding as part of the FY2003 transportation appropriations process. The funding is being awarded through the Department of Transportation's Federal Transit Administration. 
   "Santa Fe attracts a steady stream of tourists and visitors interested in our unique culture. To accommodate these large numbers, the transit center downtown greatly needs renovations to alleviate congestion in the area. I am very pleased to have worked for these funds to improve this facility," Domenici said. 
   "The current layout of the center creates problems for buses trying to maneuver in and out of the area," he said. "These funds will allow the city of Santa Fe to make the necessary changes to improve the efficiency of this facility." 
   Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, noted that the Santa Fe Bus Facility has been in operation since 1993.
