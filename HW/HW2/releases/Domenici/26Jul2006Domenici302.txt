SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES TRIO TALENT SEARCH FUNDS AWARDED TO ABQ SCHOOL
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the U.S. Department of Education (DoEd) has awarded $380,364 to the Southwestern Indian Polytechnic Institute (SIPI) to support higher education for disadvantaged students. 
   The DoEd funds are provided through the TRIO Talent Search Program which provides academic, career, and financial counseling to students who have a disadvantaged background but have the potential to succeed in higher education setting.
   "There are some students out there who have the mental capacity but need a little more help to reach their potential. I am optimistic that these programs for New Mexico institutions will give students from every background a fair shot and an education beyond a diploma," Domenici said.
   The TRIO program also encourages individuals who have quit school to reenter and complete their education. The program offers mentor programs, workshops, career exploration and aptitude assessment and tutorial services.
   DoEd awarded a total of $1.7 million to other New Mexico educational institutions including: Eastern New Mexico University in Portales ($381,014); ENMU-Roswell ($295,721); New Mexico Junior College in Hobbs ($250,261); New Mexico State University in Las Cruces ($220,000) and San Juan College in Farmington ($220,000). The awards will be funded for a five-year period.
   Domenici serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee that last week approved $828.1 million for the TRIO program as part of the FY2007 Labor, Health & Human Services, and Education (Labor-HHS) Appropriations Bill. This amount equals to the funding approved for FY2006, rejecting the administration budget request to cut TRIO funding by $448 million next year.
