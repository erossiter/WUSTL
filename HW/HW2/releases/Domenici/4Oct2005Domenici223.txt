HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS, STUDENTS TRAINING TO RECOGNIZE BIOTERRORISM THREATS WITH $1.49 MILLION GRANT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that health care professionals at the University of New Mexico (UNM) will have new training to help prepare them to act in the event of a bioterrorism threat.  
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has awarded $1.49 million to UNM to support the Bioterrorism Training and Curriculum Development (BTCD) program for three years. 
   "This program will not only give our medical personnel valuable education, but will support a proactive approach to potential threats. New Mexicans will continue to receive quality health care while our doctors and nurses can gain the know-how to effectively deal with an emergency, should it arise," said Domenici who serves on the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Committee. 
   HHS indicates that in the first two years of the BTCD program, 200,000 health professionals and students were trained and that more than 150,000 will be trained in the first year of the FY2005 grants. 
   The Bioterrorism Training and Curriculum Development Program was formed from the enactment of the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness and Response Act of 2002.
