SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LAB CONTRACT, LOCKHEED MARTIN TEAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, today issued the following statement regarding indications that the Lockheed Martin/University of Texas team will not challenge the recent award of the Los Alamos National Laboratory management contract to Los Alamos National Security LLC:  
   "The Lockheed team has been consistently professional and competent throughout the LANL contact competition. Its post-award assessments, I am confident, are being made in the same manner. There are guidelines for challenging this award, and Lockheed has every right to follow them through. I am in the end most interested in seeing the transition to a new contract proceed as smoothly and expeditiously as possible. I believe this would be best for the lab, its missions and, importantly, its employees." 
   Domenici is scheduled to address LANL employees Thursday during a day-long visit to Los Alamos. The Senator's presentation is scheduled to begin at 1 p.m. (Mountain).
