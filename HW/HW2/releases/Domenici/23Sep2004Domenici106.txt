SEN. DOMENICI URGES USDA TO RESOLVE CHILE IMPORT HALT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today called on U.S. Agriculture Secretary Ann Veneman to help resolve an emergency halt to chile imports from Mexico, which is putting processing jobs in New Mexico in peril.  
   In telephone call Thursday, Domenici stressed to Veneman the serious job implications from any extended halt to allowing Mexican-grown chile into the United States. Domenici stressed that the restrictions could be financially ruinous to processors, such as Border Foods Inc. in Deming and other smaller processors in New Mexico. 
   There are an estimated 40 shipments of red chile at border crossings on the U.S.-Mexico border that are tied up by emergency USDA regulations stopping all produce imports because of a Mediterranean fruit fly problem in the Mexican state of Baja California. A total of 250 chile shipments are expected in the near future. The import restrictions are in place for ports of entry from San Diego/Tijuana to El Paso/Ju?rez. 
   "I am cognizant of the need to safeguard the United States from any fruit fly infestation, but I do hope Secretary Veneman will work with her Mexican counterparts to resolve this situation as quickly as possible," Domenici said. 
   "Secretary Veneman understands the seriousness of the problem. These chile shipments, which represent a sizeable investment, could be lost if this situation drags out too long. Time is of the essence. In anther two days, these shipments could be ruined. The loss of all this chile would be terrible and would certainly disrupt the processing work carried out in New Mexico plants," he said. 
   Only sealed containers are being allowed to cross the border until the Mexican government provides an acceptable plan for containing the fruit fly infestation. Domenici pointed out to Veneman that it is impractical for New Mexico vegetable processors to hastily arrange closed containers on short notice to save the shipments.
