SEN. DOMENICI AFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO YUCCA MOUNTAIN AS CORNERSTONE OF COMPREHENSIVE WASTE PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, today affirmed his strong commitment to Yucca Mountain but expressed concern that Yucca, alone, cannot meet the federal government's spent fuel obligations. 
   "Yucca Mountain is the cornerstone of a comprehensive spent nuclear fuel management strategy for this country. Let me be clear. We need Yucca Mountain. I want to fix this program and make it work," Domenici said in an opening statement for a hearing on the Nuclear Fuel Management and Disposal Act (S.2589). This bill was introduced by Domenici on behalf of the administration.
   Domenici expressed concern about the "slippery" Yucca schedule. While pleased with the new Department of Energy timeline for the Yucca project, Domenici said he is concerned that it does not allow any margin for further delays or establish a timeframe for moving all commercial fuel to the repository in Nevada.
   DOE plans to move 3,000 metric tons a year to Yucca. At that pace, if the repository opened in 2017, as DOE hopes, it would be 2040 before all spent fuel existing today would be placed at the site. In the meantime, the country will continue to generate more spent fuel.
   "If everything goes perfectly it will take over 30 years-longer than I have been in the Senate-to eliminate the backlog of spent fuel. In light of that, it only makes sense to look for additional ways for the government to meet its obligations," Domenici said.
   "I have reached a few conclusions. Yucca must open. Even if Yucca Mountain opens on time, significant quantities of spent fuel will remain at reactor sites for many decades, thus the need for a practical interim solution," he said.
   Domenici has concluded that "continuing to increase the authorized limit at Yucca Mountain, while a necessary step, is not a complete solution."
   "We must use the time we have before Yucca Mountain opens to look seriously at these terrific new technologies that can reduce the volume and toxicity of spent fuel," Domenici concluded. "Yucca Mountain, GNEP and interim storage will establish a comprehensive program that will provide confidence that our nation's nuclear waste will be managed safely both for current and future reactors."
   Domenici is also chairman of the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee that has crafted a FY2007 DOE funding bill (HR.5427) that provides $494 million for Yucca Mountain and Nuclear Waste Disposal. The bill also includes a new plan authorizing the Energy Secretary to create a Director of Consolidation with the goal of finding a temporary, consolidated storage for spent fuel within a state or regional site. It would also:
   * Allow DOE to take title for the spent fuel and move it to another non-reactor site owned by the federal government or purchased from a willing seller.
   * Require the Secretary to designate a site within 270 days of enactment.
   * Provide for expedited review of license application for a term not to exceed 25 years.
   * Permit the Secretary to utilize the Nuclear Waste Fund to finance temporary storage.
   * Legislate the Waste Confidence rule, which is important for new license or expansion of existing plant license.
