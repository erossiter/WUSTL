   REVIEW: 
   00:00 - Domenici says he expects Supreme Court nominee Harriet Miers to face significant trip wires during her confirmation hearings in early November, and stresses that the nominee must demonstrate a clear level of competence. 
   02:24 - Domenici says the additional funding he secured for construction of a new federal courthouse in Las Cruces will ensure that the project moves forward. He says the funding, like most appropriations for New Mexico, should not be adversely affected by emergency spending being approved for hurricane recovery activities. He says the courthouse will be a "one-in-a-century" facility for Las Cruces. 
   03:30 - Domenici says he does not know what federal funding may be needed for damage caused by Hurricane Wilma, which slammed into southwest Florida Monday morning. 
   05:04 - Domenici acknowledges growing concern in Congress about the federal budget deficit and spending, particularly as the nation faces the high cost of recovering from a series of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast. He says New Mexico appropriations should not be affected, but says Congress has a responsibility to help people in declared disaster areas. He says Congress ultimately have to take action to control annual appropriations and automatic entitlement spending. 
   07:38 - Domenici says he is aware of the growing excitement surrounding the X Prize and commercial space opportunities in New Mexico. He says he hopes the program proves to be a success. 
   08:35 - Domenici says he is surprised by the lack of media attention to the significant action taken by Congress related to border security. He says the enacted FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill is the most striking action taken by Congress to put additional personnel on the border and increase the ability for those federal officers to handle illegal immigrants. He cites $44.3 million provided for construction needs at FLETC-Artesia to accommodate Border Patrol training requirements. He says securing the borders is the first step needed for overall U.S. immigration policy reforms. 
   11:19 - Domenici expresses his condolences to the family of Marine Lance Cpl. Chad R. Hildebrandt of Colfax County, who was killed in Iraq on Oct. 17. He says he tried calling the Hildebrandt family over the weekend to express his sympathies. He says he understands that the pride the people of New Mexico and the country have for Hildebrandt cannot fill the void the family now feels. He says he believes Hildebrandt was a marvelous American who served his country well.
