SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DUBAI PORTS SALE
  In response to the recent sale of Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation (P&O) to Dubai Ports World (DPW) of the United Arab Emirates, Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following statement:  
   "I have examined the facts provided by the Administration in support of approving the sale of P&O to DPW. 
   "While new facts may emerge, at this time I believe that fears about diminished security are not supported. Some may have different concerns beyond American security. However, I am convinced that the security of American ports will continue to be the prime responsibility of the United States Coast Guard and the Department of Homeland Security, as it is in all American ports, even those presently run by Chinese or Danish companies. This sale will not change security responsibilities. 
   "In addition, I have concluded that we are well past the time when we can, as a people, discriminate against a bona fide, competent and experienced company simply because it is Arab-owned. We have many Arab friends and the UAE is one of the foremost. 
   "As Deputy Secretary Gordon England noted yesterday, more than 600 U.S. Military Command ships were in UAE harbors last year--more than any other foreign ports. This included 56 American warships and 75 coalition partner ships. More than 77,000 American troops safely took leave in the UAE last year alone. 
   "We are at war against terrorists, not any religion or ethnicity. Some politicians seem to have forgotten that and have raised alarms about the Arab connections of DPW. Such alarm, verging almost on hysteria, harms our efforts to have the broadest coalition possible against world-wide terrorism. I wish some of my colleagues and the media would exercise more caution in matters of this magnitude."
