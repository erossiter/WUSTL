SEN. DOMENICI VOTES TO RENEW VOTING RIGHTS ACT OF 1965
  Sen. Pete Domenici today voted with the Senate for unanimous passage of legislation to renew the Voting Rights Act of 1965. 
   The Senate's approval now clears the way for President Bush to sign into law the Fannie Lou Hamer, Rosa Parks, & Coretta Scott King Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006 (HR.9).
   "It is without hesitation that I support the Voting Rights Act Reauthorization and Amendments Act of 2006," Domenici said. "It remains one of the most significant pieces of civil rights legislation in American history. Reauthorization of the Voting Rights Act will ensure many privileges."
   "Passage of this measure is not merely symbolic. It is an essential reaffirmation that we the people are securing the blessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity. I firmly believe that the right of American citizens to vote should not be denied or abridged by the United States or any state on account of race," he said.
   HR.9 amends and reauthorizes the Voting Rights Act for an additional 25 years. Several provisions of which will expire on Aug. 6, 2007 unless Congress acted to renew them.
   Initially enacted in 1965 in response to post-Civil War Reconstruction efforts to disenfranchise black voters, Congress has reauthorized the historic law in 1970, 1975, 1982 and 1992. The intent of the law is to ensure that the right of all citizens to vote, including the right to register to vote and cast meaningful votes, is preserved and protected as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. A person's voting rights is reflected by the fact that they are protected by the 14th, 15th, 19th, 24th, and 26th amendments to the Constitution.
