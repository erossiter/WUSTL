SEN. DOMENICI SALUTES NEW MEXICO INDIAN STUDENT ART WINNERS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici has honored three youth from Acoma, Shiprock and Zuni who recently won top honors in a U.S. Department of Education-sponsored art competition for Native American students.  
   Domenici has honored the New Mexico winners--Diedra Lee of Shiprock, Robert Francis of Acoma, and Michael Curley of Zuni--in a Congressional Record statement. Each student's artistic entry received awards in the "Education: A Gift Without Boundaries," the 2007 Native American student art competition sponsored by the Education Department and its Office of Indian Education. There were almost 1,400 entries from 34 states in six events divided by grade. 
   "All three of these students from New Mexico are to be recognized for their accomplishments in the arts. They have demonstrated a clear understanding of the importance of academic, cultural, and artistic education," Domenici said. 
   "Even though the art may be different from tribe to tribe, the universal importance of art is seen in the number of entrants and from the diverse geographic areas that they come from. The number of entrants also speaks to the immense support from teachers and parents in the Native American communities," he said. 
   Lee, an eighth grade student at Shiprock's Tse Bit Ai Middle School, won first place in the 6-8 grade level for a work called "A Gift Without Boundaries." 
   Curley, a Pine Hill School junior, won first place in the 11-12 grade division for his work titled "A Gift to Receive." 
   Francis, a sophomore at Grants High School, received third place in the 9-10 grade division for work titled "Let Your Mind Fly High."
