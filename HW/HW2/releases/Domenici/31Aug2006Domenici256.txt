SEN. DOMENICI TO BE PANELIST ON MENTAL HEALTH DISCUSSION
  As a nationally recognized advocate for mental illness treatment, Sen. Pete Domenici on Thursday will kick off a panel discussion at an Albuquerque symposium on major issues involving New Mexico's behavioral health needs.  
   Domenici is among the policy makers and advocates who will take part in the meeting at sponsored by the New Mexico Behavioral Health Collaborative to address the state's behavioral health needs. The Senator will argue in favor of mandated community treatment for those with mental illnesses, a concept embodied in Kendra's law, which Domenici has been actively pushing. 
   "Our state must learn from the past and implement laws that will proactively provide clear and compassionate assistance to those who suffer from serious mental illnesses. Forty-two other states have similar laws on the books for a reason. I'm disappointed the New Mexico legislature has failed to act, but our efforts are far from done. We should identify and treat those who need the most help before they become a threat to themselves and others," Domenici said. 
   Domenici will be joined on the panel by State Representative Joni Gutierrez (D-Do?a Ana), the sponsor of Kendra's Law, Jonathan Stanley, JD, of the Virginia-based Treatment Advocacy Center, and Joanna Salinas of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of New Mexico. 
   Domenici's will begin the panel's discussion at 9:00 a.m. Following his panel, a group opposed to mandated community treatment programs will participate in the discussion. 
   Domenici cosponsored the landmark 1999 federal law that authorized the federal mental health court program, through which Bernalillo County has established a separate mental health court. He is also the author of the 1996 Mental Health Parity law to begin ensuring better insurance coverage for mental illnesses. Domenici's efforts to gain full coverage for mental health benefits are ongoing.
