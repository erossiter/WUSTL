ANTI-DRUG MESSAGE RESONATES WITH NEW MEXICO SCHOOLS; SEN. DOMENICI PRAISES RED RIBBON WEEK ACTIVITIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded activities planned throughout New Mexico that celebrate National Red Ribbon Week, which focuses special attention to helping young people commit to drug-free lifestyles.  
   Domenici indicated that schools and communities throughout the state will host a variety of events to observe Oct. 24-31 as a national effort promoting anti-drug habits across the country. 
   "For two decades New Mexico has celebrated Red Ribbon Week with parades, assemblies and contests that have helped young people see the endless opportunities available when they stay drug free. These events portray the commitment our cities have made to keep youth away from drugs and I applaud their dedication," Domenici said. 
   "I hope schools all over the state enjoy celebrating this week and students will remember that it's worth being brave and standing up to say no to drugs," he said. 
   Schools throughout New Mexico will host activities this week, including tying red ribbons along school fences as a reminder to be drug-free. 
   Alameda Elementary School in Las Cruces is competing nationally for the most signatures pledging to be drug free. Other schools like Conlee Elementary School in Las Cruces will host assemblies, themed dress-up days, drug-free essay contests, and drug-free poster contests. 
   The Red Ribbon campaign is now the oldest and largest drug prevention program in the country. 
   This year's theme, "Kiki Camarena Wore His Proudly: The Red Badge of Courage," commemorates the 20th anniversary of DEA agent Enrique "Kiki" Camarena being kidnapped, tortured and murdered by drug traffickers in Mexico.
