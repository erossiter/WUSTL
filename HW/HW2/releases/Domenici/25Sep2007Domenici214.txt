SEN. DOMENICI: N.M. DWI RESOURCE CENTER TO RECEIVE DOJ FUNDS
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Justice (DOJ) Office of Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) will award a $377,660 grant to the DWI Resource Center in Albuquerque.  
   The DWI Resource Center will receive the funds as part of the Community Policing Development (CPD) program, and will help improve its efforts to address drunk driving causes, impacts, treatment, and education in New Mexico. 
   "New Mexico is affected by a startlingly high drunk driving rate," Domenici said. "Unfortunately, the consequences of driving while intoxicated are often dramatic and far reaching. I commend the DWI Resource Center for its efforts to save lives and educate the public on the dangers of driving while intoxicated." 
   The DOJ's CPD program will provide funds for community policing projects and programs across the country. Programs were selected based on their potential to impact surrounding law enforcement efforts. 
   The COPS Office is a federal agency that works to advance community policing nationwide by supporting state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies. Since 1995, COPS has invested $12.4 billion to advance community policing, which includes grants to more than 13,000 state, local, and tribal law enforcement agencies.
