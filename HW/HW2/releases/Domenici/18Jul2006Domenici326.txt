SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DOE CONTRACT TO CARLSBAD CO. FOR WASTE ISOLATION PILOT PLANT - RELATED EQUIPMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that Washington Group International's Engineered Products Department in Carlsbad has been awarded a contract worth $960,000 with the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) to manufacture items needed at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). 
   Washington Group International was awarded the DOE contract to manufacture containment units and lift fixtures needed by Washington Tru-Solutions to safely store and transport waste at WIPP.
   "Once again, we are seeing companies with offices in southern New Mexico completing work for WIPP site, providing jobs and in turn stimulating the economy. It is important not only to the safety of WIPP employees, but also to the people who live in the Carlsbad area and travel on the same routes that the waste is transported, that these items be manufactured a reliable company," Domenici said.
   The Engineered Products Department will manufacture Adjustable Center of Gravity Lift Fixtures (ACGLF); Ten Drum Overpack Lift Fixture Adapter (TDOPLFA); Standard Waste Box Lift Fixture Adapter; and two TRUPACT standard large boxes.
   The one-year contract is listed as a Basic Ordering Agreement with the DOE with four one-year renewable options.
   Domenici, as chairman of the Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee, approved the FY2007 Energy and Water Development Appropriations Bill that contains $30.7 billion for DOE initiatives which includes $232.27 million for the DOE Carlsbad Area Office and WIPP related work. The bill is ready for full Senate consideration.
