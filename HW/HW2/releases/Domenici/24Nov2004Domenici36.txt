SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES THANKSGIVING DAY STATEMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici issued the following Thanksgiving Day statement to New Mexicans:  
   "As we approach the Thanksgiving Day holiday, we have much to be thankful for. Our nation remains strong and peaceful at home. In Afghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, the brave men and women of our Armed Services are making personal sacrifices to advance the cause of freedom. We are thankful for their service and the work they are doing to make the world a safer place. We also will keep those that they have left behind in our thoughts and prayers as we gather together. 
   "Thanksgiving is also a time for families to give thanks for each other's company and love. Nancy and I wish everyone a joyful, relaxing and safe Thanksgiving."
