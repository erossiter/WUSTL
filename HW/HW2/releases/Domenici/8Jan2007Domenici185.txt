SEN. DOMENICI BRIEFED ON NEW IRAQ STRATEGY AT WHITE HOUSE MEETING
  Following a White House meeting with President Bush, Sen. Pete Domenici today said he wants to learn more about the administration's new strategy for stabilizing and rehabilitating Iraq--a plan that will hinge on greater Iraqi responsibility for controlling insurgents and bringing stability to Baghdad.  
   Domenici was among a number of Senators who today met with Bush and members of the White House national security team to discuss the new strategy for U.S. involvement in Iraq. That new plan is expected to recommend sending more American military personnel into Iraq to support Iraqi-led efforts to stabilize Baghdad. 
   "The briefing I received clearly showed me that the plan is vastly broader than the current media focus on a so-called American troop surge. Clearly, I could not support a plan that would just direct another 20,000 American men and women to Iraq with no clear mission. 
   "The administration is developing a broad, new strategy to control Baghdad and Iraq under the leadership of the Iraqi government with American assistance. I expect the President to give the American people and Congress a detailed plan to dramatically accelerate the Iraqi take-over of its own defenses. Prime Minister al-Maliki is making commitments regarding security and civil investments using Iraqi oil revenues. This is important. 
   "I am very interested in learning more about the new strategy being developed by the President. I will have to study it before deciding how I would vote on the future of our American commitment in Iraq. I will listen carefully to better understand the Iraqi commitment to its own stability and defense." 
   Domenici serves on the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee that will have jurisdiction over the approximately $100 billion supplemental appropriations request that is expected to accompany the President's new mission focus of Iraq.
