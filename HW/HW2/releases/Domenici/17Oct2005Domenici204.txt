SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES TWO-YEAR ESSENTIAL AIR SERVICE CONTRACT FOR ALAMOGORDO- ALBUQUERQUE ROUTE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Transportation has awarded an Essential Air Service (EAS) contract for two daily roundtrips between Alamogordo and Albuquerque.  
   DOT has selected Valley Air Express, Inc. based in California to operate the flights using nine-passenger Piper Navajo twin-engine aircraft. Westward Airways previously operated flights between the cities before its contract expired at the end of July. 
   "I am pleased that the Alamogordo and Holloman communities will again continue to have convenient and reliable access to Albuquerque year round. The selection of Valley Air will mean that daily flights will resume and a commercial hub is one stop away from connecting southern New Mexicans with Albuquerque and then countless other destinations," Domenici said. 
   DOT received a total of three proposals for EAS service between Alamogordo and Albuquerque. The proposal selected represented the best combination of cost effectiveness and quality service, according to the Department. 
   Valley Air Express will receive $592,170 per year for two years to provide the service. 
   For the 12 month period 2,961 passengers used the service for a total revenue of $188,595 with 706 annual Albuquerque landings and 706 departures.
