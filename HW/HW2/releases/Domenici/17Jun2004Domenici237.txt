SEN. DOMENICI: $345,000 AVAILABLE TO HELP RETRAIN UNEMPLOYED N.M. WORKERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reported that New Mexico has been awarded $345,000 in Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) funding to help retrain workers displaced by foreign competitors.  
   The Department of Labor's Employment and Training Administration (ETA) award was made available from the federal Dislocated Worker Program, which helps individuals find employment after they have lost their jobs due to company downsizing or closures related to foreign imports. The funding will be administered by the New Mexico Department of Labor and is expected to help about 900 workers. 
   "TAA funds will help displaced workers in New Mexico get training and resources to find other employment or transition into other fields," Domenici said. "The economy is growing at a breakneck rate, so this assistance will help workers keep that pace and be competitive as more and more companies increase hiring." 
   Recently, Domenici heralded evidence that the American economy grew at a breakneck pace by citing that 248,000 new jobs were created during May. Strong numbers in March (353,000) and April (346,000) brought the total number of new jobs created in the last 10 months to 1.4 million. 
   The U.S. Department of Labor's TAA is a federal program created under the Trade Act of 1974. TAA provides weekly trade readjustment allowances, training, job search allowances and relocation allowances to workers who have lost their jobs or suffered reduced hours or wages due to increased foreign imports.
