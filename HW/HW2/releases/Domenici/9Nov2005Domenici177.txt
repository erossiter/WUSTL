SEN. DOMENICI: OIL COMPANIES MUST EXPLAIN GAS PRICES, RECORD PROFITS TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today co-chaired a Senate hearing at which he advised energy company executives to better explain to the American people high energy prices and associated higher company profits.  
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, co-chaired a hearing with energy company executives to review energy prices and corporate profits. The hearing is also being led by Commerce Committee Chairman Ted Stevens (R-Alaska). 
   Domenici noted a variety of recommendations made in Congress and among industry representatives to expand energy supplies available to the American people, but strongly advised corporate executives to clearly and precisely explain energy pricing systems. 
   "I come from an energy producing state, but New Mexicans are like all Americans who are experiencing painful prices at the gasoline pump. They are seeing a lack of refining capacity in this country, and they are facing dramatically increased winter heating fuel prices, especially for natural gas. At the same time they see major oil companies enjoying record profits," Domenici said. 
   "My constituents want to know how the price of oil is set, who sets that price, how does it go up and how can it come down. Right now, a lot of my constituents think someone is rigging the process and that they are getting ripped off. They need a rational and clear explanation, or else they will think someone is rigging the price," he said. 
   The joint Energy and Commerce committees hearing featured testimony from executives from Exxon Mobile, ConocoPhillips, BP America, Shell Oil Co., and Chevron. A second panel featuring the chairman of the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general discussed federal and state consumer protection laws designed to prevent occurrences of price gouging during supply disruptions.
