SEN. DOMENICI SECURES $2.35 MILLION FOR ROADWAY IMPROVEMENTS AROUND CLOVIS CHEESE PLANT
  In what should be the last day of the 108th Congress, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici today announced that he has successfully secured $2.35 million for needed infrastructure improvements in Curry County to support a major new cheese plant near Clovis. 
   Domenici, a senior member of the Appropriations Committee, requested the funding in March as part of the Transportation, Treasury and General Government Appropriations Bill. House and Senate appropriators have completed negotiations on transportation funding for FY2005. These projects will be part of a massive omnibus appropriations package that will include nine separate appropriations bills. 
   The Congress is expected to give final passage to the omnibus bill on Saturday. All items in the $388 billion measure will be subject to a 0.8 percent across-the-board reduction. 
   "I am very happy that these federal transportation funds have been secured. A solid infrastructure is necessary to support any major industry, including a cheese plant that will be one of the largest in the nation," Domenici said. "This appropriation should be viewed as an investment in the economic future of the region, and I'm pleased to have had a role in making it possible. 
   The $2.35 million appropriation will be used to construct a "highway quality" roadway from Highway 70 to the plant, and will provide for the addition of acceleration lanes on Highway 70 itself to allow for trucks to safely enter and exit the highway. 
   The cheese plant is a joint venture between Glanbia Foods, Dairy Farmers of America, and Select Milk Producers. The facility is expected to generate 205 new jobs and an estimated $450 million in annual sales.
