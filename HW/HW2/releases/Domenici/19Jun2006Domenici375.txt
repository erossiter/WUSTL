SENS. DOMENICI, BINGAMAN REACT TO DOE SUSPENSION OF LAB PENSION PLAN
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today issued the following statements in reaction to news that Energy Secretary Samuel Bodman has suspended its recently announced Pension and Medical Benefits Policy for contractors for one year.  
   Senator Domenici said:
   "I'm pleased that Secretary Bodman has taken a step back and decided to suspend its new pension and benefits policy for a year. While I share the Secretary's concern with the rising costs of benefits in relation to the DOE budget, I believe this delay is prudent in order to come up with the best policy possible given long-term cost constraints.
   "The cost of DOE contract pensions will have a significant negative impact on cleanup, science and weapons stewardship if the right policy is not enacted. At the same time, the interests of all the labs and their employees must be considered and protected. Now we'll have more time to find the right balance."
   Senator Bingaman said:
   "This is very good news for employees of Los Alamos, Sandia and WIPP, and I commend Secretary Bodman for taking this action. I hope that that as DOE continues consulting affected employees, it will come to the view that this sweeping change in pension policy could undermine the long-term excellence of crucial facilities."
   Bingaman and Domenici worked together to press DOE to withdraw the proposed pension change.
   Bodman notified Domenici in a letter sent Monday afternoon that DOE will suspend the new policy in order to consult with stakeholders and Congress.
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Senate's Energy and Natural Resources Committee, while Bingaman is the committee's ranking member. Domenici also chairs the Energy and Water Appropriations subcommittee that funds the Department of Energy.
   A copy of the Bodman letter to Domenici is available from the Domenici press office.
