SEN. DOMENICI REPORTS DOE FUNDS FOR NEW MEXICO STATE UNIVERSITY SOLAR RESEARCH
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that New Mexico State University (NMSU) will receive $4.2 million to conduct research aiding the Solar America Initiative of the U.S. Department of Energy.  
   Beginning on May 1, NMSU will join industry participants, partner universities, federal and state government, and other non-governmental agencies to further the integrated research, development, and market transformation of solar energy technologies. Specifically, NMSU will create and operate a national working group to address solar codes and standards. 
   "Fostering the development of alternative energy sources is extremely important," said Domenici. "Moving toward more affordable solar power is an excellent method of pursuing greater and more efficient energy independence, especially in New Mexico." 
   The Solar America Initiative is a program under the Department of Energy (DOE) which aims to accelerate widespread commercialization of clean solar energy technologies by 2015 to provide the United States with additional electrical supply options while reducing U.S. dependence on fossil fuels and improving the environment. The DOE project will be funded at NMSU through May of 2012. 
   Domenici is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. He is also a senior member of the Appropriations Committee which plays a large role in determining funding allocations for the Department of Energy.
