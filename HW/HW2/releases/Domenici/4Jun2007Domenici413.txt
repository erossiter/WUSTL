SEN. DOMENICI SUPPORTS BILLS TO IMPROVE CONCEALED FIREARM RIGHTS, CERTIFICATION
  Sen. Pete Domenici today cosponsored two pieces of legislation to expand concealed firearm rights, and to improve the certification processes for retired law enforcement personnel.  
   The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007 (S.376), introduced by Senator Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.), is a bill to give retired law enforcement officers more flexibility in obtaining concealed firearms permits. Senator John Thune (R-S.D.) introduced S.388, a bill that would allow individuals who hold permits in their home states to carry concealed weapons nationwide. 
   "Currently, law enforcement officers who have retired in good standing are subjected to complex and lengthy certification procedures that vary from state to state. The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act seeks to simplify and shorten the process, allowing qualified retired officers to arm and protect themselves," said Domenici, who serves on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee. 
   "Senator Thune's bill to establish a national standard for legal possession of concealed firearms just makes good sense. Much like each state's driver's license is recognized nationwide, this legislation would require all states to recognize permits issued by other states," he said. 
   The Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act of 2007 is a bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to improve provisions governing law enforcement officers carrying concealed weapons. The bill would reduce the number of years that an officer must serve before qualifying for certification from 15 to 10. 
   During the 109th Congress Domenici cosponsored a bill identical to S.388, which also sought to provide a national standard for nationwide legal concealed weapon possession.
