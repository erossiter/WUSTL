SEN. DOMENICI APPLAUDS AIR FORCE CONTRACT TO BOEING-ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today applauded a new $1.17 million contract to Boeing-LTS, Inc. in Albuquerque to begin performing laser tests for the Air Force Research Laboratory (AFRL) at Kirtland Air Force Base.  
   The indefinite delivery and quantity contract worth $1,175,000 funds Boeing research projects on Laser Development and Engineering and Research Applications (LADERA). The new contract could, over time, total $25 million. 
   "This contract shows the important connection New Mexico's businesses have with our military installations and their reliance upon each other," Domenici said. "The partnership between industry and military base generates employment opportunities and advances technology. I am pleased this contract has been awarded to build upon the laser research being done at Kirtland Air Force Base." 
   Boeing will provide the necessary materials for the LADERA work, including any hardware, facilities, supplies, travel, labor, and other services. Work will take place in Albuquerque and is expected to be completed in May 2010.
