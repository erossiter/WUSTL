SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES DHS FUNDS FOR DO?A ANA FIRE DEPARTMENT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) has awarded a $34,102 grant to the Do?a Ana County District 3 fire department.  
   The award is part of the FY2006 Assistance to Firefighters Grant (AFG) Program, administered under DHS. Do?a Ana County will use the funds to enhance its operation and safety at its District 3 fire department. 
   "Fire departments are on the front lines of the battle to keep our nation safe because the safety of the nation ultimately rests in the safety of our local communities," said Domenici. "Their funding is vital to ensuring an appropriate response time. I am happy that DHS makes these funds available." 
   The AFG program is administered by DHS in order to provide funds to local fire departments and nonaffiliated EMS organizations across the country with the goal of strengthening the frontlines of our nation's security. For FY2006, the program will award approximately $485 million to departments and first responder units. For more information, visit http://www.firegrantsupport.com. 
   Domenici is a long-time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is responsible for determining funding for the Department of Homeland Security.
