SEN. DOMENICI: GRANT WILL PROVIDE ENERGY FOR FIRST TIME TO NAVAJO HOMES
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that Sacred Power Corp. in Albuquerque will receive a $661,625 grant from the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development to equip rural homes on the Navajo Nation in northwestern New Mexico with renewable energy systems. 
   The USDA funds will be used to provide homes in Counselor, Pueblo Pintado and Ramah Chapter Houses of the Navajo Nation with solar photovoltaic hybrid residential gathering system and high efficiency lighting and refrigeration units. These units will combine solar panels with supplemental wind turbine or propane generators and battery storage systems to provide a constant source of power to homes that have never had any source of energy.
   "This is a very good project to explore the use of alternative and renewable energy and provide people with more reliable electricity. It is a very exciting time because some of these homes in the Navajo Nation have never had electricity or refrigeration power. These homes that were previously being lit with kerosene lamps can enjoy energy that is environmentally friendly and clean," Domenici said.
   Sacred Power Corp. is an American Indian-owned and operated small business that provides photovoltaics, wind turbines, solar hot water systems, solar hot air systems and other distributive energy systems.
   Domenici serves as chairman of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and serves on the Senate Appropriations Committee.
