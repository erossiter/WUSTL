SCHOOL-BASED MENTAL HEALTH CARE BILL INTRODUCED BY SENS. DOMENICI, KENNEDY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today again teamed with Sen. Edward Kennedy to introduce mental health legislation, this time with a measure to expand resources and training to establish school-based mental health access for students. 
   The Mental Health in Schools Act of 2007 was introduced on National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day. The measure would amend the Safe Schools/Healthy Students Act to help provide more and better opportunities for public school children get the mental health services they may need. It authorizes a competitive grant program to support comprehensive school-based mental health programs for students in grades K-12.
   One in five children has a diagnosable mental disorder yet 75 percent of children in need of mental health services do not receive them.
   "We have seen over and over again that failing to offer effective mental health care has many ramifications, not the least of which is violence, substance abuse and poor academic performance," Domenici said. "We must recognize that children do not have to remain neglected when it comes to their mental health. Investing in effective mental health treatment can mean the difference between a child's success and failure in school and in society. Our bill will give the federal government a more active role in providing this needed care."
   "The need for these services has never been greater. The tragic events at Columbine, Nickel Mines, and Virginia Tech underscore the fact that when left untreated, childhood mental disorders can lead to academic failure, family conflicts, substance abuse, violence, and suicide." Kennedy said. "Comprehensive school mental health programs should be designed for all students. They should obviously include both identification and referral of specific individuals for treatment, but they should also include programs and services that promote positive mental health and prevent mental health problems for a broader population of students."
   For National Children's Mental Health Awareness Day, Domenici worked with the National Partners for Awareness Day to host a briefing on children and mental health needs. The national briefing included a presentation by NBC "Deal or No Deal" host Howie Mandel.
   The Kennedy-Domenici legislation would provide grant funding to local education agencies (LEAs, or for example, school districts) to work with local communities to develop and implement mental health service programs in schools. It would also support in-service training to all school personnel in mental health care-related support techniques. LEAs-partnered with mental health and health care providers, local law enforcement, child welfare or other community-based groups-could qualify for five-year grants worth $1.0 million annually.
   The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, in conjunction with the Education Department and Justice Department would administer the grants. Grantees would be required to develop comprehensive mental health services programs that:
   * Promote the social, emotional, and behavioral health of all students and facilitate an environment conducive to learning;
   * Reduce the likelihood of developing social, emotional and behavioral health problems for at-risk students;
   * Treat existing social, emotional and behavioral health problems of students already experiencing such problems; and
   * Develop systems of care to assist children in dealing with violence.
