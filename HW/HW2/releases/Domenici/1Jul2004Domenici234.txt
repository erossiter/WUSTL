SEN. DOMENICI SAYS TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT LOOKING TO CONTINUE ALAMOGORDO-ALBUQUERQUE FLIGHTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that companies interested in filling the gap in service between Alamogordo and Albuquerque should now submit proposals to the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT).  
   Domenici is the only member of the New Mexico delegation to serve on the Senate Appropriations Committee, which provides funding for the Essential Air Service program. 
   "These flights took thousands of New Mexicans between Albuquerque and Alamogordo last year so it's easy to imagine the disruption that has been caused by the lack of service," Domenici said. "I encourage interested entities to get proposals together to take advantage of a good business opportunity that will help the community." 
   Rio Grande Air served the Alamogordo and Holloman Air Force Base community since May 2002 averaging 4 trips a day until flights ceased in June 2004. 
   Because service ended so abruptly and needs to be restored as soon as possible, the DOT is asking interested companies to file proposals within 15 days. 
   Proposals should include projected block hours, revenues and expenses, and proposed schedules. Carriers should be prepared to offer two or three round trips each weekday and each weekend on a two-pilot, twin-engine aircraft with at least 15 passenger seats. 
   Proposals should be sent to the EAS & Domestic Analysis Division, X-53, Office of Aviation Analysis, Room 6401, Department of Transportation, 400 7th Street S.W., Washington D.C. 20590 with the title "Proposal to Provide Essential Air Service at Alamogordo/Holloman AFB, New Mexico, Docket OST-1996-1901.
