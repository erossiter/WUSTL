SEN. DOMENICI: NEW MEXICO RECIEVES $285,000 FOR CONSERVATION PROJECTS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that New Mexico will receive $285,000 under the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's Private Stewardship Grants Program to aid in conservation projects on private lands.  
   The Private Land's Stewardship Program has been providing grants to private landowners and groups for three years. Grants are awarded on a competitive basis to individuals who voluntarily implement conservation efforts on their lands in an attempt to protect endangered or threatened species. 
   "We must take care of our lands and the animals that we share them with. These grants provide an opportunity to citizens who wish to use their private lands to protect and provide habitats for those species who may be struggling to survive. I am very pleased that New Mexicans will be given aid in their efforts to enhance and protect the environment through these conservation efforts," Domenici said. 
   "This money will be available to allow citizens to conduct conservation projects on their property. Conservation involves protection, enhancement, and conserving of not only our fish and wildlife, but their entire environment. These grants will contribute to projects looking to improve habit, reintroduce certain species, and relocate others," he continued. 
   The grants will be awarded to: 
   * Grant County will receive $12,000 to establish 3 populations of the endangered Chiricahua leopard frog. The frog will be reintroduced along a stream segment on the Burro Cienega Ranch in the Southwestern part of the state. 
   * Sierra County will receive $80,000 for the Heritage Ranch Institute Habitat Improvement Project. This project will protect and restore riparian habitat on this ranch in the south central part of New Mexico. 
   * Colfax County will receive $33,000 for the Gunnison's Prairie Dog Translocation Program. This program hopes to establish up to 9 colonies of Gunnison's prairie dogs on the Vermejo Ranch over a 3-year period. The new colonies will be monitored to reduce predation and measure their survival. 
   * Multiple counties in Eastern New Mexico will receive $160,000 for the Canadian River Ecosystem for Threatened and Endangered Species Habitat Project. This project seeks to enhance habitat along the Canadian River. This will be done by protecting intact mosaics of riparian ecosystems and restoring degraded riparian habitats. 
   The Fish and Wildlife Service is the primary agency responsible for protecting, enhancing, and conserving fish, wildlife, plants, and their habitat. The agency enforces wildlife laws, administers the Endangered Species Act, conserves and restores wildlife habitat, and helps foreign and Native American Tribal governments with their conservation efforts.
