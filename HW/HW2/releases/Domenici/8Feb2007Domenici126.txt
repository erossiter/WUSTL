SEN. DOMENICI IS ORIGINAL COSPONSOR TO BILL TO STUDY POSSIBLE NATIONAL HISPANIC MUSEUM IN D.C.
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that he has rejoined a bipartisan effort to study the potential creation of a national museum honoring the contributions of Hispanic Americans.  
   Domenici is an original cosponsor of S.500, legislation introduced by Senators Ken Salazar (D-Colo.) and Mel Martinez (R-Fla.) to study the possible creation of a National Museum of the American Latino in Washington D.C. 
   "Over the years, Hispanic Americans have made very valuable contributions to the United States. I believe it is important that we look at how best to recognize them and appreciate their worth in the growth of America," said Domenici. 
   The bill, introduced in the 109th Congress, will result in a bipartisan 23-member commission to be appointed by the President and congressional leaders. The commission would establish a plan of action for the establishment of a Latino museum, including a fundraising plan and possible location sites. 
   Congressman Xavier Becerra (D-Calif.) sponsored the companion bill that recently passed the House. 
   Domenici is the ranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, the committee to which the bill has been referred.
