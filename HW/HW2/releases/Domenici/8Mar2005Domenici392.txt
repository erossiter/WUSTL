SEN. DOMENICI COSPONORS BILL TO FOCUS RESEARCH ON ARTHRITIS
  Sen. Pete Domenici has cosponsored legislation aimed at focusing attention and providing support for arthritis research and treatment.  
   The Arthritis Prevention, Control, and Cure Act of 2005 (S.424) was introduced by Senators Kit Bond (R-Mo) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). A companion bill (H.R.583) has also been introduced in the House of Representatives. 
   The bill would enhance the National Arthritis Action Plan by providing additional support to federal, state, and private efforts to prevent and manage arthritis, as well as develop an education and outreach campaign to make sure that healthcare professionals recognize signs of arthritis in their patients. 
   "Arthritis can be a painful and debilitating ailment, especially if it is not treated properly. This bill will help us focus what resources we have on the best possible strategies for managing arthritis, as well as provide additional support for research - especially among younger people - that could ultimately lead to finding a cure for arthritis," Domenici said. 
   The bill is especially aimed at preventing arthritis through research in young people. Provisions of the bill call for great attention to the area of juvenile arthritis research through the creation of planning grants for innovative research, as well as better understanding the causes, prevalence and outcomes of the disease in young people. 
   In order to encourage greater focus on juvenile arthritis, the bill establishes an education loan repayment program and career development award programs for health care professionals that enter the field of pediatric rheumatology. 
   The bill has been referred to the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee for consideration.
