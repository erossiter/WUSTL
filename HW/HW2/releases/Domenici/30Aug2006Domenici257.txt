SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GRANT FOR CHILD ABUSE PREVENTION PROGRAM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the United States Department of Justice has awarded a $468,933 grant to the Community Foundation of Southern New Mexico to help fund ChildSafe/NinosSeguros.  
   The grant is the result of funding that Domenici helped secure. Childsafe/NinosSeguros, led by community leaders, is a collaborative program to prevent child abuse in southern New Mexico. Specifically, it aims to reduce the incidence of child abuse by advocating for resources on behalf of child and family support providers, as well as serving as an umbrella of cooperation and coordination for such organizations. 
   "I believe that the work of Childsafe/NinosSeguros is essential to preventing child abuse before it occurs in the Las Cruces community. I am happy to see the community take the initiative to maximize the impact of groups and organizations that are already directly involved in combating child abuse," said Domenici. "I believe in this program and know that these funds will help ensure the safety of children in Las Cruces and the surrounding area." 
   Senator Domenici announced in July 2005 his intention to seek funding for NinosSeguros. The initiative is supported through the Community Foundation of Southern New Mexico, which will receive the grant. 
   According to ChildSafe/NinosSeguros, seven children in the area died as a result of abuse between July 2001 and March 2005. In 2002, New Mexico's three child abuse deaths all occurred in Dona Ana County. 
   Senator Domenici serves on the Commerce, Justice and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for the Department of Justice.
