SEN. DOMENICI CONGRATULATES TWO ALBUQUERQUE YOUTH TO BE HONORED IN WASHINGTON
  Sen. Pete Domenici today congratulated a pair of Albuquerque area students selected as 2004 Presidential Scholars for excellence in academics and leadership.  
   The White House Commission on Presidential Scholars awarded 141 graduating high school seniors based on their academic and artistic success, leadership, and involvement in school and community. 
   "These students should feel extremely proud that they have been set apart by their merits as all-around individuals," Domenici said. "I join their peers, families, teachers and communities in congratulating them on a fantastic job in leading the way as role models." 
   Gabriel M. Fries-Briggs of Albuquerque High School and Mary E. Spulak of Saint Pious X High School have been selected as Presidential Scholars from New Mexico. 
   In addition to being honored for their accomplishments during Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week, winners had the opportunity to nominate a teacher who has been particularly influential to accompany them on the expense-paid trip to the nation's capital. 
   Fries-Briggs will be accompanied by Mrs. Cathy Stanke, a math teacher at Albuquerque High School, while Spulak will be joined in Washington by Mrs. Marie Cahill, a French teacher at her school. 
   The group will visit Washington, D.C. during the Presidential Scholars National Recognition Week from June 19-22. 
   The United States Presidential Scholars Program was established in 1964 by an Executive Order of President Lyndon B. Johnson to recognize and honor some of the nation's most distinguished graduating high school seniors.
