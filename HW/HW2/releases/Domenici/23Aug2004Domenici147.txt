SEN. DOMENICI SECURES FUNDING FOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has awarded a $294,353 grant to support the Naturally Occurring Retirement Community, or NORC, in the Albuquerque area.  
   The grant was issued to the Jewish Family Service of New Mexico to continue the NORC program that encourages senior citizens to live independently while receiving support services such as transportation. 
   "A vast majority of seniors are now choosing to remain in their homes in familiar surroundings with family and friends nearby. NORC encompasses a wide range of health, wellness, educational and social activities to assist the elderly," Domenici said. "I believe that this program results in positive health and social outcomes and has enabled seniors to remain living independently longer." 
   The program is a partnership between the University of New Mexico Geriatrics program, the New Mexico Administration on Aging, the Bernalillo County Department of Senior Affairs, and personal finance managers and mental health professionals. 
   This grant can be used for social work, case management, personal care and other in-home support services such as transportation, home-delivered meals, and health monitoring. 
   Domenici was honored at the annual Jewish Federation of Greater Albuquerque "Just Desserts" event in March in recognition of his support for this program. 
   Domenici has been a long advocate of this project, securing $550,000 the last two years. A senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Domenici is seeking an additional $500,000 in FY2005 appropriations to expand the NORC program to rural areas of New Mexico.
