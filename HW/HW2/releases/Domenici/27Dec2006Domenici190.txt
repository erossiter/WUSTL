SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON DEATH OF FORMER PRESIDENT FORD
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding the death of former President Gerald R Ford: "Gerald Ford was friend to me, as a freshman Senator and throughout my career. President Ford came into office at a very difficult time, and successfully brought the nation through a tumultuous period in the history of the presidency. While his time in the White House was relatively short, his leadership and credibility worked to bring the nation through the Watergate crisis and its aftermath. That proved to be invaluable and underscored the resiliency of our democratic government. "Nancy and I send our condolences and prayers to First Lady Betty Ford and the entire Ford family. We join the nation in mourning President Ford and in honoring a long life of service."
