SEN. DOMENICI: $1.08 MILLION RELEASED TO NEW MEXICO TO HELP DEFRAY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT INCARCERATION COSTS
  Fourteen New Mexico counties have been awarded over $409,944 in federal funds to help pay a portion of the cost involved in incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants, according to Sen. Pete Domenici, who is a member of the Commerce, Justice, State and the Judiciary (CJS) Appropriations Subcommittee.  
   The funding was provided through the Department of Justice's (DOJ) State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) and will be used to reimburse expenses incurred by the city of Albuquerque ($225,367), Valencia County ($5,618), Santa Fe County ($15,897), Rio Arriba County ($15,520), and Taos County ($1,634), as well as 10 other counties and the State of New Mexico. The CJS Subcommittee sets funding levels for the SCAAP program. 
   "New Mexico has miles of border to cover in the federal campaign to secure our borders. Law enforcement officials maintain constant vigilance as illegal immigrants continuously attempt to cross the border and filter into different parts of the state. It is imperative that the financial burden of detaining and incarcerating criminal illegal immigrants be eased from the state's shoulders," Domenici said. 
   "Many New Mexico counties rely on this funding to continue immigration efforts without saddling taxpayers with hefty costs and I am pleased that funding for this program was included in the bill now before the Senate," he said. 
   The following counties were also awarded SCAAP funding, in addition to $650,877 for the State of New Mexico: Chaves ($11,259); Colfax ($1,009); Eddy ($7,542); Lea ($31,502); Otero ($19,252); Do?a Ana ($85,519); Luna ($4,914); Quay ($1,310); Roosevelt ($4,730); and Sierra ($4,238) counties. 
   Domenici is a cosponsor of the State Criminal Alien Assistance Program (SCAAP) Reauthorization Act of 2005 (S.188), reauthorize the program through 2011and authorizes appropriations of $750 million for FY2006; $850 million for FY2007; and $950 million for each of the fiscal years 2008 through 2011. 
   Created by Congress in 1995, SCAAP funds reimburse states and local governments for costs incurred in detaining or incarcerating illegal immigrants accused of, or convicted of, felony or misdemeanor crimes in the United States. Reimbursable expenses can include court, detention, county attorney, clerk, and indigent defense costs. 
   The FY2006 CJS Appropriations Bill, which Domenici helped draft as a member of the subcommittee, includes $405 million for SCAAP to reimburse Southwest border states for costs associated with illegal immigration. 
   Domenici worked to include $30 million for the Southwest Border Prosecutors initiative in the FY2006 CJS Appropriations Bill, which is now awaiting final Congressional approval. These funds assist states such as New Mexico that share the border with Mexico in prosecuting criminal cases associated with illegal immigration, illegal drug trafficking, and other illegal activities.
