SEN. DOMENICI PRAISES EL ZOCALO DEVELOPMENT IN BERNALILLO
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici today praised the cooperative effort that has led to the development of the El Zocalo, or gathering place, in downtown Bernalillo-a project intended to better serve the growing community's needs. 
   Domenici today met with Sandoval County and Bernalillo town officials to review the development for which he helped gain a $1.4 million federal Economic Development Administration grant. The county used those funds, combined with local and state funding, to rehabilitate historic old structures into a community complex.
   "Bernalillo can no longer be considered a sleepy, rural suburb of its neighbor. In its own right, this is a growing community. Its leaders have turned a vision into a reality with the El Zocalo. This project should strengthen the heart of this historic community today and well into the future" Domenici said. "It is good to see how a little effort on my part to help a local effort can result in good things for a New Mexico town."
   The EDA awarded the grant to Sandoval County on the premise that it, with the exception of Rio Rancho, is fundamentally rural and suffers from higher rates of poverty and unemployment rates. The renovation of what was once an old convent and school is almost complete. The complex will be used for county offices, community meetings and other purposes.
