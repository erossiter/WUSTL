SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES NEW 'RURAL PAYDAY' INITIATIVE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced a new partnership between Presbyterian Health Services and TechConnex, another major accomplishment for the Rural Payday program that he started in 1996.  
   Under the agreement, TechConnex, which is the employee service arm of the Rural Payday program, will provide customized training to Presbyterian's support staff. Presbyterian Health Services is the largest healthcare organization in New Mexico. 
   Domenici founded Rural Payday in 1996 to attract and create new jobs in rural cities and towns. Since its founding, over 3,000 workers have been placed across the state, including 1,300 in the last year alone. 
   "The Rural Payday program has been a tremendous success, and I'm pleased to announce another new initiative that will keep the strong momentum of our economy going," Domenici said. "The beauty of the Rural Payday program is that it provides services to both employers and employees. Many jobs in the new economy require advanced skills, and Rural Payday is making training and education available to all New Mexicans." 
   When the program began eight years ago, the primary focus was on call centers and telecommunications businesses. That focus has now evolved as the economy has advanced to include the health care and information technology sectors. 
   Domenici obtained $4.6 million for TechConnex in 2000 to boost the group's efforts to address workforce needs in the state. 
   Both the national and New Mexico economy has shown substantial improvement. The economy has shown 11 straight months of job growth, creating 1.5 million jobs during that period, including 17,000 in New Mexico. The 5.5 percent unemployment rate is lower than the average unemployment rate for the 1970s, 80s and 90s.
