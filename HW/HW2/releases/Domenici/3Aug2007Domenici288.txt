FEDERAL HELP COULD BE ON THE WAY FOR DROUGHT RELIEF
  Summer in New Mexico often means long hot days, often with very little of the moisture that is so precious to our region. So far this summer, many areas of New Mexico are getting respectable amounts of rain. However, one winter's good snowpack or a summer of good rains does not fundamentally change the long-term effects of the severe drought conditions we've experienced in the recent past. 
   We must take a long-term view to addressing the problems caused by drought conditions, including the strain on water service in many rural communities, pueblos and rural water cooperatives around the state. Many of these small town and cooperative water wells are still going dry even with recent precipitation.
   I have long monitored the need for emergency drought assistance and am working to see that resources are in place when we need them. I recently wrote Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne asking that New Mexico's needs are considered as $10 million for emergency water projects is distributed this year in drought-prone western states. There are at least two dozen New Mexico municipalities, counties, mutual water users associations, and pueblos that have a real need for this federal assistance.
   Through the Senate appropriations process, I helped secure this $10 million in supplemental funding for the Bureau of Reclamation to carry out emergency water projects in the West. New Mexico communities should benefit from it. Last year, we put similar funding to work to try to drill new water wells for Ruidoso Downs, Las Vegas, Ruidoso and other communities to ensure they have water and services their residents require. Ultimately, this is a long-term problem and we must continue to work toward long-term solutions.
