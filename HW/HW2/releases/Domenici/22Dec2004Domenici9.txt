SEN. DOMENICI WISHES NEW MEXICANS HAPPY HOLIDAYS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today extended the following holiday message to New Mexicans:  
   "My wife Nancy and I wish New Mexicans a Merry Christmas and a happy New Year. We hope that this time of the year provides an opportunity for families to spend time together, relax, and share the joys of the holidays. 
   "We've been through quite a bit this year, from conflict overseas to a hotly contested election here at home. But through it all our nation has remained strong and has prospered. 
   "We hope that New Mexicans take time during this season to reflect on the sacrifices made by members of the military who are defending our freedom. Please keep these brave men and women and their families in your thoughts and prayers. 
   "Again, Nancy and I wish you all a blessed holiday season, and a happy and healthy new year." 
   The Domenici offices in Washington, D.C., Albuquerque, Las Cruces, Roswell and Santa Fe will be closed starting Friday, Dec. 24. They will reopen on Monday, Jan. 3, 2005.
