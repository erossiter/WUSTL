SENS. DOMENICI, DORGAN TO INTRODUCE BORDER SECURITY & MODERNIZATION ACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Sen. Byron Dorgan of North Dakota will conduct a news conference at 11:30 a.m., Thursday in the Senate Gallery to discuss their plans to introduce the Border Security and Modernization Act of 2005. 
   The bill will authorize the first comprehensive federal program since 1986 to address rampant border infrastructure problems and needs on the United States borders with Mexico and Canada. The new Domenici legislation will also address necessary border security improvements. 
   In 1986, Congress enacted a wide-ranging border infrastructure bill authored by Domenici and then-Senator Dennis DiConcini (D-Ariz.).
