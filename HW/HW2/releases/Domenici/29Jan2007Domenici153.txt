SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS RESOLUTION DESIGNATIN JANUARY AS 'NATIONAL MENTORING MONTH'
  Sen. Pete Domenici today lent his support to youth character development with his co-sponsorship of a measure establishing January 2007 as "National Mentoring Month."  
   The resolution was introduced by Senators John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.). It recognizes the contributions of mentorship programs over the past several years and draws attention to the role they play in local communities. 
   "Character formation begins at a young age and is shaped by those who are closest to children and young people. For some, a little extra help is needed and that is where mentorship programs play a crucial role," said Domenici. "I am pleased to cosponsor this resolution that will recognize the valuable contributions that mentors make to the lives of countless young people and encourage an increase in such programs across the U.S." 
   There are currently 3 million young people in the United States who are part of mentorship programs. While this number represents an increase over the past several years, it is estimated that 15,000,000 young people still lack mentors. 
   Domenici is a long-time proponent of character-development programs and has worked to raise awareness of them through initiatives such as Character Counts. Character Counts is a program used in most New Mexico public and private classrooms and was launched in New Mexico in 1994. Since then, Domenici has worked to raise public awareness and support, as well as federal funding.
