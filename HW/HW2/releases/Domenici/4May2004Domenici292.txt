SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON REPORTS OF IRAQI PRISONER ABUSE
  In response to reports and allegations of abuse of Iraqi prisoners by American troops, Sen.  
 Pete Domenici issued the following statement today: 
   "I am appalled by recent revelations of abuse in the Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. I join President Bush in supporting a full and thorough investigation into this matter, and I believe that those responsible should be held fully responsible for their actions. I am encouraged by the aggressive manner in which the Department of Defense has addressed this issue thus far, and I have full confidence in the Department's ability to ensure that this behavior will not be repeated. 
   "The actions taken by this small number of personnel runs counter to the ideals and spirit of our country. I am troubled by it not only because of the ordeals that Iraqi prisoners were put through, but also because it may reflect poorly on the thousands of brave men and women of our Armed Forces, who risk their lives every day to protect the cause of freedom. 
   "Let me emphasize that only a tiny minority of soldiers were involved in this unacceptable behavior. In no way should it take anything away from the vast majority of troops, who represent their country overseas with professionalism. I sincerely hope that their actions will continue to be recognized and respected."
