SEN. DOMENICI LARGELY SATISFIED WITH DOE FY07 SPENDING PLAN, BUT CONCERNED ABOUT LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY SHORTFALLS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today said he was largely satisfied with the Department of Energy's FY2007 spending plan, citing significant increases in research and development for alternative fuels and renewable energy which build on his work in the Energy Policy Act of 2005 as well as improved funding for the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP). 
   The $23.598 billion measure is $45 billion over the FY2007 budget request for the Department of Energy. While the Senator was pleased with funding levels for long range nuclear programs like the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership and NP2010, he did express concern about the lack of commitment to science in the NNSA's budget, as evidenced by cuts to key programs.  
   "Overall, I'm pleased with the Department of Energy's FY2007 spending plan. In the joint resolution passed by Congress to fund the government, we gave the Department clear direction that the development of new energy sources and alternative fuels should be their priority. That direction was followed in this spending plan, which is important given our need to reduce dependence on foreign oil and control greenhouse gas emissions. While I am concerned about cuts to certain science related programs, I think that this plan meets many of our nation's top energy priorities," said Domenici. 
   Domenici expressed pleasure at the spending plan's increase for WIPP, which allocates $228.8 million, a $15 million increase above the requested funding. The funding will include $139 million for operations at WIPP, including an additional $24 million to support remote handled waste activities and the central characterization project. 
   In the area of energy supply and conservation, Domenici highlighted major increases for research and development for biomass, solar and wind energy, which will nearly double overall. He also praised a $358 million increase for the Office of Environmental Management, which cleans up Cold War-era nuclear facilities. 
   The Senator also singled out full funding ($80.3 million) for the Office of Nuclear Energy's NP2010 program. NP2010 is a joint government/industry cost sharing effort to identify sites for new nuclear plants, development and bring to market advanced nuclear plant technologies, and demonstrate a yet untested licensing processes. 
   Among the cuts that concerned Domenici was a $59 million cut for the Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Replacement (CMRR) project at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL). The CMR-R project aims to consolidate many major LANL programs in a single, safer facility which will allow the lab to continue to maintain and certify the U.S. nuclear stockpile. 
   "The NNSA has failed to fulfill its commitment to meet its own budget request of $112.4 million for CMR-R. This will lead to delays including cost increases that are unnecessary and illogical in light of the excessive increase for the NIF budget," said Domenici. "CMR-R is a major priority at Los Alamos and critical to support the plutonium mission of the NNSA. I plan to address these shortcomings in the FY2008 budget process." 
   Domenici also expressed concern at DOE's decision to increase funding for the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The budget provides $489.7 million, an increase of $38.6 million. 
   "I believe NNSA has made an extraordinarily poor decision in increasing the NIF project. With shortfalls in science, engineering and infrastructure, the Department continues to put all its eggs in the NIF basket," said Domenici. "Unlike every other program, which is forced to scrape for declining resources, the NNSA refuses to make the tough decisions needed to adequately support a balanced stockpile stewardship program." 
   The DOE proposed budget allocates $9.08 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA). Of this, $6.27 billion is outlined for weapons activities, $1.68 billion for nonproliferation activities, and $3.79 billion for scientific research. The spending plan has $2.1 billion for the President's Advanced Energy Initiative, including solar, biomass and nuclear energy--roughly a $340 million increase to fund energy supply and conservation activities authorized in the National Energy Policy Act of 2005. 
   The bill provides $470 million for Fissile Material Disposition, or MOX program construction funds. 
   "I'm disappointed that these funds can't be spent until August of this year due to the joint resolution. However, I still believe this is a worthwhile nonproliferation project that will eventually get back on track, and I believe we should put our resources toward upholding our end of the deal," Domenici said. 
   The bill provides $167.5 million for the Global Nuclear Partnership, plus $36 million for facilities upgrades and $80.3 million for the Nuclear Plant 2010 program, which is critical to licensing the next generation of nuclear plants. This fulfills the Department's obligation to fund its cost share to first-of-a-kind nuclear plant licensing process. 
   The spending plan provides funds to support energy-related activities authorized in the Energy Policy Act of 2005, including, among other things: 
   * Solar - $159 million, a $78 million increase above FY2006 levels; 
   * Biomass - $199 million, a $109 million increase above the request; 
   * Geothermal - $5 million is provided to close out geothermal research and development; 
   * Building Technology - $104 million, up 36 million over FY2006 to support energy conservation demonstration projects and to implement solid state lighting like high-efficiency LED lights. 
   The following is a review of DOE's FY2007 Spending Plan: 
   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY/National/New Mexico Overview 
   DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY - $23.6 billion for DOE, $45 million over the budget request. The budget makes significant investments in the Office of Science as part of the "American Competitive Initiative" and in the Office of Energy Supply and Conservation to support the "Advanced Energy Initiative" to find alternatives to foreign oil supplies. 
   NNSA Weapons Activities: $6.275 billion, a $180 million decrease, for weapons activities. Los Alamos National Laboratory, Sandia National Laboratories, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, the Nevada Test Site, and at plants in Texas, Missouri, Tennessee and South Carolina are involved in this work, including Science-based Stockpile Stewardship campaigns. The bill provides $1.425 billion, an increase of 53 million over FY2006, for Directed Stockpile work, including: 
   * Life Extension Program - Reduced by $53 million as a result of ending life extension work associated with the W80, as proposed in the Senate Energy and Water 2007 bill. 
   * Stockpile systems - $336 million, an increase of 11 million over the FY2007 request. 
   * Stockpile services - $714.2 million, an increase of 45 million over the FY2007 request. 
   * Reliable Replacement Warhead (RRW) - $35.8 million, a $8 million increase, to support the RRW design activities. 
   * Dismantlement - $75 million, as requested. 
   * Inertial Confinement Fusion and High Yield - $489.7 million, up $38.6 million, as funding for the National Ignition Facility (NIF). The funding provides $45.7 million for Z machine operations. 
   * Science Campaign - $270 million, down $6.2 million below FY2006, to support research and experiments that are critical to certification of the stockpile.

   * Advanced Simulation and Computing - $611.9 million, down $6 million. The Department will allocate $15 million to support the Roadrunner computer experiments. This will be the fastest computer in the world and will give Los Alamos the capability to simulate complex physics experiments to validate the reliability of the U.S. stockpile, without underground testing. * Pit Manufacturing - $242.3 million, $5 million above the FY2007 request. 
   * Weapons Readiness - $201 million, $5 million below the request.
