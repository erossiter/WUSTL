SEN. DOMENICI: U.S. TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT SEEKS NEW AIR SERVICE PLANS FOR CLOVIS, SILVER CITY AREAS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) will request a new proposal for air service to Clovis and Silver City from a hub city. 
   The request, made under the Essential Air Service (EAS) program, is designed to ensure that the two communities continue to receive passenger air service.
   Currently, Clovis and the Silver City/Hurley/Deming areas are served by Great Lakes Airlines, which operates two daily roundtrips to Albuquerque on 19-passenger Beech 1900-D aircraft. Great Lakes will have the option of bidding to continue the service.
   "News that the Department of Transportation is seeking to continue air service to Clovis and the Silver City area is welcome. The EAS program provides subsidies to airlines so that smaller, more rural communities can be connected to major hubs. This type of service is important to the local economy and to economic development efforts, particularly as the agricultural industry continues to grow in eastern New Mexico," said Domenici, a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee.
   DOT is seeking proposals for a two year contract, beginning May 1, 2007. The agency will then review proposals and select the best one, based on a combination of factors including the amount of subsidy requested, the level of service, and input from community.
   The department has specified that it is seeking proposals that would provide two round trips a day to each city utilizing 15-seat or larger pressurized aircraft.
   Great Lakes Airlines receives an annual subsidy of $1.71 million for the existing service to Clovis and Silver City.
   Through three quarters in 2006, 3,216 passengers have used the Clovis-Albuquerque service, while 3,497 have flown the Silver City-Albuquerque route.
