SEN. DOMENICI-GAINED FUNDING HELPS RENOVATE ALBUQUERQUE'S GOODWILL CENTER
  Sen. Pete Domenici today announced that the Department of Housing and Urban Development released $496,000 in funding he secured last year to help renovate Albuquerque's Goodwill Industries headquarters and training center.  
   Domenici gained the funds during FY2005 as a member of what is now the Senate Transportation, Treasury, Judiciary, and Housing and Urban Development (TTHUD) Appropriations Committee. 
   "For over six decades, Goodwill has provided new opportunities for New Mexicans to start life again. It isn't just about bargain hunting, but it's about changing lives and giving countless individuals a new chance," Domenici said. "I am pleased I was able to secure this funding to further renovations so that more New Mexicans will benefit from Goodwill's great work." 
   The lawmaker visited Albuquerque's Goodwill center in May when the organization dedicated its state headquarters building to Domenici for his role as Honorary Chairman in raising $1.0 million to refurbish the 27-year-old job training center and retail outlet. 
   In addition to his support in the Capital Campaign to raise money for the improvements, Domenici gained $500,000 in FY2005 appropriations to help support a $2 million project to restore the 44-year-old headquarters building. 
   Renovations to the building have contributed to the ability for Goodwill to serve 65 percent more clients than it did in 2002.
