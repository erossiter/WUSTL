SEN. DOMENICI: HIGH ROLLS WATER PROJECT RECEIVES USDA FUNDING
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development has awarded $107,230 to Cider Mill Farms Mutual Domestic Water Consumers Association (MDWCA) in High Rolls for improvements to the city's water system.  
   Funds were awarded under USDA's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program and will be used to address the overrun costs associated with the association's water improvement project. The association expects the upgrades, once completed, to provide the High Rolls with a reliable water system at reasonable user rates. 
   "Rural communities must be able to adequately address the water needs of their residents," said Domenici. "I hope these funds from USDA will help High Rolls finish updating its water system at a minimum cost to area residents." 
   The new system is expected to include a new 50,000 gallon reservoir and an additional chlorinator and will eliminate problems associated with the current system's deterioration. 
   The High Rolls water system in Otero County previously received a $132,000 loan and $72,000 grant in FY2005. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA.
