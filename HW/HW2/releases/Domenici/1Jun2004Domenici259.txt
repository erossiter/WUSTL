SEN. DOMENICI: DOJ AWARDS $734,000 GRANT TO REIMBURSE CRIME VICTIMS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today commended a Department of Justice (DOJ) decision to issue a $734,000 grant to the New Mexico Crime Victims Reparation Commission in Albuquerque to support compensation payments to victims of crime.  
   The Office for Victims of Crime, a division of the DOJ, has awarded the grant through the Victims of Crime Act (VOCA) Crime Victim Compensation program. VOCA compensation funds will provide financial assistance to New Mexicans statewide who have fallen victim to crime. 
   "The effort to support crime victims is an on-going endeavor that I continue to support. This grant program uses fines paid by convicted federal offenders to help crime victims shoulder the financial burden of recovery," Domenici said. "This program facilitates victims in their pursuit of a treatment and services they need after suffering from damaging incidents committed against them." 
   Funds can reimburse New Mexicans for expenses incurred from medical costs, mental health counseling, funeral and burial costs, and lost wages or loss of support. 
   The Crime Victims Fund serves as a major funding source for victim services throughout the country. Millions of dollars, deposited into the fund annually, are derived from fines, penalty assessments, and bond forfeitures from convicted federal offenders. As a result, no taxpayers contribute to this fund. 
   Domenici is a member of the Commerce, Justice, State and Judiciary Senate Appropriations Subcommittee which sets funding levels for DOJ programs.
