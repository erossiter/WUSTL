SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES GRANTS TO PROMOTE COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERISM
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced that the New Mexico Commission for Community Volunteerism has been awarded grants totaling over $311,260 to support three volunteer programs and community activities in the state. 
   "Volunteering is such an important aspect of community involvement. These funds will allow programs that are essential in providing job training, child care and numerous other services. I sincerely hope these resources will fortify community volunteer work being done in our state," Domenici said.
   VSA Arts of New Mexico, in Albuquerque, will receive $186,453 and will be used to support collaborations between people with and without disabilities. VSA volunteers promote the positive potential of people with severe disabilities as they become engaged citizens in the community.
   SER (Service, Employment/Education and Redevelopment) de New Mexico Inc., in Albuquerque, will receive $88,177 to continue providing teen parents and at-risk youth with services that include employment readiness training; life skills training; and work experience & service learning.
   Jardin de los Ni?os will receive $36,630 to provide direct services such as child care, family strengthening services and job training to homeless families in Las Cruces.
   These funds were awarded by the Corporation for National and Community Service and distributed through AmeriCorps State Program.
   AmeriCorps members who volunteer in these programs are eligible to earn education awards to pay for college or to pay qualified student loans.
   In March, Domenici cosponsored a Senate resolution declaring April 21, 2006 National and Global Youth Service Day to encourage New Mexico youth to participate in community activities.
