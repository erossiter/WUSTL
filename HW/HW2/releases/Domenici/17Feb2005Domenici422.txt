SEN. DOMENICI INTRODUCES JORNADA RANGE TRANSFER ACT
  Sen. Pete Domenici today reintroduced a bill to permanently transfer up to 1,000 acres of federal land in Do?a Ana County to the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park, a nonprofit science education organization that teaches thousands of New Mexico youth every year about the unique Southwest desert ecology.  
   Domenici, chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources, the Jornada Experimental Range Transfer Act would permanently allot up to 1,000 acres of the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Agriculture Research Service (USDA-ARS) property north Las Cruces to the Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park. 
   In 1998, the Nature Park was granted a temporary easement to the federal property, which rests on the southern border of 193,000 block of land controlled by the USDA-ARS. However, that easement is set to expire. The Domenici bill would permanently set aside the property for the Nature Park. The transfer is supported by the USDA-ARS. 
   "The 1,000 acres of land allotted in this bill could easily be transferred to the Desert Nature Park without sparking any controversy. And the truth is that the Desert Nature Park needs a permanent location to continue educating students and adults about the unique ecology growing in our own backyard. This education forms a basis for understanding the character of our land and resources," Domenici said. 
   "A land transfer proposes no red flags so this bill is essentially a winning situation for New Mexico," he said. 
   The bill will be referred to the Senate Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee. 
   The Chihuahuan Desert Nature Park provides hands-on science education to as many as 11,000 K-12 students, 600 teachers and 2,000 other adults annually. It provides classroom presentations, field trips, schoolyard ecology projects and teacher workshops.
