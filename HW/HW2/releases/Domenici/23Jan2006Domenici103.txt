SEN. DOMENICI JOINS IN PENTAGON SALUTE OF CLOVIS' DOC STEWART
  Sen. Pete Domenici today joined Air Force brass at the Pentagon in a salute to Dr. Earnest O. "Doc" Stewart of Clovis, who has been presented the 2005 Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award.  
   Domenici, a member of the Senate Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, spoke at the award presentation for Stewart, who has been a community leader in Clovis for almost 40 years. He was selected for the Air Force award for his contributions and support for members of the Armed Forces and their families - particularly at Cannon Air Force Base. 
   "Doc has been the heart and soul of Cannon's community leadership since 1968. He has positively affected every major quality of life, infrastructure and training decision at Cannon since that time. His ability to understand and articulate Cannon's strategic position in the overall Air Force mission is critical to what makes Cannon so special," Domenici said. 
   The Fisher Distinguished Civilian Humanitarian Award is presented annually to an individual or organization that has demonstrated exceptional patriotism and humanitarian concern for members of the United States Armed Forces or their families. 
   "It is as if the criteria for the award - patriotism, generosity and selfless dedication to the men and women of the Armed Forces - were written just for Doc," Domenici said. 
   Stewart was accompanied by members of the Clovis Committee of 50. The award was presented General John Corley, Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force. 
   The award, which is also given by the Army and Navy, is named after Zachary and Elizabeth Fisher, who founded the Fisher House Foundation in 1990 to build "comfort homes" on the grounds of military and Veterans Affairs medical centers to house families of service members and veterans receiving treatment far from their homes.
