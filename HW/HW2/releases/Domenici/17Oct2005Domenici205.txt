SEN. DOMENICI TO ATTEND WHITE HOUSE SIGNING CEREMONY FOR BILL TO STRENGTHEN SOUTHWEST BORDER SECURITY
  Sen. Pete Domenici Tuesday will attend a White House signing ceremony for the FY2006 Homeland Security Appropriations Bill, which includes millions of dollars for border security-related activities in New Mexico.  
   President Bush is scheduled to sign the bill at 12:30 p.m. Mountain Tuesday. As a member of the Senate Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, Domenici worked directly on the $30.8 billion bill that, among other things, provides funding to hire and train 1,000 more Border Patrol agents. 
   "The first step toward immigration reform requires a more secure border, and this bill is probably the most significant in years toward meeting that challenge. There is a growing concern about our seemingly porous borders, and we must do more to contain them. This bill will aid New Mexico, and I am pleased the President invited me to be there when it becomes law." 
   The FY2006 Senate Homeland Security Appropriations provides unprecedented funding and significant increases for a variety of programs to ensure border protection. 
   Overall, the bill represents an $883 million increase over FY2005 for border security and immigration/customs enforcement. The bill funds over 40,700 positions dedicated to protecting our borders and enforcing immigration laws: 12,500 border patrol agents; 18,200 customs and border protection officers; over 6,000 criminal investigators for customs and immigration; 1,300 deportation officers; and nearly 2,700 immigration enforcement agents and detention officers. 
   The bill places heavy emphasis on securing the nation's borders with resources to support a total of 12,449 Border Patrol agents. The bill has $79.5 million to annualize the 500 agents funded in an emergency supplemental bill this spring, as well as $241 million to hire 1,000 additional Border Patrol agents.
