SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES USDA FUNDS FOR ANTHONY WATER PROJECT
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Development will award $225,000 to the Anthony Water and Sanitation District (AWSD) in Do?a Ana County in order to renovate its wastewater system.  
   AWSD will receive a grant of $42,000 and a loan of $183,000 to address additional costs associated with the redirection of effluent waste lines. In order to complete the proposed plan, which would direct waste through the Elephant Butte Irrigation District East Drain to O'Hara Road to be discharged in the Rio Grande, the town must construct a lift station. 
   "I support the construction of waste water treatment facilities that are commensurate with each community's needs," said Domenici. "Although some areas lack the appropriate resources to undertake these projects on their own, I am pleased that USDA can fill in the gaps. I hope residents in the Anthony area will benefit from this USDA award." 
   According to USDA, the loan will be awarded under a 40 year term at a rate of 4.125 percent. 
   The project received a loan of $341,000 and a grant of $29,093 in FY2005. 
   Domenici is a member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which plays a large role in determining funding for federal programs, including those administered by the USDA.
