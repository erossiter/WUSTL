SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES JUSTICE GRANTS FOR LOS LUNAS & VALENCIA
  U.S. Senator Pete Domenici announced today that law enforcement in Los Lunas and Valencia County will benefit from a $47,004 grant from the Department of Justice (DOJ).  
   Funds were awarded as part of the DOJ's FY2007 Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. The village of Los Lunas and Valencia County expect to utilize funds to improve current law enforcement technology, including laptops for squad cars that will enable officers to receive and transmit real-time information from the field. 
   "DOJ funds will equip law enforcement in Valencia County as they maintain safety for the area's residents. As Valencia County grows, its public safety personnel require equipment that will allow it to keep pace with its expanding population," said Domenici. 
   "I am encouraged to know that Valencia County officials will have more of the tools they need to carry out their work effectively and efficiently," he said. 
   The Edward Byrne JAG Program provides funds to states, tribes, and local governments to support a broad range of activities to prevent and control crime in their communities. Grant funds can be used for various purposes, including direct law enforcement programs, prosecution and court programs, prevention and education programs, and drug treatment programs.

   Domenici is a long time member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, including the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee which plays a large role in determining funding for programs within the Department of Justice.
