SEN. DOMENICI ANNOUNCES ENRICHMENT FUNDS FOR SANTA CLARA, JEMEZ, ZUNI LIBRARIES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today confirmed that a total of $392,947 in federal funds have been awarded by the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) to support local libraries in Santa Clara, Jemez, and Zuni pueblos.  
   The funds were awarded through the IMLS Native American Library Services program to enhance current library services or initiate new programs in the three tribal communities. 
   "Libraries enrich our communities and open doors with low-cost ways to bring resources to many. With the proper funds, our libraries can accomplish even more by partnering with local schools to start literacy programs that can benefit adults and youth," Domenici said. "I am pleased these pueblo communities will be able to expand their current library systems and offer more services to residents." 
   The Pueblo of Santa Clara was awarded $150,000 to expand its current library services. The funds will be used to increase technological capabilities, enhance literacy programs for the student and elderly populations, and support tutorial and reading incentive programs. 
   Jemez Pueblo was awarded $146,626 to support the Jemez Library Consortium, which enables libraries and schools to share resources and coordinate literacy programs, a family literacy program, after-school tutoring, reading clubs, and a summer reading program. Finally, the funds will be used to ensure all community members have access to information that will help preserve the Jemez language and culture. 
   Zuni Pueblo also received an award for $96,321 to hire a bookmobile operator, which provides services to rural areas, and a children's program coordinator. The funds will also be used to bolster and expand the library's collection.
