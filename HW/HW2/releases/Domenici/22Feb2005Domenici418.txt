SEN. DOMENICI ISSUES STATEMENT ON LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL LABORATORY REQUEST FOR PROPOSAL CHANGES
  Sen. Pete Domenici today issued the following statement regarding changes in the request for proposal issued by the National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) regarding the contract competition for Los Alamos National Laboratory:  
   "I am currently taking time to fully review the changes made by the NNSA Selection Evaluation Board concerning the Los Alamos contract process. Right off the bat, one significant change that raises a red flag is the call for a stand-alone benefits plan at Los Alamos. That needs to be fully reviewed. 
   "I have discussed my thoughts and concerns with a number of administration and laboratory officials about the RFP. I know they are all intent on fostering a competitive process that, in the end, will best serve the future of LANL and its employees. I will continue to actively participate in this process and fully intend to address the ongoing contract process while I'm in Los Alamos this week." 
   Domenici on Wednesday will address the "Reducing Nuclear Threats: Nonproliferation Today and Tomorrow" workshop hosted by Los Alamos National Laboratory and the Los Alamos Committee on Arms Control and International Security. (12:30 p.m. at LANL. Contact the LANL press office at 505-667-7000 for more information and security clearance requirements.) 
   Domenici is also slated to be in Los Alamos on Friday to accompany DOE Secretary Samuel Bodman during his visit there. (Details pending.)
