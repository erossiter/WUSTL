   REVIEW: 
   00:48 Domenici discusses the outlook for Congress reaching an agreement on FY2008 funding for the National Nuclear Security Administration and its nuclear weapons complex. Domenici says the budget outlook "is very grim" as a result of the House-passed appropriations bill. 
   03:06 Domenici says he believes Los Alamos National Laboratory will outline "a fair" severance package for lab employees who voluntarily choose to leave the lab. He says the separation package is necessitated due to budget uncertainties. 
   04:52 Domenici discusses the difficulties in trying to reach a FY2008 funding agreement for the labs once the current continuing resolution expires Dec. 14. He says the Democratic leadership in Congress has directed appropriators to try to reach agreements on outstanding bills to fund the government through an omnibus measure. He says the leadership has also cut subcommittee allocations by 50 percent, which will force appropriators to make difficult decisions. 
   07:29 Domenici says he wants to learn more about a Fish and Wildlife Service proposal to reintroduce the Mexican grey wolf into areas of southern and southeast New Mexico. He questions whether expanding the reintroduction area is a good idea, and expresses his belief that the wolf program does not warrant the resources put into it. 
   11:20 Domenici says he hopes President Bush will sign a bill approved by Congress to improve the Head Start program. He states his support for the early childhood education program. 
   14:02 Domenici expresses his Thanksgiving day wish for New Mexicans--that they make contact with family and friends whether they are near or far. He talks about his holiday plans with his family. He also asks New Mexicans to remember those away from their families as they serve their country in Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas around the world. 
   16:27 Domenici thanks New Mexicans for their outpouring of support and good wishes since he announced he would not seek reelection in 2008.
