SAN ILDEFONSO SETTLEMENT BILL PASSES SENATE
  Sens. Pete Domenici and Jeff Bingaman today announced that their legislation to implement the San Ildefonso settlement, which was reached last summer between the San Ildefonso Pueblo and the Forest Service, has passed the U.S. Senate. 
   The Pueblo de San Ildefonso Claims Settlement Act (S.1773) passed the Senate by unanimous consent late Wednesday. The bill would formally settle San Ildefonso Pueblo's claim to 7,700 acres of ancestral land, which dates back to 1951. Santa Clara Pueblo and Los Alamos County are also impacted by the settlement. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives.
   "After a very long wait, the Senate has passed legislation that will settle the Pueblo de San Ildefonso claims. The Department of Justice and Forest Service worked hard to reach a compromise with the Pueblo to make legislation possible. I hope the House acts quickly so we can implement this settlement and begin work in Los Alamos county," said Domenici.
   "I am pleased the Senate has approved this legislation, which is long overdue and I hope the House of Representatives acts quickly to pass it," Bingaman said. "I also urge the Forest Service to begin the necessary pre-implementation work as soon as possible so they may finally conclude this settlement process."
   The agreement is the final settlement of the 1946 Indian Claims Commission Act, which involved more than 600 claims by tribes.
   The agreement will give the pueblo a payment, as well as an opportunity to gain other property from the Santa Fe National Forest. Santa Clara Pueblo has also negotiated the right to acquire certain properties.
   The pact is designed to guarantee Los Alamos County access to water wells and infrastructure, and allow the county to purchase property for future economic development. Also included will be right-of-way passage during emergency situations.
