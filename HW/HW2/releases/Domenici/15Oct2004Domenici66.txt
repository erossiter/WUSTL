SEN. DOMENICI THRILLED WITH NEW AIR SERVICE LINKING ALAMOGORDO, ALBUQUERQUE
  Sen. Pete Domenici today extolled news that the Department of Transportation (DOT) has selected Westward Airways, Inc. to provide new air service for the Alamogordo and Holloman communities. 
   Westward Airways was the winner of the contract that will establish a commercial link between Alamogordo and Albuquerque until 2006 at an annual subsidy rate of $518,870.
   "This new contract will be a great link between Albuquerque and the growing Alamogordo area that will encourage travel throughout the state, expand business opportunities and increase communication," Domenici said. "This is great news for Alamogordo, and I'm excited to see the progress and benefits New Mexicans, especially our military, will see as a result of this air service."
   Flights on Westward Airways will be operated seven days a week using a nine passenger-seat Pilatus PC-12 aircraft, Domenici noted.
   "The whole Alamogordo community including Holloman Air Force Base put their strong support behind this project and I'm pleased to see that it was a successful effort. This new air service will strengthen the commercial ties between the two cities and will be more convenient for residents in both areas," said Domenici.
