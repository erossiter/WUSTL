SEN. DOMENICI SAYS NATIONAL NUCLEAR SECURITY ADMINISTRATION BUDGET FOCUS ON FACILITIES, NOT SCIENCE HITS N.M. DOE LAB BUDGETS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today criticized the overall Department of Energy weapons budget for focusing too much on facilities rather than on the science carried out at existing national laboratory facilities. 
   Domenici highlighted proposed cuts in weapons funding at the DOE national laboratories--including Los Alamos and Sandia national laboratories in New Mexico--during a subcommittee hearing Wednesday to review the FY2008 National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) budget plan.  
   "I am concerned about cuts to the science, engineering and experimental activities that support the science-based stockpile stewardship. This work has been cut by more than $113 million in this request. I believe the focus on transformation is putting too much emphasis on facilities and not enough on science," Domenici said. 
   "The facts speak for themselves. All three weapons labs received a net reduction in funding for stockpile stewardship work, computing, and operations. Meanwhile, funding for manufacturing plants is increased despite the fact there is $60 million in unobligated balances at these plants," he said. "I think the NNSA has embarked on an unsustainable strategy." 
   Domenici challenged NNSA officials to work with congressional appropriators on addressing the science vs. facility imbalance as the FY2008 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill is developed. In particular, he cited the NNSA decision to proceed more quickly with its Complex 2030 program, a decision that has been criticized by the General Accountability Office. 
   "Complex 2030 is worth pursing, but it must be done smartly. It has already been criticized as moving too aggressively without knowing what the ultimate military need will be in the future. The strong emphasis on facilities and infrastructure now and into the foreseeable future is reducing our needed investments in science, engineering and experimental support facilities at the weapons laboratories," Domenici said. "I believe we need to rethink the pace of Complex 2030 and also look where we can also makeup funding." 
   Domenici suggested that NNSA budgets could be helped by reducing American subsidies and requiring Russia to pay more for its involvement in the Cooperative Threat Reduction Initiative (CTR), a nonproliferation program. 
   "I believe we need to give very close scrutiny to the level of assistance we are providing Russia. When we initiated many of the projects under the CTR, Russia did not have the financial means to protect and secure nuclear material within its country," Domenici said. "Now that picture has changed and Russia enjoys a budget surplus as they have profited immensely from the high price of crude oil and natural gas. I no longer support providing massive subsidies to Russia's military establishment and believe they should now be expected to pay for their full share of the nonproliferation obligations." 
   Overall, the administration has recommended $9.38 billion for the NNSA in FY2008, roughly 3 percent over FY2007 funding levels. Under this plan, overall weapons funding is down at LANL (-6 percent), Sandia (-8 percent), and Lawrence Livermore (-8 percent). 
   For New Mexico in FY2008, DOE proposes to spend $4.08 billion for activities including the operation of LANL, Sandia and the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, which is $122 million below the FY2007 requested level. 
   NNSA funding for New Mexico laboratories would fall $192 million from $3.5 billion to $3.3 billion under this plan. 
   Los Alamos National Laboratory: $1.83 billion proposed in FY2008, a decrease of $24 million below FY2007. * Weapons Activities - $1.38 billion, down $97 million 
   * Nonproliferation - $169 million, down $4 million from FY2007 * Plutonium pit production/certification - $209 million, up $15 million 
   * Advance Simulation and Computing - $166 million, down $61 million 
   * Chemistry and Metallurgy Research Building - $95 million, down $65 million 
   * Environmental cleanup - $140 million, the same as FY2007 * Radioactive Liquid Waste Treatment Facility - $26 million to initiate engineering, design and construction work 
   Sandia National Laboratories: $1.27 billion proposed, a decrease of $119 million below the FY 2007 requested level. * Microsystems and Engineering Sciences Applications (MESA) Complex - $11 million to complete construction 
   * Z Machine & Inertial Confinement Fusion Program - $17.6 million, down $30 million. (NNSA has made cuts to other stewardship activities in the ICF budget, but provided an increase for NIF construction. Z is also undergoing refurbishment for half of the year.) 
   * Advanced Simulation and Computing - $111 million, down $42 million 
   * Center for Integrated Nanotechnology - $20 million to support operation of this joint Sandia-LANL venture at Kirtland AFB.
