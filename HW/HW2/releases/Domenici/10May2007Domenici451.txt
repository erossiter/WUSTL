SEN. DOMENICI: SANTA FE BUS SERVICE COMPANY GETS HOMELAND SECURITY FUNDING
  Sen. Pete Domenici announced today that the Department of Homeland Security intends to award $123,427 to Santa Fe's Industrial Bus Lines, which offers park and ride services in northern New Mexico. 
   The award will be made as part of the FY2007 Intercity Bus Security Program (IBSGP), which is administered under the FY2007 Infrastructure Protection Program.
   "In the time we live in, we must take steps to safeguard our safety at the local level because that is where our homeland security begins," said Domenici. "It is good to see DHS distributing funds, not only to large cities, but also to those that are smaller and just as relevant in our quest for national security. I believe the Homeland Security Department should look at other New Mexico communities with transit services that could also benefit from such funding."
   Industrial Bus Lines' services include Park and Ride, charter buses, and tours. Its Park and Ride service operates over 80 daily departures between northern New Mexico destinations including Albuquerque, Santa Fe, Los Alamos, and Las Vegas. Services are offered in conjunction with the New Mexico State High and Transportation Department at a rate that is greatly discounted from the costs associated with operating one's own vehicle independently.
   The Intercity Bus Security Program provides funds to enhance the security of intercity systems that service urban areas. It is one of five programs contained within the FY2007 Infrastructure Protection Program which was funded at $459 million through DHS. 
   Domenici is a senior member of the Senate Appropriations Committee, which helps determine funding priorities within the federal budget. He is also a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee.
