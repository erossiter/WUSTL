SEN. DOMENICI COSPONSORS MEASURE TO OPEN MILITARY ORDER OF PURPLE HEARTS TO SPOUSES OF FEMALE VETERANS
  Sen. Pete Domenici today lent his support to wounded veterans through cosponsorship of legislation to expand membership in the Military Order of Purple Hearts (MOPH) to include male spouses of female Purple Heart recipients.  
   Domenici joined Senator David Vitter (R-La.) to cosponsor the measure that will amend the organization's congressional charter to admit male spouses of female Purple Heart recipients for membership within the group. Under its current charter, the organization admits female spouses for membership, but does not provide for male spouses of female recipients. 
   "Over the years, females have come to play an integral role in the success of our military. The original charter of MOPH has not kept up with the times. It was not created to accommodate the current number of female Purple Heart recipients and their spouses," Domenici said. "I am pleased to throw my support behind this legislation and look forward to seeing more people benefit from membership in this important organization." 
   The Purple Heart is awarded to military veterans wounded in combat. Over 900 females have received the Purple Heart as a result of the military conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. 
   MOPH was chartered by Congress in 1958 to provide support to recipients and families of the Purple Heart medal. It acts as a vehicle for legislative advocacy and solidarity for fellow wounded combat veterans. 
   Domenici has consistently advocated on behalf of veterans and their needs. His efforts last year resulted in a Purple Heart medal award to World War II veteran William L. Rice of Williamsburg, New Mexico.
